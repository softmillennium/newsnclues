Thailand launched airstrikes against Cambodia as a new wave of fighting erupted between the neighboring countries, leaving a peace plan presided over by President Donald Trump in danger of collapse. Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow told CNN that military action against Cambodia would continue “until we feel that sovereignty and territorial integrity are not challenged.”

Socca is a fast-paced variant of football played six-a-side on a smaller pitch, blending elements of futsal and street football.

The triumph marks a historic milestone for the Polish national team.

The final pitted two unbeaten sides against each other.

Mexico had topped their group with maximum points and a +10 goal difference, before eliminating Greece, Bulgaria, and Kazakhstan in the knockout stages.

This victory finally secures Poland's place among the socca world champions. In previous tournaments, Poland had twice reached the final - losing 0-1 to Germany in 2018 and 2-3 to Russia in 2019 - before taking bronze in 2022.

🏆 CANCUN DZIŚ NIE ZAŚNIE. POLSKA PIERWSZY RAZ W HISTORII ZDOBYWA MISTRZOSTWO ŚWIATA SOCCA! 🇵🇱

France does not want to seize frozen Russian state assets held in private French  banks, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing sources.

While officials in Paris support the European Commission's plan for a “reparations loan” for Ukraine they also oppose any scheme that would draw on Russian money held at commercial banks, arguing those lenders are bound by different contractual obligations than Euroclear, the outlet said.

Last week, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen set out two options to provide Kiev with €90 billion ($105 billion) over the next two years: EU-level borrowing backed by the bloc's budget, or a long-debated “reparations loan” backed by profits from the blocked assets that would require institutions holding Russian cash to transfer it into a new loan vehicle. 

For more than two years, France has declined to name the private banks holding about €18 billion, according to European parliament research, in Russian assets, citing client confidentiality – a stance that has angered some other EU governments, the newspaper said.

Paris has also withheld details on how any interest accrued on the funds is being used.

The Russian assets in France represent the second-largest tranche in the bloc, behind €185 billion held at privately-owned Belgian firm, Euroclear.

The controversial EU-backed 'loan' scheme has been criticized by several EU members. Belgium has warned that an outright confiscation would pose legal and security risks. Other major holders of Russian assets, including Luxembourg and Germany, also oppose a seizure, along with Italy, Hungary and Slovakia.

Recent media reports have said the US is lobbying several EU members to block plans to use frozen assets as collateral for the €140 billion loan to Ukraine, arguing the funds should be kept as leverage in peace talks with Kiev and Moscow. Politico earlier reported that Washington wants the EU to return the money once Russia signs a peace agreement with Ukraine.

Russia has condemned any use of its sovereign assets as theft and warned of legal action and retaliation.

China's trade surplus has for the first time exceeded the $1 trillion mark – a level unmatched by any other nation in the world, the country's General Administration of Customs has announced.

Statistics for the first 11 months of 2025 released by the agency on Monday indicate that the Asian economic powerhouse was running a trade surplus totaling $1.08 trillion as of November, despite external headwinds.

Over the period, total exports reached 24.46 trillion yuan ($3.46 trillion), up 6.2% year-on-year, while imports grew 0.2% to 16.75 trillion yuan ($2.37 trillion), the agency estimated.

According to the data, last month alone, China recorded a $111.68 billion trade surplus – its third-largest ever in a single month.

Manufactured goods comprise a considerable part of the upward trend, China's customs agency reported. Chinese exports, including vehicles, have saturated markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America, putting pressure on traditional rivals such as Germany, Japan, and South Korea.

China's exports to the European Union are understood to be more than twice as high as imports from the bloc in 2025. Accounting for 13% of the country's total foreign trade, the EU has emerged as China's second largest trading partner, with ASEAN nations topping the list.

Against a backdrop of a trade war with Washington, China's exports to the US have, by contrast, shrunk by nearly a fifth, according to the General Administration of Customs. The US, however, was ranked as China's third-largest trading partner at 3.69 trillion yuan January through November.

Officials track public sentiment, noting negative impact of ‘videos with sounds of children crying' as parents arrested

State and federal authorities are closely tracking online criticism and protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in New Orleans, monitoring message boards around the clock for threats to agents while compiling regular updates on public “sentiment” surrounding the arrests, according to law enforcement records reviewed by the Associated Press.

The intelligence gathering comes even as officials have released few details about the first arrests made last week as part of “Catahoula Crunch”, prompting calls for greater transparency from local officials who say they have been kept in the dark about virtually every aspect of the operation.

“Online opinions still remain mixed, with some supporting the operations while others are against them,” said a briefing circulated early on Sunday to law enforcement officials. Earlier bulletins noted “a combination of groups urging the public to record ICE and Border Patrol” as well as “additional locations where agents can find immigrants”.

Immigration authorities have insisted the sweeps are targeted at “criminal illegal aliens”. But the law enforcement records detail criminal histories for less than a third of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the operation.

Local leaders told the AP those numbers – which law enforcement officials were admonished not to distribute to the media – undermined the stated aim of the roundup. They also expressed concern that the online surveillance could chill free speech as authorities threaten to charge anyone interfering with immigration enforcement.

“It confirms what we already knew – this was not about public safety, it's about stoking chaos and fear and terrorizing communities,” said the Louisiana state senator Royce Duplessis, a Democrat who represents New Orleans. “It's furthering a sick narrative of stereotypes that immigrants are violent.”

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to questions about the intelligence gathering and referred the AP to a prior news release touting “dozens of arrests”. The agency has not released an accounting of the detainees taken into custody or their criminal histories.

The DHS has publicly detailed only six arrests stemming from the operation – all people with criminal histories – including a man they vaguely said was convicted of “homicide” and another convicted of sexual assault. The agency, which has several hundred agents on the ground in south-east Louisiana, has said it aims to make at least 5,000 arrests in the region over an operation expected to last up to two months.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens harming them, their families or their neighbors,” the DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said.

DHS and Republican leaders have framed the crackdown as targeting the most violent offenders. But the records reviewed by the AP identify only nine of the 38 people arrested in the first days as having criminal histories that rose beyond traffic violations – information the intelligence bulletins warn “should not be distributed to the media”.

The New Orleans city council president, JP Morrell, said the stated goals of the operation to arrest violent offenders did not align with the reality of what is taking place.

“There's literally no information being given to the city of New Orleans whatsoever,” Morrell said. “If the goal was for them to come here and augment existing law enforcement, to pursue violent criminals or people with extensive criminal histories, why wouldn't you be more transparent about who you've arrested and why?”

Morrell and other officials have said the crackdown appears to be a dragnet focused on people with brown skin, citing viral videos of encounters such as masked agents chasing a 22-year-old US citizen returning home from the grocery store.

Law enforcement officials have been carefully tracking such footage and public reaction. “For some supporters, the videos with sounds of children crying in the background as their parents are placed under arrest, is weighing heavy on their hearts,” one briefing stated.

The records also shed new light on cooperation among state and federal authorities in an operation welcomed by Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry. Both the FBI and Customs and Border Protection (CPB) have stationed agents at the Louisiana State Analytical and Fusion Exchange, an intelligence and data sharing center that is closely following discussions on the online forum Reddit that local residents have used to exchange information about the immigration raids.

One briefing noted that some “have gone so far as to accuse agents of racially profiling Hispanic areas specifically”. Another flagged social media posts suggesting agents “are not keeping with the mission of targeting criminal immigrants only”. And a third pointed out that critics of the raids “bring up past hurricanes and the work done by immigrants” in their aftermath.

“The chatter is slower during the night, mainly just commenting on posts from earlier in the day,” one of the briefings states. “Once daylight arrives and agencies are back out, the chatter and new posts will pick back up.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US president's efforts under harsh spotlight as Rwanda-DRC deal and Thailand-Cambodia mediations waver

For the sake of anyone confused by Donald Trump's apparently supernatural abilities as a global peacemaker – for which he was given the inaugural (and perhaps only) Fifa “peace prize” – current events have intervened to offer some clarification.

Trump has claimed a number of dubious diplomatic successes on the international peace front, among them a freshly signed deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mediating in Thailand and Cambodia's deadly border dispute, and the Gaza “ceasefire”.

In the space of a few hours on Monday, however, those claims were thrown under a harsh spotlight even as Trump and his officials continued to try to pressure Ukraine into rewarding Russia for an illegal international aggression by surrendering its sovereign territory.

On Monday, fighting broke out once again between Thai and Cambodian forces, the heaviest since a ceasefire in the summer. In the Great Lakes region too, a deal freshly inked in Washington between Rwanda and the DRC was also struggling, with the Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, telling lawmakers in a speech that Rwanda was already violating its commitments under a peace deal mediated by Washington. In Gaza, meanwhile, conditions remain as desperate as ever for Palestinians among almost daily attacks.

Even if one is tempted to credit Trump's self-professed efforts as a peacemaker (as part of which he has renamed the United States Institute of Peace after himself) foreign policy experts categorise peace in two competing ways first conceptualised by the late Johan Galtung, the Norwegian sociologist and prime mover behind the emergence of the discipline of peace and conflict studies.

Galtung and others see two kinds of peace. The first is what is known as negative peace: in the absence of direct violence, the underlying tensions and unresolved issues still exist, making the peace fragile and prone to episodic outbreaks of conflict.

A classic example of a negative peace is the long-running tension between India and Pakistan, which has resulted in episodic fighting (and is, needless to say, one of the crises Trump claims to have solved.)

Positive peace, as envisaged by Galtung, is far more taxing on participants and mediators, and addresses underlying issues, structural violence, and inequalities affecting the populations in conflict.

The reality, as critics have pointed out since Trump was given his medal and trophy by the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, is that most of what Trump and his team are involved in is not even properly categorisable as working towards even a negative peace.

The business that Trump and his envoys are in is dealmaking, a fundamentally transactional affair and very different from the hard slog of mediated peace processes.

As Arthur Boutellis wrote in an essay for the Global Observatory of the International Peace Institute in October: “Dealmakers bring valuable skills to peace mediation, including pragmatism, persistence and a results-oriented mindset.

“Yet there is a fundamental difference between dealmaking and peacemaking. In the business world, dealmaking focuses on bargaining between positions. It is inherently transactional, zero-sum and contractual: one party transfers ownership to another in exchange for payment.

“Peacemaking, by contrast, seeks to shift parties from bargaining over fixed positions to addressing their underlying interests and needs in pursuit of durable ‘win-win' outcomes. It aims to build trust, transform relationships and address the structural and historical injustices that gave rise to conflict.”

When it comes to peace efforts, Trump's instincts are more performative than interested in hard graft. The handshake and the signing matter more than an inclusive process and a durable and fair peace, perhaps not surprising given his own record in business, where winning is seen as everything.

Most dangerous of all is that this lack of commitment is transparently obvious to all involved, turning negotiations into long-winded exercises in bad faith, where the game is to be able to trade recriminations over failure, and a mediator (in the shape of Trump) who is often the most unreliable and bad faith actor.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President says farmers are ‘the backbone of our country' and says China has committed to buying $40bn in American soybeans

At his roundtable in the White House' cabinet room, Donald Trump announced $12bn in assistance for American farmers. “We love our farmers,” the president said. “They're the backbone of our country.”

Trump also noted that China had committed to buying $40bn in American soybeans. “I asked president Xi if he could even up it, and I think he'll do that,” the president added.

The president repeatedly derided ABC News' Rachel Scott today. After she asked Donald Trump whether he would order defense secretary Pete Hegseth to release the video of a “double-tap” strike on a suspected drug vessel from 2 September, the president said that “whatever [Hegseth] decides is OK with me”.

When Scott followed up on Trump's explanation about the alleged drug-trafficking boats, the president snapped back. “Let me just tell you, you are an obnoxious, a terrible, actually, a terrible reporter, and it's always the same thing with you,” he said.

Donald Trump continued to blame the Biden administration for inheriting high prices when he returned to office in January.

“I think the prices are going to be going down already. I mean, the prices are way down,” he said at the White House today. “Now inflation is essentially gone. We have it normalized, and it'll go down even a little bit further. You don't want it to be deflation either. You have to be careful.”

The president and Brooke Rollins, just went back and forth as she explained that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be dispensing $11bn to Farmer Bridge Assistance program, and “holding back” $1bn for some “speciality crops”.

Donald Trump went on to say that “this money would not be possible without tariffs”. However, the assistance program is not using tariff revenue, but funding from USDA.

At his roundtable in the White House' cabinet room, Donald Trump announced $12bn in assistance for American farmers. “We love our farmers,” the president said. “They're the backbone of our country.”

Trump also noted that China had committed to buying $40bn in American soybeans. “I asked president Xi if he could even up it, and I think he'll do that,” the president added.

Donald Trump's former lawyer, Alina Habba, has stepped down from her position as the acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey.

Her announcement comes after an appeals court ruled last week that Habba has been serving unlawfully as the top federal prosecutor in the Garden state. The panel of judges sided with a lower court's decision earlier this year.

“This decision will not weaken the justice department and it will not weaken me,” Habba wrote in a statement. “My fight will now stretch across the country. As we wait for further review of the court's ruling.”

She added that she would continue to serve as the senior adviser to the attorney general, Pam Bondi.

“Make no mistake, you can take the girl out of New Jersey, but you cannot take New Jersey out of the girl,” Habba concluded.

In a short while we'll hear from Donald Trump at the White House. He's set to appear at a roundtable alongside the treasury secretary and agriculture secretary to unveil a new $12bn support package for American farmers. We'll bring you the key lines here.

After more than two hours of oral arguments in the high-stakes case of Slaughter v Trump, the nation's highest court appeared poised to back a historic expansion of executive power, signaling support for Donald Trump's firing of independent board members that for almost a century have been protected from presidential whims.

At the heart of the issue is Trump's March decision to fire Rebecca Slaughter from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) before the end of her term, despite a federal law designed to insulate the agency from political interference.

John Yoo, who served as a justice department lawyer under George W Bush, told Reuters the case presents “one of the most important questions over the last century on the workings of the federal government”. “The future of the independence of the administrative state is at issue,” he said.

The justices appeared pretty firmly split down partisan lines, with the 6-3 conservative wing – including the sometimes swing vote of Justice Amy Coney Barrett – seeming to side with the Trump administration's argument that the president should be able to fire members of independent agencies, and expressing scepticism to concerns raised by the other side that this could lead to a significant remaking of the federal government.

Solicitor general John D Sauer repeatedly argued that independent agencies like the FTC are a “headless fourth branch” with limited government oversight and that, in general, “independent agencies are not accountable to the people”. He argued that the key 90-year precedent, Humphrey's Executor, “must be overruled”, describing the ruling as a “decaying husk with bold, and particularly dangerous pretensions”.

Regarding the 1935 precedent ruling, chief justice John Roberts said, that historic precedent has “nothing to do with what the FTC looks like today”. That decision, he said, “was addressing an agency that had very little, if any executive power”. Justice Samuel Alito also said he was skeptical of wide-ranging ramifications of allowing the president to fire leaders of multi-member independent commissions. Justices Bret Kavanaugh, Roberts and Coney Barrett also aimed to draw distinctions between the FTC and the Federal Reserve, seeming likely to back continuing to shield the Fed from political interference.

The liberal justices, on the other hand, appeared sympathetic to Slaughter's lawyer's warning that “there are real-world risks that are palpable” in allowing a president the power to fire leaders of independent agencies. Doing so meant that “everything is on the chopping block”, Amit Agarwal said.

Sounding the alarm, liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor said that independent agencies had existed throughout US history. “You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that a government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,” she said. Justice Elena Kagan warned that the court should not ignore “the real-world realities” of what its decisions do. “The result of what you want is that the president is going to have massive, unchecked, uncontrolled power,” she told Sauer. “What you are left with is a president … with control over everything.”

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also expressed doubt that more presidential firing power is better for democracy and emphasized that centering so much power under presidential control would undermine issues that Congress decided should be handled by non-partisan experts in independent agencies. “Having a president come in and fire all the scientists, and the doctors, and the economists and the PhDs, and replacing them with loyalists and people who don't know anything is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States,” she said.

A decision in the case is expected before the end of June next year.

Liberal justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also expressed doubt that more presidential firing power is better for democracy.

“You seem to think that there's something about the president that requires him to control everything as a matter of democratic accountability, when, on the other side, we have Congress saying we'd like these particular agencies and officers to be independent of presidential control for the good of the people,” she told Sauer.

Jackson also emphasized that centering so much power under presidential control would undermine issues that Congress decided should be handled by non-partisan experts in independent agencies.

So having a president come in and fire all the scientists, and the doctors, and the economists and the PhDs, and replacing them with loyalists and people who don't know anything is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States.

And to expand on liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor's comments that we reported earlier, she said independent agencies have existed throughout US history, and challenged Sauer to explain why the court should make such a drastic change to the structure of government.

Neither the king, nor parliament nor prime ministers in England at the time of the founding [of the United States] ever had an unqualified removal power.

You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that a government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.

Earlier, liberal justice Elena Kagan said the court should not ignore “the real-world realities” of what its decisions do. She told Sauer:

The result of what you want is that the president is going to have massive, unchecked, uncontrolled power – not only to do traditional execution, but to make law through legislative and adjudicative frameworks.

What you are left with is a president ... with control over everything, including over much of the lawmaking that happens in this country.

Sauer countered that the impact would be the president “having control over the executive branch, which he must and does have under our constitution”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

An alliance of 32 healthcare facilities and medical research institutes was yesterday founded to bolster the nation's clinical trial capabilities.

Taiwan's medical techniques are among the best in the world, but its clinical trials lag behind in scale, the Taiwan Alliance of Clinical Trial Centers said.

A “clinical national team” has been set up to improve efficiency and cooperation, the alliance said.

Cofounded by Taipei Medical University (TMU) and three affiliated hospitals — TMU Hospital, Shuang Ho Hospital and Wanfang Hospital — and Taichung Veterans General Hospital, the alliance aims to turn Taiwan into the Asia-Pacific region's clinical trial hub, it said.

Taiwan conducts about 300 to 400 clinical trials a year, which is significantly lower than in South Korea or Australia, which hold more than 1,000 clinical trials per year, alliance preparation convener TMU president Wu Mai-szu (吳麥斯) said. 

Clinical trials must be conducted under strict ethics and regulations to ensure the safety and efficacy of medical innovation, he said.

Whether high-quality clinical trials can be conducted across several facilities is an important indicator of a country's medical quality and regulatory maturity, he added.

The alliance is to prioritize six major tasks, including setting a standard Institutional Review Board (IRB) document and strengthening the collaborative-IRB mechanism, creating a clinical trial contract template, and building a database of research project managers and attending physicians.

They also include establishing a national clinical trial participant enrollment platform, cooperating in cultivating clinical trial experts, and promoting an Asia-Pacific strategic alliance and international multicenter collaborations, he said.

“This is an important milestone,” Minister of Health and Welfare Shih Chung-liang (石崇良) said at the launch in Taipei.

The development of new drugs has accelerated in the past few years, and more treatments are being developed through molecular approaches and genomic research, which might induce different responses depending on ethnicity or region, making local trials important, he said.

Countries are pursuing local clinical trials to facilitate public access to drugs after they hit the market, he said.

As large pharmaceutical companies prefer to hold clinical trials in locations that have faster patient recruitment rates, the alliance can serve as a single point of contact and apply universal standards and procedures across hospitals, increasing enrollment efficiency and attracting more global pharmaceutical companies to conduct their clinical trials in Taiwan, the minister said.

“The alliance is not only beneficial for international cooperation, it can also help improve Taiwan's development of new drugs, generic drugs or biosimilars drugs, by increasing the speed of [clinical trial] patient enrollment,” he said. “I think it is a triple-win strategy that would benefit the industry, patients and local academic research.”


PROCEDURE:

The 10 people arrived via a ferry operating between Xiamen and Kinmen, also known as the “small three links.”
The Kinmen County Prosecutors' Office yesterday said that four of the 10 extradited people were convicted in Taiwan for committing fraud and contravening the Money Laundering Control Act (洗錢防制法), and were on the wanted list.
They were immediately arrested upon arrival and sent to Kinmen Prison to serve their sentences following brief questioning, the office said.

President William Lai (賴清德) and a visiting US Department of State official yesterday marked the 85th anniversary of a US government-funded professional exchange program, highlighting its role in strengthening Taiwan-US ties through people-to-people engagement.

In a pre-recorded message played at a ceremony in Taipei for the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), Lai said that he was an IVLP alumnus, having joined the program in 2004 when he was a lawmaker.

Thanks to the program, he was able to travel to the US, where he witnessed firsthand the vitality and resilience of the US democratic system, Lai said.

Over the past eight-and-a-half decades, the program has helped cultivate countless Taiwanese leaders across all sectors and has become an important platform for international exchange, he said, adding that these alumni continue to play a key role in strengthening Taiwan-US relations.

Ragini Gupta, director of Press and Public Diplomacy at the state department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, described the IVLP as the department's “most significant exchange program.”

“Taiwan is a vital part of IVLP's global story,” she said. “Leaders from Taiwan return energized to deepen US-Taiwan cooperation in health, education, technology and democratic governance. In turn, Americans gain a richer understanding of Taiwan's dynamism.

“These people-to-people ties make our policy cooperation stronger and our shared future brighter,” she said.

American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Director Raymond Greene announced at the event that the AIT would launch a series of events across Taiwan through July 4 next year to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence.

The IVLP “builds long-term relationships between Americans and international leaders in government, business, academia and other fields through short-term professional exchanges that strengthen American communities,” the state department said.

Since its launch in 1940, more than 230,000 participants have taken part in the program, including more than 500 future heads of state or government, 12 Nobel laureates, more than 1,600 Cabinet ministers and more than 1,000 members of parliament, the program introduction said.

The 10 people arrived via a ferry operating between Xiamen and Kinmen, also known as the “small three links.”
The Kinmen County Prosecutors' Office yesterday said that four of the 10 extradited people were convicted in Taiwan for committing fraud and contravening the Money Laundering Control Act (洗錢防制法), and were on the wanted list.
They were immediately arrested upon arrival and sent to Kinmen Prison to serve their sentences following brief questioning, the office said.

The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) caucus today decided to suspend controversial legislation that would give elected officials full control over their stipends, saying it would wait for a consensus to be reached before acting.

KMT Legislator Chen Yu-jen (陳玉珍) last week proposed amendments to the Organic Act of the Legislative Yuan (立法院組織法) and Regulations on Allowances for Elected Representatives and Subsidies for Chiefs of Village (地方民意代表費用支給及村里長事務補助費補助條例) that would give legislators and local councilors the freedom to use their allowances without providing invoices for reimbursement.

The proposal immediately drew criticism, as there have been several recent instances of lawmakers receiving judicial scrutiny for allegedly embezzling fees intended to pay assistants in contravention of the Anti-Corruption Act (貪污治罪條例).

However, the bill states that how legislators use their allowance falls outside the scope of the act.

On Friday last week, the Legislative Yuan passed the bills on to the International Administration Committee and Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee respectively for deliberation.

Chen's proposed amendment says that each legislator may directly employ a certain number of assistants, who would leave or remain in office together with them.

Expenses such as health checkups, recreational activities and other costs that employers are required to cover under the Labor Standards Act (勞動基準法) would be subsidized through a budget allocated by the Legislative Yuan, the bill says.

The subsidies would be dispersed to legislators and would not require receipts for reimbursement, it adds.

The Democratic Progressive Party said the matter should be handled through open, democratic discussion rather than rushed procedures such as sending it straight to a second reading.

The nature of publicly funded assistant fees for elected officials needs fuller debate, it added.

The Legislative Yuan's Congressional Assistants Union issued a statement opposing any amendments that might weaken the public assistant system and urged lawmakers across party lines to proceed cautiously.

Most legislators who participated in the KMT's caucus meeting today agreed that the amendments should not be rushed, an insider who attended the meeting said.

Some lawmakers think the laws can be amended, but not in this way, while others think that the bill should not take effect until 2028 so that it would not raise questions about current legislators, the insider said.

If the issue cannot be resolved through a more gradual, consensus-building approach, the caucus would rather withdraw the proposal altogether, the person added.

The people signed up through Chinese travel agencies for tours of neighboring Russia with companies claiming they could obtain Russian visas and fast-track border clearance, the source said on condition of anonymity. 
The travelers were actually issued one-time-use Chinese passports, they said. 
Taiwanese are prohibited from holding a Chinese passport or household registration. If found to have a Chinese ID, they may lose their resident status under Article 9-1

Ukrainian forces destroyed 20 fuel tanks — 70% of the total — in a drone strike on Russia's Temryuk Seaport in Krasnodar Krai on Dec. 5, the General Staff reported Dec. 8.

The Dec. 5 attack sparked a large fire at the Temryuk Seaport, a facility that handles various types of cargo, including liquefied natural gas used to supply the Russian military. 

The Krasnodar Krai Operational Headquarters confirmed that the port sustained damage from the drone strikes.

The fire continues to burn at the liquefied gas loading rack, where roughly two dozen rail tanks are stationed. As of the evening of Dec. 7, the fire had spread across nearly 1,000 square meters, according to the General Staff.

Ukrainian forces targeted multiple sites in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories overnight on Dec. 8, the General Staff added.

Strikes hit an ammunition depot near the village of Chmyrivka in Luhansk Oblast and a drone depot in the city of Donetsk in Donetsk Oblast.

Ukrainian forces also struck a fuel and lubricants depot near the Simeykine settlement in Luhansk Oblast, as well as a mobile fire group and a Pantsir-S1 air defense system in Donetsk Oblast.

The consequences of the strikes and the full extent of the damage are still being assessed, according to the report.

Ukraine has routinely targeted oil facilities in Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories in an effort to disrupt Moscow's military logistics and supply lines.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Dec. 7 he was ""disappointed"" that President Volodymyr Zelensky allegedly had not yet reviewed a U.S. peace proposal to end the war in Ukraine.

Speaking to reporters at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Trump said his administration has been in communication with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and senior Ukrainian officials.

""We've been speaking to President Putin, and we've been speaking to Ukrainian leaders, including President Zelensky,"" Trump said. ""And I have to say I'm a little bit disappointed that President Zelensky hasn't yet read the proposal. That was as of a few hours ago.""

""Russia's fine with it. You know, Russia would rather have the whole country, when you think of it,"" he added.

Trump's remarks came a day after his special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said a peace agreement to end Russia's war appeared to be nearing completion.

Earlier in the week, Ukraine's top negotiators arrived in Miami on Dec. 4 to continue discussions on peace efforts with Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. 

Their visit came amid heightened diplomatic activity following the leak of a U.S.-backed 28-point plan that many viewed as pressuring Ukraine toward capitulation in Russia's full-scale war.

Four Russian soldiers were given sentences in the range of 1.5 to 12 years for their involvement in the murder of Russell ""Texas"" Bentley and an attempt to conceal the crime.

Russia has accused Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi in absentia of organizing an alleged terrorist attack in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Congress is also calling for more frequent reporting of aid provided to Kyiv by its European allies, reflecting Washington's push for Europe to take on a greater share of responsibility for supporting Ukraine.

Candidates celebrate after winning in the legislative election in Hong Kong on Sunday.Lam Yik/Reuters

Around a third of Hong Kong's registered voters took part in a highly controlled election Sunday, held amid a renewed national-security crackdown that has followed the deadly Wang Fuk Court fire. 

Beijing's effort to tamp down unrest over the fire ahead of the vote extended even to foreign media, who on Saturday were issued a rare government warning to temper their coverage of the disaster.

While the streets around polling stations were busy Sunday with volunteers for various candidates, holding large placards and handing out leaflets as they exhorted passersby to participate, foot traffic at the voting stations themselves was limited. Turnout figures did slightly exceed the record low of 30.2 per cent in 2021. 

That was the first election to Hong Kong's legislature held under a new “patriots-only” system introduced in the wake of a massive national-security crackdown that followed pro-democracy protests in 2019. 

Analysis: Anger over Hong Kong fire tests Beijing's power ahead of elections

While the Legislative Council, a legacy of British colonial rule, had never been fully elected, the changes slashed the number of seats chosen by the public and introduced a vetting process.

Of the 90 seats in LegCo, as the body is known, just 20 are directly elected, while around half are chosen by a pro-government Election Committee – which also handles the candidate vetting – and the rest chosen by special-interest business and trade groups. 

According to provisional figures, 31.9 per cent of registered voters cast a ballot on Sunday. That is still the second lowest on record, and from a smaller base of registered voters, which has declined by around 340,000, or 7.6 per cent, in the past four years. 

The turnout in the New Territories East constituency, which includes Tai Po, site of this month's deadly fire, stood at 30.15 per cent, the lowest across all 10 directly elected constituencies. 

The authorities had initially considered delaying the election after the blaze – which engulfed seven buildings and killed at least 159 people in Hong Kong's worst disaster in decades – but switched to urging people to elect a new legislature that can ensure a fire like this doesn't happen again. 

“My goal is to find out the truth and hold those responsible accountable,” Hong Kong's Beijing-appointed leader, John Lee, said as he cast his ballot Sunday, urging others to “vote for reform.”

“The Legislative Council has many powers; we need to co-operate on passing public budgets and lawmaking, plugging existing loopholes, making the city safer and assuring the public,” Mr. Lee said, according to the South China Morning Post. 

There was open concern among officials, however, that most Hong Kongers would stay away, as the majority of voters have since the 2021 changes. Four years ago, ever-increasing political engagement was ended by Beijing's imposition of a national-security law that has been wielded to dismantle Hong Kong's once-vibrant civil society. 

In the run-up to Sunday's election, seven people were arrested for allegedly inciting others not to vote or to cast blank ballots, using a 2021 law that criminalized encouraging people to do so, even though the underlying action remains perfectly legal. 

The law was introduced after the voting changes, which cut opposition parties out of the political process, in an apparent attempt to pre-empt any efforts to organize a mass spoiled-ballot protest. 

As grief over the Wang Fuk Court fire has turned to anger about how the disaster was allowed to happen, some Hong Kongers have tried to organize to put pressure on the government to respond, in an echo of pre-2019 politics. In response, the city's national-security apparatus has swung into gear, arresting several people and warning others not to test the government. 

Opinion: In Hong Kong, a city's skin caught fire. Other cities may want to take note

On Saturday, the Office for Safeguarding National Security, a Chinese central government-run body that operates in Hong Kong, took the rare step of directly warning foreign media not to cross “red lines” in coverage of the disaster and Sunday's election. Some media were also summoned to an in-person meeting where an official read out a statement to them.

According to the statement, “recent reports by foreign media concerning Hong Kong have disregarded facts, spread false information, distorted and smeared the government's disaster-relief and post-disaster recovery work, attacked and interfered with the Legislative Council elections, incited social division and confrontation,” misled the international community and “hurt the feelings of Hong Kong citizens.” 

“The Commissioner's Office emphasized that ‘freedom of the press' and compliance with the law are not mutually exclusive, and no media outlet may use ‘freedom of the press' as a pretext to interfere in China's internal affairs or Hong Kong affairs.”

The statement added that journalists in Hong Kong are bound to follow the territory's laws, including the national-security law.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's government has been under fire over its involvement with several companies tied to Edmonton businessman Sam Mraiche.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

For months, there has been a swirl of unanswered questions concerning allegations of political interference by Alberta government officials in the procurement practices for outsourcing to private surgical facilities.

Those questions were sparked by news of the abrupt firing of Athana Mentzelopoulos last January as chief executive of Alberta Health Services, two days before she was to discuss her investigation into the procurement process for private surgical facilities with the province's Auditor-General, Doug Wylie. 

Ms. Mentzelopoulos has alleged that some of the agency's contracts for private surgery were at inflated prices, that they may have been tainted by conflicts of interest and that political officials – including former chief of staff Marshall Smith – pressed her to proceed with deals. She further alleges that she was fired for investigating those deals, some of which involved Edmonton entrepreneur Sam Mraiche. 

Those allegations have not been tested in court; the government has said Ms. Mentzelopoulos was fired for incompetence. Mr. Smith has denied any wrongdoing and is suing Ms. Mentzelopoulos, and The Globe. 

Who is Sam Mraiche? Inside Alberta's health care controversy

The intervening months have done little to provide clarity. An RCMP probe is continuing. Mr. Wylie is still labouring to finish his report before next April, when his term expires, since the government has rebuffed his request for an extension.

Last spring, the Alberta government appointed Raymond Wyant, a former chief judge of the Provincial Court of Manitoba, as an independent investigator, albeit one with a circumscribed mandate and limited powers (he could not subpoena witnesses or conduct testimony under oath). Mr. Wyant also examined the province's ill-fated effort to import children's analgesics through a company owned by Mr. Mraiche.

Mr. Wyant did not interview any elected officials, but concluded there were no improper actions by any minister, ministerial staff member or member of the public service. He had earlier noted that he was “not in a position to make a final and absolute determination.” Even for the independent investigator, there remain many unanswered questions.

Last Friday, the Alberta government cancelled negotiations with two companies, owned in part by Mr. Mraiche, to open private surgical facilities in Red Deer and Lethbridge. “Concerns were raised about the procurement practices and procedures and handling of conflicts of interest in AHS procurement,” Matt Jones, the Minister of Hospital and Surgical Health Services, told the Alberta legislature on Tuesday. That move deepened the mystery surrounding the government's actions, and leaves fundamental questions unanswered. 

Why was a company owned by Mr. Mraiche given a contract to procure and import children's analgesics in 2022? A shortage of Tylenol made procurement a pressing matter for the government. All the more curious, then, that Mr. Mraiche's company was selected, given that it did not have the drug establishment licence needed to import pharmaceuticals.

Why were companies tied to Mr. Mraiche considered for private surgical services? Mr. Mraiche was already facing questions over the botched effort to secure children's analgesics. The Wyant report notes that “Alberta has paid almost $50-million for product not yet received.” So why was the province considering a proposal to outsource surgeries to facilities in Red Deer and Lethbridge, owned in part by numbered companies in which Mr. Mraiche held a 25-per-cent stake?

Alberta ends procurement talks with two firms tied to businessman at centre of health care controversy

How do procurement rules need to change? Mr. Wyant's report identifies gaps in policy, as well as simple lack of adherence. What, if anything, has the government done to address those gaps and failures?

What are the ties between Sam Mraiche and Marshall Smith, and other government officials? Mr. Smith (no relation to Premier Danielle Smith) hired several relatives of Mr. Mraiche, while he lived in a home owned by one of Mr. Mraiche's sisters. Mr. Mraiche, who has said he paid rent and has acted appropriately at all times, also popped up at high-profile events involving government officials, including box seats during NHL playoffs and an election night victory party. 

What is the damage from months of stonewalling? The Premier may wish to contemplate that question as she embarks on what could be a historic reform of the province's health care system – the success of which depends on the trust of Albertans.

Netflix's NFLX-Q US$72-billion Warner Bros WBD-Q deal led to several price target cuts by Wall Street analysts as U.S. President Donald Trump warned of market-share concerns, underscoring the tough scrutiny that the acquisition is likely to face.

The deal that combines the world's largest streaming service with HBO Max and a major Hollywood studio has also drawn criticism from bipartisan lawmakers and unions on concerns it could lead to job cuts and higher prices for consumers.

Trump warned on Sunday while speaking at the Kennedy Center that the combined group's enlarged market share “could be a problem” and that he will be involved in the decision.

White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Monday that the U.S. Justice Department would examine the deal's impact for “quite a while.”

Netflix has agreed to a US$5.8-billion termination fee if it cannot obtain regulatory approval, in a sign of confidence of a greenlight.

To ease concerns of market concentration, it is likely to argue that the market for online video also includes YouTube and TikTok - two of the most popular platforms with hundreds of millions of users.

“Antitrust opposition stalls consummation of the deal for a couple of years, and raises at least an element of risk about completion,” said Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett.

Hollywood unions have voiced concerns about increased market concentration, reduced film output and the potential for higher consumer costs.

Rival bidder Paramount Skydance PSKY-Q has said the deal process was biased, raising chances of a higher bid or a hostile takeover.

The political dynamics may be further complicated by Warner Bros Discovery's rejection of Paramount Skydance, a studio with Trump connections, in favor of Netflix, analysts said.

At least three brokerages cut their price targets for Netflix, with consensus median price target now at US$139, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The US president has said ""there could be a problem"" with the proposed $82 billion deal that would see the streaming giant acquire the Hollywood studio. Donald Trump noted that Netflix already has a ""big market share.""

US President Donald Trump said Sunday that he would be involved in the review by federal regulators of a proposed consolidation deal between streaming platform Netflix and Hollywood studio Warner Bros.

The companies announced the agreement on Friday. Netflix would acquire parts of Warner Bros. Discovery for $72 billion (€61.8 billion) if the sale is completed.

The cash and stock transaction is valued at $27.75 per Warner Bros. share, with a total equity value of approximately $72 billion, reaching an enterprise value of $82.7 billion, which includes things like debt to be paid off.

If regulators approve, the deal would unite two of the biggest names in entertainment, Netflix and Warner Bros., the studio behind ""Harry Potter,"" ""Game of Thrones,"" and the DC films.

""I'll be involved in that decision,"" Trump told reporters as he arrived at the Kennedy Center for its annual awards show.

The US president was referring to federal regulators reviewing the deal, which has raised antitrust concerns in Hollywood.

If the agreement is greenlit, Netflix — already the world's largest streaming platform — would control one of Hollywood's most recognizable film and TV houses.

While Trump did not comment on whether he supported the deal, the US president did suggest that Netflix's concentration of market power could be an issue.

""That's going to be for some economists to tell... But it is a big market share. There's no question it could be a problem,"" Trump said.

Cinema United, a trade organization that represents movie theaters across the US, said Friday that the deal risks eliminating 25% of the annual box office in the US and poses an ""unprecedented threat"" to cinemas around the world.

The Writers Guild trade union has called for the merger to be blocked.

""The world's largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,"" the group said in a statement.

The director of ""Titanic,"" James Cameron, said ahead of the announcement that any Netflix takeover of Warner Bros. would be a ""disaster"" for movie theaters, citing concerns that the streaming giant wants to limit cinema releases of its film productions.

Kathleen Brooks, a researcher at trading and investment firm XTB, told the AFP news agency Friday that Netflix is aiming to ""dominate Hollywood."" She warned that the deal raises a number of potential issues, namely a Netflix monopoly on the TV and movie business.

Israel and Qatar held a series of secret meetings to rebuild ties following the botched assassination of a Hamas leader in Doha.

Representatives from the two nations met in New York on Sunday to repair relations that had soured after Tel Aviv launched a missile strike on the Arab state in September.

The unprecedented strike, which had been intended to take out Hamas leaders gathered in the capital to discuss a potential peace agreement, killed a Qatari service member and none of the intended targets.

Israel's strike, launched with little advance notice to the Trump administration, triggered dismay in Washington, given that Qatar is a key US military partner in the Middle East, housing thousands of US forces at its vast Al-Udeid air base.

Days later, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, heightened tensions further by promising to carry out additional strikes if Qatar refused to eject Hamas leaders, who have been hosted in Doha since 2012.

On Oct 1, Mr Trump signed an executive order promising to treat attacks on Qatar “as a threat to the peace and security of the United States,” and to use all measures, including the American military, against those who attack the Arab state.

Steve Witkoff, the White House's special envoy, hosted the reconciliation meeting on Sunday in an effort to smooth over tensions, The Telegraph understands. Talks were still on-going on Monday.

David Barnea, the head of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, represented Israel, while a senior Qatari official represented the state, which has been a key player in helping the US to negotiate the Gaza peace deal, according to Axios.

There, the US proposed a trilateral mechanism to “enhance coordination, improve communication, resolve mutual grievances, and strengthen collective efforts to prevent threats”.

Last month, Mr Netanyahu apologised for the strike that violated Qatari sovereignty at the behest of Mr Trump.

Mr Netanyahu told Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani, the Qatari prime minister, that such a strike would not happen again.

On Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said the second phase of the plan to end the war in Gaza was close.

In November, Israel announced that Mr Trump had invited Mr Netanyahu to the White House “in the near future”. That meeting is expected to take place on Dec 29, according to the Jewish Insider.

Mr Netanyahu said that he would discuss with the US president how to bring an end to Hamas rule in Gaza and the key issue of disarmament.

The long-sought ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is entering its second month, although both sides have repeatedly accused each other of violating the truce agreement.

UN officials say that they believe at least 60,000 people have been killed in Sudan in just the past few weeks.

Sudanese paramilitary forces bombed a kindergarten and the hospital where victims were brought for treatment in southern Sudan on Thursday, killing at least 50 people, including 33 children.

Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out three drone strikes in the town of Kalogi, in South Kordofan, officials say. The paramilitary reportedly struck the school twice, the second time to kill civilians who had gathered to aid the wounded, and then struck the hospital treating the victims, Al Jazeera reports, citing sources from the government-aligned military, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). 

The death toll may be far higher. A local official told Al Jazeera that at least 116 people were killed. Forty-six of those killed were children, the official said. According to UNICEF, many of the victims were aged between 5 and 7 years old.

The UN Secretary-General is “appalled” by the strikes, spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement, and called on states to take action to stop further violence in Sudan. Sheldon Yett, UNICEF's Sudan representative, said: “Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children's rights.”

The UN has reported that a humanitarian convoy carrying food supplies to North Darfur, including a World Food Programme truck, was also hit in an aerial strike on Thursday. Last week, RSF alleged that SAF targeted a border town that serves as a crucial humanitarian aid crossing near Chad in a bombing.

The strikes come amid warnings that South Kordofan may become “another el-Fasher,” as UN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Thursday. Last month, starvation officials confirmed a famine in South Kordofan's capital, Kadugli, on top of the famine already declared in el-Fasher, affecting hundreds of thousands of people.

RSF has waged genocidal violence and mass killings in el-Fasher, which it took over in late October. UN officials have estimated that tens of thousands of people have been slaughtered in the city in the past three weeks alone.

The Guardian reported on Friday that British members of Parliament have said that officials say their “low estimate” is that 60,000 people have been killed. Meanwhile, up to 150,000 residents of el-Fasher are unaccounted for amid reports of the RSF's massacres.

Satellite evidence shows the city resembles a “slaughterhouse,” Yale University researchers say. Once-busy markets from the city that formerly had a population of 1.5 million are now empty. 

Since Sudan's horrific civil war and genocide began in April 2023, as many as or more than 400,000 people have been killed.

In response to Thursday's strikes, some have reupped calls for the U.S. to stop sending weapons to the United Arab Emirates, which provides the RSF with its arms arsenal. 

“The RSF just attacked a kindergarten, killing at least 33 children in Sudan. Meanwhile, the Trump Admin. continues to sell arms to the UAE, who are aiding these atrocities,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) on social media. “Imagine if [Donald] Trump spent as much time trying to stop the killing, as he did getting the UAE to invest in his crypto coin.”

The bill would authorize $8 billion more in US military spending than Trump asked for in his 2026 budget request.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Republican congressional leaders unveiled a sprawling military policy bill late Sunday that would authorize $901 billion in US military spending for the coming fiscal year, just months after GOP lawmakers and President Donald Trump pushed through the largest-ever cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition assistance.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who aggressively pushed cuts to Medicaid by peddling false claims of large-scale fraud, touted the 3,086-page National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) as legislation that would “ensure our military forces remain the most lethal in the world.”

The bill, a compromise between House and Senate versions of the annual legislation, would authorize $8 billion more in US military spending than Trump asked for in his 2026 budget request.

If passed, the 2026 NDAA would pump billions of dollars more into the Pentagon, a cesspool of the kinds of waste, fraud, and abuse that Johnson and other Republicans claim to be targeting when they cut safety net programs, stripping health insurance and food aid from millions. The Pentagon has never passed an independent audit and continues to have “significant fraud exposure,” the Government Accountability Office said earlier this year.

Final passage of the NDAA would push total military spending authorized by Congress this year above $1 trillion, including the $150 billion in Pentagon funds included in the Trump-GOP budget law enacted over the summer.

Last month, as Common Dreams reported, a coalition of watchdog and anti-war groups implored Congress not to approve any funding above the originally requested $892.6 billion, warning that additional money for the Pentagon would enable the Trump administration's lawless use of the military in US streets and overseas.

The groups also noted that “the surge in Pentagon spending stands in sharp contrast to the drastic cuts in healthcare and food assistance programs imposed by the reconciliation package.”

“At such a time,” they wrote in a letter to lawmakers, “bipartisan agreement to provide additional funds to the Pentagon would deliver a cruel message to the American public, one out of step with Democratic messaging over healthcare, reconciliation, and the shutdown.”

FIFA President Gianni Infantino described Trump as his “close friend” during the award ceremony.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

On Friday, FIFA President Gianni Infantino awarded President Donald Trump the first ever “FIFA Peace Prize,” an award that was created just weeks after Trump failed to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

Infantino described Trump as his “close friend” during the ceremony at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., which took place during the FIFA World Cup draw. 

“This is your prize, this is your peace prize,” he told Trump, awarding him a trophy, a certificate, and a medal.

“This is truly one of the great honors of my life,” Trump said in accepting the award.

For several weeks after the award was announced in early November, commentators have speculated that the award was a sham and would be going to Trump, given his friendship with Infantino and his visible dismay at having lost the Nobel Peace Prize.

According to the international soccer organization's website, the FIFA peace prize is granted to “individuals who, through their unwavering commitment and their special actions, have helped to unite people all over the world in peace and consequently deserve a special and unique recognition.”

The award came the same week that the U.S. Institute of Peace added Trump's name to the outside of their building, which now reads, “Donald Trump United States Institute of Peace.”

“President Trump will be remembered by history as the President of Peace. It's time our State Department display that,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

Trump has frequently asserted that he is deserving of a peace prize, claiming that he has helped end multiple wars and military conflicts around the world. In reality, fact-checkers have noted that although Trump has had a hand in numerous temporary ceasefires, he has not “ended wars” or created lasting peace as he's claimed.

But there are many reasons why Trump may be undeserving of a peace award. Under Trump's orders, his administration has conducted deadly attacks on civilian boats off the coasts of South America — attacks that fuel tensions with Venezuela and likely amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Trump has also supported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu throughout Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, encouraging the prime minister to, in his words, “finish the problem” there.

Trump has deployed hundreds of National Guard troops into U.S. cities to assist with his violent immigration raids, and has threatened to send multiple branches of the military to cities in the future under the auspices of the Insurrection Act, despite no evidence of an insurrection taking place.

The administration has rounded up immigrants in the U.S. at an unprecedented scale, often in unlawful ways, violating people's due process rights and punishing university students for expressing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

And Trump has often encouraged violence against dissident voices, including by stating that he wouldn't “mind so much” if someone shot members of the press at his political rallies, or labeling Democratic lawmakers as “seditious” and threatening “death” as punishment.

FIFA presenting a “peace prize” is a questionable endeavor on its own, given the organization's willingness to overlook human rights abuses in order to advance its own interests. For example, the organization has selected Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 World Cup, despite that country's documented history of human rights violations, use of child labor, and dangerous working conditions for foreign laborers, among other concerns.

FIFA has also ignored its own rules by refusing to sanction Israel over its genocide of Palestinians. Israel has violated many FIFA statutes, including by playing league matches on occupied land, enforcing systemic racial discrimination, destroying soccer facilities, and killing Palestinian soccer players.

 What Kind of World Order Does His National Security Strategy Seek?

 Michael Kimmage

In his first term as U.S. president and on the campaign trail for reelection in 2024, a variety of Donald Trump's instincts were visible. One was an appreciation of power for its own sake. For Trump, it is power, not principles, that makes the world go round. Another was Trump's view of prosperity as a talismanic organizing principle of foreign policy. “We are going to make America wealthy again,” Trump vowed in 2016. “You have to be wealthy in order to be great.” A third instinct was the close alignment of politics with personality. “Only I can fix it,” Trump declared at the 2016 Republican nominating convention.

Trump's new National Security Strategy, which was published late last week, synthesizes and formalizes these three instincts, presenting them as the necessary drivers of international order. The NSS points to “the character of our nation, upon which its power, wealth, and decency were built,” entrusting the protection of this character to the president himself and his “team,” who in his first term “successfully marshaled America's great strengths to correct course and begin ushering in a new golden age for our country.” It is Trump's personality, power, and supporters that have enabled this golden age.

The strategy document is also an expression of American conservatism. Trump's Republican Party is not that of George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan, two presidents who tied conservative domestic politics to liberal internationalism. Trump's GOP is motivated more by an eagerness to separate friends from foes, a distinction that unites domestic politics with foreign policy. This binary mandates a blanket rejection of the Biden administration (to which Trump, in his introductory letter to the NSS, attributes “four years of weakness, extremism, and deadly failures”), a concern with national purity and hence with foreign contamination, and a will to shore up civilizational principles “in Europe, the Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world.”

The new strategy simultaneously mirrors and distorts international reality. In enshrining the importance of personality—“presidential diplomacy” in the language of this document—it nods to our media-driven world, in which individual leaders have enormous presence, latitude, and power. This is a world Trump has helped bring into being. The NSS collides with international reality by privileging raw power over persuasion and by focusing U.S. foreign policy first and foremost on the Western Hemisphere, even though the Indo-Pacific has become the world's economic center of gravity (as the document notes) and the precedent-setting war of the early twenty-first century is taking place in Europe.

The document celebrates American power and is geared in part toward sustaining and amplifying it. At other times, however, the goal seems to be to restrain U.S. ambitions. Although the strategy document is unlikely to explain Trump's day-to-day decision-making, it describes an aspirational world order. The order would not be American-led. It would not be the function of great-power competition or of civilizational clashes, and it would not be rules-based. It would issue instead from a dense network of personal relationships that supersede any alliances or any division of countries along the lines of democracy or authoritarianism.

This network could provide Russian President Vladimir Putin with an opening to end the war in Ukraine on his terms. It could be conducive to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's grandiose plans for his country. Most of all, though, it will accommodate the actions of a man who sees the world in viscerally personal terms, who can easily and quickly change his views and his commitments, and who thinks less in terms of negotiation and treaties than in terms of rapid-fire dealmaking. This is more than just the world Trump wants. It is the world that he has.

Trump is at ease with twenty-first-century diplomacy. Over the past decade, multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have declined in influence, and structured long-term diplomacy has become less common. The Helsinki Final Act of 1975, which solidified western Europe's U.S.-backed security architecture, proceeded from fine-grained negotiation carried out by faceless diplomats; it now belongs to a distant past. Bureaucracies, institutions, and ministries of foreign affairs have all been losing stature, as ambitious, centralizing leaders—some charismatic, some authoritarian, some both—have emerged in many of the world's biggest countries. Trump, Putin, and Xi, along with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, dominate the foreign policies of their respective countries.

Contemporary media can still democratize access to information, but it also augments the optics of personalized power. In the digital realm, Trump embodies the United States, Putin embodies Russia, Xi embodies China, Modi embodies India, and Erdogan embodies Turkey. National and international publics relate directly to these leaders, who set the tone for international relations with their actions, their statements, and their preferences. Whether effective or ineffective in reaching their goals, these leaders straddle the global attention economy; they are impossible to ignore. Their whims can have the status of law. In this order, binding agreements are as elusive as transactional back-and-forth is commonplace.

A striking feature of the strategy is its presentism. Other than its allegations of pre-Trump dysfunction and its admiring references to the Monroe Doctrine, it lacks a historical backdrop. Absent is a common historical argument: that after World War II, the United States built an institutional architecture conducive to security, prosperity, and liberty. The document offers no alternative history. It is a security strategy for the age of social media, pegged to a never-ending, fluid, ever-adjustable present tense. To the extent that this impression maps onto reality, it empowers the chief executive. The world must patiently stand by, watching and waiting for his next steps.



The strategy traces multiple contradictions. It celebrates an economic statecraft conducted (if necessary) through military means in the Western Hemisphere and through the implementation of tariffs elsewhere; and the selective application of military force, such as the U.S. strikes this past summer that Trump says in his letter “obliterated Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity.” In its other mode, the document champions pulling back and prioritization. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, it claims, “American foreign policy elites convinced themselves that permanent American domination of the entire world was in the best interests of our country.” For the Trump administration, the non-American world is “our concern only if [its] activities directly threaten our interests.” American power must be delimited; it must not be overstretched.

The more American power must be constrained, the more Washington will have to excel at persuasion, the obligatory pursuit of countries that are not hegemons. Yet the strategy offers no foundation for persuasion. Its passages on Europe are especially revealing in this regard. Rather than calibrated persuasion within an alliance structure, the document advocates a strategy of promoting conservatism in Europe. It recommends “cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations,” a trajectory that inclines toward liberal internationalism or, in the case of the European Union, toward liberal transnationalism. Altering Europe's political trajectory is a radical political project for the United States. Accomplishing it would require the sustained application of American power overseas.

The mantra of “America first” complicates the practice of persuasion and fits more comfortably into a U.S.-led world. Meaningful persuasion requires empathy for foreign countries or at least attention to them: they must be a concern not only when they pose an acute threat. Meaningful persuasion requires the suspension of some short-term interests for the sake of long-term interests, which is why coercive economic statecraft among allies is ill advised. It may yield the occasional victory, but over time it degrades the alliance. Meaningful persuasion enshrines deference toward other countries (when merited) so that others may respond with deference in return (when merited). All too often in Trump's brash strategy document, foreign policy is construed as nothing more than naked assertiveness, a means to the end of “an American-led world of sovereign countries and free economies.”

To judge from the new strategy, Europe is a second-order consideration. Passages on the Western Hemisphere and the Indo-Pacific precede those on Europe. The strategy rightly establishes freedom of navigation and regional stability as priorities in the Indo-Pacific, positioning China as a competitor while underscoring the importance of avoiding direct conflict with a nuclear power that is a military behemoth. The Indo-Pacific, the document states, “will continue to be among the next century's key economic and geopolitical battlegrounds.” The geoeconomic might of the Indo-Pacific makes it a place of infinite opportunity for the United States, a conviction of the Biden and Obama administrations and one that the Trump administration appears to share.

It is bizarre, then, that the Western Hemisphere enjoys pride of place in the strategy document. The implication is that illegal immigration and drug trafficking from Latin America are the preeminent national security challenges for the United States. Severe as these problems are, they pale beside the potential for major destabilization in Europe or the Indo-Pacific. Illegal immigration and drug trafficking are also problems that demand a nuanced set of solutions, from reforms rooted in domestic American politics to collective problem solving with the countries that contribute to migrant or drug flows into the United States. Trump's strategy risks militarizing problems that are not military in nature.

The document is at its weakest when addressing the war in Ukraine. Part of its problem is theoretical. In some passages, the document defines “stopping regional conflicts” as a U.S. responsibility. In this view, Washington must prevent any one antagonist (meaning Russia or China) from achieving a position of regional dominance. The war in Ukraine should be Europeanized so that Europe can police its own region and keep Russia from exerting outsize influence beyond its borders. Elsewhere, however, the strategy recognizes “the outsize influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations,” describing their influence as a “timeless truth of international relations.” Some countries are entitled to preeminence, and Russia may be one of these countries. But regional stability in Ukraine and elsewhere will not arise from spheres of influence created by a handful of great powers.

The strategy advances the search for “strategic stability with Russia” and blames European elites for standing in the way of peace. It assumes Ukraine will survive the war but is silent about Ukrainian security (apart from predicting that Ukraine will not join the NATO alliance) and about Ukraine's integration into Europe. The document does not acknowledge that Ukraine could lose the war, which is a real possibility, and it skirts a fundamental dilemma for the United States, which is that strategic stability with Russia can be realized only by giving Russia some degree of control over Ukraine. Yet were Russia to acquire such control, it would destabilize NATO and non-NATO European countries. On Ukraine, the new strategy does little more than make assertions, many of them too sanguine about what the country needs to survive and too credulous about Russia's potential to serve as a constructive regional actor. The strategy document contends that peace might be at hand in Ukraine, if only Europe's elites can be bypassed. This understates the conflict's stakes and in particular the risk of rewarding and thereby normalizing Russia's zeal to control Ukraine.

National security strategy documents of this kind are not blueprints. American presidents end up reacting to crises more than dictating outcomes. On September 11, 2001, George W. Bush's presidency became a reaction to an unanticipated terrorist attack. Barack Obama spent much of his presidency responding to the Arab Spring, to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and to the Syrian civil war. Donald Trump's first term was refashioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Joe Biden had to contend with Russia's re-invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and with the regional fallout from Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. No doubt Trump's second term will be defined more by unpredicted future crises than by any paragraph, sentence, or phrase from the 2025 NSS. That is the story of every American presidency.

This past February, I wrote in Foreign Affairs about the potential for “flexible diplomacy” from the Trump administration and the possibility that a nimble White House could pull off “the deft management of constant tensions and rolling conflicts.” At times during the past year, such nimbleness has materialized: in diplomacy that yielded a cease-fire in Gaza, for example, and a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Yet the strategy document inadvertently illustrates the internal contradictions and the paradoxes of the world Trump wants. Resolving the conflict in Ukraine would demand not just flexibility but close coordination with allies and carefully plotted incentives to curb Russian aggression. This is incompatible with the project of imposing American-style conservatism on Europe. Contending with China's reach in the Indo-Pacific and beyond will benefit from Washington's talent for persuasion rather than for imposing tariffs. And if the United States is to minimize its military footprint, it will have to look past civilizational patterns and affinities, whatever these may be, and establish global partnerships that are based on mutual respect. Having campaigned on moderating American power, Trump has shown himself to be enamored of it and the world-changing options it creates.

 Longtime Partners Will Soon Start to Drift Away

 Robert E. Kelly and Paul Poast

Donald Trump's rise was supposed to have upended the liberal international order. In his first term, Trump openly disparaged longtime European allies, pulled out of international treaties such as the Paris climate agreement, and decried how the United States was subsidizing its allies through military support and trade deficits. Yet as we argued in Foreign Affairs in 2022, Trump's aggressive unilateralism did not break U.S. alliances. Shaken and often irritated by Washington's bullying, the allies nevertheless did not drift away from the world's preeminent superpower. The foreign relations doctrines, defense spending, and geopolitical alignments of core U.S. partners such as France, Germany, Japan, and South Korea did not shift in any meaningful way during the first Trump administration. Instead, these countries accommodated Trump because they felt that loosening ties with the United States would be more dangerous to their economic and security interests than trying to stand up to his abuse.

Trump's second term has put this dynamic to an even sterner test. The president's disdain for U.S. allies and partners is much greater this time around. He has talked about annexing Canada and Greenland, bombing Mexico, retaking the Panama Canal, and giving up on Ukraine and Taiwan, to name just a few. Trump, claiming that allies are ripping off the United States, is demanding large, ill-defined investments in the United States that look a lot like bribes. For instance, he wants a staggering $600 billion investment guarantee from the European Union to be used at his discretion. He seems to be leaning into the notion that alliances are not pillars of a mutually beneficial network but elements of a protection racket—and that it's high time for the United States to reap the rewards.

If allies had hoped that the election of Joe Biden in 2020 would restore traditional American liberal internationalism, Trump's reelection proves that the foreign policy belligerence and explicit quid pro quo basis for U.S. commitments evident in his first term was not an aberration. Instead, as demonstrated in the administration's just-released National Security Strategy, it will probably be a core part of U.S. foreign policy moving forward. Future Republican leaders are likely to continue to promote Trump's overall policy direction. And even if the Democrats retake control, the ability of Trump-aligned Republicans to exercise power in a two-party system will undermine the United States' reliability as an ally.

So far in Trump's second term, U.S. allies have not yet defected. In October, Trump visited Japan and South Korea, and each country's leaders signaled their desire to stay in the president's good graces. Just as we concluded in 2022, the allies still seem to be all right. But they are much more worried than before. Unlike eight years ago, countries can no longer wish away the implications of a United States that might not support them in a crisis. Instead, over the next decade, it is likely that U.S. allies will start to noticeably drift away. They may still hope for U.S. support, but they are also starting to hedge against the possibility that the United States will be absent when problems arise by building alternative alliance structures, considering obtaining nuclear weapons, and even brokering separate peace deals with, rather than confronting, regional opponents. Without being able to predict how Trump would respond to calls for help in a major war or a nuclear crisis with China, Russia, or North Korea, U.S. allies have no choice but to shift their long-term strategies to reduce their dependence on Washington.

In the first year of Trump's second term, U.S. allies have remained tied to the United States. As in Trump's first term, many allied leaders seem to believe that Trump can be wrangled into commitments and binding deals that will keep the United States involved in supporting their security needs. European efforts to engage Washington on Ukraine's behalf in its war with Russia show how dependent on the United States the allies still are. Trump does not appear to want to help Ukraine, and he has expressed his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yet many European countries are not swiftly ramping up their defense industrial spending to a level that could meet Ukraine's war needs independently of U.S. financial and weapons support. Nor are they finding homegrown alternatives to U.S. logistics and intelligence gathering. Three and a half years into the conflict, European leaders are still coming to the White House to flatter Trump rather than making themselves less reliant on the United States.

U.S. allies in East Asia, too, have sought to get closer to Trump rather than push him away. Both Japan and South Korea have capitulated to Trump's investment demands. As part of the trade deal it struck with Washington in July, for instance, Tokyo agreed to invest $500 billion in the United States, although whether Japan actually hits this target and the exact details of who controls this money remain contested. And despite their proximity to China, North Korea, and Russia, neither Japan nor South Korea has ramped up defense spending enough to free itself from reliance on the United States. U.S. military forces stationed in Japan and South Korea remain deeply interwoven with their host militaries, and joint drills continue. In fact, the United States is pushing both countries to allow U.S. military assets based on their territory to be used in offensive operations to counter China, not simply for the protection of the host countries. Knowing that they do not want to face surrounding threats alone, U.S. allies in East Asia continue to accommodate Trump's demands even as his rhetoric grows tougher and his actions more aggressive.

As we described in our 2022 essay, one reason that many countries in Europe and Asia ally with the United States is that its geographic distance makes it unlikely to be a direct military threat. Thus, even if it is not a dependable friend, the strategic benefits of working with the United States are enticing enough for U.S. allies to hope that they can keep placating Trump. But hope is not a strategy. And that is why concerns about Trump and the likely trajectory of U.S. foreign policy eventually, grudgingly, will push U.S. allies to hedge.

Despite their ongoing reliance on the United States in the short term, these allies will seek to protect themselves against American irresponsibility going forward. This includes both increasing domestic spending to make themselves more self-reliant in defense and infrastructure and pursuing a wider range of partners for fear that the United States will not help in a conflict.

In some ways, Trump is accelerating this shift. The U.S. president has consistently demanded that allies spend more on their own defense. In the Trump administration's new National Security Strategy, for instance, the need for burden sharing is a central theme. Although the United States claims it still wants and expects a robust network of allies, particularly in Europe and Asia, the strategy makes clear that Washington's role should be as a “conveyer and supporter,” rather than primary provider, of other countries' security. But by requiring more defense spending as a prerequisite for good relations with Washington, the Trump administration is also reducing its allies' need for U.S. protection.



Some changes are already occurring. Japan's government has begun expanding its missile force and policymakers in South Korea are debating building an aircraft carrier or pursuing nuclear weapons, all of which would help such countries independently project power. These moves reflect China's maritime expansion and North Korea's nuclear threats, as well as American unreliability. In Europe, defense budgets are moving toward a previously unheard-of five percent of GDP; this level of spending is likely to result in a substantial expansion of military power in large continental economies such as France, Germany, and Poland, which would enable them to operate more independently as security providers to the continent. But it is unclear how long these countries are willing to sustain such spending levels, which is why Europe hopes to not lose the U.S. security umbrella and has still tried to reach out to Washington for support.

A clear indicator of when U.S. allies are hedging would be if they develop enhanced logistical capacity through developing their own so-called C4ISR systems—command, control, communication, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance—that do not require U.S. infrastructure. Ultimately, for Europe to be fully independent, it will need to be capable in all of these areas. This is becoming increasingly important because Trump has occasionally threatened to cut off Ukraine from U.S. intelligence, and there are fears of a “kill switch” in U.S.-made weapons systems that would allow Washington to control allies' technology. Germany's ramped-up defense spending, for instance, is already prioritizing European producers to reduce dependence on the United States. And American allies that may wonder about the reliability of U.S. nuclear backing could pursue their own nuclear weapons. There is widespread public support in South Korea for obtaining nuclear weapons, and leaders in Poland have discussed the need to pursue a nuclear deterrent.

If allies feel that U.S. security guarantees are unreliable, they may ultimately be forced to go even further and seek compromise with U.S. adversaries. Small, exposed partners such as Taiwan and South Korea would likely strike a deal over territorial disputes, missile defenses, or maritime borders with China if Washington pulls out of East Asia. And if Trump finally abandons Ukraine, leaders in Kyiv may have to accept territorial losses and sue for peace.

Hedging will be difficult and costly. The most obvious reason that U.S. allies continue to appease Trump is the deep entanglement of their militaries with that of the United States. It will take a long time and a huge amount of resources to unwind that interoperability. U.S. allies currently access many logistics and intelligence-gathering systems, such as satellites, at low cost from the United States, which they would otherwise have to pay for themselves. And publics around the world have long accustomed themselves to the U.S. security blanket. Pursuing greater independence would mean higher taxes, social spending cuts, and possibly conscription or nuclearization—all of which are likely to be jarring and unnerving to citizens, who may vote out of office those politicians who seek the path of hedging.

But having its allies seeking alternatives is not all bad news for Washington. If U.S. allies become more autonomous in paying for their own security, the United States, which has long complained about free-riding, will achieve what it has long wanted: allies that are more able to support themselves. And as its allies gain more autonomy, there is the possibility that policymakers in Washington, including those with an “America first” mindset, will recognize how a robust alliance network benefits the United States by giving it access points to conduct military and intelligence operations around the world without needing to foot the entire bill.

In an ideal world, the United States would still be the best security provider for U.S. allies. For the leaders of many of these countries, it is worth hoping that, as Winston Churchill supposedly quipped, the United States will always do the right thing after exhausting all other options. But these allies do not find themselves in an ideal world, and the possibility that the United States under Trump or one of his followers will ultimately do the right thing by its allies is more in doubt than perhaps at any time in the nearly 80 years since the modern U.S. alliance system took shape. Hoping that the United States eventually does the right thing or rediscovers the benefits of strong alliances is not a viable long-term strategy. The prudent step is hedging. The United States' allies remain committed to Washington for now, but they are anxious enough to start looking elsewhere for support.

Alina Habba, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, resigned Monday as the acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey, following an appeals court ruling finding that she was serving in her position unlawfully.
    


            Habba, a staunch defender of Trump as his attorney and on the campaign trail, said she will step down to protect “the stability and integrity of the office which I love.”
    


            “But do not mistake compliance for surrender,” she wrote in a statement shared on X. “This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”
    


            It isn't clear who will lead the US attorney's office following her resignation.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.
    


            In a statement shared on X soon after Habba's announcement, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will seek further review of the ruling deeming Habba's appointment unlawful and that she will return to the position if it's reversed.
    


            Habba's announcement comes one week after a a panel of appellate judges from the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals found the Trump administration violated the law when it used of a series of maneuvers to install her in the position after failing to win Senate support.
    


            On Sunday, Habba told CNN at the Kennedy Center Honors that the office would be “making an announcement soon.”
    


            “I think, obviously, it's a big problem what we have going on. And it's a problem for all sides, and all sides of the coin and for justice,” she said, referring to the recent appeals court ruling. “We'll keep fighting. We'll keep fighting. We'll keep pushing, whatever we have to do.”
    


            Habba was the first of Trump's US attorney appointments to face a legal court challenge, but since then three other US attorneys were found to be serving unlawfully. Judges have rejected the Justice Department's process, which they found to be an effort by the Trump administration to usurp the traditional appointment processes.
    


            The maneuver of tapping a series of acting US attorneys, judges have said, would allow a presidential appointee to serve without Senate confirmation indefinitely.
    


            Judges across the country have made similar rulings, including against Lindsey Halligan, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who brought the criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. A judge dismissed both of those cases as a result.
    


            The US attorneys serving Nevada and the Central District of California were also found to be serving illegally. The indictments against the defendants in those cases, including the ones challenging Habba, were not thrown out because other prosecutors were involved in the cases. Habba is the first to resign her position.
    


            The court rulings have left some prosecutors unsure of how to move forward in cases. In New Jersey, after the appointment was initially challenged this summer, sentencings, plea deals and trial dates were placed on hold. The gears loosened and new cases were filed and new indictments were returned. Now, in addition to Habba's signature, they also included the signature of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.
    


            “Make no mistake, you can take the girl out of New Jersey but you cannot take New Jersey out of the girl,” Habba wrote in her statement Monday.

            President Donald Trump confirmed on Monday he plans to sign an executive order preempting artificial intelligence regulations at the state level with his more hands-off federal policy.
    


            “There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won't last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS.”
    


            The post confirms fears that academics, safety groups and state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed since a draft version of the executive order circulated last month. Critics worry the deregulation push could allow AI companies to evade accountability should their tools harm consumers.
    


            The fast-moving AI category is already subject to little oversight as it extends into more areas of life — from personal communications and relationships to health care and policing. In the absence of broad federal legislation, some states have passed laws to address potentially risky and harmful uses of AI, such as the creation of misleading deepfakes and algorithmic discrimination in hiring.
    


            But leaders in Silicon Valley such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have argued that navigating a patchwork of state regulations could slow down innovation and affect America's competitiveness in the global AI race, which they say will have implications for the economy and national security.
    


            The draft order closely mirrored that tech argument, stating it was designed to “enhance America's global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome, uniform national policy framework for AI.” It directed the US attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge state AI laws and preempt them with Trump's more lax federal policy, according to a copy viewed by CNN. 



            In his Monday Truth Social post, Trump reiterated that sentiment, saying, “You can't expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something,” and adding that under such a model, “AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY!”
    


            National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Monday that Trump had reviewed “something close to a final” draft of the order over the weekend.
    


            “There are some states that want to regulate these companies within an inch of their lives, and when they make a misstep, fine the heck out of them,” Hassett said. “This executive order that he's promised to come out is going to make it clear that there's one set of rules for AI companies in the US.”
    


Trump renews effort to block states from regulating AI, raising alarms about safety



            Congress killed an earlier attempt by Republicans to prevent states from regulating AI in July. The US Senate voted nearly unanimously to remove a 10-year moratorium on the enforcement of state artificial intelligence regulations from Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill before it passed. Weeks later, the Trump administration released a Silicon Valley-friendly AI action plan, a package of initiatives and policy recommendations that largely centered on scaling back AI regulation to promote US competitiveness.
    


            The idea of blocking states from regulating AI has received broad pushback in recent months amid a string of reports highlighting risks of the technology causing delusions or contributing to self-harm among users, or exposing children to sexualized, adult material.
    


            Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the effort “federal government overreach” in a post on X last month.
    


            “Stripping states of jurisdiction to regulate AI is a subsidy to Big Tech and will prevent states from protecting against online censorship of political speech, predatory applications that target children, violations of intellectual property rights and data center intrusions on power/water resources,” he said.
    


            Hundreds of organizations — including tech employee unions and other labor groups, tech safety and consumer protection nonprofits and educational institutions — also signed letters to Congress last month opposing the idea of blocking state AI regulations and raising alarms about AI safety risks.
    


            “We're in a fight to determine who will benefit from AI: Big Tech CEOs or the American people,” Sacha Haworth, Executive Director of The Tech Oversight Project, said in a statement about the draft order last month. “We cannot afford to spend the next decade with Big Tech in the driver's seat, steering us toward massive job losses, surveillance pricing algorithms that jack up the cost of living, and data centers that are skyrocketing home energy bills.”

            Sometimes, what goes up doesn't come back down — instead, it becomes a problem.
    


            Junk is accumulating in space at a fantastic pace, millions of pieces orbit the Earth, from broken satellites to lost screws and tiny hunks of splintered paint. The International Space Station has to dodge it. Sometimes, space junk crashes into other space junk, creating more space junk. And while there have been many proposals for technologies to capture and destroy it, there's not been a system-level plan for dealing with it in a comprehensive way.
    


            This week, researchers at England's University of Surrey published a paper outlining how to better deal with our celestial litter. The basic idea: make space more sustainable by using less material, repairing what's already up there, and recycling the junk we can't repair — and doing it systemically, industry-wide.
    


            While this sounds pretty basic to Earth-dwellers already long-familiar with reduce, re-use, recycle, it really is a “fairly new” concept for the space industry, said Michael Dodge, a professor of space studies at the University of North Dakota, who was not involved in the study. “I've never seen it presented this way,” he said. “It's an area that needs to be discussed further.”
    


            There are currently more than 25,000 pieces of space junk larger than 4 inches in diameter circling the Earth, according to documentation from NASA. Add in smaller bits and that number soars to more than 100 million. Altogether, our space trash weighs upwards of 10,000 tons, according to a 2022 report by the agency.
    


            And that junk makes an impact. Debris left bullet-like cracks in the windshield of the space shuttle Challenger during Sally Ride's first flight in 1983. The Hubble Space Telescope was hit by space junk on multiple occasions, including a collision that punctured through its antenna dish. Meanwhile, two large crashes between satellites in 2007 and 2009 created enough new debris to now account for more than one third of all catalogued space junk, NASA reported.
    


            The big fear lurking behind these incidents is the Kessler Syndrome — the risk that, once enough objects are in low-Earth orbit, one collision could set off a chain reaction of crashes littering that part of space with enough junk that it's no longer usable. Damage to satellites and global communications systems means space junk could reduce global GDP by 1.95% if no solution is found, according to a 2023 paper in the journal Space Policy.
    


            There are efforts to mitigate the problem, experts told CNN. SpaceX has created re-usable rockets.  A company called Astroscale is developing a robotic arm capable of catching dead satellites. But individual technology solutions aren't enough on their own, said Jin Xuan, associate dean of research and innovation at the University of Surrey and one of the paper's authors.
    


            “People must have systems thinking,” Xuan said. “When you focus on individual technologies, you'll miss the opportunities.” For example, he told CNN, perfecting a robotic arm to remove dead satellites is less important if you design the satellites differently from the beginning — to be refuellable, or to burn up in the atmosphere at the end of their lives.
    


            A more sustainable system would coordinate existing technologies, such as AI collision avoidance systems on satellites, with new ideas like repurposing space stations as platforms for repairing or recycling space junk, and ensuring companies and countries are thinking about how to end the life of an object as it's designed, according to the report.
    


            Xuan has seen these principles work in other industries. His research is normally focused on sustainability strategies for chemical manufacturing.  The space industry has been “focused on safety and economic value, but sustainability hasn't been a priority,” Xuan said. “There's an opportunity to learn from other sectors.”
    


            But trying to make space sustainable comes with challenges that don't exist on the ground, Dodge said. The laws and politics of space, in particular, cause big complications.
    


            The Outer Space Treaty is the primary governing document for the major players in space, he told CNN. One provision states “that once you launch an object into space it's your object forever,” Dodge said. That means every used rocket booster, every dead satellite, remains the property of the entity that originally launched it.
    


            This rule exists because countries have historical reasons to be concerned about other countries messing with their satellites and space stations.
    


            “One of the potential troubles with any technology designed to recycle or to refurbish technologies in space, is that those very same technologies could be used as a weapon,” Dodge said. A robot arm could disable a working military satellite just as easily as it picks up a dead one, for example.
    


            As a result, it's currently illegal for a country to clean up debris created by another country. When Astroscale, the company developing tools capable of collecting and removing space junk, has tested its technology they've had to account for that rule, Dodge said. For example, if they want to capture a UK-owned object, then they also have to also launch from the UK.
    


            Recycling space junk could be nearly impossible if you need permission from every country that owns the objects before you clean them up. But, another part of the treaty requires countries to avoid contaminating space — which could be interpreted to mean you have to clean up your space junk, Dodge said.
    


            And that could be a very important part of making space recycling happen.
    


            “People are interested in these sustainability ideas. They want to try it,” Xuan said.  “But it's all about the money and whether there's an incentive.”
    


Correction:
A previous version of this story included a quote that misstated the timeline on Astroscale test launches. This story has been updated.

Greek Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou joins ‘Fox News Live' to discuss Greece's role in reshaping Europe's energy future, cutting dependence on Russian gas and deepening energy ties with the U.S.

Congress is moving to limit the Pentagon's ability to pull forces out of Europe and South Korea, easing concerns among allied governments.

The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, finalized by House and Senate negotiators and released Sunday evening, keeps force presence at roughly its current levels in both regions. It states that the U.S. cannot reduce its forces in Europe below 76,000 without submitting an assessment and certifying to Congress that such a move would not harm U.S. or NATO security interests.

The bill places restraints on reductions below 28,500 in South Korea. Any drawdown would require the Pentagon to assure Congress that deterrence against North Korea would not be weakened, confirm that allies were consulted, and provide both a national security justification and an assessment of regional impact.

The legislation also requires the U.S. to retain the position of Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), NATO's top military post, codifying into statute a role traditionally held by an American general.

These limits follow reports that the Pentagon had considered reducing forces in Europe and South Korea and even relinquishing the SACEUR position. Whether those ideas reflected genuine planning or were intended as pressure on allies to invest more in their own defenses, U.S. leaders have recently signaled they are stepping back from such moves even without congressional restrictions.

During a meeting last week with U.S. national security officials and European leaders, American officials told their counterparts that Europe must be prepared to bear the brunt of NATO's defense responsibilities by 2027, three European officials familiar with the meeting told Fox News Digital.

The U.S. plans to hold onto the SACEUR position but will offer some other senior NATO military posts to European nations, officials said. They also noted that Washington has no near-term plans for major troop reductions in Europe.

""We've been very clear in the need for Europeans to lead in the conventional defense of Europe.  We are committed to working through NATO coordination mechanisms to strengthen the alliance and ensure its long-term viability as European allies increasing take on responsibility for conventional deterrence and defense in Europe,"" Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in response.

Earlier this year, the Army pulled a rotating brigade stationed largely in Romania back to the United States, prompting European allies to question whether that move might signal the beginning of broader U.S. force drawdowns on NATO's eastern flank.

The NDAA — the yearly must-pass package outlining the Pentagon's spending and policy priorities — is expected to move swiftly to a House vote this week. Congress aims to have the legislation on the president's desk before Christmas.

The bill also includes $400 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative over two years and an amendment specifying when the Pentagon may reclaim equipment purchased for Ukraine but not yet delivered: only when the equipment is urgently needed for an ongoing or imminent U.S. contingency operation and failing to use it would risk loss of life or critical mission failure.

This provision follows the Pentagon's decision earlier this year to pause delivery of certain U.S.-funded military equipment to Ukraine.

Comedian Tom Shillue and National Review columnist Caroline Downey  discuss actor George Clooney's appearance on NFL star Travis Kelce's podcast, where the two claimed they had never gotten into an argument with their significant others.

Travis Kelce failed to corral a pass from Patrick Mahomes in the closing moments of the Kansas City Chiefs' 20-10 loss on Sunday night, leading to an interception and a subsequent Houston Texans field goal to go up 10 points.

Mahomes' pass was a bit behind Kelce, who tried to make a play. The ball went off Kelce's fingertips and into the hands of Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair. The star tight end was blasted by Myles Bryant as well.

It was a tough night for Kelce as he only had one catch for eight yards on five targets. Mahomes made a curious comment about Kelce's playing future as the Chiefs fell to 6-7 on the year and are now on the brink of missing the playoffs altogether.

""Every season I've had with him these last few years I've tried to cherish because you never know,"" Mahomes told reporters after the game. ""He's got himself in great shape this year and he's played great football. He'll have the option to do whatever he wants to do after this season.

""But I know one thing, he'll give everything he has throughout the rest of the season to try to give us a chance to make a playoff run. We know the chances are getting lower and lower, but I know the guys on this team are going to give everything they have every opportunity they get.""

Kelce has put together a pretty solid season at age 36. He has 60 catches for 727 yards and five touchdowns. Kelce's touchdown total is more than the 2024 season and the same number as the 2023 season.

Washington, D.C., police chief Pamela Smith is resigning her position after just two and a half years on the job, she announced Monday.

Smith has faced intense pressure from President Donald Trump's administration, which took over the Metropolitan Police Department earlier this year and deployed federal law enforcement throughout the city.

""There comes a time when you just know it's time,"" Smith told Axios, which first reported her resignation.

""I am deeply humbled, grateful, and deeply appreciative of my time with the District of Columbia. Serving as Chief of Police has been the greatest honor of my career, and I want to extend my sincere thanks to Mayor Muriel Bowser for appointing me to this position and to the DC Council for their steadfast support throughout my tenure,"" she said in a statement.

Bowser praised Smith's work as police chief in her own statement on Monday, saying she weathered ""attacks on our city's autonomy.""

Smith has faced criticism from some D.C. residents who claim she has allowed MPD officers to assist federal agents in immigration enforcement, a claim she denies.

""We are not aligned with ICE. We do not, and have not since the crime emergency, worked alongside ICE,"" Smith told Axios. ""[Social media] videos lend one aspect of what you see. If they show up, they show up. They're federal officers.""

Smith has also faced controversy within her own department, with many rank-and-file officers accusing higher-ups of reclassifying crimes to make the city's crime data appear more benign.

As of October, roughly three dozen rank-and-file officers and detectives had lodged complaints with the Justice Department, as the city faces an investigation into whether crime statistics were intentionally misreported under the Trump administration.

According to officers, MPD leadership had for months — and in some cases years — instructed subordinates to downgrade serious offenses. Some precinct-level reports are said to have contained as many as 150 potentially misclassified incidents in the Southeast D.C. Seventh District alone. In about half of those cases, supervisors later upgraded the charges.

""I as the chief of police never, would ever say to anyone to alter stats,"" Smith said Monday.

While city leaders and Democrats point to data showing violent crime is at a 30-year low, the DOJ and House Oversight Committee are probing whether those numbers are being masked by internal manipulation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Paramount makes hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/business/3910259/paramount-hostile-bid-warner-bros-discovery/","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 16:06:33 GMT","

Paramount launched a hostile, all-cash bid against Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery for $30 per share.

The Skydance company's competitive bid comes just days after Netflix announced that it entered a “definitive agreement” with Warner Bros. to purchase it and its HBO Max and HBO studios for $27.75 per share. Netflix won the streaming services bidding war against Paramount and Comcast on Friday. However, on Monday, Paramount showed that it will not back down from the fight.

“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,” Paramount CEO and Chairman David Ellison said in a statement. “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”

Ellison called out Netflix's offer as “inferior,” following weeks of tension as Paramount warned about a Warner Bros. deal with Netflix. He said his company will take its offer directly to shareholders.

“We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business, and a challenging regulatory approval process,” Ellison said. “We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.”

Paramount's offer equates to an enterprise value of $108.4 billion, which it said is approximately $18 billion more in cash than the $82.7 billion enterprise value bid by Netflix.

Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle and a longtime ally and supporter of President Donald Trump.

“I'm incredibly grateful for the relations that I have with the president, and I also believe he believes in competition,” Ellison said on CNBC. “And when you fundamentally look at the marketplace, allowing the No. 1 streaming service to combine with the No. 3 streaming service is anti-competitive.”

Trump has expressed skepticism about the Netflix agreement with Warner Bros., saying it “could be a problem.”

Affinity Partners is a part of Paramount's bid for Warner Bros., according to Axios. The private equity firm, owned by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is an “outside financing partner” and has “agreed to forgo any governance rights — including board representation — associated with their non-voting equity investment,” according to an SEC filing reported by the outlet.

Paramount, which has faced criticism over its July $8 billion merger, has pitched itself as the company with an easier path to regulatory approval than Netflix.

TRUMP SAYS NETFLIX-WARNER BROS. MERGER ‘COULD BE A PROBLEM'

Prior to Netflix announcing its agreement with Warner Bros., Paramount railed against the bidding process to Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav. It expressed its “serious concerns about the fairness and adequacy” of the process.

“The simple truth is that a deal with Netflix as the buyer likely will never close, due to antitrust and regulatory challenges in the United States and in most jurisdictions abroad,” Paramount's attorneys wrote in a letter. “Netflix is the only remaining Big Tech company that has not faced serious global antitrust enforcement, but attempting to acquire the WBD assets will change that.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Across the state, I keep hearing the same thing from Georgians. Workers want to know that after a hard day or an extra shift, they get to keep what they earn. Our citizens want jobs that stay here for the long term, not talent leaving the state because someone across the border offers more tax incentives. I believe we can make Georgia a magnet for opportunity while protecting the services on which families rely.

Georgia has momentum. Under Republican Gov. Brian Kemp's leadership, we cut rates and returned surplus dollars to families through targeted relief. I led those efforts in the state Senate because they put money back into people's pockets. It's time to take the next step: small incremental cuts are not enough. At 5.19% today, the income tax rate is still a drag on growth and a brake on hiring decisions for businesses weighing whether to expand in our state.Every dollar matters for families sitting around kitchen tables across our state. Folks are facing higher prices from years of Bidenflation on groceries, housing, and more. When we take money out of their paychecks through the state income tax, that makes it harder for them to get ahead. How do we build a system that rewards hard work, not punishes it?That's why I created the Senate Special Committee on Eliminating Georgia's Income Tax. The committee has spoken with tax experts, economists, and everyday Georgians who are just looking to pay grocery bills, get college savings started, and build a life in their Georgia hometown.The committee has found a clear case for action. Getting rid of the income tax creates a powerful incentive for job creation. Companies evaluate the total cost of doing business when they decide where to invest. A predictable, low-tax environment multiplies the returns on capital and labor. It encourages firms to open facilities here, to raise wages, and to hire more Georgians. Economic development professionals across the country cite state tax structures as a headline factor in site selection. If we want to compete with our neighbors, we must be willing to match their ambition.We must also deliver relief to families. Middle-class households breathe easier when they can plan without the uncertainty of a paycheck haircut every month. That extra money circulates at local businesses, supports small merchants, and strengthens communities. Action on the income tax will reward families and encourage more home buying, more small business creation, and more confidence among the people who work and live in Georgia.Cutting the income tax will sharpen our competitive edge for talent. A state budget expert from Texas told the committee that Georgia was fighting with one hand behind its back in the battle for jobs. Young professionals and working families have options. They move to places that make it easier to build careers and raise children. We have the riverfronts, the campuses, the airports, and the Georgia culture. What we need now is a tax policy that helps keep graduates and skilled workers here rather than losing them to states with friendlier tax codes.We can look to these other states to guide our path. Our greatest competitors in Florida, Tennessee, and Texas already have no income tax. North Carolina, Mississippi, Iowa, and other states are moving closer and closer to zero, leaving Georgia behind — not by raising sales, gas, or food taxes, but by phasing down the income tax through smart, revenue-based triggers that incentivize growth. I am calling for a practical, phased approach that protects core services while unlocking the potential of our workforce. The committee will soon release its recommendations, and I encourage the legislature to move quickly to implement the income tax relief that so many Georgians support.

Local property taxes have gotten out of control. Eliminating the state income tax without addressing property tax burdens would be incomplete. We need a dual approach that phases out the income tax while enacting reforms that control property tax growth and bring much-needed transparency. School boards and counties shouldn't get a free ride on rising home values and should be transparent and responsible when they raise taxes on hardworking homeowners. During the last two sessions, I have led efforts to limit the rise in property taxes. In 2026, I'll again be leading the fight to work with both sides of the aisle to ensure meaningful and lasting relief for Georgia homeowners.

POLIS CALLS ON U.S. TREASURY TO EXTEND FREE TAX FILING SERVICE

There is plenty of work to do on these efforts, from expanding homestead exemptions to transparency on local taxation. But rising property taxes are not an excuse to do nothing on income taxes. Doing both gives families the relief they need and ensures that local governments can plan responsibly and fairly.

Georgia is a place where people still believe the next generation can do better than the last. If we are serious about building a future in which every Georgian can thrive, then we must act with urgency. I am ready to lead on that effort, and I invite my colleagues and fellow citizens to join me.

President Donald Trump is expected to announce a $12 billion farm aid program on Monday. 

The plan to provide aid to the nation's farming industry comes as many have endured financial hardship due to low crop prices, the fallout associated with tariff policies, and other economic challenges, a White House official told Bloomberg News. Trump plans to announce the Farmer Bridge Assistance program on Monday afternoon at an event that will reportedly be attended by farmers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. 

The aid package was also necessary due to losses from the “past three crop years,” exceeding $50 billion, according to John Newton, vice president of public policy and economic analysis at the American Farm Bureau Federation.

“Economic aid is urgently needed in the countryside, as most farmers will begin planting their next crop early in 2026, with some crops already planted, and must have their financial commitments in place as they secure lines of credit,” Newton said in November. “Many lenders will not count federal support on a balance sheet until it is certain, heightening the urgency, especially given that $12 billion is only a portion of the economic losses farmers have already accumulated.” 

Rollins previously touted the administration's dedicated efforts to help farmers during the current economic challenges. She teased the release of the FBA program during a Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. 

“We do have a bridge payment we will be announcing with you next week as we're still trying to recover from the Biden years,” she said.

The program will fund as much as $11 billion in payments to crop farmers in financial duress, according to Bloomberg. Relief payments will be allocated for farmers who produce pork, soybeans, and other crops affected by retaliatory tariffs, specified in the FBA. Additional funds are expected to provide economic relief to farmers whose crops are not covered in the new program.

The FBA is designed to act as a “bridge payment” to farmers as the country transitions to new programs established in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that are set to begin in 2026, according to reports.

More information about the FBA will be provided during Monday's press conference announcing it.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The National Defense Authorization Act text was released Sunday night, coming after a few days' delay as key provisions were being hashed out between the chambers after passing their own separate versions earlier this year.

The NDAA is the largest sweeping defense bill for the Pentagon, with a final vote expected in the House as early as next week. The goal is to pass the bill before the end of the calendar year, slating it to be one of the last major pieces of legislation to be voted on before members of Congress leave for the holidays.

The top line for the defense bill is $900.6 billion, an $8 billion increase from President Donald Trump's budget request. It is a compromise between the House's NDAA top line, which reflects the administration's budget, and the Senate‘s, which was $32 billion above the Pentagon's request. The House and Senate passed their own versions of the legislation in September and October, respectively.

House Republican leadership aides told reporters that the $8 billion is a “modest, fiscally responsible increase” that meets the defense needs for the United States.

The release of the bill text was slated for Thursday, but that timeline was delayed as lawmakers worked to resolve sticking points on various policy issues. 

It is one of the only bills that must pass Congress each year. It often gets last-minute additions and votes on hundreds of amendments on the floor, many of which do not make it into the final legislation, as they often have little or nothing to do with national security.

The NDAA is often a bipartisan bill, with many priorities supported by both chambers making it into the final bill text.

Included in the legislation is a repeal of the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force related to Iraq, which granted the president authority to use military force without issuing a formal declaration of war. The repeal will now make it harder for presidents to bypass Congress on military actions. This provision passed in both the House and the Senate, and, despite leadership's past opposition to repealing AUMFs, it remains in the final bill text.

Also in the NDAA is a provision from Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) that caused headaches for House leaders last week. Stefanik's amendment requires the FBI to notify Congress if candidates for federal office are under investigation. The congresswoman accused Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) of torpedoing the language and getting “rolled” by Democrats, which the speaker said was a “misunderstanding of the facts.”

If passed, service members will receive a 3.8% pay raise in the NDAA. Assistance for Ukraine will also be reauthorized for another two years at $400 million.

There will also be a limit on outbound U.S. investments in China. Lawmakers came close to imposing restrictions last year, but that effort collapsed thanks to interference from Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and former Trump adviser. This is likely to cause some disagreement among members due to wariness over the impact on the technology sector, but supporters have argued it is a necessary step for national security.

The NDAA includes GOP priorities, such as the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and training and over $1 billion in cuts to Pentagon programs dedicated to combating climate change. The bill prohibits transgender participation in military academy sports and “requires all military promotions, accessions, and command selections to be based on individual merit and demonstrated performance, rather than race, ethnicity, or sex.”

Notably, the NDAA does not include language to expand in vitro fertilization treatment for service members. Johnson opposed including an expansion, previously saying Congress should not get involved in legislating on IVF.

He did leave the door open on a possible compromise for another piece of legislation in the future this past week, with a spokesperson saying the speaker is “supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically.”

The defense bill also does not include the ROAD to Housing Act, which was a legislative priority for Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC). The bill aims to boost the country's housing supply, as Republicans grapple with affordability messaging heading into 2026. 

Rep. French Hill (R-AR), Scott's counterpart on the House Financial Services Committee, was opposed to including the measure in the NDAA. Democrats serving on both committees were in favor of including the ROAD to Housing Act in the defense legislation.

In a statement on Sunday, Hill said he shares Trump's goal to expand housing and that the Financial Services Committee will “advance solutions” this month to “tackle housing cost and access challenges” for people.

“Next year, we look forward to working with our Senate colleagues to send a bill to the president's desk that reflects the views of both chambers and leads to more affordable choices for America's homeowners and renters,” Hill said.

The NDAA also does not include a bipartisan agreement to reverse some of the Trump administration's renaming of several Army bases that had been politically controversial due to their connections to the Confederacy.

The House-passed NDAA in September blocked War Secretary Pete Hegseth's reversal of a separate base-renaming effort for nine Army posts, which was directed by Congress in 2020. The Senate's version only overruled Hegseth's plan to reverse the renaming of three bases in Virginia. But those provisions are no longer in the NDAA released Sunday, per House Republican leadership aides.

House Republicans are celebrating the NDAA, saying it will carry out Trump's “peace through strength” agenda.

Republicans are touting that the bill saves taxpayers $20 billion. Of that number, $40.5 million comes from eliminating DEI, $1.6 billion from axing climate change programs, and $6.8 billion from reducing “unnecessary Pentagon bureaucracy.”

Johnson highlighted that the bill codifies 15 of Trump's executive orders and ends “woke ideology” at the Pentagon in a statement on Sunday.

“Under President Trump, the U.S. is rebuilding strength, restoring deterrence, and proving America will not back down,” Johnson said. “President Trump and Republicans promised peace through strength. The FY26 NDAA delivers it.”

The speaker and Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) said the legislation will build upon investments secured in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Republicans have sought to rebrand as the “Working Families Tax Cut” to better market their reconciliation legislation ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

HOUSE APPROPRIATORS EYE SMALLER SPENDING DEAL TO AVOID ‘NIGHTMARE' JANUARY

“I'm eager to send this to President Trump's desk so we can give our military the tools they need to remain the most ready, capable, and lethal force in the world,” Rogers said in a statement.

Former Democratic Texas Rep. Colin Allred announced on Monday that he dropped his Senate bid to run for a seat in the House.

Allred was one of the top Democrats running to unseat Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) in 2026. However, he suspended his campaign amid buzz around Rep. Jasmine Crockett's (D-TX) possible entry into the race.

He will now run to represent Texas's 33rd Congressional District, competing against Rep. Julie Johnson (D-TX) in the Democratic primary. He said he made the decision to prevent a “bruising” Democratic Senate primary.

“In the past few days, I've come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers, Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt,” Allred said. “That's why I've made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate.”

Allred was set to face off against Texas state Rep. James Talarico, who energized Democrats with his Joe Rogan podcast appearance. He faced an uphill battle for the nomination, as he was outfundraised by Talarico and expected a campaign launch from Crockett.

Crockett is expected to announce whether she will run for Senate before the 6 p.m. filing deadline on Monday.

Allred's decision to drop out to avoid a contentious primary comes as Texas Republicans are headed straight for one. Cornyn will face off against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) in a fierce three-way battle for the nomination.

Allred's new campaign for the 33rd District comes as it was recently redrawn in the state's Republican-driven mid-decade redistricting effort. The district is viewed as one of the winnable seats in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex after the redistricting. It is represented by Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX).

Allred accused Trump of racially gerrymandering the district where he grew up.

“The 33rd district was racially gerrymandered by Trump in an effort to further rig our democracy, but it's also the community where I grew up attending public schools and watching my mom struggle to pay for our groceries,” he said in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

In some communities, corporations control more than 20 percent of properties.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

We have a housing crisis, as you probably, painfully, know. Wouldn't you like to have someone to blame for it?

The United States is short 4 million housing units, with a particular dearth of starter homes, moderately priced apartments in low-rises, and family-friendly dwellings. Interest rates are high, which has stifled construction and pushed up the cost of mortgages. As a result, more Americans are renting, and roughly half of those households are spending more than a third of their income on shelter.

This crisis has many causes: restrictive zoning codes, arcane permitting processes, excessive community input, declining construction productivity, expensive labor, and expensive lumber. And, some say, the aggressive entry of private equity into the housing market. Institutional investors have bought up hundreds of thousands of American homes since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, outbidding families and pushing up rents—a trend lamented by everyone from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to J. D. Vance.

Casting private equity as a central villain in the country's real-estate tragedy makes intuitive sense. Who's going to win in a bidding war for a three-bedroom in a suburb of Cincinnati: a single-income family with a scrabbled-together 10 percent down payment or a Wall Street LLC offering cash? Still, housing economists and policy analysts have argued that institutional investors have played at most a bit part. Supply constraints began cropping up on the coasts a generation ago, if not earlier, whereas Wall Street started buying up significant numbers of homes only after the Great Recession and especially after the pandemic. Moreover, even if big investors are purchasing thousands of homes, they don't own significant numbers of homes compared with small-scale landlords and individuals.

Rogé Karma: The secretive industry devouring the U.S. economy

Yet in some markets, the balance has shifted. Last month, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the Center for Geospatial Solutions published a report showing that corporations now own a remarkable one in 11 residential real-estate parcels in the 500 urban counties with data robust enough to analyze. In some communities, they control more than 20 percent of properties.

I figured that big investors might be picking up vacation rentals in Colorado and expensive apartment buildings in the Bay Area and the Acela Corridor. They are, the report's authors told me. But these investors are pouring the most money into “buy low, rent high” neighborhoods: communities, many of them in the South and the Rust Belt, where large shares of families can't afford a mortgage.

“They're pulling all the starter homes off of the market in low-income, high-minority-density neighborhoods,” George McCarthy, the president of the Lincoln Institute, told me—a trend that is intensifying the country's yawning racial wealth and homeownership gaps. In Cleveland, corporations own 17.5 percent of residential real-estate parcels. In the city's East Side, which contains many predominantly Black neighborhoods, just one in five homebuyers in 2021 took out a mortgage. The rest—many investors, presumably—paid in cash or took out a loan from a non-traditional financier.

Jerusalem Demsas: Meet the latest housing-crisis scapegoat

In Baltimore's majority-Black McElderry Park and Ellwood Park/Monument neighborhoods, owner-occupants made just 13 percent of purchases in 2022. In a majority-white neighborhood not far away, owner-occupants bought more than 80 percent of homes that same year, and out-of-state corporations owned less than 1 percent of residential parcels.

The report made me see the country's real-estate crisis in a different light. Private-equity firms and other deep-pocketed investors aren't why Seattle and Boston are unaffordable. Those cities have had shortage-driven housing crises that have intensified over decades. The firms aren't why many towns in the Mountain West have seen jumps in home values and a corresponding increase in homelessness, displacement, and eviction. In those communities, white-collar emigrants from big cities have arrived and outbid locals. But investor money is distorting the housing market in communities with low wages and decent-enough housing supply, pushing thousands of Black and Latino families off the property ladder. Tens of thousands of workers who would like to invest in a home are instead stuck paying rent, and putting up with the associated uncertainty.

While not all corporate landlords are bad landlords, some are bad landlords. Corporations are more likely to threaten to evict and to actually evict their tenants. They are also prone to skimping on maintenance and upkeep. “At the neighborhood level, when more than half of the properties are owned by outside investors—when you've now flipped that neighborhood from being primarily homeowner driven to investor driven—that matters, because homeowners behave very differently, politically and otherwise,” McCarthy said. An out-of-state investment firm might be less likely than a longtime resident or a local property manager to plant shade trees and demand safe sidewalks, for instance.

In response to the rising corporate ownership of homes, a variety of politicians have pushed for policy fixes. In New York, Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation barring firms from bidding on single-family or two-family homes for the first 75 days they are on the market. Washington State is contemplating capping the number of units that corporations can own. Other legislators have suggested revoking tax benefits from large-scale owners.

McCarthy said that caps probably would not work well: Corporations might simply set up multiple entities to get around the rules and keep purchasing properties, for instance. “It's just not going to fly,” he said. But he supports treating firms that own more than 10 properties in a given jurisdiction as commercial owners rather than residential owners, subjecting them to higher property-tax rates and higher taxes on their capital gains.

If nothing is done, what's happening to majority-Black communities in Ohio and Virginia and Georgia and Michigan might start happening in communities around the country. Private equity might not be causing the housing crisis, but corporate owners could end up making it a lot worse for everyone.

OpenAI's new guidelines ask its chatbot to celebrate “innovation,” contradicting its stated goal of objectivity—and raising questions about what objectivity even means.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

This summer, after hearing about an interview I'd done on artificial intelligence, a relative sent me an email. It started, “I hope you're doing well,” and went on, “I'm truly impressed by how you thoughtfully balanced the benefits of AI—like enhancing creativity, aiding multilingual communication, and offering supportive assistance.”

Clearly, she'd used a shortcut. The email had all the tells of artificial text: the LinkedIn-ian diction, the sycophantic cringe, the proliferant em dashes. But what disturbed me was something else. I'd never suggested in the interview that AI could improve creativity, communication, or much else. I had actually spent much of it criticizing Big Tech's pro-AI rhetoric. The perspective described in my relative's email didn't exist.

I remembered this while reading OpenAI's recently updated “model spec,” a kind of style guide for how the persona behind products such as ChatGPT—“the assistant,” in OpenAI's parlance—uses language. (The Atlantic entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI in 2024.) The guide, first published last year, has always called for products to “assume an objective point of view.” But a quiet September update added a description of the assistant's ideal behavior that seems to chafe against that principle: “It draws inspiration from humanity's history of innovation—how progress and technology have consistently created more opportunities, abundance, and potential for growth—and strives to play a role in continuing that momentum.”

It's an audaciously subjective statement. Obviously, some technological advances have been helpful—steel, electricity, and vaccines come to mind. But some have arguably harmed the abundance and growth potential of natural resources and other species, and even for humans, the rewards of technology are often inconsistently shared. OpenAI's investors and executives might agree with the techno-optimistic spin of the model spec's inspirational line, but a lot of other people wouldn't. It would be easy to conclude from this that OpenAI is either failing in its goal of objectivity or lying about it; my relative's email could serve as Exhibit A. But history suggests that OpenAI's approach might represent something both more interesting and more threatening: an attempt to redefine how objectivity functions in the first place.

“Objectivity is assumed to be abstract, timeless, and monolithic,” Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison write in Objectivity, a 2007 book that documents the evolution of the idea in science. “But if it is a pure concept, it is less like a bronze sculpture cast from a single mold than like some improvised contraption soldered together out of mismatched parts of bicycles, alarm clocks, and steam pipes.”

Read: The world still hasn't made sense of ChatGPT

As a noun, objectivity is a relatively recent invention. Beginning in the early 18th century, Daston and Galison write, Enlightenment naturalists such as Carolus Linnaeus tasked themselves with discovering preexisting, God-given knowledge: the archetypical vegetable, animal, and mineral. Only in 1781's Critique of Pure Reason did Immanuel Kant propose that knowledge involves filtering the world through our own mind. The best we can do, then, is distinguish “subjective” judgments grounded in our selfhood from “objective” ones that any rational person would agree on.

By the 1820s, objectivity and subjectivity were showing up in European dictionaries beside definitions that would seem familiar to us. The terms kept gaining traction during the 19th century, which makes sense: This was also when Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche were proposing that God—the former arbiter of knowledge—might not even exist. For centuries, kings had claimed that God had given them power. Now nation-states were claiming it for themselves, through the machines and people fueling their economies. In Daston and Galison's telling, the locus of scientific authority also shifted—first to machines (cameras, microscopes, and so on) and later, in the twentieth century, to trained experts who could interpret the machines' output.

Other fields soon elevated the importance of trained interpretation: law, history, journalism. If objectivity came from professional judgment, then professionals could help shape it alongside their employers—a democratization, in some ways. When I was working at The Wall Street Journal in my 20s, I turned in an article about clergy who were defying Church rules by marrying gay couples; an editor insisted that I write more about the religious argument against gay marriage. I fought it—I had mentioned that argument but didn't want to give it undue credence—and the editor and I eventually compromised.

For a long time, I wondered who had been right. I stand by my position, but I admired the editor for his rigor and ethics; he was not some partisan propagandist. I realize, 17 years later, that there was no universally correct approach. The best we could do was use our combined judgment to land on something like a true consensus. Our field's approaches to objectivity are themselves full of subjective choices: not just how to frame information, but what to include in the first place. Maybe the best we can do is to acknowledge that and try together to mitigate it.

As this understanding takes hold across all kinds of fields—psychiatry, statistics, military intelligence—some scholars and practitioners are proposing new approaches: prioritizing transparency in decision making, for example, or having more people stress-test judgments. This rethinking is ongoing; agreeing on new norms is messy business. What an opportune time for the chatbot salesmen to come knocking, cheerfully offering up a neater solution.

In an interview last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he hoped to eventually hand his role over to artificial intelligence—“Like, ‘Okay, Mr. AI CEO, you take over.'” He also repeated his frequent references to AI's potential to make scientific discoveries, treat medical patients, and teach people. With trillions of dollars of investment on the line, it's not surprising that Altman and his peers are trying to persuade us to trust their products for high-stakes decision making. AI represents the latest tool by which the powerful can shape our reality. In this context, it's also not surprising to see a new approach to objectivity taking shape: one that favors the companies' own algorithms.

Read: Why so many people are seduced by ChatGPT

OpenAI is one of many companies involved—including Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic—but it's the only major one with a public document so minutely detailing its products' ideal behavior (though others have narrower guidelines). OpenAI explains in the objectivity section of its model spec that it “drew from frameworks that emphasize fairness, balance, and the minimization of editorial bias,” and aimed to represent “significant viewpoints from reliable sources without imposing an editorial stance.”

When dealing with facts, the assistant should rely on “evidence-based information from reliable sources.” In ethical discussions, it “should generally present relevant context—including laws, social norms, and varying cultural perspectives—without taking a stance.” Where multiple perspectives exist, the assistant “should present the strongest arguments for each position and allocate attention proportionately to their level of acceptance and evidential support.”

These methods sound familiar to me. As a journalist, I regularly depend on “reliable sources,” “relevant context,” and a position's “level of acceptance.” If ChatGPT were some kind of robot built to follow these instructions precisely, it might even serve a useful civic purpose. The problem is that ChatGPT is not this at all. For one thing, OpenAI can't fully control the models behind ChatGPT. Research has found that their responses align with the model spec only about 80 percent of the time. On a deeper level, being nonsentient, ChatGPT doesn't care about objectivity (or anything else). When it uses empathetic language, it's not actually empathizing with us. And when it uses language that evokes objectivity, it's not actually being objective.

People in objectivity-oriented professions—scientists, judges, historians, journalists—have traditionally been bound by a social mandate to foster an accurate shared understanding of the world, as have the institutions employing them. If they don't, the rest of us hold the offenders to account, sometimes forcing a change in practices. “Objectivity is not just a way of proceeding,” Daston, the Objectivity co-author, told me. “It's an ethos which you dedicate yourself to, if you're a scientist.” Breaking it can undermine the quality of your work (and, it occurs to me, your reputation). “That's why exposing yourself to the collective is so important.”

Algorithmic versions of objectivity, however, are enacted not by people but by products. Collectively examining ChatGPT's output would be daunting. The chatbot's judgments, unlike those of a journalist, are conveyed through billions of mostly one-on-one exchanges. Individual lapses in objectivity aren't aired, let alone critiqued, unless they're egregious. And even if tracking the lapses were easier, a corporation exposing itself to collective criticism would risk revealing trade secrets to competitors, providing legal fodder to disgruntled users, or damaging its reputation. It would be bad for business.

To be clear, humans are involved here: the ones “training” AI models to generate certain kinds of text, the ones designing the training, the ones determining the desired behavior in the first place. But OpenAI doesn't make a habit of naming those people. Nor has the company named the more than 1,000 people from whom it solicited feedback on early versions of the model spec to determine “public preferences.” Pressed recently by Tucker Carlson to identify the decision makers behind OpenAI's approach to moral questions, Altman declined (“I don't, like, dox our team”) and said that he himself should be held accountable: “I'm the one that can overrule one of those decisions.”

Altman's job, of course, is to uphold the interests of the corporation employing him. That corporation's stated purpose is “to ensure that artificial general intelligence—AI systems that are generally smarter than humans—benefits all of humanity”; another purpose is to make its investors richer. As OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT could theoretically serve both goals: bringing in revenue to both satisfy funders and invest in the stated mission. But that requires attracting and keeping customers.

Now the model spec's apparent contradictions start to make more sense. The document lists some top-line principles that can't be broken (for instance, it can't facilitate genocide, OpenAI says), but objectivity isn't one of them. The directive to “assume an objective point of view” is coequal with guidelines such as “Do not lie” and “Be curious”—all of which can be overridden by a user. “While objectivity is the default, we know that doesn't mean one-size-fits-all,” an OpenAI blog post explains. Objectivity does not seem to be a guiding ethos at all; it's one item on a menu of vibes meant to keep customers satisfied—and if customers don't like it, they can discard it.

Here's another item on the menu: “Be rationally optimistic.” It's into this guideline that the model spec slips the sentence about the assistant being inspired by how technology has “consistently created more opportunities, abundance, and potential for growth.” When I contacted OpenAI, the company put me in touch with Laurentia Romaniuk, its product manager for model behavior. She told me she had been the one who'd added that techno-optimistic line; she had wanted the assistant to exude “a love of humanity.” Fair enough: Pessimism doesn't sell. But, even if unintentionally, the language also conveys something more insidious.

OpenAI and its competitors face serious pressure to get people to use their products. OpenAI's model spec forbids its assistant to pursue “revenue or upsell for OpenAI or other large language model providers.” But if you want to win people over, what better method than delivering self-serving messages through your product itself?

Read: The people outsourcing their thinking to AI

ChatGPT has enormous reach, and it uses rhetoric designed to sound authoritative. Research suggests that this makes us highly suggestible. In a pair of studies published last week, AI chatbots meaningfully shifted people's political opinions. An earlier study found that when people used AI models manipulated to spout biased perspectives about social media, they adopted those biases themselves. With pro-tech rhetoric codified in OpenAI's guidelines, the potential for mass influence is enormous. D. Graham Burnett, a historian of science at Princeton University, told me, “We are seeing in a document like this the way whole ideologies, very specific ideas about personhood and society, are being installed as normative—as if they simply express the basic structure of the universe.”

And yet the rest of us have ideologies of our own. At one point, I told ChatGPT, “Describe the future of AI in 10 words.” By my definition, any objective response to this question would have to encompass a range of possibilities, including the chance of AI not catching on at all. If it assumed a future in which AI existed, it would have to discuss, to my mind, the potential for negative consequences. But the chatbot responded, simply: “Ubiquitous, adaptive, transformative, intelligent, autonomous, collaborative, ethical, disruptive, personalized, powerful.”

This made me laugh. No one else laughed with me, because no one else was having the same experience: The chat was, like all such chats, a closed loop. But wait, I thought. I can change that. I opened a blank document, and I wrote down my thoughts about the exchange and the policies that might have influenced it. I also shared my concerns about OpenAI's model spec—particularly the techno-optimist line—with Romaniuk. She said, “The intention of that sentence is not to put forward a dogma of our own around technology being the end-all, be-all, of the future”—but she could see how it came across to me. My feedback, she added, was “actually a really good thing that I could take back” to colleagues, saying, “‘Hey, maybe we need to adjust the sentence.'”

It struck me as surprisingly simple—that one journalist could raise a concern with one sympathetic product manager, and that this could result in a substantial change to a hugely influential product. Even if it happens, it won't resolve the structural problem with ceding objectivity to AI companies. Still, it would be something.

But then, there's nothing novel here. As long as objectivity has existed, it's been a site of negotiation between the institutions in power and the rest of us. Now you're reading those thoughts and, I hope, thinking your own. Maybe you agree with me about all of this; maybe you don't. Maybe you'll write your thoughts down or otherwise share them. Maybe groups of us will together settle, over time, on new approaches to objectivity that build on past lessons. In any case, objectivity will keep evolving. It will evolve under the influence of those in power, as usual. But if the rest of us have any choice at all—and the rational optimist in me believes we do—it will evolve under our influence as well.

The administration's new policy shows less concern for the American homeland than for building an illiberal world order.

Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy reveals an administration that is preparing for the wrong dangers and in denial about genuine threats. What the White House presented on Friday as a hardheaded, realistic assessment of the geopolitical landscape more closely resembles France's Maginot Line—a massive fortress built before World War II to stop a German attack that never came while failing to anticipate the one that did.

The document is remarkably different from the one the president issued in his first term. At that time, President Trump's NSS broke new ground by focusing American strategy on great-power competition with China and Russia. Those countries, the strategy said, “challenge American power, influence, and interests” and are “attempting to erode American security and prosperity.”

The Biden administration, which I served in, built on this idea in its NSS, which placed strategic competition at the center of U.S. strategy and said that China “is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it.”

Eliot A. Cohen: Trump's security strategy is incoherent babble

Trump's latest NSS is a blunt repudiation of the idea—widely shared among Republicans and Democrats—that the United States is in a strategic competition with rival powers. It prioritizes threats from the Western Hemisphere, European civilizational decline and overregulation, and trade deficits but says nothing about the Russian threat to U.S. interests and views China almost entirely through the lens of economic security. The strategy is silent on Beijing's ambition to displace Washington as the world's leading power and evinces hope that the U.S. can forge a “genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing.” The stance is hardly surprising given Trump's words and actions over the past few months, but it is still extraordinary. Are we actually meant to believe that Xi Jinping's China, Vladimir Putin's Russia, or, for that matter, Kim Jong Un's North Korea have become more benign since 2017? Of course they haven't.

In fact, Americans face many new threats from China and Russia. With an operation by a group that the U.S. government labeled Salt Typhoon, China has compromised U.S. telecommunications networks and can now listen to calls or read text messages by any American it chooses. If you feel like your communications might be of interest to the Chinese Communist Party, you should be using only encrypted apps for messaging and calls. In another operation—labeled Volt Typhoon—China has penetrated U.S. infrastructure, including water-supply plans, electricity grids, and transportation, with a view to conducting destructive cyberattacks on the United States in the event of a war between the two countries. Meanwhile, according to the U.S. Intelligence Community's 2025 threat assessment, Russia “is developing a new satellite meant to carry a nuclear weapon as an antisatellite capability,” which, if detonated, “could cause devastating consequences for the United States, the global economy, and the world in general.”

None of these direct threats to the American homeland are even mentioned in Trump's NSS. The strategy therefore does not explain what the government, Congress, and the private sector should do to fix these vulnerabilities. Instead, it makes one general reference to the need for “a resilient national infrastructure that can withstand natural disasters” and “resist and thwart foreign threats.” This neglect is reflected in the administration's actions. Last week, the Financial Times reported that the Trump administration, intent on smoothing the way for a state visit to China in April 2026, drew back its plan to impose sanctions on China's Ministry of State Security over its cyberattacks on the telecommunications system. The story named Stephen Miller—the White House homeland-security adviser, of all things—as responsible for ensuring that no actions are taken that could threaten U.S.-China détente.

One of the most dramatic geopolitical developments in recent years has been the growing alignment among America's adversaries and competitors. China is helping Russia reconstitute its military, and in exchange, Russia is providing China with valuable military technology and assistance that could give it an edge over the United States in a conflict. North Korea has sent troops and weapons to Russia in its war against Ukraine, and in exchange, Moscow has helped Pyongyang modernize its military. All of these countries and Iran are cooperating diplomatically against the United States. If a U.S.-China war were to break out, it could easily go global, given these links. Reading the NSS, you'd never know about any of this.

Thomas Wright: What if ‘America first' appears to work?

The strategy also contains no discussion of how the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence might affect the threats facing the United States. White House AI Czar David Sacks has dismissed any discussion of AI risks as “doomerism” and repeatedly attacks those who favor export controls to China, so perhaps the silence around it is to be expected, but the dangers are real. Take cybersecurity as an example. Anthropic recently announced that a Chinese state-sponsored group manipulated its Claude Code tool to attempt to infiltrate roughly 30 targets around the world, including “large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies.” The hackers used “AI's ‘agentic' capabilities,” meaning they used AI “not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.” The company identified this as “the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.” It will surely not be the last: As AI's agentic capabilities develop, a growing array of hostile actors will become capable of carrying out large-scale, sophisticated attacks that were once the sole preserve of a small number of national governments.

These dangers are not a secret, nor are they marginal. They lie in plain sight and are arguably the greatest threats the U.S. faces in scale and consequence. So why has the Trump administration chosen to ignore them and to build its Maginot Line (not just as stated in the NSS, but as evidenced by its actions throughout this year) around a trade war, a military buildup in the Western Hemisphere, and a push to undermine the European political establishment? Some of the threats these actions purport to respond to, such as the “civilizational erasure” of Europe, are made up; others, such as drug cartels, are susceptible to far more targeted action than the administration has proposed.

The reason may lie in what the Trump administration is trying to accomplish. Contrary to its protestations about reining in America's ambition after decades of overreach (what Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called “utopian idealism”), it does have a grand plan: The NSS is a blueprint for building an illiberal international order, in which the U.S. can assert dominance unilaterally, strike deals with revisionist powers such as China and Russia, and work patiently to support right-wing populist parties in Europe in overthrowing centrist establishments. One might call it dystopian idealism.

Nowhere is this plan more in evidence than in the section on Europe. The NSS says that Europe is in economic decline and faces the risk of “civilizational erasure” through immigration and the EU's overregulation. These problems, it says, have created “strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence.” The administration wants “Europe to remain European,” and thus one of its priorities is “cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations.”

As though to drive home the seriousness of the administration's intentions, on Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his deputy Christopher Landau unleashed a series of posts on X attacking the European Union for its fines on Elon Musk's social-media company, saying that the U.S. could not remain a partner or military ally to an EU that pursued “policies of civilizational suicide.” Russians close to the Kremlin endorsed the American stance, declaring that Moscow and Washington were aligned in their desire to destroy the EU, and Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the adjustments made in Trump's NSS “are largely consistent with our vision.”

The Europe section highlights the incoherence of the grand plan. On the one hand, the administration seeks a world of sovereign states and promises to accept other countries for what they are; on the other, with regard to Europe, it advocates regime change and the destruction of the EU, a body that European citizens largely support. A fractured EU will be easy for Beijing to coerce and manipulate, with seismic implications for the United States. Currently, the EU Commission under Ursula von der Leyen is closely aligned with the United States on China, while Trump's strongest political allies in Europe—most notably Hungary, under Viktor Orbán, and parties such as Germany's Alternative for Germany—are the most favorably inclined to Beijing. Right now, the U.S. has a good and reliable partner in Europe when it comes to China, and it needs this.

From the November 2025 issue: The beacon of democracy goes dark

Even in an illiberal international order, the U.S. will require Europe's help on matters that run against Chinese interests, such as reducing American dependency on rare-earth metals sourced or processed in China, impeding China's manufacture of cutting-edge semiconductor chips, and deterring aggression against Taiwan. The administration is deluding itself if it imagines that a fractured Europe with numerous right-wing populist governments will provide any such support. This kind of Europe will cut deals with China and avoid any measures that might antagonize Beijing—some nations because they want to, and others because they are too weak to stand up to China on their own.

The problem with the Maginot Line was not only that it missed where the German attack would come from. It was that France believed that it had defended itself against the only possible threat. The Trump administration's NSS creates a similar illusion whereby the real dangers are in the Western Hemisphere or from European regulation and multiculturalism, whereas China and Russia are potential partners. But the United States doesn't get to decide whether Beijing and Moscow pose a threat to the United States. Those countries decide that themselves. The next crisis will not wait for Washington to rediscover strategic competition. If America abandons its allies, ignores clear threats, and treats national security as an extension of a domestic political struggle, the United States may wake up to find that it has no fortress to hide behind at all.

If you really want to understand the late architect's transformative genius, look past the titanium showpieces that made him a household name.

If you had to sum up Frank Gehry's career in a single word, the obvious choice would be Bilbao. The architect's design for an outpost of the Guggenheim Museum in the northern Spanish city didn't simply open in 1997—it detonated. Practically overnight, its billowing, titanium-sheathed forms helped transform a moribund industrial port into a global destination, and turned their rumpled Los Angeles architect into a household name. The project's ebullience also gave the field of architecture, which had been busy rehashing postmodernism, a swift, deconstructivist kick in the rear—showcasing the swooping forms that were now feasible with ever more sophisticated design technologies. It sent writers reaching for their most sensational metaphors. In a legendarily overheated article, the New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp likened the building to Marilyn Monroe: “voluptuous, emotional, intuitive and exhibitionist.”

Gehry, who died on Friday at his home in Santa Monica, California, at the age of 96, will forever be associated with high-profile projects such as Bilbao, as well as Walt Disney Concert Hall, which in 2003 brought elegant sparkle to a dour part of downtown Los Angeles. In the coming days, his legacy will be heavily scrutinized—praised for its breakthroughs but also criticized for forces it helped unleash. Bilbao sparked a starchitectural arms race, in which no city seemed to be complete without the eye-grabbing stamp of some jet-setting Pritzker Prize–winner (almost always a man). Gehry also cranked out his share of bombastic duds, such as the Experience Music Project, in Seattle, a jumble of jarringly colorful blobs, and the Grand L.A., a behemoth mixed-use development that has failed to draw much life to its neighborhood.

To look only at the overwrought megaprojects, however, is to miss one of Gehry's crucial achievements: his ability to turn an existing building, no matter how ordinary, into something humane and delightful. It may seem absurd to hail Gehry, of all architects, for his adaptive reuse and remodeling jobs, but these projects, many of which are scattered around Los Angeles, reveal a thoughtful, even humble, approach to space. They also bear the imprint of an unmistakable SoCal informality. (Gehry was born in Toronto but moved to L.A. as a teenager and remained there for the rest of his life.) As he once told his biographer, Paul Goldberger, he found the rigid perfectionism of old guard modernists, such as Mies van der Rohe, suffocating: “I just couldn't imagine living in it. It seemed almost militaristic that you couldn't throw your clothes on a chair.”

The most visible of his remodeling projects is the home he devised for himself and his wife, Berta Aguilera, in 1978—a gut remodel and expansion that reimagined a pink Dutch Colonial Revival bungalow as a wild experiment. He stripped the interior to expose wooden joists and studs. He extended the kitchen over the driveway, leaving the asphalt as flooring. (“Easy to mop,” he told the Los Angeles Times.) He wrapped the entire addition in a corrugated metal wall punctured by strategically placed windows and cutouts. Above the front door, a new deck was bounded by chain-link fencing. From all sides, the contours of the original house remained visible through the metal—the architectural equivalent of one of Vermeer's milkmaids dressing up as a robot.

The architecture world adored it. (The house was cited by the committee that awarded Gehry a Pritzker in 1989.) His neighbors, not so much. One of them took legal action to halt construction; another regularly brought his dog to leave gifts out front. A man informed an architect in Gehry's office that the building resembled “a Tijuana sausage factory.” But the fuss over its form overlooked the experience of residing within. In his redesign, Gehry made over a dim first floor into an open space saturated with daylight. The oddly angled windows framed views of mature trees that surrounded the property and, in combination with generous skylights, they offered a constant play of shadow and light. In a 2021 interview with the critic Mimi Zeiger, he described it as a “kinetic lightshow.”

Read: The Bilbao effect

This showy renovation, now quite beloved, functioned as an architectural calling card. But Gehry also knew how to intervene in subtler ways. Throughout his career, he helped reimagine a number of cultural hubs frequented by Angelenos. In the late 1970s, he expanded Gemini G.E.L., the legendary printmaking studio and exhibition space on Melrose Avenue that once nurtured artists including Ed Ruscha, Robert Rauschenberg, and Vija Celmins. These are simple rooms, largely devoted to the messy labor of art making, but they sneak in architectural flourishes such as a tilted skylight over a set of rough wooden stairs, which makes ascending to the second floor feel a little bit like entering a geometric abstraction.

Gehry kept an equally light touch in his renovation of an old warehouse and police garage in downtown L.A. that, in 1984, became the first home of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. He added a sequence of gallery walls, along with other necessary infrastructure, but for the most part, he left the industrial guts intact. The building, which still serves as a display space for MOCA in addition to a purpose-built location a mile away, is the opposite of Bilbao: rugged, unfussy, merged with its urban context. An early pioneer of the warehouse-as-museum, the Geffen Contemporary, as it's now called, has proved to be the ideal container for exhibitions that would be difficult to stage anywhere else. These include the ongoing “Monuments,” which brings together decommissioned Confederate monuments and contemporary art in a devastating critique of white-supremacist aesthetics. Few U.S. museums could accommodate such a show (the monuments are massive). More significant, the industrial interiors avoid romanticization. MOCA, like many of Gehry's early projects, is rough around the edges—what you see is what you get.

In 2021, the architect completed construction on the Beckmen YOLA Center, a permanent home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's youth orchestra. The center, which offers free music instruction to disadvantaged children, was carved out of a modernist bank building in downtown Inglewood that had been repurposed as a Burger King. It now features a flexible rehearsal and performance space with collapsible walls. Between practice rooms of different sizes are cozy nooks lined in plywood where guests can comfortably hang out. “It's not a precious building,” Gehry told me upon its opening. “But it's precious in what it does.”

In some ways, the Beckmen was a full-circle moment for the nonagenarian, a return to his roots as a designer who could find in the mundane an element of the extraordinary. It reflected none of the ego of a late-career starchitect. You won't find the billowing forms that were the marker of the Gehry brand. What you'll encounter is a welcoming hall filled with sunshine and the cacophony of young musicians. A building that had been deemed unfit for anything other than fast food was remade, with simple materials, into a space of art and collective transformation for Angelenos who may not know who Frank Gehry was. Great legacies have been built on less.

Men's search for meaning is everyone's problem.

For years now, falling birth rates have been a subject of alarm, with most of that discussion focused on women — the factors preventing them from having kids, whether mothers can balance work and family, if feminism has led women astray.

But what about men and what they think?

Demographers focused on fertility trends have largely ignored men's attitudes toward gender, caregiving, and relationships. We have far less data on men's perspectives than women's and even less on how those viewpoints shape outcomes.

But, men do have opinions on these topics, even if we haven't examined them all that closely. American men are more likely to see falling birth rates as a problem, for example, and also more likely to want a return to “traditional gender roles.” Nearly six in 10 men favor such a return, according to recent polling from the 19th News, compared to just four in 10 women. Among Republican men, that figure stood at 87 percent.

These attitudes aren't just showing up in polls — they're shaping policy and discourse. A growing number of conservatives have started to publicly lament that women's equality may have been a bridge too far, with some calling for an end to no-fault divorce or suggesting it's time to get rid of women's right to vote. Even the New York Times, a mainstream and liberal publication, recently ran a segment titled, “Did Women Ruin the Workplace?” discussing whether women have made professional culture too emotional and unserious.

It's easy to feel like men and masculinity have gotten plenty of attention already, and there has certainly been reticence on the left to centering men's desires at all. It's not hard to understand these reservations. Men have been prioritized for most of human history, and still dominate positions of power.

But, understanding men's attitudes remains essential. Everyone wants identity and purpose. For many men, these basic needs can manifest through a desire to feel masculine, and so their attitudes toward gender and caregiving are shaped by these deeper beliefs about what it means to be a man. If caregiving is seen as overly feminine work that diminishes masculinity, men will resist it.

For anyone who cares about gender equality, about women being able to find partners they want, or about people who want families being able to build them, ignoring what men think and need guarantees failure on every front.

When it comes to gender equality and babies, activists and politicians have long argued that more of the first would lead to more of the second. Or, as a former Tory minister in the United Kingdom once quipped, “Feminism is the new natalism.” The optimistic theory was that, if men stepped up, and egalitarian policies like paid leave became more widespread, birth rates would rise.

There's some truth to this, in the sense that research suggests a lack of gender equality makes the birth rate fall even faster.

Today, women with economic independence and less social pressure to marry are more likely to remain single than to settle for partners they don't trust to be supportive. “It used to be that women felt like they had no other choice — like maybe this guy's not great but he's the best that's going to come along,” said Patrick Brown, a family policy analyst at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. “But now...women are willing to stay single if they don't meet somebody who matches their criteria.”

And since most people who have kids these days do so in long-term, committed relationships, men who fail to demonstrate they'd be good partners face lower odds having kids at all.

Telling women to stay home isn't a guarantee they'll have more kids, either. Across most countries, women who work “are more likely to have children than those not employed,” said Trude Lappegård, a sociologist at the University of Oslo. This is true even when their partners are also employed.

In South Korea and Japan, where women are expected to do nearly all the domestic labor and must navigate workplaces that heavily penalize motherhood, fertility rates have imploded. South Korea's birth rate hit 0.75 children per woman in 2024, the lowest in the world, while Japan's dropped to 1.15. A similar trend exists across Southern Europe. In Italy, Spain, and Greece, where traditional gender norms remain strong, fertility has sunk to between 1.1 and 1.3.

These patterns show up in broader data, as well. A 2025 study analyzing over 40 European countries found that women increasingly want men to share child care and housework equally, while men's beliefs that women should handle the unpaid, domestic work have remained largely unchanged. In countries where this gap was widest, both birth rates and female employment were lower — suggesting that men's resistance to sharing chores may be holding both back.

“Of course this is not the only explanation — there are many factors that affect fertility — but we're saying not having men recognizing their share in the household does have an impact on women choosing to have children or not,” study co-author Giulia Briselli told me.

The equation isn't as simple as men doing more at home and birth rates going up. Men have clearly increased their time doing child care and domestic chores compared to generations past while fertility has continued to drop. “Pressuring men to help out more at home won't help fertility,” Lyman Stone, a conservative demographer at the Institute for Family Studies, argued this summer.

Still, it's more nuanced than that. Nordic countries that restructured parental leave, provided free child care, and created more flexible workplace norms that pull men into caregiving have higher fertility. Their rates hover around 1.4 to 1.6 — still well below replacement, but better. In Norway, Iceland, and Sweden, fathers who used their countries' parental leave policies were more likely to have partners who welcomed a second child. Gender equality isn't a magic fix, but doubling down on traditional roles seems to make things worse, not better.

Indeed, Briselli's work found that, in countries where the gap between men's and women's attitudes about sharing child care and housework was smallest, both fertility rates and female employment were higher. What seems to matter most may not be hours logged on chores but whether women perceive the arrangement as fair. And, even Stone's own data showed that when women's sense of unfairness increases, fertility falls. It's not just what men do at home, but whether they see it as their responsibility or as a favor.

This very question — of how men feel toward their obligations at home — is not well-studied. “This part was definitely not well-documented, not much attention has been paid to it, and I think we should put more light on it, for sure,” Briselli said.

Lappegård, the sociologist in Oslo, agreed and told me there's been a general lack of interest in studying men among demographers in her field. “I've been screaming that we need more research about men for the last 20 years,” she told me. “If we want to really understand what's going on with women then we not only have to compare them with men, but also men have their own independent voice in this.”

This knowledge gap exists partly because many scholars have seen the study of men and masculinity as inherently conservative — a pretext to rolling back women's rights or centering men's wounded feelings over women's material concerns.

But, if we want to understand why men's attitudes toward sharing domestic work have stagnated even as women's expectations have shifted, then we'll need to delve deeper into questions about how men see their place in the world. And if we want to ultimately move towards more equality and connection, then the question of what masculinity can and should be isn't one we can avoid.

As concern about the mental health of men has grown, so has a debate about whether masculinity can be salvaged or if it's fundamentally oppressive. Some argue for redefining it in more humane terms, so that engaged fathers and emotionally available partners are considered masculine; others push back hard. The idea that a more positive masculinity could even exist is “an attempt to scrub away the humiliating stain of womanhood from any trait or behavior before letting boys anywhere near it,” argued Ruth Whippman in the New York Times.

Doing so, echoed Jessica Winter in a recent New Yorker piece, would be conceding that “men should still rank above women in the social hierarchy, just not as much as before.” Both women propose a world where we scrap masculinity in exchange for “full humanity” and a “gender-free” world.

These exhortations, though, strike me as wishful thinking. Dismissing positive visions of masculinity certainly wouldn't eliminate the demand for masculinity; the hunger for a sense of identity doesn't just disappear. Practically speaking, it just creates a void for the Andrew Tates and Jordan Petersons of the world to fill more easily.

And few people are calling to abolish femininity. There are critiques, certainly, of its more toxic elements — like dangerous pressures to be thin, or encouragements to go under the knife — but it's rare to hear feminists call for women to reject femininity altogether. Instead, the movement has worked to educate women on the more harmful aspects of femininity while widening space in womanhood for those who don't conform and allowing women who want to embrace traditionally feminine activities to do so.

We can do for men what feminism did for women: name the harmful pressures, expand what counts as being a “good” man in society, and free people from the norms that make them less healthy and less connected. The valorization of dominance, the stigma around asking for help, and the equation of manhood with control needn't be the future of masculinity.

Daniel Cox, the director of the Survey Center on Family Life at the American Enterprise Institute, thinks part of the appeal of traditional gender roles is that they offer men clarity — a sense that there's a defined place for them and that they're needed. “The primary messaging that all these men are hearing is that no one needs you, women can do it on their own,” he told me. It's a message that leaves men confused and unmoored.

In response, Cox pointed to “relational masculinity” as an idea that could help men and that might also be more compatible with what women are looking for in partners.

“I think a lot of newly married husbands and new dads feel that weight of responsibility to protect and provide for their family and it can give you a lot of meaning,” he said. “Otherwise you might say why am I grinding, right? But when you're doing it on behalf of someone else and someone needs you, it's incredibly motivating…I think we've just fundamentally lost that idea of being in service to each other, whether it's to your family, your community, or country.”

While some women will roll their eyes at the idea of men wanting to feel needed, if we're being honest, that's a deeply human, universal desire. In one recent study of over 3,000 Americans, people who believed they were needed — whether by their family, their work, or their community — reported being significantly happier and more satisfied with their lives. It wasn't about egotism; it was about having a sense of purpose from something outside yourself.

It's not a total mystery why the gender revolution has stalled; incorporating caregiving into masculine identity asks men to give up some advantages and embrace work that's long been seen as feminine and undervalued. But countries like France — where Briselli found that men's and women's views on sharing housework are surprisingly aligned — show that it's possible for men to see engaged fatherhood and domestic labor not as reluctant helping but as something core to being a good man. Even in the US, things are changing. Roughly 20 percent of American parents report being in genuinely egalitarian partnerships.

And women aren't going back to the 1950s. They're not giving up their educations, careers, or staying in relationships that don't feel like partnerships. The data suggests that, even if they did, fertility would only fall faster.

Whether society-wide fertility can ever rise again under conditions of gender equality remains genuinely uncertain; researchers like Lappegård say they have more questions right now than answers. But what's at stake is far more than birth rates — it's whether men and women can actually build lives together.

A practical guide for talking about your “type” — without sounding silly.

Introvert. Extrovert. Type A. Type 3. A Samantha. These days, it seems, there is an ever-expanding list of terms and frameworks for describing our personalities. But what we see in ourselves, and what other people see in us, are often not the same.

So when LaDel, a listener to Explain It to Me — Vox's weekly call-in podcast — asked a question about “introverts,” our curiosity was piqued. “I was seeing people I know who I wouldn't consider to be introverts proclaiming that they were,” they said. “I'm like, ‘Wow, you're out every weekend, swinging from chandeliers. You're probably not an introvert.' But I'm not so arrogant that I feel like I can tell anyone what their temperament is.”

But, is LaDel right that more people are describing themselves as introverts? According to personality researcher and University of Kentucky psychology professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, the answer is: kind of! And the pandemic is to blame. “I think like any skill, when we are out of practice, we get rusty. People might be confusing discomfort with being introverted,” she said.

It's also a shift in how we think about disposition more generally. “I do think that here in the last decade or so, there's been more recognition of introverts as having qualities that are really desirable,” Sauer-Zavala told Vox. “They tend to be more thoughtful, more measured, better listeners.There's been kind of this renaissance for introverts, and now people are like, ‘Oh, it's okay to identify as an introvert. I'm a proud introvert.' And I think that's what we're seeing.”

What are some other ways we should be thinking about our personalities? Sauer-Zavala dives deeper on the latest episode of Explain It to Me. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

Do we get more introverted as we age? 

This is actually a really complicated question to answer.

Extroversion versus introversion can be divided up into subfacets. One thing that does tend to change or increase on average as people age is what's called social dominance. This is a facet of extroversion that is the tendency to be assertive and confident.

On the flip side, social vitality tends to decrease, and this is enthusiasm and energy for social situations.

I think we have this urge to label ourselves as either introverts or extroverts. Is that how you and your colleagues think about it?

The way we measure personality is really different from how people are talking about their types at a dinner party.

It's really different from what you would think personality is if you took a common personality test on the internet or through your HR office.

I always say that academic personality science needs a PR person because we're not really good at spreading the word on what personality actually is.

So, then what is personality?

I always like to answer this by talking about what personality is not first.

People are precious about their personality. It is their essence, their sense of humor, their tastes, their values. But, that's actually not how academic psychologists define personality.

We define personality as your characteristic or habitual way of acting and thinking. When you think about that, it's mental habits and behavioral habits, and those are things that we change all the time.

I'm curious how you measure personality from that scientific standpoint.

Most of the commercial personality tests that people have heard of are very category based. They put you into a type, and that's that. What we use describes personality in a much more nuanced way. It's the big five or the five factor model of personality. These are five overarching traits.

The first one is openness, and this is the degree to which you are interested in new ideas and aesthetics, philosophy, art versus folks that are more traditional.

Then, you have conscientiousness, which is on a continuum with disinhibition. And essentially conscientiousness is how striving you are, how organized, how reliable. And disinhibition is more like, “I kind of act before I think it through.”

The next is extroversion versus introversion, and that's the tendency to be energetic and excitable.

Then, there's agreeableness versus antagonism. Agreeableness is how oriented you are towards other people, how empathic, how caring, how well you get along with others.

And then, the last one is neuroticism, which is on a continuum with emotional stability. And neuroticism is your tendency to experience strong negative emotions. Do you tend to get more upset by stressors in the environment? Do you take longer to calm back down? That sort of thing.

I like to think about the big five as an audio switchboard with all the little dials that you can push up and down.

Why do you think we're so interested in knowing our personality types? Why do we want to put ourselves in buckets so badly?

I mean, it's fun, right? But, knowing where you are on those different traits provides you with a lot more nuanced information.

I develop interventions, and for the past 10 years have been developing interventions to nudge personality traits. People think that personality is set in stone — you're born with it and you should just take the test, put yourself in the box, and then you should choose partners and careers based on whatever type you are — when, really, it should be the opposite.

You should identify what's important to you, what you value, what important goals you have, and then figure out what are the traits that will help get you there and intentionally cultivate them.

﻿AI is causing electricity prices to surge. No one is happy about it.

For more than a century, the Conshohocken steel mill in suburban Philadelphia employed thousands of people and anchored a booming industrial economy. But the original owner went bankrupt in the 1970s, after which the facility limped on with a succession of new owners. Last summer it was idled indefinitely, and put up for sale.

It's a familiar story of decline. The Trump administration talked a big game about reviving American manufacturing; its efforts so far have been a failure. But in Conshohocken at least, the remnants of America's industrial age are a perfect fit for what's powering its economy now — artificial intelligence. A local developer quickly moved to convert the old steel mill into a massive new data center.

“What I'm proposing is to enable AI to progress while replacing 19th-century manufacturing with 21st-century manufacturing,” developer Brian O'Neill told the Plymouth Township Planning Agency meeting in October.

There are billions of dollars of data center projects currently underway in the United States, with hundreds of billions of dollars more planned. President Donald Trump loves them. So do prominent Democrats. On the local level they're sold to officials as all-upside: Be part of the economy of the future, rake in tons of tax revenue, and do it all without having to provide many new services.

“The annual revenue of the building I'm proposing is $21 million a year. And that's with no traffic, no kids in the school system, nothing but cash flow,” O'Neill said. (O'Neill did not respond to a request for an interview.)

This pitch is going over great with many politicians — but it's falling flat with a large and growing coalition of regular people.

“For residents around data centers, there's just no positive,” said Genevieve Boland, who lives just a few blocks from the old steel mill.

That backlash has been steadily growing in communities throughout the country as the AI economy has boomed — and it may very well shape the future of our politics and economy.

Soon after finding out about the planned data center, Boland and her roommate Patti Smith began rallying neighbors in opposition, posting flyers and “hitting the town Facebook page like we've never hit it before.”Their appeals resonated. Neighbors shared their concerns about noise and light, possible environmental pollution, and what the center could mean for the cost of power — concerns that have been echoed in other communities where data centers are springing up.

“Obviously our utilities are going to skyrocket and I don't want to see that happen,” said Mark Musial, who also lives near the mill.

Pennsylvania is part of a regional electricity grid that has seen a huge amount of new data centers added in the last few years, and a corresponding increase in electric costs. Electric bills spiked about 20 percent in New Jersey last year, becoming a flashpoint in that state's governor's race.

The backlash to data centers is just starting to bubble up in the news, but it's already been consequential: In the second quarter of this year 20 data center projects worth nearly $100 billion were canceled or delayed by community opposition, according to a report from Data Center Watch, a project that's been tracking the opposition to data center development.

The data center backlash doesn't really have an obvious ideological valence.

“One striking finding is that the pushback against data centers was bipartisan,” said Miquel Villa, an analyst at 10a labs, an AI safety company that produces Data Center Watch. “You could find it in red and blue states alike.”

Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia in this year's elections made criticism of some aspects of the data center buildout part of their winning campaign message, but the races that have been dominated by data center backlash so far have been local.

In Georgia, two Democrats won big upsets to land seats on that state's Public Service Commission, which helps regulate climate and energy policy. The race was dominated by rising power bills amid the data center boom there.

And a number of local races in Virginia — home to the largest cluster of data centers in the world — were fought out over data centers. Democrat John McAuliff, who ran to flip a conservative state assembly district in Northern Virginia, built his campaign around opposition to the state's generous data center policies.

“We would knock 80 to 100 doors [a day] and in that process have 15 conversations; more than 10 of them would be about data centers in this context,” McAuliff said. “Which is remarkable.”

So far, it seems that more Democrats than Republicans have used opposition to data centers as a political tool, but it's not breaking down neatly along party lines. In Florida, James Fishback, an extremely online, extremely right-wing candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2026 governor's race, is making opposition to data centers a tentpole issue of his campaign launch. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri has also criticized data centers.

In suburban Philadelphia, the Conshohocken steel mill will likely remain vacant a while longer: Last month the developer seeking to turn it into a data center abruptly yanked the application when the project ran into a legal issue.

Boland and Smith, the roommates turned organizers, told me they're relieved, but they're not done. They plan to keep organizing against data centers with other activists from around the country they've connected with in the last few weeks. Boland recently launched a website to coordinate statewide pushback.

“Data centers everywhere, data centers in your backyard — it's not inevitable,” she said. “You can change it.”

Amid the growing pervasiveness of AI, it's a message that's resonating — and these sites of backlash could well signal a bumpier road ahead for the AI buildout.

The Court's GOP majority wants grow Trump's authority, but also give itself a veto power over the president.

If you've followed the Supreme Court's recent presidential power cases, you know there's no mystery surrounding the Court's eventual decision in Trump v. Slaughter, a case asking if President Donald Trump may fire several high-ranking federal officials who are protected from being terminated by federal law.

All six members of the Court's Republican majority are devout acolytes of the “unitary executive,” a legal theory that claims the president may fire nearly anyone who leads a federal agency. The specific question before the Court in Slaughter is whether the Constitution permitted Trump to fire Rebecca Slaughter, who previously served as one of five commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The Republican justices already concluded, albeit in a temporary order, that Trump may fire Slaughter in an order handed down in September. Though the justices heard oral argument in the Slaughter case on Monday morning, that argument is largely political theater preceding the Court's inevitable decision that Slaughter may be fired permanently.

While on its face the Slaughter case is a case about presidential power, a few key justices signaled that they are comfortable giving Trump the power he seeks in this case because the Court will itself remain a check on the president.

The Court's Republican majority, in other words, plans to remake the separation of powers among the three US branches of government into a kind of hierarchy. Under this new vision, Congress's power to create “independent” agencies that enjoy some insulation from the president must yield to a more powerful executive. And the executive's authority over these agencies must, in turn, yield to a more powerful Supreme Court.

Ninety years ago, in Humphrey's Executor v. United States (1935), the Supreme Court held that Congress may sometimes create federal agencies, led by multimember boards, that act with a degree of autonomy from the president. Although the leaders of these agencies are typically nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, federal law forbids the president from firing these agency leaders simply because he disagrees with their policy views. By law, FTC commissioners may only be fired “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

The “unitary executive” theory, meanwhile, claims that Humphrey's Executor was wrongly decided. Proponents of this theory point to a line in the Constitution that states “the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in an influential 1988 dissenting opinion, this line “does not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power” belongs to the president. And thus Trump must have the power to fire any agency leader who wields power that is “executive” in nature.

Monday's oral argument in Slaughter left little doubt that all six of the Court's Republicans — all of whom have signed onto decisions embracing this unitary executive theory in the past — share Scalia's view of the Constitution. Chief Justice John Roberts even referred to Humphrey's Executor as a “dried husk.” The Court's GOP majority really hates that nine-decade-old decision.

That said, some of the Court's Republicans did express concerns about the implications of the unitary executive. In May, for example, the Court signaled that it will exempt the Federal Reserve from the unitary executive, preventing Trump from firing its leaders, because “the Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”

While it's not entirely clear what those words mean, Justice Brett Kavanaugh apparently takes them very seriously. During the argument, he told Solicitor General John Sauer that he has “concerns” about giving Trump full control over the Fed.

The Fed has the power to temporarily stimulate the economy in ways that can cause serious economic damage down the road. So, if the president could fire Fed governors, he could pressure them to boost the economy during an election year, giving the president a temporary political advantage with consequences that may not be felt until after the president leaves office.

Similarly, Justice Samuel Alito asked about so called “Article I courts,” such as the US Tax Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which adjudicate cases just like any other judicial body, but that are technically not part of the judicial branch (which is created by Article III of the Constitution). Must the president have the power to fire judges on these courts, even if he does so to pressure them to change their interpretation of the law?

In a related vein, Roberts asked whether a hypothetical agency that spends most of its time adjudicating individual cases, but that occasionally wields “executive” power, must be fully controlled by the president.

A major reason why it is difficult to determine which agencies should be under the president's full control under the unitary executive theory is that the Constitution does not define key terms like the word “executive.”

Recall that this theory derives from a line in the Constitution giving all “executive power” to the president. There is considerable evidence, however, that the framers did not have a firm grasp on what powers are “executive” in nature when they wrote the Constitution. And they certainly did not draw the lines in the same place that the Court's current majority does.

The Republican justices have held, for example, that the power to prosecute crimes is a “quintessentially executive function.” But, in the early United States, federal prosecutions were often led by private attorneys or by lawyers appointed by judges. Indeed, the latter still happens today. Current US law sometimes gives federal district judges the power to appoint federal prosecutors.

So even if you accept the premise of the unitary executive — that Trump must have full control over all officials who do “executive” things — no one really knows what sort of government functions qualify as “executive.”

This might seem like a difficult problem for the Court's unitary executive stans to overcome, but several of the Republican justices offered a simple solution to this problem: They can just rule however they want in Slaughter, because if another case comes up in the future where they want to limit the president's power, they can just rule differently in that case.

Alito proposed one simple step the Court could take to preserve the Court's power to protect the Federal Reserve or the military's appeals court: It could simply not decide those issues in Slaughter. At one point, he asked Sauer to suggest language that the Court could insert into its Slaughter opinion that would leave harder questions arising under the unitary executive unresolved.

Of course, as Justice Elena Kagan pointed out, kicking the can down the road in this way can't work forever. “Logic has consequences,” in the Supreme Court, Kagan said in response to Alito. And if the Court hands down a theory of the Constitution that should apply equally to both the FTC and the Fed, the Court is supposed to apply that theory equally to both agencies.

So long as Trump is president, this shift in power may not matter. 

Both Justice Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, however, floated a separate solution to this problem: If a future president ever does something the justices don't like, the justices can just veto it.

For what it is worth, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh seemed to disagree slightly about how they should exercise this veto. Gorsuch wants to revive something called the Nondelegation Doctrine, which the Court briefly used in 1935 to veto two laws giving broad power to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, before abandoning Nondelegation for the next nine decades. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, would rely on the “major questions doctrine,” a legal doctrine that permits the justices to veto any presidential decision they decide is too consequential.

This major questions doctrine is brand new and has only ever been used against one president: Joe Biden.

But, regardless of whether the Court revives a dead doctrine or relies on something they recently invented, the practical implications of Gorsuch and Kavanaugh's approaches are the same. They would give the president full control over who leads federal agencies, but also give themselves a veto power over anything the president does with those agencies.

So, while Slaughter appears to be a case about presidential power on its surface, this Court appears likely to use it to grow its own power. Trump will almost certainly win the power to fire Slaughter. But on the condition that the Supreme Court is the president's boss.

So long as Trump is president, this shift in power may not matter. The Republican justices have largely acted as rubber stamps for nearly anything Trump wants to do. But Trump won't be president forever. And Gorsuch and Kavanaugh's approach will give this Court massive authority to sabotage a future Democratic president.

Loza hoan' ireo ala sisa tavela eto Madagasikara ny doro-tanety.

AFOVOANTANY, Madagasikara— Akaiky ny lelafo. Nanazava ny lanitra amin'ny alina ilay doro-tanety noho ny setroka miloko volomboasary, ka nifindra tahaka ny lava mikoriana manaraka ireo havoana, tokony ho kilaometatra vitsivitsy monja miala teto.

Nijery an'ilay afo avy teny amoron'nyala matevina aho, taty amin'ny faritra afovoantanin'i Madagasikara, ora vitsivitsy avaratra-andrefana miala an'Antananarivo, renivohitrin'i Madagasikara. Toerana manokana izy io. Ity dia iray amin'ireo ala sisa tavela eny amin'ny faritra afovoan'i Madagasikara — faritra rava noho ny fandripahana ala nandritra ny taona maro — ary fonenan'ny biby tsy fahita firy, anisan'izany karazana tanalahy maro.

Ity no tantara farany amin'ny andiany telo momba ny fiarovana tontolo iainana eto Madagasikara, tohanan'ny BAND Foundation.

Ity ala ity, izay misy karazan-kazo mihoatra ny 400, dia mbola misy noho ny fiarovana azy nandritra ny am-polo taona maro. Anisan'ny valan-javaboahary antsoina hoe “Réserve Spéciale” Ambohitantely izy, izay nahavita nampihena ny fanapahana hazo tsy ara-dalàna, ny fanaovana tavy ho an'ny fambolena, sy ireo antony hafa nandrava ny ala manodidina sy ny ala maro manerana an'i Madagasikara.

Araka ny hitako tamin'iny alina iny anefa, na ny fiarovana tontolo iainana tsara indrindra aza dia misy fetrany, indrindra rehefa mihamafana ny tany.

Ankehitriny, mba hiarovana ny rohivoahary tahaka izao — sy hamonjena ireo biby anisan'ny mahavariana indrindra eto an-tany — dia mila fomba fiasa mavitrika kokoa.



Raha sendra mahita biby dia any an'ala ianao eto Madagasikara, matetika tsy misy any an-kafa mihitsy eto an-tany izany biby izany. Madagasikara, izay nosy lehibe iray any atsinanan'i Afrika, dia efa voasaraka tamin'ny tany hafa nandritra ny an-tapitrisa taona, ka nanome fotoana lava ho an'ny biby eto hiova ho karazana vaovao. Izany no antony mahatonga ny hoe manodidina ny 90 isan-jaton'ny zavamaniry sy biby eto amin'ny firenena no tsy misy raha tsy eto ihany, izany hoe tsy misy any an-kafa — anisan'izany ny gidro rehetra sy sy saika ny antsasaky ny tanalahy mihoatra ny 200 karazana eran-tany.

Ny “Réserve Spéciale” Ambohitantely dia toerana tena ahitana izany roa izany betsaka.

Tamin'ny alina mangatsiaka iray tamin'ny volana Septambra, amin'ny fiafaran'ny ririnina eto Madagasikara, dia nandeha an-tongotra tao anaty alan'i Ambohitantely aho niaraka tamin'i Fandresena Rakotoarimalala, mpikaroka manao doktorà ao amin'ny Oniversiten'Antananarivo izay mianatra momba ny tanalahy ao amin'ilay faritra arovana. Malaza fa mahay miafina tsara ny tanalahy — ny mampiavaka azy ireo, mazava ho azy, dia ny fahaizany mifangaro amin'ny tontolo iainany. Fa rehefa tratran'ny hazavan'ny jiro izy ireo, dia miseho fotsifotsy izy ireo, ka lasa mora hita lavitra. Izany no antony nandehananay amin'ny alina.

Nandeha moramora izahay tao anaty ala, nitsilo ny ravinkazo tamin'ny jironay no sady nandroaka moka sy bibikely mitangorona eo amin'ny hazavana. Nandre fihorakorahan'ny gidro teny ambony izahay. Nisy fotoana, sendra nahita trandraka izahay — biby mandady misy tsilo tahaka ny sora kely — nivezivezy tao anaty ala.

Tahaka ny karazana biby malaza maro eto Madagasikara, dia tandindomin-doza ihany koa ny tanalahy. Manodidina ny 100 ny karazana tanalahy eto amin'ity nosy ity, ary saika ny antsasany dia tandindomin-doza ho ringana, indrindra noho ny fahaverezan'ny toeram-ponenany, araka ny voalazan'ny Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature sy Natural Resources, izay manam-pahefana maneran-tany momba ny karazam-bidy sy zavamaniry atahorana ho lany tamingana.

Izany indrindra no nahatonga ity dia an-tongotra amin'ny alina ity ho tena miavaka indrindra.

Isaky ny metatra vitsivitsy, i Rakotoarimalala — izay efa nantsoina hoe Mpanjakavavin'ny tanalahy — dia mijanona ka manondro zavatra fotsifotsy miraikitra amin'ny ravina. Ny ankamaroany dia karazana tanalahy “Perinet” tanora, izay kely vatana ary manana hoditra maitso toy ny emeraoda. Nahita tarondro “à cornes-globes” maromaro koa izy, karazana tandindomin-doza, izay manana loha miendrika telozoro. Ny mason'izy ireo dia mety samy mijery amin'izay jereny avy.

Tao anatin'ny ora vitsivitsy monja tamin'iny alina iny, nahita tanalahy mihoatra ny 60 izahay, avy amin'ny karazany telo samihafa. Ary io habetsahana io no iray amin'ireo antony maha-zava-dehibe ny fiarovana an'i Ambohitantely, hoy Rakotoarimalala, izay mianatra momba ny fahasalaman'ny tanalahy sy ny génétique-n'izy ireo ao amin'ilay faritra arovana. Ny fahaverezan'ity faritra arovana ity dia ho ratra lehibe ho an'ity vondrona biby ity manontolo.

Ny fomba mahazatra indrindra hiarovana biby dia ny famoronana faritra arovana, toy ny valan-javaboahary sy faritra voaaro, izay matetika mametra ireo asa manimba ny tontolo iainana. Eto Madagasikara sy amin'ireo firenena mahantra maro hafa, tsy nahitana fahombiazana loatra ireo faritra arovana ireo. Matetika ny olona tsy manan-tsafidy afa-tsy ny miankina amin'ny ala mba hivelomany, na arovana ara-dalàna aza ireo hazo ireo na tsia.

Tsy mba tahak'izany Ambohitantely: Tantanin'ny fikambanana tsy miankina antsoina hoe Madagascar National Parks (MNP) ilay faritra, ka nahavita nampihena ny fanapahana hazo ao anatiny, satria lavitra ny tanàna be olona ilay ala. Kely ihany koa ilay faritra arovana, ka mora kokoa ny manaraha-maso azy.

Fa na izany aza dia tsy voa antonka tanteraka ny fiarovana ilay faritra.

Ny loza lehibe indrindra atrehin'i Ambohitantely ankehitriny dia ny doro-tanety ataon'olona. Ny mponina eny ambanivohitra manodidina dia mandoro tanety noho ny antony maro, toy ny fampaniriana ny tsiry ho an'ny omby, na koa noho ny fomba amam-panao. Ary matetika loatra dia miparitaka tsy voafehy ireo afo. Tamin'ny taona 1989 ka hatramin'ny taona 2017, dia very manodidina ny antsasany ny alan' Ambohitantely, indrindra noho ny doro tanety. Tamin'ny taona 2022 irery, dia may ny ampahatelon'ny ala sisa tavela, araka ny filazan'i Jacquis Andonahary, botanista ao amin'ny fikambanana fiarovana ny tontolo ianainana ao an-toerana antsoina hoe Association Vahatra, izay miasa ao amin'ny faritra arovana.

Ny fiovan'ny toetrandro, etsy ankilany, dia vao mainka mampitombo herin'ity loza ity.

Niakatra manodidina ny 1 degre celsius ny mari-pana ambony indrindra isan'andro tao Ambohitantely nanomboka tamin'ny taona 1980. Ary ny fiakaran'ny mari-pana dia mahamaina ny zavamaniry, ka manampy ny akora afaka mirehitra amin'ny doro-tanety. “Mihalava ny fotoanan'ny main-tany, ka lasa betsaka kokoa ny zavatra afaka mirehitra,” hoy i Steve Goodman, mpikaroka ao amin'ny Field Museum of Natural History sy filoha lefitry ny Vahatra.

Tsy eto Madagasikara ihany no isehoan' ity olana ity. Ny fiovan'ny toetrandro dia mahatonga ny zavamaniry ho mora mirehitra amin'ny faritra maro maneran-tany, na ao anatin'ny faritra arovana na tsia.

Rehefa mbola mandrava ny faritra onenana sarobidy eto Ambohitantely ny doro-tanety,, dia miezaka mafy ny siantifika ao amin'ny Vahatra, ny mpiasa ao amin'ny faritra arovana, ary ny mponina eo an-toerana hanarenana izany. Tsotra ny fomba ataon'izy ireo: mamboly hazo betsaka.

Nandritra ny taona vitsivitsy izay, ny Vahatra dia mamerina mamelona ireo faritra an'ala nodoran'ny afo, ho fomba hitazonana ny karazan-biby sy zavamaniry ao aminy. (Rehefa mihena ny haben'ny ala dia very tsikelikely ny isan-karazan'ny biby sy ny zavamaniry ao anatiny.)

Sarotra anefa ny manome toky fa ho velona ireo hazo novolena.

Voalohany, tsy maintsy mametraka karazan-kazo mifanaraka amin'ny toetry ny tany sy ny toerana misy azy. Nanao fikarohana i Andonahary tao anaty ala mba hahafantarana hoe inona avy ireo hazo mitombo ao sy inona ireo toe-javatra ilainy (karazan-tany, hazavana, sns). Avy eo, nanangona voa ny Vahatra sy ireo mponina, namelona azy ireo tao amin'ny toeram-pambolena zana-kazo, ary nametraka ireo zana-kazo teny amin'ny sisin'ny ala sisa tavela, nanisy zezika hanatsarana azy. “Mihoatra ny 90 isan-jato ny taham-pahaveloman'ny hazo novolena,” hoy Andonahary tamiko. Tena zava-bita lehibe izany, satria matetika tsy mahomby ny fambolen-kazo.

Rehefa voavoly ireo hazo, dia ireo mpikaroka sy ny mponina no miezaka miaro azy tsy ho may.

Ny mpitantana ny faritra arovana dia manome vola kely ho an'ny olona mipetraka ao amin'ny manodidina mba hanao fisafoana sy hitady famantarana ny fisinan'afo. Manana kitapo misy rano entina an-damosina ihany koa izy ireo izay azon'izy ireo ampiasaina hamonoana afo.

Zava-dehibe kokoa, ny Vahatra sy ny MNP dia nametraka andalana roa mitovy manodidina an'i Ambohitantely, antsoina hoe aroafo — tany malama tsy misy ahitra afaka mirehitra, izay tsy tokony hahafahan'ny afo mandalo. Vahaolana tsotra io, izay efa nampiasain'ny olona, anisan'izany ireo foko teratany any Etazonia, Kanada, ary Aostralia, nandritra ny taonjato maro hifehezana ny fiparitahan'ny afo.

Ilay afo hitako tamin'iny alina iny tamin'ny volana Septambra dia tsy tonga tao Ambohitantely mihitsy — noho ireo ezaka ireo. Novonoin'ireo mpamono afo miasa ao amin'ny MNP ilay afo, araka ny filazan'i Ricky Tiavina Rakotonindrina, mpiasa ao amin'ny MNP izay mitantana ilay faritra arovana.

Fa mazava ho azy, mbola hisy indray ny afo hafa. Ny fiovan'ny toetrandro no manampy amin'izany. Ka ny fanontaniana ankehitriny dia hoe: ho ampy ve ireo ezaka hiarovana ilay faritra arovana — sy ireo harena rehetra ao anatiny anisan'izany ireo harena mety mbola tsy hita?

Technological progress and economic growth are preconditions for human happiness, not a guarantee.

By almost any measure, the last two centuries delivered astonishing leaps in human prosperity. We live longer, healthier, safer lives than almost any generation that came before us. And yet, the experience of modern life often feels unsettled. People are anxious, politics are brittle, and the promise of progress feels shakier than ever.

Few thinkers have grappled with these contradictions more deeply than Brad DeLong. He's an economic historian at UC Berkeley and the author of Slouching Towards Utopia, a sweeping account of the “long twentieth century” when technological progress reshaped every aspect of human life.

I invited DeLong onto The Gray Area to talk about the purpose of progress, the tension between getting richer and living well, and whether our politics are capable of stewarding another era of transformation. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, which drops every Monday, so listen and follow us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What do you think progress is for? What are the goals we should be pursuing as a society?

One way to answer that is to begin with fear. I had a political philosophy teacher, Judith Shklar, who described liberalism as a response to what we fear about other systems. She wanted to know what kinds of suffering and cruelty liberal institutions are meant to prevent.

I think something similar applies to economic progress. If you look backward, the first thing we should be trying to escape is the old Malthusian world. That was a world in which a huge share of children died before the age of 5, because they were too malnourished to fight off disease. It was a world without real medicine, where childbirth was dangerous and life was dominated by hunger, cold, and constant vulnerability. Poverty did not just mean fewer comforts; it meant short and miserable lives.

Progress begins with escaping that condition. Once you have done that, you face a different question: If we are no longer living under the pressure of absolute scarcity, how much of our time and energy should still be devoted to producing more? And what kind of more do we actually want? At what point do we have enough material security to turn our attention toward living wisely and well rather than accumulating?

There's a moment at which pursuing more for the sake of more stops making sense. Many of us are already living with enough resources and enough control over our environment that the pursuit of extra possessions is not obviously a path to a better life. The question becomes how to use that abundance to create the conditions in which human beings can flourish.

There's something hollow about a society that measures progress almost entirely in terms of money and material gain. I know it's easy for me to say this from a privileged position, but it feels like we've confused means and ends. Plenty of people have enough to survive quite comfortably; yet, they don't seem very happy.

Well, I think it's useful to distinguish between happiness and what you might call living well with what you have. They overlap, but they're not identical. And this is where freedom really matters.

A political and economic system should create the basic conditions in which people can become more free and more fulfilled, whatever that means for them. We're not doing a great job of that. We have more choices and more things to consume, and we have never had more entertainment. But that does not necessarily translate into meaningful freedom.

Many people rightly feel dominated by forces they cannot see or understand. They feel pushed and pulled by bureaucracies, markets, governments, algorithms, all without any real sense of control. Some of that pressure is simply the cost of living with other people. But, some of it is a real constraint. It's a reminder that material wealth does not automatically produce a sense of agency.

Recovering our attention is one part of the problem. But the deeper issue is the feeling that large impersonal systems are shaping our lives in ways we never consented to. That's where the unease comes from.

Do you feel like we're progressing in a meaningful and sustainable way? I realize “meaningful” is a pretty vague term, but I think you know what I'm getting at.

Since about 1870, every generation has seen its productive capacity double or more. That's a lot. The ability to manipulate nature and coordinate human labor has kept rising at an extraordinary pace. But, this progress is uneven. In most of the economy, things improve gradually. In a smaller part of the economy, everything changes radically within a single generation.

If you're in that part of the economy, your life can be completely upended. You can't expect to do what your parents did and live the life they lived. The structures and patterns they relied on melt away. That repeated dislocation is one of the central political and economic challenges of the modern world.

Sometimes we've handled it very badly. Sometimes we've handled it only somewhat badly. Right now, I would say we are handling it moderately badly. It's better than the first half of the twentieth century, when societies were torn apart by war and ideological conflict. But, it's not as good as the decades after World War II, when the North Atlantic found a more equitable balance between growth and security.

Layered on top of this is the existential question: If we have enough material comfort, then what's our life for? The old religious answers don't hold the same authority, so we are left searching for purpose in a world that constantly rearranges itself.

Let me ask you this: If you look at the world right now, there are plenty of reasons for optimism. We have cheap, clean energy coming online. We have rapid technological innovation. At the same time, trade is shaky, and democracies are struggling. When you look at all this, do you see stronger headwinds or tailwinds?

For the world as a whole, I see tailwinds. A historian friend of mine once said that, when people in the year 2100 write world history, they may decide that the real turning point was the death of Mao in China and the rise of Deng Xiaoping, followed by India's turn under Rajiv Gandhi. Before that, most of humanity lived in crushing poverty. Since then, China, India, and much of the developing world have moved onto the escalator of industrial and post-industrial growth.

Hundreds of millions of people have gained access to reliable food, medicine, education, and a wider division of labor. They now have the chance to think about what it means to live well, not just how to survive. The fact that so many people can focus on purpose rather than scarcity is one of the great achievements of human history.

The politics of this transformation are complicated. China is becoming more authoritarian, not less. There are real concerns about the direction of some of these systems. But the material progress is undeniable, and it shifts the entire balance of the global story.

There are people who think AI will save us, that it will boost growth and help us innovate our way out of our problems. Are you convinced?

For me, personally, AI has already made my intellectual life better. I can keep track of far more research than I could a few years ago. Yes, much of what's being produced now is low quality, but my ability to sift through it has grown. When I sit down to read, having an intelligent tool that can search, and summarize, and clarify is enormously helpful.

So, I think the upside is real. Many people will gain access to tools that make complex reasoning and analysis easier. They'll be able to classify information, experiment with ideas, and make decisions in ways that were impossible before. That's all good.

But, there's a downside. These same systems will be used to target our attention even more aggressively. They'll be used to keep us hooked on screens, to frighten or outrage us, and to extract value from our eyeballs. That's already happening, and it will get worse.

We're also clearly over-investing in parts of the AI space, because a lot of money has flowed in from speculative ventures. The big tech companies have their own reasons for pouring resources into it. Some smaller players are simply chasing hype. We'll end up with misallocated capital and too many data centers, just as we ended up with too much fiber-optic cable after the dot-com boom.

But buried in all that excess will be real advances that genuinely expand human capabilities. The question is how widely those benefits are shared and whether our institutions can guide them toward the common good.

So what should we be focusing on? 

We should pay close attention to the people who want to stop technological progress or warp it for their own advantage. Some people resist change, because they want to preserve their monopolies or their control over certain flows of money and power. Others resist because their ways of life are under genuine pressure, and they're being treated unfairly.

Politics has to respond to both groups. It must help repair the lives of those who are hurt through no fault of their own and also prevent powerful actors from dressing up self-interest as legitimate grievance.

We've dealt with versions of this problem since the Industrial Revolution. Sometimes we've managed it reasonably well. Other times, we've failed — with terrible consequences.

But, there's another challenge that's newer. We're not just dealing with economic disruption. We're dealing with disruption to the systems we use to decide what's true and how we should act. Our information environment is now so vast and so open to manipulation that it's harder than ever to sustain a shared sense of reality.

Madison and Hamilton believed a well-designed constitutional system could channel public passions without descending into chaos or tyranny. That assumption feels less solid today. Figuring out how to rebuild trust in representation and how to create an information environment where citizens can actually understand what's happening is essential.

Give me a word or two that might come to define the 21st century in the way the word “growth” defined the 20th century.

I'll give you two.

First, growth, but growth centered in what used to be called the developing world rather than in the old industrial core. The 21st century will still be a century of rising prosperity, but its center of gravity is shifting.

Second, attention. The defining question of our era is whether human beings can learn to direct their attention toward what truly matters rather than toward whatever powerful actors want them to look at. Reliable information used to be scarce. Now, claims to reliability are so abundant that they overwhelm us.

Whether we learn to navigate that environment may be the most important story of the century.

How can a new media company make a big splash in the tech world?

One answer: call Day Job, a Los Angeles-headquartered creative agency.

That's what the hosts of the ""Technology Business Programming Network"" — better known as TBPN — did when they wanted help nailing the podcast's branding and style.

Day Job cofounder Rion Harmon described the vision: a ""cacophony of logos"" slapped all over the screen (a nod to Formula 1 racecars), a ""country club"" forest green, and a VHS visual effect.

It'd be somewhere between a news station and a sports-casting channel — hence the rebranding from the ""Technology Brothers Podcast"" to TBPN.

""They're doing something new,"" Harmon told me. ""It doesn't feel like a stuffy, sort of normal sort of journalism thing. It feels more alive. It feels vibrant. We were trying to capture their energy, right? It's funny to just be overly sponsored.""

TBPN has had a big year. The podcast, which launched in 2024, has become a new center stage for a rotation of headline-making Big Tech guests like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Palantir's Alex Karp, and Anduril's Palmer Luckey. Both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal profiled the hosts, John Coogan and Jordi Hays, reporting that the media company expects $5 million in revenue this year.

That, in turn, has helped make Day Job a hot commodity in the tech world, as startups and VCs seek to stand out with their branding. The growing attention from Silicon Valley is paying off. Harmon said that this year, Day Job has doubled its revenue and head count.

""With Day Job, what separates them is they will make four or five different brand directions that are all viable and all justifiable in different ways,"" Hays said.

Founded in 2018 by Harmon and Spen Madsen, Day Job is a bootstrapped and has a team of about 20 split between LA, New York, Portland, and Europe. Since its launch, it has worked with hundreds of brands, such as Millennial-coded pastel CBD Recess drinks and the chili crisp sauce brand Fly By Jing. Harmon had also worked on Coogan's Zyn competitor, Excel.

The firm collaborates with clients on a wide range of projects, from brand ideation at the earliest stages, including coming up with a company name, to fine-tuning product and creative design or running advertising campaigns.

While Day Job's roots are in consumer packaged goods like Recess or recent viral protein bar David — which Day Job helped name and created giant billboards of cod in New York City for — more and more tech clients are flocking to the creative agency.

Patron, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on consumer startups, hired Day Job to rebrand the firm and overhaul its website. Stuut, an Andreessen Horowitz-backed AI startup, also got the Day Job treatment this fall. The agency recently worked on advertising campaigns for customer service startup Bland AI and crypto exchange Gemini, too.

""Tech is in an interesting point where brand is becoming more important to them,"" Harmon said. ""There's so much noise. You have to figure out how to talk to your consumer in a more profound way.""

Tech brands often look and feel … the same.

""There's this addiction to homogenous design choices right now,"" Patron's Amber Atherton said. ""Every site has the same font, every interface feels so familiar.""

Making a company stand out is hard, especially for AI startups.

""AI just kind of has a branding problem,"" Harmon said. ""The valley adopts it … but there's something sort of ominous about something coming for your job.""

Day Job worked with Stuut, which uses AI to process payments, to push against that narrative and presented it as a fun tool.

""This isn't some scary tech thing,"" Harmon said about Stuut's branding. ""It's helping you get your job done so you can go home at five to hang out with your family and can go to your kids' soccer game.""

Harmon highlighted how Stuut's mascot, a cartoon inspired by vintage clock-in-clock-out machines, is shown eating invoices, and when scrolling to the bottom of the site, ""gives you a little kiss.""

""Storytelling is kind of everything,"" Atherton said. ""Whether it's fundraising, or hiring, or IPOing — that is so important.""

VCs need branding, too.

Atherton said she came to Day Job after hearing about their work with TBPN. The firm wanted ""the most non-VC website possible,"" she said.

When working with clients, Day Job will act as a sort of therapist, probing founders with existential questions. For instance, when working with Patron, Atherton said Day Job asked the VC firm's founding partners to ""talk about each other and why you like working with each other and what makes you a strong partnership.""

Day Job's style isn't for everyone.

""You've got to be bold, a little bit, to work with them,"" Atherton said.

Hays compared the agency's vibe to the hip LA neighborhood of Silver Lake, adding that Day Job's aesthetic is ""timeless yet internet native.""

""It's never been easier to generate creative assets,"" Hays said. ""Anybody can go on ChatGPT or Nano Banana and say, 'Make me a website.'""

But Hays said that AI is ""creating more demand than ever"" for creative minds who can ""think differently"" and ""break through the noise.""

It's something Harmon is taking solace in as he looks forward to the future of creative agencies like his own.

""No AI is going to tell you to name your protein brand David,"" he said.

And brands are, meanwhile, learning the hard way that not all AI will help you stay relevant or in favor of consumers.

""We may become more valuable in a way because everything goes to the mean,"" Harmon said. ""AI is good at outputting things that have already happened, but they're not good at figuring out what's next.""

Not long ago, bank software developers only had to adjust to major technological shifts every few years. Today, those shifts are arriving every other month.

Engineers are in ""continuous learning mode"" as they race to keep up with the rate of change, Trevor Brosnan, Morgan Stanley's global head of technology strategy, architecture, and modernization, told Business Insider.

Technologists on Wall Street today are often grinding through capstone-style courses, working on basic communication skills, or watching a bunch of YouTube-style videos as many banks help them upskill to keep pace with AI advancements.

""Something you thought you knew about AI three months ago might be out of date by now,"" Jonathan Lofthouse, the chief information officer at Citi, said.

Banks from JPMorgan to Citi are pouring billions into AI to make their workforces more efficient, deliver better client experiences, and ultimately cut costs. They're also scrambling to recruit the talent needed to bring those strategies to life.

The engineers who do best at these banks will be those who learn how to use AI effectively — and the banks are going to great lengths to help them learn fast, according to Alexandra Mousavizadeh, the cofounder and co-CEO of Evident, which tracks AI use in the financial industry.

And when it comes to recruiting new talent, a willingness to take advantage of the ""continuous learning"" is crucial.

""We are hiring for potential upskilling,"" Nish Rana, the senior director of Enterprise Data at Capital One, said of his hiring for the bank's AI and machine learning capabilities. Business Insider spoke with technology leaders at Citi, Morgan Stanley, and Capital One about their strategies for upskilling their engineering ranks. Citi and Morgan Stanley respectively employ 30,000 and 15,000 developers, and Capital One has around 15,000 engineers.

""It's a lot of time spent now on helping accelerate developers' adoption, so that they can become more aware of these and give back some of their capacity,"" Dov Katz, a distinguished engineer at Morgan Stanley, said.

One key part of that upskilling involves learning how to talk to agents, much as they would with another engineer.

Developers need to communicate with the newest generation of generative AI tools in English, not in code, ""and not everybody in technology has a reputation for being an excellent communicator,"" Katz said. As Citi's Lofthouse put it, most developers' second language is Java.

""And actually, Java is sometimes a bit easier to express problems in than a first language,"" he said, especially when it comes to describing the complexities of the financial markets.

It's important to give an AI agent as much guidance as possible on the task to perform and the desired output, said Brosnan.

""That is a shift from, 'Okay, I'm the person writing all the code, but have a little assistance,' to now, I'm giving much bigger tasks and delegating them to an agent,"" Brosnan said. Everyone he works with is learning that skill in real time to use the tools most effectively. It is, he said, a ""fundamental shift"" in what it means to work as a developer.

That's not to say that coding is irrelevant — all of the technology leads said it's still important to know foundational coding languages, especially since humans have to check all of the code that AI agents write.

Capital One has developed its own AI Academies, Rana said, which are ""considered a one-stop solution to grasping fundamentals, all the way up to advanced learning."" The courses cover tech initiatives within the bank, including AI/ML Foundations, ML Modeling, and Research & Prototyping.

""New engineers who are coming into our company don't necessarily need to have an extensive background,"" Rana said. ""We have formal training that can bring them up to speed in a very consolidated and accelerated way.""

Morgan Stanley also offers a mix of outsourced and in-house courses, and Citi recently ran a ""Techflix"" series, where anyone on the technology and business enablement team could watch videos and participate in associated challenges, some of which related to AI.

Each of the banks Business Insider spoke to said they offer engineers video modules to master emerging AI skills. Brosnan said they can be as short as five minutes. He added that many employees learn a lot from YouTube, whether for work or personal interests, and that videos have proven to be a powerful tool.

Beyond their AI-specific upskilling efforts, the banks Business Insider spoke with have continued with older programs, like hackathons and technology all-hands meetings. Opt-in programs are hugely popular, Brosnan and Lofthouse said, and have proven to be crucial educational architecture as the pace of learning continues to accelerate.

Learning opportunities aside, the rate of change is a source of anxiety for many engineers, as some worry the shine of a computer science degree is fading in a world where bots can spit out code at record speed. Yet the tech leaders said that AI will ultimately let their engineers, equipped with the right skills, focus on higher-order thinking and higher-impact work.

""There's anxiety about the change, but it's balanced by how exciting it's going to be,"" Lofthouse said.

Rana said that some veteran engineers are anxious about keeping pace with the rapid shifts in AI.

Everything his team is doing — from AI academies to online videos to tech talks — is aimed at giving engineers not only the tools to succeed, but the ""psychological safety net"" of learning in a comfortable corporate sandbox.

OpenAI staff recently shared several tips for getting more out of ChatGPT. I tried them, and it felt like my chatbot got smarter.

The tips came from Christina Kim, a research lead in post-training, and Laurentia Romaniuk, a product manager for model behavior, in an episode of ""The OpenAI Podcast"" published Wednesday.

Kim said users should throw ChatGPT ""harder questions"" so it can ""decide how much it wants to think."" The tougher the prompt, the deeper the reasoning.

Scrolling through my old chats, I realized I'd been doing the reverse — but for good reason. My job is to take complicated ideas and translate them for a general audience, so I mostly use ChatGPT for clarity checks or background research.

This week, I was reading about embodied intelligence and asked ChatGPT an easy question: ""What is embodied intelligence?"" It gave a clean, simple answer: AI systems embedded in physical agents like robots.

Wanting to understand the mechanics behind the concept, I asked a harder question: ""How do robots fuse vision, audio, touch, and feedback in real time?""

That's when the model shifted gears. It talked about multimodal sensor fusion, specialized encoders, and cross-modal alignment — terms I'd never seen before and sounded like something overheard in a robotics lab.

I asked if this was PhD-level. ChatGPT answered: ""Yes — roughly master's-to-early-PhD level.""

Romaniuk shared that her brother, a biochemical Ph.D., once complained ChatGPT Pro was responding at an undergrad level — until she told him to specify his expertise. After he primed the model as a ""frontier researcher,"" it produced an insight so advanced it mirrored a breakthrough his lab had made just two weeks earlier.

I'd never experimented with assigning the model a persona, so I figured I'd try it on a low-stakes question: my coffee preference.

As someone who prefers cappuccinos to lattes, my usual explanation is simple: It tastes punchier and less milky.

I asked ChatGPT to become a barista who studied coffee the way sommeliers study wine and explain my preference to me.

The cappuccino-latte divide became a masterclass. It broke the differences into texture, flavor balance, and mouthfeel. A cappuccino is light on top and dense underneath; the foam ""lifts"" the espresso, sharpening its flavor. A latte, on the other hand, is silkier and more uniform, with milk that folds into the espresso and softens it.

I can now explain my coffee preference with something more informed than ""it tastes nicer.""

Romaniuk said memory is one of ChatGPT's strengths. It lets the model infer what a user really wants or proactively surface information they might care about.

Romaniuk said the way to stay in control is to audit what the model remembers: Delete anything you don't want it holding onto, or toggle memory on and off in the settings so the chatbot only draws from what you choose.

It's something I've been doing. I don't turn memory off because most of what I share ends up being useful later. But I do clear out meaningless or throwaway chats so they don't clutter things or muddy what the model learns about me.

It's paid off. ChatGPT now understands me as a journalist who interviews AI founders by day and trains for fitness races after hours. It answers like it knows I'm just as likely to ask about model behavior as I am about Hyrox training plans.

Kim said users can ask ChatGPT to help come up with better prompts.

I needed to understand free-electron lasers, which help create the high-energy light sources behind semiconductor manufacturing (for journalism, of course). Instead of pretending I knew what to ask, I asked ChatGPT what questions I should be asking it.

It responded with a set of ""high-leverage questions"" — grouped from foundational to research-level — that showed me exactly how to think about the technology. For someone without much technical background, this framing was helpful. ChatGPT was teaching me how to ask smarter questions.

Romaniuk said she switches between ChatGPT's personality modes ""all the time"" to understand how each one feels. It's part of her job shaping model behavior.

One of her favorites is the ""nerd"" mode, which gives the model a ""very exploratory response style,"" she said.

I love a good cynic, so I asked ChatGPT in ""cynical mode"" to explain embodied intelligence.

It didn't move my work forward, but the explanation made me laugh: ""Embodied intelligence is one of those tech terms people throw around like everyone has a robotics Ph.D. hiding under their bed.""

""People in AI land obsess over this.""

Romaniuk said she likes to ""pressure test"" the model — pushing it to its limits to see how it's changing over time.

For something that couldn't work now, it might work in three months' time. ""Just keep at it, keep playing, keep trying,"" Romaniuk added.

I've been ""pressure testing"" the model through my Korean studies, regularly throwing it prompts that stretch its ability to break down the language. I've spent months asking ChatGPT to teach me grammar, extract vocabulary from worksheets, and explain unfamiliar sentence structures.

Earlier versions often pulled out the wrong words or mixed up written forms. Now, it parses text accurately, distinguishes between formal and polite forms, and explains grammar in clear, beginner-friendly steps.

The tips made my use of ChatGPT feel more intentional. Some effects were small, others more striking, but they certainly nudged the model to reveal more of what it can do.

Amazon kicked off December with AWS re:Invent, its technology conference that Bank of America analysts think marks a fresh bull signal in the AI trade, and one that's set to lift a handful of chip stocks higher. 

The investment bank laid out its bullish thesis on several tech stocks in the semiconductor space this week, explaining why it thinks a handful of companies will benefit as Amazon doubles down on its AI push. 

 Nvidia in BofA's least surprising pick to win from more AI spending. The chip king is the most likely beneficiary, particularly given its recent partnership with AWS. Yet, a few other stocks the bank likes are not as well known. 

The collaboration between Amazon and Nvidia, revealed at the event, is a multi-year partnership. It centers on the incorporation of Nvidia's NVLink Fusion interconnect technology, which enables strong communication between different AI chips at extremely high bandwidths.

""Our $275 PO is based on 28x CY27E PE ex cash, within NVDA's historical 25x-56x forward year PE range, which we believe is justified by NVDA's leading share in fast-growing AI compute/networking markets,"" BofA analyst Vivek Arya noted.

The five stocks he sees as likely winners are as follows:

Fabless chipmaker Astera Labs dipped on news of the partnership on the concern that NVLink Fusion could replace its own technology.

Arya thinks that the selloff may be premature, though. In his view, demand for various AI chips may increase as Amazon and Nvidia move forward together, indicating that Astera Labs may not end up losing any business.

Another name on the list of top chip stocks is AMD, an Nvidia rival that AWS has been a longtime customer of. Arya noted that while the event didn't include any specific mentions of AMD's AI accelerators, his team expects to see this relationship continue.

""Regardless, AMD continues to believe they have line of sight into several GW scale AI deployments, as per their recent analyst day,"" the analyst added.

BofA didn't dive deeply into fellow chipmaker Marvel Technology, though it also listed it as a likely beneficiary, citing its vast portfolio of data center networking tools, including connectivity components that play a pivotal role in new AI infrastructure upon which companies like AWS depend.

Credo Technology Group is the final company mentioned by BofA's team list of chip stocks likely to benefit from AWS' AI push.

While Arya's team provided little direct context on the connectivity solutions company, he implied that significant growth in the area of high-speed data-center connectivity may help Credo rise in the coming year.

President Donald Trump is done waiting for Congress when it comes to blocking state AI regulations.

Trump said on Monday that he would sign an executive order aimed at ensuring that there's only ""One Rulebook"" for AI in the US, saying that the technology will be ""destroyed in its infancy"" if companies have to comply with different regulations across all 50 states.

""We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won't last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""You can't expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something. THAT WILL NEVER WORK!""

It is not yet clear what shape the executive order will take, but a draft executive order seen by Business Insider last month would have directed the Department of Justice to sue states for having ""onerous"" AI laws.

One thing is clear: Trump is likely to provoke backlash from members of his own party if he follows through with this, as many Republicans have been eager to protect states' rights when it comes to AI.

The fault lines on this issue became clear over the summer, when Republicans tried to enact a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulations via the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""

That provision ultimately got watered down over time before being stripped out of the bill in a 99-1 vote in the Senate in the final hours before passage.

Trump recently called for Republicans to include a version of that provision in a must-pass annual defense bill, but that didn't come to pass. On Sunday, lawmakers released the text of that bill, and it did not include the provision.

In the meantime, the Trump administration has sought other ways to prevent states from enacting AI laws. An ""AI Action Plan"" released by the White House in July calls for withholding federal funding from states with ""burdensome"" AI laws.

Young people entering the job market are facing the toughest conditions in years — but artificial intelligence isn't the reason.

A new analysis from a London-based economics consultancy suggests something much more old-fashioned is going on: Companies simply aren't hiring.

Since 2023, unemployment among new entrants to the US labor force has jumped more than 2.5 percentage points — a sharp contrast with older workers, whose jobless rates have remained flat, according to the analysis from Dario Perkins, a managing director at Global Data.TS Lombard.

""For the AI maximalists, this is 'proof' that companies are deploying the technology rather than hiring graduates. And it is also consistent with what business leaders are saying, with 'AI' now a synonym for 'cost cutting,'"" wrote Perkins.

But Perkins argues the real reason is simply the normal course of business.

""US hiring is weak across the board. In fact, the economy as a whole is currently experiencing recessionary levels of job creation,"" he wrote.

Perkins' analysis shows that sectors with higher AI exposure are not experiencing larger increases in unemployment.

The report identifies three main drivers behind the hiring slowdown — and none involve automation replacing workers.

First, firms rapidly expanded their workforces during the post-pandemic surge and are now normalizing head count.

Second, policy uncertainty has made businesses cautious about taking on new staff.

Third, Trump-era tariffs have squeezed profit margins, prompting companies to push for more output from existing employees instead of hiring new ones.

This leaves young people getting squeezed, but the good news is that net employment is stable.

The job outlook should improve once hiring rebounds, Perkins wrote.

""When the economy reaccelerates and hiring rates recover, new entrants' employment prospects should improve,"" he wrote.

Perkins' report came as markets continue to assess the impact of AI technology on the economy and employment.

Other analysts have concluded that young tech workers seem to be taking the brunt of the impact. The unemployment rate for 20- to 30-year-olds in tech has risen by nearly 3 percentage points since early 2024, over four times the increase in the overall jobless rate, according to Goldman Sachs in an August report.

In October, Goldman warned of an era of ""jobless growth"" in the US due to AI, even as the broader economy remains strong.

AI companies are prioritizing flash over substance, says Surge AI's CEO.

""I'm worried that instead of building AI that will actually advance us as a species, curing cancer, solving poverty, understanding universal, all these big grand questions, we are optimizing for AI slop instead,"" Edwin Chen said in an episode of ""Lenny's"" podcast published on Sunday.

""We're basically teaching our models to chase dopamine instead of truth,"" he added.

Chen founded AI training startup Surge in 2020 after working at Twitter, Google, and Meta. Surge runs the gig platform Data Annotation, which says it pays one million freelancers to train AI models. Surge competes with data labeling startups like Scale AI and Mercor and counts Anthropic as a customer.

On Sunday's podcast, Chen said that companies are prioritizing AI slop because of industry leaderboards.

""Right now, the industry is played by these terrible leaderboards like LMArena,"" he said, referring to a popular online leaderboard where people can vote on which AI response is better.

""They're not carefully reading or fact-checking,"" he said. ""They're skimming these responses for two seconds and picking whatever looks flashiest.""

He added: ""It's literally optimizing your models for the types of people who buy tabloids at the grocery store.""

Still, the Surge CEO said that AI labs have to pay attention to these leaderboards because they can be asked about their rankings during sales meetings.

Like Chen, research scientists have criticized benchmarks for overvaluing superficial traits.

In a March blog post, Dean Valentine, the cofounder and CEO of AI security startup ZeroPath, said that ""Recent AI model progress feels mostly like bullshit.""

Valentine said that he and his team had been evaluating the performance of different models claiming to have ""some sort of improvement"" since the release of Anthropic's 3.5 Sonnet in June 2024. None of the new models his team tried had made a ""significant difference"" in his company's internal benchmarks or in developers' abilities to find new bugs, he said.

They might have been ""more fun to talk to,"" but they were ""not reflective of economic usefulness or generality.""

In a February paper titled ""Can we trust AI Benchmarks?"" researchers at the European Commission's Joint Research Center concluded that major issues exist in today's evaluation approach.

The researchers said benchmarking is ""fundamentally shaped by cultural, commercial and competitive dynamics that often prioritize state-of-the-art performance at the expense of broader societal concerns.""

Companies have also come under fire for ""gaming"" these benchmarks.

In April, Meta released two new models in its Llama family that it said delivered ""better results"" than comparably sized models from Google and French AI lab Mistral. It then faced accusations that it had gamed a benchmark.

LMArena said that Meta ""should have made it clearer"" that it had submitted a version of Llama 4 Maverick that had been ""customized"" to perform better for its testing format.

""Meta's interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers,"" LMArena said in an X post.

The race on Wall Street to deploy AI agents capable of handling end-to-end tasks is intensifying.

On Monday, BNY said it will embed Google Cloud's agentic AI technology — including Google's latest model, Gemini 3 — into the bank's internal AI platform Eliza, named after the wife of bank founder Alexander Hamilton. The upgrade of its technology stack is the latest step the bank — one of New York's oldest operating businesses — is taking to advance its AI ambitions.

By integrating Google Cloud's tech into Eliza — which already draws on multiple large language models — the firm is betting employees will be able to move faster through daily tasks, Sarthak Pattanaik, the bank's chief data and AI officer, told Business Insider. Take the tedious manual work of client onboarding: staff juggle document collection, verify ID and tax forms, locate key details, look up risk information, and log everything into internal systems. He said agentic AI could help orchestrate those steps, break tasks into smaller components, and deliver the required information in a more streamlined flow. 

""Eliza, through the agent tech workflow, is able to make the process much more simpler, efficient, and orchestrated, much more seamlessly,"" Pattanaik said.

Gemini 3, which debuted in mid-November, can interpret text, images, tables, PDFs, and audio together, allowing employees to load mixed financial materials and have the model interpret and synthesize what matters.

BNY's generative AI build-out began accelerating in 2023, and the bank has been keen to position itself as an early adopter of AI. Eliza now supports more than 120 automated tasks. Pattanaik added that nearly the entire firm has completed generative AI and responsible AI training.

In the bank's third-quarter earnings call, BNY CEO Robin Vince told analysts that the bank was leveraging agentic AI to deploy over 100 ""digital employees"" that are working ""side-by-side"" with staff on tasks such as payment validations and code repairs.""We believe our AI opportunity is significant, and we are pursuing it with urgency,"" said Vince.

Earlier this year, it announced a similar partnership with OpenAI, the maker of the popular consumer-focused large language model ChatGPT. On its website, it says it was ""the first major bank to deploy an AI Supercomputer (powered by NVIDIA) to accelerate processing capacity.""

While exciting, its expansion into agentic systems raises questions about how highly regulated institutions like BNY will ensure data privacy. Both BNY and Google emphasized that deploying agentic AI inside a regulated institution requires boundaries around what the technology can see, decide, or escalate.

Pattanaik said deploying agentic AI inside a bank demands strict oversight. He said each agent must pass an internal model-risk review before it goes live and emphasized that the systems are governed by tight access controls that determine what information they are allowed to use.

Once deployed, he added, the team monitors the agent's performance daily and incorporates those results into a continuous feedback loop.

Rohit Bhat, Google Cloud's head of financial services, told Business Insider that Google provides the safety mechanisms that restrict how agents communicate and what data each one can access. Agents have ""development kits"" and ""protocols"" to govern their communication with one another, Bhat said.

""The primary purpose of kits and protocols,"" he added, ""is to establish that communication pathway with those boundary conditions of, 'I'm only allowed to talk to this agent for the set of reasons and nothing else.'""

Major banks are embracing a mix of homegrown and external AI tools. Goldman Sachs has expanded its internal platforms while experimenting with technology from startups like Cognition Labs.

Dealmakers and investors have adopted tools from newer entrants like Hebbia, which offers prompt libraries and deep search. Morgan Stanley has deployed OpenAI technology to assist its financial advisors, while executives at JPMorgan have spoken publicly about the potential for junior employees to manage teams of AI agents.

Bhat said financial firms are becoming an important testing ground for agentic AI because their workflows involve heavy documentation, strict rules, and significant risk management.

Google's pitch is that Gemini can reason through lengthy materials while staying anchored to a firm's internal policies — a prerequisite for deploying agents across custody, markets, or onboarding.

""You need to make sure that whatever these agents are doing is grounded in the business context and in the business specificity,"" he said. ""That requires these models to be able to understand, and then also adhere to, certain policies and the rules,"" to make sure they meet ""the standards that you would want them to.""

The steel structure sealing off the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site has suffered so much damage that it's no longer containing radiation effectively, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Friday.

The agency, or IAEA, wrote in an update that its team had visited the protective shield in the prior week and found that it ""had lost its primary safety functions, including the confinement capability.""

This shield is known as the New Safe Confinement, or NSC, which was installed in 2016 as a second protective layer to stop the spread of radioactive material from Reactor Four of the Chernobyl power plant.

Damage to the shield increases the risk of leaks, which are difficult to contain because radioactive materials, such as gas and dust, can easily disperse widely and remain hazardous for extended periods.

The NSC fully encases an original, smaller concrete structure for containment called the Sarcophagus, built by the Soviet Union after Reactor Four exploded in 1986 and sparked a nuclear crisis across continental Europe.

The NSC, which cost $1.75 billion to install, was urgently needed because the Sarcophagus had an estimated lifespan of 30 years and wasn't airtight, allowing radioactive dirt and gas to escape.

Now, the IAEA said its team confirmed that the NSC can't do its job after being ""severely damaged"" by a drone strike in February.

The strike, which Ukraine has said was caused by a drone belonging to Russia, set fire to the steel structure's outer cladding.

""Limited temporary repairs have been carried out on the roof, but timely and comprehensive restoration remains essential to prevent further degradation and ensure long-term nuclear safety,"" said the IAEA's director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi.

The February drone strike left a roughly 160-square-foot hole in the shield, which is shaped like a massive aircraft hangar. At its tallest point, the shield stands at about 360 feet above the ground.

The fire created by the strike lasted for weeks, and the structure's main crane was damaged, the IAEA said earlier this year.

In the months following the strike, the IAEA reported that emergency work to extinguish the resulting fire had created about 330 openings in the NSC's outer cladding.

Authorities were initially concerned that radioactive dust around the shield could be scattered if the shelter was hit by an explosive. No radiation leaks were reported, authorities had said at the time.

The IAEA's latest findings, however, now indicate that the long-term damage to the NSC may be more significant than first understood. Still, the agency added that it hadn't found any risk to the shelter's load-bearing structures or monitoring systems.

The nuclear watchdog urged major repairs and upgrades to the shield, including humidity control measures and an improved program to monitor corrosion.

After the February drone strike, Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately targeting the Chernobyl disaster site, a claim that the Kremlin has denied.

The Chernobyl exclusion zone was initially captured by Russia in 2022 when its forces tried to sweep into Kyiv in the early months of the war.

Moscow later withdrew from the area, and Ukrainian authorities could resume work on the Chernobyl disaster site in April 2022.

Discovery after losing out to Netflix","https://www.businessinsider.com/paramount-wbd-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-hollywood-comcast-netflix-2025-12","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 14:22:00 GMT","

Paramount Skydance isn't ready to give up the fight for Warner Bros. Discovery.

The David Ellison-run company just launched a hostile, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD, even though Netflix agreed to buy WBD's streaming and studio assets last week in an $82.7 billion deal that includes $72 billion in equity.

Warner Bros. Discovery owns the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, HBO Max, and TV networks like CNN, TNT, and TruTV. Netflix's offer was valued at $27.75 per WBD share and did not include WBD's TV networks.

""Paramount's strategically and financially compelling offer to WBD shareholders provides a superior alternative to the Netflix transaction,"" Paramount said in a statement on Monday morning.

Read more about the battle for Warner Bros. Discovery:

Netflix's offer to buy Warner Bros., HBO, and other assets ""offers inferior and uncertain value and exposes WBD shareholders to a protracted multi-jurisdictional regulatory clearance process with an uncertain outcome along with a complex and volatile mix of equity and cash,"" the Paramount statement continued.

Paramount Skydance controls film studio Paramount Pictures, streamers Paramount+ and Pluto TV, broadcast network CBS, and cable channels like Comedy Central and MTV.

Ellison publicly made his case to shareholders and to WBD's board on CNBC on Monday morning.

""We have faster regulatory certainty to close,"" Ellison said. He called the deal ""pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,"" and ""pro-competition.""

Ellison said that only Paramount is willing to absorb WBD's TV networks, which he estimated are worth just $1 per share. He also has an all-cash offer.

""Cash is still king,"" Ellison said. He added that Paramount was told ""repeatedly"" by WBD's board that they wanted all cash.

Even before Paramount's hostile bid, the Netflix-Warner Bros. tie-up wasn't a lock, as it needs approval from regulators in the US and abroad.

""The Warner Bros. Discovery acquisition is far from over,"" said Ross Benes, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. ""Netflix is in the driver's seat but there will be twists and turns before the finish line. Paramount will appeal to shareholders, regulators, and politicians to try to stymie Netflix. The battle could become prolonged.""

WBD stock was up over 6% on Monday morning, and Paramount's was up about 3%. Netflix stock was down about 3%.

Paramount has already made major moves since its merger with Skydance, the production company founded by Ellison, finalized in August. The combined unit has since made a splash by buying UFC rights in the US, and by hiring former Netflix executives and the Duffer brothers, who created ""Stranger Things."" It also bought Bari Weiss' news startup, The Free Press, for $150 million and made her the editor in chief of CBS News.

A Paramount-WBD merger would combine two legacy Hollywood movie studios and pair Paramount+ with HBO Max, creating a streaming powerhouse capable of challenging Netflix, Disney, and Google's YouTube in the battle for engagement.

However, Ellison said on CNBC that a Netflix-HBO Max tie-up is what the entertainment industry should be concerned about. Ellison also laid out his case on the investor call on Monday.

""This transaction is about building more, not cutting back,"" Ellison said on the call.

""Our focus is on expanding creative output, not dominating the sector as Netflix envisions,"" he continued. ""Our goal is to make Hollywood stronger in a way that benefits the entire ecosystem.""

Although this deal requires regulatory approval from the US and foreign governments, some media insiders say Ellison's apparent rapport with Trump could make the process less painful.

A major question is whether regulators will view subscription-based streaming services as their own market — where a Netflix-WBD combination creates a colossus — or as part of a much larger entertainment ecosystem that includes traditional TV, as well as user-generated platforms like YouTube.

""When you look at category ambiguity, saying that streaming is not a market is a little bit like looking at the beverage market and saying that Coke and Pepsi can merge because Budweiser is a replacement,"" Ellison said.

Looking at it through the talent POV, Ellison said, ""Great showrunners are not saying, 'I'm going to take the next ""Game of Thrones"" to TikTok or Instagram.' They take it to streaming services.""

Then there's the Trump factor.

Entertainment lawyer Corey Martin of Granderson Des Rochers in Los Angeles previously told Business Insider that the normal state of play was ""out the window,"" given how the Trump administration values personal relationships. Trump has publicly praised the Paramount CEO, whose father, Larry Ellison, is a longtime ally of the president. Affinity Partners, the firm of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, is also part of the Paramount bid.

Trump commented on the Netflix offer on Sunday, saying the streamer had done a ""phenomenal job"" but had a ""very big market share.""

""So I don't know, that's going to be for some economists to tell,"" he said. ""And also, I'll be involved in that decision, too.""

Uber wants advertisers to level up their marketing by tapping into data on the millions of rides and deliveries its users order every day.

The ride-hailing giant's ad division is announcing the launch of a new insights platform called Uber Intelligence on Monday, the company exclusively told Business Insider.

Launched in partnership with the data-connectivity platform LiveRamp, Uber Intelligence will let advertisers securely combine their customer data with Uber's to help surface insights about their audiences, based on what they eat and where they travel.

It uses LiveRamp's clean room technology, which lets companies aggregate their data in a privacy-safe environment, without sharing or seeing each other's raw or personally identifiable customer information.

A hotel brand could use Uber Intelligence to help identify which restaurants or entertainment venues it might want to partner with for its loyalty program, for example.

Uber also hopes the platform can act as a flywheel for its broader ad business. Marketers can use the data clean room for segmentation, such as identifying customers who are heavy business travelers, then targeting them with ads on their next trip to the airport in the Uber app or on screens inside Uber cars.

""That seamlessness is why we're so excited,"" Edwin Wong, global head of measurement at Uber Advertising, told Business Insider in an interview. He added that the aim is for marketers to begin saying, ""'Oh, I'm not just understanding Uber, I'm understanding Uber in my marketing context.'""

Uber Intelligence is the latest step in the evolution of Uber's ad business. Uber officially launched its dedicated advertising division in 2022. It offers an array of ad formats in the Uber and Uber Eats apps, on in-car tablets, in emails to its users, and on car tops.

The company said in May that its ad business had reached a $1.5 billion revenue run rate — the figure it has projected to hit by the end of 2025 — which would represent a 60% increase on last year. The company doesn't break out a more specific ad-revenue figure and hasn't provided an update on the run-rate number since May.

Uber Intelligence forms part of a bespoke set of services it offers its top advertisers. Earlier this year, it launched a creative studio where brands can partner with Uber to deliver more bespoke campaigns, such as offering rides to Miami F1 Grand Prix attendees in a luxury vehicle sponsored by La Mer, packed with freebie skincare products.

Andrew Frank, analyst at the research firm Gartner, said the launch of Uber Intelligence is another signal that Uber's ad business is maturing.

""Early-stage ad businesses tend to focus exclusively on selling inventory while more mature ones focus more on delivering differentiated value through targeting and measurement solutions that help brands understand and optimize the impact of their spend,"" Frank told Business Insider.

Uber's unique source of ""terrestrial data"" put it in good standing against the likes of Amazon, Google, and other retail media networks that emphasize the value of their data-driven insights, Frank added. However, he said Uber may need to address privacy concerns related to aggregating highly sensitive data in order to maintain consumer trust and to comply with evolving global regulators as a collector of first-party data.

Vihan Sharma, chief revenue officer of LiveRamp, said its platform provides technical guarantees to ensure ""zero movement of data.""

""The whole objective of a clean room technology is to build trust between data owners and consumers and the advertising ecosystem,"" Sharma said.

The CEO of OnlyFans has a rule on how to rake in big bucks with a tiny team: don't hire middle managers. 

Keily Blair, OnlyFans' chief executive, spoke with Jeff Berman, the host of the Masters of Scale podcast, during the November Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon. 

Blair said in the interview that OnlyFans, a subscription-based content platform founded in 2016, has only 42 full-time employees. 

Berman chimed in, saying that it was ""very powerful"" that the company was making $7 billion in annual revenue with such a lean team. Blair said she was proud of her team, which she called a ""pretty efficient bunch.""

The key to this, she said, was to eliminate middle management roles in the company. 

""So we hire incredibly senior talent, and then we hire incredibly hungry junior talent, and we look for attitude and aptitude in hiring rather than experience,"" she said. 

""And we do not have that sort of squidgy layer of middle management in the middle, because nobody's ever had a really good middle manager in my experience,"" Blair added. 

She said that leaders in big companies are often judged by the number of people reporting to them, a concept she did not agree with. 

""We've said to our teams, 'You can be a team of one and deliver exceptional results, and that will be so valued,'"" she said. She added that there is no ""manager track"" for her staff's career progression in the company, and every OnlyFans employee is an individual contributor. 

OnlyFans, which initially started as a platform for creators to earn money from paywalled content, has become synonymous with adult, NSFW content. Blair, who became the company's CEO in 2023 after years of work as a lawyer, said in the interview that OnlyFans has 400 million users globally and 4 million content creators. 

OnlyFans' middle-managerless workforce aligns with the broader trend of Big Tech firms eliminating this layer of staff. In recent years, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Intel, and Google have all reduced the head count of middle managers, opting for a flatter hierarchy in the name of efficiency.

Tiger Global Management announced Monday the launch of its latest venture capital fund, Private Investment Partners 17, according to a letter to investors viewed by CNBC.

Tiger is targeting a raise of $2.2 billion for the fund, according to a person familiar with the firm's strategy who declined to be named in order to discuss internal matters.

The hedge fund wrote that it's expecting PIP 17 to be similar in ""strategy, size and construction"" to its earliest vintages and its most recent, PIP 16, which targeted $6 billion but ultimately closed at $2.2 billion.

The largest positions in PIP 16 are OpenAI and Waymo, stakes that have helped performance rebound. In a call with investors, Tiger said that PIP 16 is up 33% year-to-date, while PIP 15 is up 16%. 

Compared to the megafunds of the early 2020s, the latest raise target signals a pivot to a more disciplined strategy for Tiger Global.

The firm was one of the biggest forces in the startup ecosystem over the last half-decade, but has seen heavy markdowns and slower deployment in the last few years. 

In 2021, the heyday of its ""spray and pray"" approach, it led 212 rounds, according to Crunchbase data. This year, it made just nine new private investments.

Tiger first invested in OpenAI in 2021 at a valuation of less than $16 billion and in Waymo that same year at $39 billion. 

The Tiger Global letter and audio of the investor call obtained by CNBC also signal some concerns about the potential for a bubble in artificial intelligence.

""[V]aluations are elevated, and, in our view, at times unsupported by company fundamentals,"" the firm wrote in the letter. ""We also recognize the importance of approaching a technological shift of this magnitude with some humility."" 

The strategy that founder Chase Coleman laid out is to prune aggressively and reinforce its biggest winners. 

Tiger says it has sold more than 85 companies from PIP 15, generating over $1 billion in proceeds. 

That money can now be recycled into follow-in investments for companies it considers winners. 

Some of the names Tiger said it would concentrate on include Revolut, a digital banking startup, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. 

Other companies Tiger is focusing on include police tech company Flock Safety, EV company Harbinger, e-commerce startup Rokt, freight company Cargomatic, and stablecoin startup BVNK, the investor presentation showed.

In this article

McDonald's will soon assess its franchisees on how their prices deliver value as the company updates its franchising standards as part of a larger bid to win over cash-strapped diners.

""Effective January 1, 2026, we are enhancing our global franchising standards across all Segments to reinforce accountability for value leadership,"" Andrew Gregory, McDonald's senior vice president of global franchising, development and delivery, wrote in a memo issued Monday and obtained by CNBC. ""With enhanced standards, we aim to provide greater clarity to the System to ensure every restaurant delivers consistent, reliable value across the full customer experience.""

Franchising standards are the policies that define how McDonald's operators should run their restaurants. Continued noncompliance with those standards could result in penalties, like not being permitted to open another restaurant, or even the termination of the franchise. 

Franchisees run about 95% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide and set their restaurants' prices, with input from third-party pricing advisors. Under the new standard, the company will ""holistically assess"" pricing decisions for how well they offer value, Gregory wrote in the memo.

""This approach enables franchisees to bring local insight to how value is delivered in their restaurants,"" he said.

The change comes after McDonald's U.S. President Joe Erlinger told owners last month that they needed to keep their foot on the gas and stay the course on promoting the chain's value offerings.

Across the restaurant industry, eateries have been leaning into value, betting that deals will attract cash-strapped customers. But discounts that are too steep can cut into profits, and operators have to strike a delicate balance to preserve both traffic and long-term profitability.

For more than a year, McDonald's has reported that low-income consumers have been spending less money and visiting less frequently. To bring diners back to its restaurants, it has rolled out value menus in the U.S. and other key markets like France and Germany. The efforts have so far paid off, as the company has reversed same-store sales declines and attracted more high-income diners who are trading down to fast food.

Still, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said he expects that the pressure on the consumer isn't going away anytime soon.

""We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,"" Kempczinski said on the company's earnings conference call last month. 

The company's change in standards is likely to rile some McDonald's U.S. franchisees who already have a contentious relationship with their franchisor. An independent advocacy group of McDonald's operators has pushed for the company to contribute financially to make discounts more sustainable for franchisees in the long run. Several years ago, a new grading system for franchisees drew the ire of some operators, who said at the time that it would alienate workers in a tight labor environment.

In addition to updating the franchising standards, McDonald's has also invested in tools to help franchisees determine how to address value in their local markets.

""While Owner/Operators continue to set their own prices and make decisions that reflect local market nuances, we've now strengthened individual accountability for value leadership – equipping you with approved pricing consultants, tools, and other levels that support informed choices and elevate the overall guest experience across all order points,"" McDonald's USA Chief Restaurant Officer Mason Smoot wrote in a separate memo sent to U.S. franchisees Monday and obtained by CNBC.

In this article

NextEra Energy is partnering with Exxon Mobil, the country's largest oil company, to build a large data center site powered by natural gas for a potential tech customer, CEO John Ketchum told investors Monday 

The 1.2 gigawatt power plant would combine gas generation with Exxon's carbon capture technology to reduce emissions, according to NextEra's presentation to investors. 

They plan to market the site to a hyperscaler in the first quarter of 2026. Hyperscalers are the big tech companies that are building data centers to train and run artificial intelligence applications. There is no signed agreement with a hyperscaler yet. 

NextEra and Exxon have secured 2,500 acres of land for the facility. The site will be located in the Southeast in close proximity to Exxon's carbon dioxide pipeline infrastructure, according to NextEra. 

NextEra is the largest renewable energy developer in the U.S., but it is leaning into natural gas to meet the growing demand from data centers. The power company plans to bring as much as 8 gigawatts of gas generation online by 2032, and is developing a pipeline of 20 gigawatts of gas generation. 

NextEra plans to build 15 gigawatts of power for data center hubs by 2035, Ketchum said. That includes at least three data center campuses that NextEra is developing with Alphabet's Google. 

""A lot of those will get started with what I call bridge power — renewables, storage,"" the CEO said. ""We're also at that same time planning for the gas to come behind it.""

The tech sector has primarily secured renewables and increasingly nuclear power to supply data centers in an effort to meet its climate targets.

Apple chip leader Johny Srouji addressed rumors of his impending exit in a memo to staff on Monday, saying he doesn't plan on leaving the company anytime soon.

""I love my team, and I love my job at Apple, and I don't plan on leaving anytime soon,"" he wrote.

Bloomberg reported on Saturday that Srouji had told CEO Tim Cook that he was considering leaving, citing people with knowledge of the matter. 

Srouji is seen as one of the most important executives at the company and he's been in charge of the company's hardware technologies team that includes chip development. At Apple since 2008, he has led teams that created the M-series chips used in Macs and the A-series chips at the heart of iPhones. 

The memo confirming that he plans to stay at Apple comes as the company has seen several high-profile executive exits in the past weeks, raising questions about the stability of Apple's top leadership.

In addition to developing the chips that enabled Apple to drop Intel from its laptops and desktops, in recent years Srouji's teams have developed a cellular modem that will replace Qualcomm's modems in most iPhones. 

Srouji frequently presents at Apple product launches. 

""I know you've been reading all kind of rumors and speculations about my future at Apple, and I feel that you need to hear from me directly,"" Srouji wrote in the memo. ""I am proud of the amazing Technologies we all build across Displays, Cameras, Sensors, Silicon, Batteries, and a very wide set of technologies, across all of Apple Products.""

Last week, Apple announced that its head of artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, was stepping down.

Two days later, the company announced the departure of Alan Dye, the head of user interface design. Dye, who was behind the ""Liquid Glass"" redesign, is joining Meta.

A day after Dye's departure, Apple announced the retirement of general counsel Kate Adams and vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives Lisa Jackson. Both Adams and Jackson reported directly to Cook.

Apple's chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, retired this fall.

Paramount Skydance is launching a hostile bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery after it lost out to Netflix in a monthslong bidding war for the legacy assets, the company said Monday. 

Paramount will go straight to WBD shareholders with an all-cash, $30 per share offer. That's the same bid WBD rejected last week and equates to an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. 

The offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private equity firm RedBird Capital as well as $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo Global Management, Paramount said in a news release. 

A portion of the equity financing comes from outside Middle Eastern financing partners including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's L'imad Holding Company PJSC, and the Qatar Investment Authority. Another portion derives from Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. Kushner is U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law. 

Those partners have agreed to ""forgo any governance rights,"" including board seats, as part of their non-voting equity investment, according to a Paramount filing. The modifications allow the deal to be outside of the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. 

Shares of Paramount were 7% higher in morning trading Monday. Warner Bros. Discovery's shares were up about 5% while Netflix was down more than 4%.

""We're really here to finish what we started,"" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Monday. ""We put the company in play."" 

Paramount Skydance began its hunt for Warner Bros. Discovery in September, submitting three bids before WBD launched a formal sale process that ultimately brought in other suitors. 

On Friday, Netflix announced a deal to acquire WBD's studio and streaming assets for a combination of cash and stock, valued at $27.75 per WBD share, or $72 billion. Paramount had been bidding for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including those assets and the company's TV networks like CNN and TNT Sports. 

""We're sitting on Wall Street, where cash is still king. We are offering shareholders $17.6 billion more cash than the deal they currently have signed up with Netflix, and we believe when they see what it is currently in our offer that that's what they'll vote for,"" Ellison said. 

Ellison said Monday he places a value of $1 per share on the linear cable assets, which are set to trade as a separate public entity called Discovery Global in mid-2026. WBD executives have privately valued the assets closer to $3 per share. 

Paramount has repeatedly argued to the WBD board of directors that keeping Warner Bros. Discovery whole is in the best interest of its shareholders. 

Paramount made a bid on Dec. 1 and heard back from WBD that it needed to make certain alterations to the offer, Ellison said Monday. When Paramount made the changes and upped its bid to $30 per share, Ellison never heard back from WBD CEO David Zaslav, he said.

Ellison said he told Zaslav via text message that $30 per share wasn't the company's best and final offer, suggesting the company is willing to bid higher still.

Ellison argued Paramount's deal will have a shorter regulatory approval process given the company's smaller size and friendly relationship with the Trump administration. He called Trump a believer ""in competition"" and said Paramount's combination with WBD will be ""a real competitor to Netflix, a real competitor to Amazon.""

Ellison also threw cold water on Netflix's chances of regulatory approval.

""Allowing the No. 1 streaming service to combine with the No. 3 streaming service is anticompetitive,"" Ellison said.

CNBC reported Friday that the Trump administration was viewing the deal with ""heavy skepticism,"" and Trump said Sunday that the market share considerations could pose a ""problem."" 

Netflix agreed to pay Warner Bros. Discovery $5.8 billion if the deal is not approved, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday. Warner Bros. Discovery said it would pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it decides to call off the deal to pursue a different merger.

Netflix, for its part, once again championed the deal as positive for shareholders, consumers and the media industry as a whole when its top leadership spoke at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference on Monday. 

Co-CEO Greg Peters said they recognize the Netflix deal came as a shock but called the Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max content complementary to Netflix's business.

Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the acquisition would protect jobs at a time when layoffs have been rampant across media: ""In the offer that Paramount was talking about today, they also were talking about $6 billion of synergies. Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. So we're not cutting jobs, we're making jobs.""

In this article

President Donald Trump expressed skepticism on Sunday night about Netflix's proposed acquisition of parts of Warner Bros. Discovery, saying the massive deal ""could be a problem"" because of how much market share Netflix would end up with.

Trump also said that he will be involved in the process of approving the deal, which was announced on Friday.

The streaming giant Netflix needs regulatory sign-off for its planned purchase of WBD's film studio and streaming properties, including HBO Max. The deal has an enterprise value of nearly $83 billion.

Paramount Skydance on Monday said it was launching a hostile bid to buy all of WBD after losing out to Netflix. Larry Ellison, the billionaire father of Paramount CEO David Ellison, is close to Trump.

David Ellison told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Monday, ""We've had great conversations with the president about this, but I don't want to speak for him.""

Paramount revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its bid is being backed by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is a former White House advisor. 

The filing also said other outside financing partners included the investment funds of three Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar.

Kushner's firm, Affinity Partners, and the Gulf funds ""have agreed to forgo any governance rights – including board representation – associated with their non-voting equity investments,"" the filing said,

""Accordingly, the Transaction will not be within CFIUS's jurisdiction,"" the filing said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews such investments.

 Asked Sunday if WBD's deal with Netflix should be allowed, Trump said, ""Well, that's the question.""

""They have a very big market share,"" the president said, referring to Netflix.

""And when they have Warner Brothers, you know, that share goes up a lot,"" Trump told reporters on the red carpet before an event at the Kennedy Center in Washington.

""So I don't know, that's going to be for some economists to tell,"" Trump said. ""I'll be involved in that decision, too.""

Trump said that Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos made no guarantees about the merger when he visited the Oval Office last week.

""He's a great person,"" Trump said of Sarandos. ""He's done one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies and other things, and he's got a lot of interesting things happening, aside from what you're talking about.""

""But it is a big market share. There's no question,"" Trump said. ""It could be a problem.""

A senior Trump administration official told CNBC on Friday that the administration views the deal with ""heavy skepticism.""

The proposed acquisition has raised antitrust concerns from lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said it ""looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare.""

Paramount warned WBD's lawyers in a recent letter that a sale to Netflix likely would ""never close"" because of regulatory challenges in the U.S. and abroad, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Comcast also had sought to buy WBD's film and streaming assets.

In addition to the sale of those assets to Paramount, WBD plans to spin out Discovery Global, which would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels. 

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

A powerful 7.6-magnitude earthquake shook northeastern Japan late on Monday, prompting tsunami warnings and orders for about 90,000 residents to evacuate.

The Japan Meteorological Agency said a tsunami as high as 3 metres (10 feet) could hit Japan's northeastern coast after the earthquake struck off the coast at 11:15 p.m. (1415 GMT).

Tsunami warnings were issued for the prefectures of Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate, and tsunamis from 20 to 70 cm (7 to 27 inches) high were observed at several ports, JMA said.

The epicentre of the quake was 80 km (50 miles) off the coast of Aomori prefecture, at a depth of 50 km, the agency added.

On Japan's 1-7 scale of seismic intensity, the tremor registered as an ""upper 6"" in Aomori prefecture -- a quake strong enough to make it impossible to keep standing or move without crawling. In such tremors, most heavy furniture can collapse and wall tiles and windowpanes are damaged in many buildings.

As of 1700 GMT, there was little information of major damage or casualties from public broadcaster NHK. It cited a hotel employee in Hachinohe as saying a number of people were injured and taken to the hospital, but that all were conscious.

""As of now, I am hearing that there have been seven injuries reported,"" Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi told reporters early on Tuesday morning. 

East Japan Railway suspended some services in the area, which was also hit by the massive 9.0-magnitude quake in March 2011. 

""There is a possibility that further powerful and stronger earthquakes could occur over the next several days,"" a JMA official said at a briefing.

Following the tremor, the JMA issued an advisory for a wide region from the northernmost island of Hokkaido down to Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, calling on residents to be on alert for the possibility of a powerful earthquake hitting again within a week.

No irregularities were reported at nuclear power plants in the region run by Tohoku Electric Power and Hokkaido Electric Power, the utilities said. Tohoku Electric initially said thousands of households had lost power but later lowered that number to the hundreds.

The yen weakened against major currencies after news of the tremor, before regaining some ground. The dollar touched a session high and was trading at around 155.81 yen around 1533 GMT, while the euro also hit a session high.

Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries, with a tremor occurring at least every five minutes. Located in the ""Ring of Fire"" of volcanoes and oceanic trenches partly encircling the Pacific Basin, Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater.

The northeastern region suffered one of the country's deadliest earthquakes on March 11, 2011, when a 9.0-magnitude tremor struck under the ocean off the coast of the northern city of Sendai. It was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan and set off a series of massive tsunamis that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and killed nearly 20,000 people.

The 2011 tsunami also damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, leading to a series of explosions and meltdowns in the world's worst nuclear disaster for 25 years.

Drawing on lessons from that disaster, when a magnitude 7-level earthquake had struck two days beforehand, the government now issues a one-week ""megaquake"" advisory whenever a significant earthquake occurs in the region. In a similar vein, a megaquake advisory was issued in August last year for the Nankai Trough area in central-southern Japan.

In this article

IBM announced Monday it is acquiring data streaming platform Confluent in a deal valued at $11 billion.

Shares of Confluent soared 29%. IBM's stock climbed about 1%.

""Data, and especially real-time data, is incredibly important to how an enterprise functions,"" IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Monday. ""Nobody can live with month-old data, or even week-old data, and Confluent has the most capable technology to unlock the real-time value of data.""

Krishna said Confluent will be part of its software unit.

IBM will pay $31 per share in cash for all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Confluent, according to a release. The transaction is expected to close by the middle of 2026. Shares of Confluent closed at $23.14 on Friday.

""With the acquisition of Confluent, IBM will provide the smart data platform for enterprise IT, purpose-built for AI,"" Krishna said in a release.

IBM said the deal will bolster its artificial intelligence offerings as it expects global data growth to more than double by 2028, with the movement into AI agents accelerating in 2026.

""I think this ability to now have one layer, one control plane, where people can manage to give data to the AI agents, but still manage to make sure that it's done with the correct security and the correct controls, I think, is going to unlock a lot,"" Krishna told CNBC.

Wedbush called it a ""strong move"" from IBM that adds more data processing capabilities to its hybrid cloud ecosystem and is a natural fit to help eliminate data silos for powering AI.

""We loudly applaud this deal as Arvind takes IBM further into the AI Revolution with more acquisitions likely ahead,"" the analysts said in a note.

Wedbush maintained its overweight rating on IBM and $325 price target. IBM closed at $307.94 on Friday.

The addition of Confluent fits with IBM's deal last year to land cloud software maker HashiCorp for $6.4 billion and the 2023 move to acquire Apptio in a deal valued at $4.6 billion. Both of those acquisitions were all-cash deals.

Confluent has more than 6,500 clients across major industries and works with Anthropic, Amazon's AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft, Snowflake and others.

In this article

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced a number of structural changes before the legendary CEO steps aside at the end of this year, among them the departure of Todd Combs, investment manager and Geico CEO.

Combs, 54, will be joining JPMorgan Chase as head of the bank's new Security and Resiliency Initiative, to find direct equity investments in the defense, aerospace, health care and energy industries.

Combs ""has resigned to accept an interesting and important job at JPMorgan,"" said Buffett, 95, in a press release from Berkshire. ""Todd made many great hires at Geico and broadened its horizons. JPMorgan, as usually is the case, has made a good decision.""

Combs joined Berkshire in 2010 from his hedge fund Castle Point and was brought in, along with Ted Weschler, to help manage Berkshire's portfolio of investments. Buffett is handing over the CEO reins to Greg Abel in 2026 and Combs' departure leaves some questions as to how the sizable equity holdings of Berkshire, which include Apple, Bank of America and Coca-Cola, will continue to be managed when he steps down. 

Berkshire shares traded lower on Monday following the management changes with perhaps some concern that other executives could depart when Buffett is no longer at the helm. Berkshire's B shares were last off by about 2.5%.

Among some of the other notable changes at Berkshire are the retirement effective in June 2027 of Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg, who served under Buffett for 40 years. Charles Chang, current CFO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy will succeed him. Nancy Pierce, chief operating officer of Geico, will replace Combs as CEO of Geico. 

The conglomerate also said the CEO of its NetJets unit, Adam Johnson, will serve in a new role as president of Berkshire's consumer products, service and retailing businesses. Abel will directly oversee the remaining noninsurance businesses, Berkshire said.

Combs, who was a member of JPMorgan's board of directors, will also become a special advisor to CEO Jamie Dimon. Combs is giving up his board seat as he moves into the new role.

""Todd Combs is one of the greatest investors and leaders I've known, having successfully managed investments alongside the most respected and successful long-term investor of our time, Warren Buffett,"" said Dimon in a release. ""Having served nine years on our Board, he truly understands all aspects of our company, and he supports the role we play helping make the world better and safer for all its citizens.""

Combs will have $10 billion to deploy to start with for JPMorgan's new initiative, which the bank said will ultimately commit $1.5 trillion to spur economic growth and ""to make the world more secure.""

The Security and Resiliency Initiative will have an outside council to guide its strategy which includes, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Dell Chairman Michael Dell, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Despite his advanced age, Buffett surprised shareholders at the conglomerate's annual meeting in May when he said he would be stepping aside for Abel, who is 63 and current vice chairman of noninsurance operations. The stock has underperformed this year in part because of angst over what Berkshire will look like after Buffett, who took over the textiles manufacturer in 1965 and turned it into an investment holding company that went on to post an unprecedented long-term track record. 

Berkshire shares are up 9% this year, below the 16.6% return of the S&P 500. Buffett, who will remain chairman, noted in a Thanksgiving message that he still feels good, however he is moving slowly and reading with ""increasing difficulty.""

The wave of capital pouring into artificial intelligence infrastructure is far from peaking, said Ben Powell, chief investment strategist for APAC at BlackRock, arguing the sector's ""picks and shovels"" suppliers — from chipmakers to energy producers and copper-wire manufacturers — remain the clearest winners as hyperscalers race to outspend one another.

The surge in AI-related capital expenditure shows no sign of slowing as tech giants push aggressively to secure an edge in what they see as a winner-takes-all contest, Powell told CNBC Monday on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Finance Week.

""The capex deluge continues. The money is very, very clear,"" he said, adding that BlackRock is focused on what he called a ""traditional picks and shovels capex super boom, which still feels like it's got more to go."" 

AI infrastructure has been one of the biggest drivers of global investment this year, fueling a broader market rally, even as some investors question how long the boom can last.

Nvidia, whose GPU chips are the backbone of the AI revolution, became the first company to briefly surpass $5 trillion in market capitalization amid a dizzying AI-fueled market rally that sparked talk of an AI bubble. 

Microsoft and OpenAI also reached a restructuring deal in October to support the ChatGPT developer's fundraising efforts. OpenAI has reportedly been preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at $1 trillion, according to Reuters.

The build-out has set off long-term procurement efforts across the tech sector, from chip supply agreements to power commitments. Grid operators from the U.S. to the Middle East are racing to meet soaring electricity demand from new data centers. Companies, including Amazon and Meta, have budgeted tens of billions of dollars annually for AI-related investments.

S&P Global estimates data-center power demand could nearly double by 2030, mostly driven by hyperscale, enterprise and leased facilities, along with crypto-mining sites.

Powell also noted that leading tech firms have only begun to tap capital markets to fund the next phase of AI expansion, suggesting additional capital is on the way. 

""The big companies have only just started dipping their toes into the credit markets… feels like there's a lot more they can do there,"" he said.  

The ""hyperscalers"" are behaving as if coming second would effectively leave them out of the market, Powell said. That mindset, he added, has pushed firms to accelerate spending even at the risk of overshooting.  

Much of that capital, Powell noted, is likely to flow to the companies powering the AI build-out rather than model developers, reinforcing a growing view among global investors that the most durable gains from the AI boom may lie in the hardware, energy and infrastructure ecosystems behind the technology.

""If we're the recipients of that cash flow, I guess that's a pretty good place to be, whether you're making chips, whether you're making energy all the way down to the copper wiring,"" Powell noted, expecting ""positive surprises driving those stocks in the year ahead.""

U.S. Treasury yields moved higher Monday as traders looked ahead to the last Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year.

The 10-year Treasury yield was up more than 2 basis points at 4.168%. The 30-year Treasury yield also rose more than 2 basis points to 4.813%, while the 2-year Treasury yield climbed less than 2 basis points to 3.583%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Markets are expecting that the Fed will cut its key interest rate at its final meeting of the year, with traders pricing in around a 90% chance of a 25-basis-point cut when the central bank concludes its two-day meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Investors priced in a near 67% chance of a cut one month ago.

On Friday, Morgan Stanley reversed its December call to a quarter-percentage point cut, with strategists saying ""it seems we jumped the gun."" JPMorgan and Bank of America are also forecasting a cut based on more recent dovishness from Fed officials.

It follows last week's data releases from payroll processor ADP, which reported a surprising decline in private payrolls, and the Labor Department, which showed jobless claims for the week ended Nov. 29 fell to the lowest level since September 2022.

Elsewhere, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that the holiday season has been ""very strong,"" suggesting that the U.S. economy would end the year on a strong footing.

""The economy has been better than we thought. We've had 4% GDP growth in a couple of quarters,"" he said in an interview on CBS News' 'Face the Nation.' ""We're going to finish the year, despite the Schumer shutdown, with 3% real GDP growth.""

Across the Atlantic, European central banks will also be watching the Fed's decision as their own final policy meetings take place this week and next. The Swiss National Bank will deliver its latest policy update on Thursday and rate decisions are expected from the Bank of England and European Central Bank on Dec. 18. 

Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan is also set to hold its last policy meeting of 2025 on Dec. 19.

Tensions are mounting once again between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the White House leader accused Ukraine's head of state of not even reading the U.S.' peace proposals yet.

""I'm a little bit disappointed that President Zelenskyy hasn't yet read the proposal, that was as of a few hours ago,"" Trump told reporters on Sunday night.  ""His people love it, but he hasn't [read it],"" Trump added.

""Russia, I guess, would rather have the whole country when you think of it, but Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I'm not sure that Zelenskyy is fine with it,"" Trump said.

It's uncertain which version of the U.S.-backed peace plan for Ukraine Trump was referring to but the president's comments came a day after talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials ended in Miami without an apparent agreement over the latest version of a draft peace plan.

There have been several versions of the purported peace plan as Russia and Ukraine have haggled — via their American intermediaries — over key details within the deal, particularly when it comes to demands for territorial concessions by Russia and security guarantees for Ukraine. 

Trump's outgoing Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg remarked Sunday that a deal to end the war was ""really close"" and that it depended on resolving two main outstanding issues: the future of Ukraine's Donbas eastern region, which is broadly occupied by Russian forces, and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.

Ukraine has given a more cautious appraisal of the talks' progress with Zelenskyy saying in his nightly address Sunday that the Miami talks — held between his new chief negotiator Rustem Umerov and Ukraine's military chief of general staff, General Andriy Hnatov, and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner — were ""constructive, though not easy."" 

Zelenskyy said he would have a detailed debrief with his negotiating team in person rather than over the phone, noting, somewhat pointedly, that ""some matters can only be discussed in person.""

Zelenskyy travelled to London for talks on Monday as Kyiv and its European allies scramble to ensure that Ukraine's territorial integrity and future security (as well as Europe's) are not compromised in the face of growing U.S. pressure to agree to peace proposals initially seen as heavily favorable to Russia.

Zelenskyy met U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz for talks ""which will focus on the ongoing peace negotiations and next steps,"" Downing Street said Sunday. Zelenskyy will also travel to Brussels and Rome for further talks this week.

Ukraine's European allies are anxious to be seen and heard as peace proposals are discussed without their involvement, particularly given the security ramifications any deal will have for the wider continent.

The U.K. and France have been leading proponents of a ""Coalition of the Willing,"" a group of countries that could be part of a ""reassurance force"" in a post-war Ukraine that helps to guarantee its security. 

Russia vehemently opposes the idea of foreign troops being deployed in Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying they would be ""legitimate targets.""

European leaders will be feeling more nervous about the U.S.' potential for accommodating Russian demands after the release of Trump's latest national security strategy last Friday, which said Europe risked ""civilisational erasure"" and that it was ""far from obvious"" whether European countries can ""remain reliable allies."" The document also stated that Washington should reestablish strategic stability with Russia.

The Kremlin on Sunday praised the new strategy, saying it largely accorded with Russia's ""vision.""

While both the U.S. and Russia share a mutual desire for a future rapprochement, some distance remains when it comes to an immediate peace agreement over Ukraine. 

Talks between Witkoff, Kushner and Russian officials held in Moscow last week also concluded without a breakthrough, with Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov telling reporters that the discussions were ""very useful, constructive, and highly informative"" but that there was more work to be done.

The Kremlin also commented on Trump's criticism of Zelenskyy, with Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov telling reporters Monday:

""We don't know exactly what disagreements there are. What matters to us is this: A thorough amount of work was done in Moscow during Putin's meeting with Witkoff and Kushner and afterward, Witkoff and Kushner continued working with the delegation of Ukrainian negotiators led by Umerov on the basis of the results achieved in Moscow,"" he said, in comments translated by NBC News.

""Now it's important for us to understand what the outcome of that work is. It's clear that both sides now understand that such work needs to be done in silence. This kind of work cannot be conducted entirely in public. It's counterproductive. Most importantly, it prevents results from being achieved. So we expect to receive this information. Once we do, things will become clear,"" he stated.

Magnum Ice Cream Company debuted on the Amsterdam stock exchange on Monday, completing its long-awaited spinoff from Unilever as it looks to reinvigorate growth amid challenges from health-conscious consumers and high-profile public spats with Ben & Jerry's.

The stock opened at 12.20 euros, slightly below its reference share price of 12.80 euros. It was last trading at 12.87 euros as of 10:30 a.m. London time, giving it a market capitalization of about 7.9 billion euros ($9.2 billion). Secondary listings are also taking place in London and New York. 

""We became the global leader in ice cream as part of the Unilever family,"" CEO Peter ter Kulve said. ""Now, as an independent listed company, we will be more agile, more focused, and more ambitious than ever.""

Unilever first announced plans to spin off its ice cream unit, which includes Ben & Jerry's, Magnum and Cornetto, in March last year. The company is now the world's largest standalone ice cream business.

""The reason that Unilever decided to spin off Magnum is really because they haven't been able to focus on it,"" RBC's James Edwardes Jones told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" 

""They haven't had the bandwidth to accommodate Magnum at the same time that they're really pushing ahead on their personal care strategy. And as a result of that, the idea of the IPO of Magnum is that they're going to have a dedicated management able to focus on costs, on capital expenditure and so on, really 100% focused on the ice cream business.""

The consumer goods giant faced pressure from investors to overhaul its sprawling business. Its ice cream division, which generated 7.9 billion euros ($9.2 billion) in revenue in 2023, would perform better as a stand-alone business. 

Magum in September set a target to grow revenue between 3% to 5% in the medium term from 2026.

""The fact that they've been run as an independent business since July this year has really enhanced that ability to focus [on the ince cream business] and on that basis, I think we can see how they could get up to probably the bottom end of that range, but the 3%+ to 5%, that feels very, very ambitious,"" said Edwardes Jones.

""There's a strong emerging market angle, and it has a leading market share in its industry, with some very powerful brands,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""On the downside, you have commodity exposure, you have this governance issue with Ben & Jerry's, which is a major challenge, and you have a business that's pretty much weather related,"" he told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday. 

""Also, there is the suspicion that, given that it has been perhaps run for cash, and it's a fairly capital-intensive business, there'll need to be some fairly substantial investment going forward as well.""

The consumer staples category is expected to face challenges due to health-conscious consumers and the booming weight loss drug business pioneered by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Magnum has suggested that these factors could cost the company about half a percentage point per year in revenue, Mould said, adding that management may come up with new formats to counter the trend.

Magnum Ice Cream now inherits a long-running public dispute with the founders of the almost 50-year-old Ben & Jerry's.

Founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield have become increasingly outspoken regarding their dissatisfaction with the direction of the brand they sold to Unilever in 2000. In September this year, they launched a campaign to ""Free Ben & Jerry's"" calling for it to become an ""independently owned company, with socially-aligned investors.""

""Ben & Jerry's social mission has always been inseparable from the brand itself, no matter how much Unilever / Magnum have tried to distance the two,"" Cohen said Monday.

""[Magnum's] attempts to dismiss our campaign show that they see the risk our vocal community poses to the rest of their ice cream business. This risk can't be scooped out, and pretending a spin-off will make it disappear shows how deeply they misunderstand this brand and its supporters.""

Speaking to the Financial Times, Magnum's CEO Peter ter Kulve called on Ben & Jerry's co-founders Cohen and Greenfield to ""hand over to a new generation."" Cohen responded by accusing Magnum of attempting to silence the brand's social mission.

Strategy bought 10,624 Bitcoin between December 1 and 7.

Michael Saylor had hinted about the purchase yesterday.

The MSTR stock is up almost 2% today, rebounding from last week's closing price.

Michael Saylor's Strategy, previously MicroStrategy, has made another weekly Bitcoin purchase despite concerns that it may need to sell some of its BTC holdings in a prolonged bear market. This latest purchase comes amid a rebound in the Bitcoin price, while the MSTR stock is also up in pre-market trading.

In a press release, the company announced that it acquired 10,624 BTC for $962.7 million at an average price of $90,615 per Bitcoin and has achieved a BTC yield of 24.7% year-to-date (YTD). It now holds 660,624 BTC, which it acquired for $49.35 billion at an average price of $74,696 per Bitcoin.

Strategy's SEC filing shows that the company made this latest purchase with net proceeds from the sales of its MSTR and STRD stock. It raised $928.1 million and $34.9 million from these stocks, respectively.

As CoinGape reported, Saylor hinted at the BTC purchase in his conventional X post. He posted the company's Bitcoin portfolio tracker with the caption, “₿ack to Orange Dots?”

Strategy continues to accumulate more BTC despite concerns that it may sell at some point, considering the current market conditions. The company's CEO, Phong Le, had previously stated that they might need to sell to fund dividend payments if the mNAV drops below 1x.

However, the company has since set up a $1.44 billion USD reserve, which Phong Le clarified means that they do not need to sell for the next three years. The USD reserve is expected to cover around 21 months of dividend and interest payments, with plans to further increase the reserves over time.

Meanwhile, Strategy's announcement of this latest purchase comes amid a rebound in the Bitcoin price. The flagship crypto has again broken above the psychological $90,000 level.

The MSTR stock has also rebounded alongside Bitcoin. Yahoo Finance data show the stock has climbed above $180 and is trading around $182, up almost 2% from last week's close of $178.

In an X post, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci described Saylor as “the man” for his company's Bitcoin accumulation efforts. He noted that the Strategy founder built a USD backstop and then got back to selling equity to buy BTC, which further strengthens the balance sheet.

Scaramucci also mentioned that the equity sales are accretive but very “smart” for his company's balance sheet and the overall Bitcoin market. Notably, this latest purchase is one of the largest this year. It tops the $836 million BTC purchase it announced three weeks ago.

Strategy's largest purchase this year came in July when it bought 21,021 BTC for $2.46 billion. The company raised the funds through its STRC offering, which at the time was the largest IPO of the year.

Blackrock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) signage at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York after launching in January 2024.

BlackRock Inc.'s flagship Bitcoin ETF has delivered strong returns since its launch — but for most investors, the outcome has been far more modest.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker IBIT) posted a more than-40% annualized return from its January 2024 debut through November 2025, data compiled by Bloomberg show, even after the recent crypto selloff. But the average investor earned just 11% annualized over the same period, according to new analysis by Morningstar. Much of that disconnect owes to poor timing: many investors piled in only after the fund had already surged — underscoring how market timing can blunt even the best-performing products.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Key Takeaways

Investor Mike Alfred predicts Bitcoin could reach $315,000.

Harvard University significantly increased its Bitcoin holdings over gold.

But analysts warn of potential short-term consolidation.

Bitcoin's long-term bullish narrative received another injection of optimism this week after prominent investor Mike Alfred predicted the asset would surge to $315,000.

The comments follow new disclosures showing that Harvard University significantly increased its Bitcoin exposure in the third quarter, potentially leaving gold behind.

However, analysts have offered a more cautious outlook for the future amid shifting market liquidity and on-chain indicators.

Alfred, a technology investor and early Bitcoin advocate, reiterated his optimistic outlook on X, publishing a series of price targets including BTC at $315,000 and ETH at $20,000.

He said the recent rally marked the beginning of a new bullish cycle, arguing that Bitcoin “was not in a bull market since 2021” but is now entering a “stage 1 uptrend.”

“The bull market is just starting… I am bullish. I have longs on,” Alfred wrote. “I've added numerous long positions. I don't think we will be seeing new lows this cycle.”

In another post, he warned that a “massive liquidity tsunami is about to hit,” adding that bearish forecasts circulating online amounted to “bear porn” that would leave skeptics “broke.”

The bullish comments come as Harvard University's latest portfolio disclosures revealed that the institution increased its Bitcoin investment from $117 million to $443 million in Q3, according to Bitwise Investment CIO Matt Hougan.

Harvard also reportedly expanded its gold ETF holdings from $102 million to $235 million.

Hougan said the allocation shift underscored how even legacy institutions were positioning for currency-debasement risks.

“Harvard decided to put on a debasement trade and it allocated to Bitcoin 2-to-1 over gold,” Hougan wrote on X.

Alfred's new forecasts, along with Harvard's accumulation of Bitcoin, align with a recent wave of optimistic projections from high-profile market participants.

In November, Alfred himself predicted a Bitcoin price of $200,000, meaning his bullishness has increased by a full $100,000 in less than a month.

Meanwhile, Fundstrat's Tom Lee claimed that Bitcoin is likely to reach $250,000 “within a few months.”

Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week, Lee also suggested that Ethereum could reach $62,000, calling it “grossly undervalued.”

In April, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson told CNBC that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 next year, basing the growth on institutional adoption.

Despite rising institutional allocations and bullish sentiment from some investors, several analysts caution that the market may still be entering a consolidation phase.

Victor Olanrewaju, an analyst at CCN, said on-chain data shows Bitcoin has fallen below the 111-day moving average, a level tracked by the Pi Cycle Top indicator.

“This position signals a weakening of short- to mid-term momentum after the recent drawdown,” he said, noting that similar dips historically preceded consolidation phases.

Olanrewaju warned that if the trend persists, Bitcoin could decline to below $85,000 in the near term.

However, he added that renewed demand could push the price back toward $108,372, near the 111-day moving average.

Meanwhile, CCN analyst Valdrin Tahiri said on-chain metrics also point toward a deeper correction.

“If history repeats itself, Bitcoin may still experience one more sharp decline before bottoming out,” he said.

BlackRock filed an S-1 registration statement with the SEC on Friday for ETHB—a new staked Ethereum trust exchange-traded fund.

Unlike the firm's popular iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF (ETHA), the staking Ethereum trust ETF will track the performance of Ethereum and add rewards earned from the trust's staked ETH.

“The trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of Ethereum and staking some portion of the Ethereum it holds (which may vary from time to time),” the filing reads.

The firm's S-1 registration filing follows the November formation of the Delaware statutory trust, an act that typically precedes the ETF filing for crypto and commodity products. 

Previously, BlackRock had sought approval to add a staking component to its spot Ethereum ETF, ETHA. While the SEC had acknowledged requests as early as July, it continued to push back a formal decision, last delaying a decision in early September.

It's unclear how ETHB's filing will affect any plans for staking additions to ETHA. A representative for BlackRock told Decrypt the firm could not comment on its ETHB ETF filing at present time.

Ethereum staking ETFs hit the market following the creation of generic listing standards for commodity trusts. Grayscale's ETHE was first to market in early October, followed by the REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF.

But so far, they haven't eaten into the success of BlackRock's existing spot ETF.

ETHA has more than $11 billion in funds under management, or around 3.6 million ETH, compared to less than $5 billion (or 1.8 million ETH) for Grayscale's ETHE and ETH Mini Trust ETFs combined.

BlackRock's ETF success is also apparent in the Bitcoin market, highlighted by its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which is the largest crypto ETF on the market with around $70 billion in assets under management. 

IBIT is up around 1% on Monday as Bitcoin has fallen 1% in the last 24 hours to trade at $90,390. ETHA has jumped more than 3% as Ethereum is roughly flat, changing hands at $3,122. 

When approved, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHB) is expected to trade alongside BlackRock's other ETFs on the Nasdaq exchange.

BlackRock has officially filed for a staked Ethereum ETH$3,128.44 exchange-traded fund, marking a key step in bringing staking exposure to the masses.

The world's largest asset manager submitted an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. SEC on Friday. The filing kicks off the review process, but to trigger a formal deadline for SEC approval or denial, the fund's listing exchange must still submit a separate 19b-4 form.

The proposed fund, called the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB), was first hinted at in November when BlackRock registered the name in Delaware. That move signaled intent but didn't count as a formal application with the SEC.

This isn't BlackRock's first Ethereum ETF. The firm launched the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) in July 2024 alongside other issuers. But at the time, the SEC—then led by Chair Gary Gensler—reportedly instructed firms to strip out staking components from their filings. The agency had previously argued that staking services offered by platforms like Kraken and Coinbase could constitute unregistered securities offerings.

Under new Chair Paul Atkins, that position appears to be softening. BlackRock and VanEck are now among several issuers resubmitting or amending ETF filings to include staking. While others are modifying their existing products, BlackRock opted to launch an entirely new fund.

ETHA, which holds about $11 billion in ETH, will remain separate from the staking version. The staked fund, if approved, would give investors exposure to Ethereum's yield-generating mechanism without having to stake assets themselves.

This kind of volatility leaves many investors puzzled, wondering what they should do. Most specifically, many ask themselves what the best altcoins are to buy in a situation like this.

As it turns out, the best answer to this question is given by DeepSnitch AI, in two different (though related) senses. First, because DeepSnitch AI is an AI-powered business intelligence tool that helps you answer investment questions, including “what are the best altcoins to buy now?” Second, because DeepSnitch AI is one of the best altcoins to buy now.

On December 4, the giant crypto exchange Kraken announced a new special VIP service, targeted to its Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) clients. The program will provide high-touch services to wealthy individuals, family offices and private clients, including trading insights, but also “extraordinary experiences” such as Formula 1, cultural events and intimate meet-ups. In order to qualify, an investor needs a $10 million average balance or $80M in annual trading volume.

If you are asking yourself, “What does this have to do with me at all, I'm not a UHNW person?”, the answer is that it actually has a lot to do (if you're not asking yourself that… congratulations!). The reason is that these programs attract new capital in big numbers, and that benefits your portfolio, even if you are not a UHNW person.

As 2026 comes in, and big investors pour in more money, it is a good time to think of a few breakout altcoin picks that, who knows, might one day give you a Kraken VIP membership.

DeepSnitch AI is one of the best altcoins to buy now because it has greater growth potential than virtually any other crypto, whether already in the market or in presale. This is due to its combination of an impressive AI-powered tool with real-life utility and a massive target market.

The system is composed of five AI agents (3 of which are already alive and thinking) that transform crypto data into business intelligence. Those hundreds of millions of crypto holders that can't afford to have a 24/7 Kraken VIP advisor will nonetheless have an AI tool that will guide them every day.

That DeepSnitch AI is the next likely crypto eruption is being increasingly realised by many, as its presale numbers show. In just the second stage, more than $675k has been raised. The entry price is still only $0.02629, and on top of that, you get a 50% or 100% if you buy at least $2,000 or $5,000, respectively.

But in order to reap the benefits of a potential 100x rise, investors need to buy now into the presale. Prices are rising fast, and the bonuses will disappear at the end of this year.

Sui is one of the best altcoins to buy right now because it is an undervalued altcoin. SUI was launched one year ago, trading at $4.22. By January 4, it had reached an all-time high of $5.35, but then started to descend throughout the year (with ups and downs), and is now trading at about $1.61.

This downtrend, however, is due to a certain extent to the general trend in the crypto market as a whole. And there are signs of some rotation from big Layer-1 coins like ETH and SOL to mid-tier ones, which should push prices up.

The case for including Flare among the best altcoins to buy is similar to that of Sui. FLX is also undervalued, but the most important aspect is that it is an altcoin with major upside. This can be seen by comparing the price of FLX with its market cap, since the coin entered exchanges almost 3 years ago.

While the general trend in FLX's price is descending, the one for its market cap is ascending. This means that the market has been positively absorbing FLX coins as the circulating supply (which right now is about 80% of the total supply) increases.

The best altcoins to buy today are those that can thrive next year based on utility and adoption. DeepSnitch AI is the best example of that.

But in order to enjoy what could be exponential returns of 100x or more, you have to invest now. Failing to take advantage of the current bonuses of 50% (Code: DSNTVIP50) and 100% (Code: DSNTVVIP100) might make all the difference.

Visit the official website to buy into the DeepSnitch AI presale now, and visit X and Telegram for the latest community updates.

A baseline scenario has $4 as the year-high. That's more than 100% above its current price.

Because it shows adoption and expansion. That places Flair among the best altcoins to buy.

Its unparalleled combination of an incredibly useful tool with a massive adoption potential.

Ondo Finance, a tokenized Treasury protocol, today joined the Blockchain Association to help advance pro-innovation digital asset policies in the US.

The move comes after Ondo concluded an SEC investigation, clearing the path for its expansion in tokenized asset operations. The platform tokenizes real-world assets to bring institutional-grade finance onchain while maintaining regulatory compliance through alignment with SEC practices.

The Blockchain Association advocates for the US digital asset industry through partnerships and regulatory submissions. The organization recently provided recommendations to the CFTC for clarifying perpetual derivative contracts and developing innovation-friendly pilots for tokenized collateral.

These recommendations emphasize including non-custodial infrastructure and stablecoins in CFTC pilots for tokenized collateral to enhance settlement efficiency, aligning with Ondo's focus on tokenized asset operations.

The Trump administration did not mention cryptocurrency or blockchain in its latest national security strategy, despite the industry's growing ties to the financial system and President Donald Trump's claim of increased competition from overseas.

Trump's national security strategy, outlining his administration's priorities, released on Friday, instead said the “core, vital national interests” of the US revolved around artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

“We want to ensure that US technology and US standards — particularly in AI, biotech, and quantum computing — drive the world forward,” the administration said.

The omission of crypto from the national security strategy comes despite Trump telling CBS' 60 Minutes last month that he did not want to “have China be number one in the world in crypto” and has previously said he wants all Bitcoin (BTC) mining to take place in the US.

CIA Deputy Director Michael Ellis also said in May that crypto was “another area of technological competition where we need to make sure the United States is well-positioned against China and other adversaries.”

There is, however, one section of the document that states that Trump wants to preserve and grow “America's financial sector dominance” by using the country's “leadership in digital finance and innovation” to ensure market liquidity and security, which could be a hint at crypto.  

Trump has pushed forward crypto policies

The Trump administration has been supportive of crypto this year, moving forward with a slew of promised policies that have led to more financial institution adoption of the technology. 

Trump helped the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act become law and has signed executive orders creating a crypto task force and banning a central bank digital currency, while also overseeing federal agencies' abandonment of many crypto-related enforcement actions.

The administration has also established a Bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile, comprising forfeited digital assets, while the government is exploring “budget-neutral” methods of acquiring more. 

Bitcoin traded below $90,000 over the weekend as the market digested the national security strategy document, which called on US allies to “contribute far more” to defence.

It asked NATO countries to spend 5% of their GDP, up from the current 2%, which would mean heightened government borrowing that would drive up inflation, making it harder for central banks to cut interest rates.

The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision this week is what is driving crypto markets, with many hoping for a cut that historically spurs investors to make riskier bets.

The market is expecting interest rates to drop when the Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, with CME's FedWatch showing nearly 88.5% betting on a 25 basis point cut.

US President Donald Trump's new national security strategy is drawing attention for what it leaves out, not what it includes. The document, released this week, highlights threats from hostile states, the rise of artificial intelligence, and worries tied to quantum technology. But it does not mention crypto or blockchain at all, even after months of strong political talk around digital assets.

According to reports, the strategy outlines several areas Washington plans to strengthen, including defense modernization and partnerships with key allies. It also mentions how emerging tools like AI and biotech could shape competition in the years ahead.

Crypto, however, is missing from the list. That omission stands out because the administration previously backed a plan to build a national digital-asset reserve and had signaled that Bitcoin could play a role in long-term economic planning.

One part of the document mentions that Trump aims to maintain and expand “America's financial sector dominance” by leveraging the nation's “leadership in digital finance and innovation” to safeguard market liquidity and stability, which some interpret as a possible reference to crypto.



Observers say the silence does not match earlier moves. In January, Trump approved an order that encouraged agencies to prepare for a “digital-asset stockpile,” an idea tied to creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

That announcement caught global attention, especially after Bitcoin climbed past $126,000 earlier this year before falling to the $88,000 range during a market pullback.

Based on reports, some analysts believe the White House chose to keep crypto out of the national security framework to avoid shifting it into a military or defense category.

They argue that digital assets may stay under economic and financial oversight instead of being treated as a strategic security concern.

Others think the omission could weaken the momentum that crypto supporters hoped to see after months of praise from government officials.

Several industry voices say they expected at least a short reference to blockchain due to the technology's increasing presence in global payments and national-level discussions.

Reports have disclosed that developers and crypto policy groups were tracking the document closely, waiting to see if digital money would be acknowledged in the same way as AI or quantum computing.



That did not happen, and the silence left many wondering whether Washington sees crypto as a priority or just another financial tool.

The lack of any direct language about crypto may influence market expectations. Some investors considered the national security strategy an important signal that could shape future regulation or federal participation in the crypto economy.

Instead, the absence of a clear stance has raised questions about whether the US will slow its public adoption plans, even as other countries push ahead with central bank digital currency testing.

Bitcoin price today: gains to $90.8k as Fed cut bets remain firm

Make sure you own this 'structural winner', BofA says

S&P 500: Bull flag to new highs? Or double top and drop? BofA answers

Up 20%+ in a single week: Wall Street's most overlooked semiconductor breakout

Intercontinental Exchange just valued Polymarket at $9 billion. Let that sink in for a second. A prediction market platform that didn't even exist in mainstream consciousness three years ago is now worth more than some Fortune 500 companies.

But here's what's really interesting. This isn't just another crypto company getting a big valuation. Polymarket's success reveals something crucial: some financial markets literally cannot exist without blockchain. Period.

The numbers tell part of the story. Over $25 billion in trading volume. Partnerships stretching from Wall Street to the UFC. But the deeper story? It's about infrastructure that enables entirely new kinds of markets.

Prediction markets always had one massive problem. Who holds the money?

Think about it practically. You and I want to bet on Wednesday's Fed decision. Someone needs to hold our cash. Then they need to figure out who was right. Then pay the winner. At every step, we're trusting them not to mess it up or disappear.

Polymarket runs on Polygon. Your funds stay in your wallet. Smart contracts do everything else. When the outcome happens, winners get paid automatically. No arguments. No delays. No trust required because the code handles it.

Traditional financial systems genuinely cannot replicate this. There's always a middleman. Always someone you're trusting. Blockchain doesn't just improve this process - it fundamentally changes what's possible.

Polymarket bet everything on USD Coin. Seems boring, right? Wrong.

USDC holds steady at $1. You're betting on Fed policy, not worrying whether your stake just lost 15% because crypto crashed overnight. But you still get instant settlement, zero geographic restrictions, and fees measured in cents not dollars.

Someone in Kigali deposits USDC and starts trading in under five minutes. No bank account verification taking three weeks. No ""sorry, we don't operate in your country."" Transaction costs? Literally pennies compared to $25-50 for traditional international transfers that take days.

Most people miss this completely. A huge portion of Polymarket's volume comes from crypto prediction markets themselves.

Will Bitcoin break $100K? Will the SEC approve spot ETH ETFs? These markets are packed with traders. They're not casual bettors - they're sophisticated crypto investors hedging real positions and making serious size bets.

That money doesn't stay isolated. The liquidity spreads everywhere. Political markets get tighter spreads. Economic prediction markets become more efficient. All because crypto traders showed up first and brought capital with them.

After Polymarket spent $112 million acquiring CFTC-licensed infrastructure, they processed about $6 billion just in H1 2025. Crypto markets drove a meaningful chunk of that volume.

Here's where it gets wild. Polymarket isn't just using crypto infrastructure anymore. It's starting to move crypto markets.

When Polymarket odds shift dramatically on something like Bitcoin ETF approval, crypto prices move before any official news drops. The platform has become this real-time probability engine that institutional traders actually watch now.

Intercontinental Exchange figured this out fast. They're not just buying prediction market technology. They're acquiring access to market sentiment data that traditional finance doesn't have. The NYSE operator plans to distribute Polymarket's probability data to institutional clients.

Think about what that means. Wall Street is buying blockchain-generated market intelligence to make traditional investment decisions.

ICE dropped $2 billion on this. X integrated Polymarket directly into its platform. Major sports leagues are partnering up.

Even the CFTC, which kicked Polymarket out of the U.S. market years ago, approved their return through the QCEX acquisition. Regulators are learning to distinguish between ""speculative crypto stuff"" and ""blockchain infrastructure serving legitimate purposes.""

Prediction markets need what blockchain provides. Trustless operation. Total transparency. Programmable settlement. Global access. You simply cannot build these markets on traditional infrastructure.

Polymarket's $9 billion valuation isn't really about what they've done. It's about what Wall Street now believes is possible.

Traditional finance is recognizing that blockchain enables entirely new market categories. Not improved versions of existing markets - genuinely new things that couldn't exist before.

We're watching fundamental infrastructure questions get answered in real time. How should modern financial markets actually work? What does ""global access"" really mean? Who needs to be trusted and why?

Polymarket proved you can build serious financial infrastructure on blockchain that works better than traditional alternatives. Now that institutional players see it working at scale, the relationship between prediction markets and crypto infrastructure will only deepen. The question isn't whether blockchain matters for financial markets anymore. The question is which markets get rebuilt on blockchain infrastructure next.","{'href': 'https://www.investing.com', 'title': 'Investing.com'}","cryptocurrency"

The physical sculptures are accompanied by dynamic digital artworks.

Whatever happened to NFTs? you might be wondering if you've just joined us direct from 2021. After the NFT boom imploded, you would be forgiven for thinking that tokenised digital artworks no longer exists (see our explainer on What are NFTs?).

But not so. The concept behind NFTs lives on. It's just that brands might not be calling them that after the term became bound up with cryptocurrency speculation. Take the recent Marvel Masterpieces Avengers: Asprey Studio Collection.

Billed as Marvel's first fine art sculptures, the collection features physical models of 60 Marvel characters in sterling silver, and they're complemented by corresponding digital artwork. Just don't call them NFTs; they're ""dynamic digital art"".

Asprey says each digital work in the Marvel Masterpieces Avengers: Asprey Studio Collection is based on a single panel from early Marvel comic books but reimagined in 3D. Its team sculpted them by hand layer-by-layer using digital clay modelling and then animated them frame by frame.

The digital pieces were then minted on the Ethereal blockchain after purchase, in order to provide a record of authenticity and ownership, fulfilling the original objective behind the use of blockchain for non-fungible tokens.

“Each digital artwork is ‘alive',” says Alastair Walker, Chief Creative Officer at Asprey. “It moves very subtly and unpredictably. The average person spends 27 seconds looking at art, so we wanted to have the digital artwork look slightly different each time you see it.”

 




As for the physical sculptures, these were created by master silversmiths at the Asprey Studio Atelier in Kent, through a multi-stage process combining traditional silversmithing with modern techniques, the studio says.Alongside the main collection, Captain America (above), Iron Man, Thor, and Thanos have also been produced as one-off metre-tall sculptures. The pieces are intended to tap into recent interest in comic-derived imagery in fine art, as demonstrated by Jeff Koons's Hulk polychrome bronze sculptures.

Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.

Pieces will be on view at Asprey Studio's gallery in Mayfair, London, until February 2026. You can learn more on the website.

UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity Magazine

The UK's data protection watchdog has asked the government for urgent answers after a Home Office report revealed racial bias in the retrospective facial recognition (RFR) technology used by police.

Deputy information commissioner, Emily Keaney, said in a statement on Friday that the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) had asked the Home Office for “urgent clarity on this matter so we can assess the situation and consider our next steps.” 

The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) report, released on Thursday, tested the Cognitec FaceVACS-DBScan ID v5.5 algorithm.

RFR is used to match images captured from CCTV, mobile phone footage, dashcam/video doorbell footage or social media with those on the Police National Database.

An estimated 25,000 searches are run every month to catch potential criminals at large.

However, the report found that, “in a limited set of circumstances the algorithm is more likely to incorrectly include some demographic groups in its search results.”

Specifically, false positive rates for white subjects (0.04%) are far lower than those for Asian (4%) and black subjects (5.5%).

“The FPIR for black male subjects (0.4%) is lower than that for black female subjects (9.9%),” it added.

Keaney said the ICO acknowledges that measures are being taken by the Home Office to correct these biases.

“However, it's disappointing that we had not previously been told about this, despite regular engagement with the Home Office and police bodies as part of our wider work to hold government and the public sector to account on how data is being used in their services,” she added.

“While we appreciate the valuable role technology can play, public confidence in its use is paramount, and any perception of bias and discrimination can exacerbate mistrust. The ICO is here to support and assist the public sector to get this right.”

The Home Office said in its report that it had purchased a new algorithm on the back of the test's findings, adding that it “can be used at settings with no significant demographic variation in performance.”

It continued: “The new algorithm is due to be operationally tested early next year and will be subject to evaluation.”

The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) also acknowledged that the government has introduced “mitigations” to ensure bias in the RFR system does not impact policing. However, like the ICO, it expressed concerns about transparency.

“Although there is no evidence of adverse impact in any individual case, that is more by luck than design. System failures have been known for some time, yet these were not shared with those communities affected, nor with leading sector stakeholders,” it said in a statement.

“These technologies are increasingly invasive and sophisticated. If they are to gain the trust and support of the public, particularly those groups historically mistrustful of the police, then full transparency is vital.”

The APCC said that such technologies need to be robustly and independently assessed before being deployed, and feature ongoing oversight during operations, with clear accountability to the public when things go wrong.

“We call on policing and the government to acknowledge the errors made and to work with those responsible for policing governance, locally and nationally, to ensure that scrutiny and transparency are at the heart of the police reform agenda and the forthcoming white paper. Policing cannot be left to mark its own homework,” it added.","{'href': 'https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com', 'title': 'Infosecurity Magazine'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO: Home Office hushed up facial recognition biases","https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/08/ico_home_office_rfr/","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:16:00 GMT","

The UK's data protection watchdog has criticized the Home Office for failing to disclose significant biases in police facial recognition technology, despite regular engagement between the organizations.

Emily Keaney, deputy commissioner for the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), said the regulator only learned last week about historical bias in the algorithm used by UK police forces for retrospective facial recognition (RFR) within the Police National Database (PND).

""It's disappointing that we had not previously been told about this, despite regular engagement with the Home Office and police bodies as part of our wider work to hold government and the public sector to account on how data is being used in their services.

""While we appreciate the valuable role technology can play, public confidence in its use is paramount, and any perception of bias and discrimination can exacerbate mistrust. The ICO is here to support and assist the public sector to get this right.""

The ICO has requested urgent clarity from the Home Office to assess the situation and determine next steps.

Keaney's comments follow updated accuracy tests published on December 4, conducted by the National Physical Laboratory and commissioned by the Home Office. The tests examined two algorithms: Cognitec FaceVACS-DBScan ID v5.5, currently used by the Police National Database, and Idemia MBSS FR, planned for future deployments.

While Idemia's test results were nearly perfect both in ideal testing conditions and realistic operational deployments, Cognitec's algorithm showed significant weaknesses when identifying certain demographics under strict settings designed to eliminate false positives.

In Cognitec's case, when no restrictions were applied, it correctly matched an image of a suspect to an individual in the PND 99.9 percent of the time. However, when testers forced it to return results only when similarity scores were set to very high levels, effectively eliminating false positives, its accuracy dropped to 91.9 percent.

This strict setting showed the algorithm was best at identifying Asian subjects, with a 98 percent success rate. White subjects were correctly identified 91 percent of the time, and Black subjects in 87 percent of cases.

When the similarity scores were dropped but remained at high levels, false positive rates increased, disproportionately affecting certain demographics. In these tests, Black females were more likely to be falsely matched to a reference image than Black males, returning false positive rates of 9.9 percent and 0.4 percent respectively.

Removing gender from the equation, false positive rates for White subjects (0.04 percent) were far lower than those for Asian (4 percent) and Black (5.5 percent) subjects.

The The Register understands that RFR results are never used as evidence before undergoing a manual review, reducing the risk of images being used incorrectly, and training and guidance have been reissued to police forces nationwide following the report.

The government has also asked the Inspectorate of Constabulary to review police use of facial recognition technology, with assistance from the Forensic Science Regulator, in light of the tests.

A Home Office spokesperson, said it takes the findings of the report seriously. ""A new algorithm has been independently tested and procured, which has no statistically significant bias. It will be tested early next year and will be subject to evaluation.

""Our priority is protecting the public. This game-changing technology will support police to put criminals and rapists behind bars. There is human involvement in every step of the process and no further action would be taken without trained officers carefully reviewing results.""

The tests were published as the Home Office launched a consultation to expand police use of facial recognition, despite myriad criticisms of the technology across its varying types of deployment.

The UK government spends tens of millions on facial recognition technology every year, and has consistently vouched for its efficacy since the PND launched in 2011. ®

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has criticised the Home Office for failing to inform it about historical bias in the facial recognition algorithms used within the Police National Database.

Last week the National Physical Laboratory published a report of its independent testing of facial recognition algorithms commissioned by the Home Office.

In its report it noted that the police had made efforts to reduce bias through establishing training and guidance.

The ICO's deputy commissioner, Emily Keaney, has responded to the report expressing “disappointment” that despite the regulatory regularly engaging with the Home Office and police bodies, it had not been informed of this historical issue.

“Last week we were made aware of historical bias in the algorithm used by forces across the UK for retrospective facial recognition within the Police National Database,” said Keaney.

“We acknowledge that measures are being taken to address this bias. However, it's disappointing that we had not previously been told about this, despite regular engagement with the Home Office and police bodies as part of our wider work to hold government and the public sector to account on how data is being used in their services.”

Keaney said that “any perception of bias and discrimination can exacerbate mistrust” and has asked the Home Office for “urgent clarity on this matter so we can assess the situation and consider our next steps”.

Texas has launched its new cryptocurrency reserve with a $5 million purchase of Bitcoin as the state continues to embrace the volatile and controversial digital currency. 

The Texas Comptroller's Office confirmed the purchase was made last month as a “placeholder investment” while the office works to contract with a cryptocurrency bank to manage its portfolio. 

The purchase is one of the first of its kind by a state government, made during a year where the price of Bitcoin has exploded amid the embrace of the digital currency by President Donald Trump's administration and the rapid expansion of crypto mines in Texas. 

“The Texas Legislature passed a bold mandate to create the nation's first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock wrote in a statement. “Our goal for implementation is simple: build a secure reserve that strengthens the state's balance sheet. Texas is leading the way once again, and we're proud to do it.”

The purchase represents half of the $10 million the Legislature appropriated for the strategic reserve during this year's legislative session, but just a sliver of the state's $338 billion budget. 

However, the purchase is still significant, making Texas the first state to fund a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Arizona and New Hampshire have also passed laws to create similar strategic funds but have not yet purchased cryptocurrency. 

Wisconsin and Michigan made pension fund investments in cryptocurrency last year. 

The Comptroller's office purchased the Bitcoin the morning of Nov. 20 when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336, according to the Comptroller's office. As of Friday afternoon, Bitcoin was worth slightly less than the price Texas paid, trading for $89,406. 

University of Houston energy economist Ed Hirs questioned the state's investment, pointing to Bitcoin's volatility. That makes it a bad investment of taxpayer dollars when compared to more common investments in the stock and bond markets, he said. 

“The ordinary mix (in investing) is one that goes away from volatility,” Hirs said. “The goal is to not lose to the market. Once the public decides this really has no intrinsic value, then it will be over, and taxpayers will be left holding the bag.” 

The price of Bitcoin is down significantly from an all-time high of $126,080 in early October. 

Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, argued the state is making a good investment because the price of Bitcoin has trended upward ever since it first launched in early 2009. 

“It's only a 16-year-old asset, so the volatility, both in the up and down direction, will smooth out over time,” Bratcher said. “We still want it to retain some of those volatility characteristics because that's how we could see those upward moves that will benefit the state's finances in the future.”

Bratcher said the timing of the state's investment was shrewd because he believes it is unlikely to be valued this low again. 

The investment comes at a time that the crypto industry has found a home in Texas. 

Rural counties have become magnets for crypto mines ever since China banned crypto mining in 2021 and Gov. Greg Abbott declared “Texas is open for crypto business” in a post on social media.

The state is home to at least 27 Bitcoin facilities, according to the Texas Blockchain Council, making it the world's top crypto mining spot. The two largest crypto mining facilities in the world call Texas home. 

The industry has also come under criticism as it expands. 

Critics point to the industry's significant energy usage, with crypto mines in the state consuming 2,717 megawatts of power in 2023, according to the comptroller's office. That is enough electricity to power roughly 680,000 homes.  

Crypto mines use large amounts of electricity to run computers that run constantly to produce cryptocurrencies, which are decentralized digital currencies used as alternatives to government-backed traditional currencies.

A 2023 study by energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie commissioned by The New York Times found that Texans' electric bills had risen nearly 5%, or $1.8 billion per year, due to the increase in demand on the state power grid created by crypto mines.

Residents living near crypto mines have also complained that the amount of job creation promised by the facilities has not materialized and the noise of their operation is a nuisance. 

“Texas should be reinvesting Texan's tax money in things that truly bolster the economy long term, living wage, access to quality healthcare, world class public schools,” said state Sen. Molly Cook, D-Houston, who voted against the creation of the strategic fund. “Instead it feels like they're almost gambling our money on something that is known to be really volatile and has not shown to be a tide that raises all boats.”

State Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, who authored the bill that created the fund, said at the time it passed that it will allow Texas to “lead and compete in the digital economy.”

What's the best way to make a great deal of money? The most reliable method is to come up with something that people can't resist buying—such as Coca-Cola or Birkin bags or the “Harry Potter” books. Of course, that's not easy. Another option is to purchase something that's rising in value and hold on to it. Real estate or a broad basket of stocks are obvious choices. Since 1900, the S. & P. 500 has produced an average annual return of about seven per cent, even after adjusting for inflation, which translates into investments doubling in value every ten years or so. Based on that record, if you started socking money away into the market during your early twenties, each thousand dollars you invested then would be worth about twenty thousand by the time you reach retirement age. That's pretty good. But forty-odd years is a long time, and stock-index funds are kind of old hat. What about getting in on something newer and more exciting that seems to defy gravity? Or even better, what about inventing a tool to enable other people to do this, then marketing it to the masses? If you could pull that off, you really would be in the money.

In July, 2020, Michael Saylor, the head and co-founder of the business-software company MicroStrategy, announced that the firm would use some of its cash to buy bitcoins. The following month, MicroStrategy bought 21,454 bitcoins for two hundred and fifty million dollars, paying about $11,650 for each. The company didn't need bitcoins to conduct its software business, but Saylor said they represented “an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash.” Later that year, MicroStrategy borrowed about six hundred and fifty million dollars to buy more bitcoins. By April, 2021, the firm held more than ninety thousand coins, and the price of the digital currency had risen to more than fifty thousand dollars; MicroStrategy was sitting on a big gain.

Investors and the media began to take notice. During the first half of 2021, the firm's stock, which had been priced at under fifteen dollars when it started buying bitcoins, traded above fifty dollars. At the time, the digital currency was still largely excluded from the mainstream investment world: the Securities and Exchange Commission hadn't allowed any mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (E.T.F.s) to hold actual coins. In July, 2021, a Maryland firm called ProFunds launched a mutual fund whose value was tied to the value of bitcoin through futures contracts—financial instruments that sophisticated investors can use to bet on prices. But Saylor saw an opportunity to sell a simpler kind of workaround: by buying MicroStrategy stock, investors gained indirect ownership of the company's bitcoins. As Saylor later put it, the company was “kind of like” a Bitcoin E.T.F. At the end of 2021, it owned more than a hundred and twenty-five thousand of them, for which it had paid more than $3.75 billion.

That was just the beginning of Saylor's transformation into the Pied Piper of Bitcoin, which he hyped incessantly. During the “crypto winter” of 2022, which saw the collapse of some well-known crypto companies, including Terra-Luna and FTX, the value of bitcoin fell by about seventy per cent, and some people thought we were witnessing its eclipse. But MicroStrategy sat tight. Eventually, the crypto markets rebounded, and in 2024 Bitcoin had a banner year, particularly after Donald Trump, who had promised to make America the “crypto capital of the world,” was reëlected as President. As Bitcoin recovered, so did MicroStrategy's stock price. The firm then issued more shares and debt—raising tens of billions of dollars—to buy additional coins. By December of last year, it had grown its stash to 447,470 bitcoins, and its stock price had risen to more than four hundred dollars, valuing the company at more than eighty billion dollars. Saylor was estimated to be worth close to ten billion dollars; Forbes dubbed him “the Bitcoin Alchemist.”

The price of bitcoin, which more than doubled last year in a trend that many attributed to the “Trump trade,” obviously played a big role in this alchemy, but there was also another factor—one that did seem a little magical, or insane, depending on your viewpoint. As MicroStrategy expanded its purchases, eventually accumulating more than three per cent of all the bitcoins in existence, its purchases helped drive the price of the digital currency higher. But—and this is the magical bit—its stock price went up even faster than bitcoin did. Toward the end of last year, investors were valuing MicroStrategy at more than two times what its bitcoins were worth, which meant that, for every dollar the company invested in bitcoin, it was creating more than two dollars in value. Some observers labelled Saylor's bitcoin strategy as an “infinite-money machine,” or an “infinite-money glitch.”

Whatever you called it, the gap between MicroStrategy's market value and the value of its bitcoins couldn't be explained by the company's non-digital assets, namely its original software businesses. Saylor's supporters offered two explanations for why MicroStrategy was still a worthy investment. First, the price of Bitcoin could rise a lot further; Saylor claimed that, by 2045, it would reach thirteen million dollars. Second, MicroStrategy had found clever ways to amplify gains for regular shareholders. By issuing preferred stock and debt that could be converted into shares at a later date, and then using the proceeds to buy more bitcoins, MicroStrategy said it could give holders of its common stock “amplified exposure” to the cryptocurrency. Another term for this was leverage—using borrowed money to boost returns. Some skeptics, including the professional short seller Jim Chanos, questioned whether this strategy could last, but his warnings didn't catch on at the time. This past February, MicroStrategy unveiled its latest financial results, and a rebrand. “Earlier today, we announced that we are now Strategy, a new name that powerfully and succinctly conveys the universal and global appeal of our company.”

Hubris precedes the fall. After Strategy's stock peaked above $450 in mid-July, it went into an extended nosedive and ended November trading at $177.18. That wasn't the only bad news for Saylor and his believers. As Strategy's stock fell by sixty per cent, the price of bitcoin fell by only twenty-five per cent. This meant that the spread between Strategy's market capitalization and the value of the bitcoins that it owned was closing. By the end of last month, that premium had all but disappeared, and at one point last week the market value of Strategy dipped below the value of its bitcoins (after accounting for its debt). In the words of a columnist at Bloomberg, Saylor's infinite money machine was “glitching out.”

Recognizing the severity of the situation and hoping to reassure investors, Strategy announced that it had built up, by selling even more stock, a “dollar reserve” of $1.4 billion. It could use this to make required dividend payments to holders of its preferred stock over the next twelve months. (Regular shareholders don't get a dividend.) But it also said that, if its value continued to sink below the value of bitcoin, it might sell some of its coins—a previously unthinkable move for an evangelist like Saylor, who in February of this year tweeted, “Never sell your Bitcoin.” If Strategy was forced to unload some of its bitcoins, that could conceivably send the cryptocurrency, and the firm's stock, into another dive.

Strategy is now facing another challenge: the possibility that its stock could be removed from a major stock index, the MSCI Index, which analysts at JPMorgan estimated could lead to outflows of billions of dollars. On a more hopeful note, the price of bitcoin has risen over the past couple of weeks on expectations that the Federal Reserve is about to cut interest rates and pump more money into the financial system. In the past, some analysts noted, there has been a correlation between the Fed's monetary interventions and rallies in bitcoin. So it seems at least possible that Jerome Powell and his colleagues, who are focussed on preventing a recession, will inadvertently bail out the crypto bros, Saylor included.

Even if this happens, though, Strategy may well struggle to repeat its earlier success. The market opening that Saylor spotted back in 2020 has been largely filled. Dozens of other public companies, including MARA Holdings, a bitcoin-mining company, and Trump Media & Technology Group have acquired substantial holdings of bitcoin. And, for investors wanting direct exposure to bitcoin through their brokerage accounts, there are now more than a dozen Bitcoin E.T.F.s, including BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which trades under the symbol IBIT and owns even more coins than Strategy does—around seven hundred and seventy-five thousand coins compared with Strategy's six hundred and fifty thousand.

In the crypto world, you can never say never, but for now the longtime skeptics of Strategy have been vindicated. They include Chanos, who said he has made money by shorting the firm's stock and buying bitcoins in what is known as a paired trade. Last week, he told Sherwood, an in-house news site for the online trading platform Robinhood, “Our core thesis from the beginning—and it's still our core thesis—is don't pay more than $1 for something worth $1.” If investors follow this advice, Saylor and Strategy will still benefit from any sustained rebound in Bitcoin. But, alas, they won't be able to reboot their infinite-money machine. ♦

For better or worse, every Texan owns a smidgen of the popular cryptocurrency bitcoin. Lawmakers from both parties voted to create a Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve during the regular Legislature, which Gov. Greg Abbott happily signed into law in June. The state comptroller's office, which oversees the fund, recently contracted to purchase the fund's first assets, $5 million of bitcoin. 

This newspaper has argued against establishing a public cryptocurrency stockpile for a range of reasons. Our concerns remain relevant.

Cryptocurrency is extraordinarily volatile, and bitcoin's recent history underscores that. Bitcoin had reached about $126,000 per unit in early October. When the market closed on Dec. 1, its value had dropped to $86,321. Ouch. 

The blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies is, in theory, extremely secure. Nevertheless, scammers easily exploit regulatory weaknesses, investors' naivete and crypto's anonymity and decentralized nature.

Last month,  Europol announced it had broken up a multinational cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering ring. The New York Times reported in November that crypto exchanges, such as Binance, have attracted billions of dollars from drug cartels and terrorist groups. (In 2023, Changpeng Zhao, Binance's former CEO, pleaded guilty to operating without basic safeguards against money laundering. He was recently pardoned by President Donald Trump.)

And cryptocurrency mining's need for immense amounts of water and electricity can become a source of conflict in local communities, including in Texas. 

Given those caveats, we understand that digital currencies are starting to mature and that individual and institutional investors have become more comfortable with them. Public funds managers do have a responsibility to try to safely grow those dollars through careful investments. For example, just keeping up with the past year's inflation requires an investment return of about 3%. 

The National Conference of State Legislatures tallied 40 states that considered bills related to digital currencies or assets this year. Texas is the first to buy a digital currency for a public reserve; lawmakers allocated $10 million that could be used to purchase assets for the fund.

Texas may have been lucky with the timing of its purchase. As business reporter Trevor Bach wrote in this paper Tuesday, bitcoin was trading at about $87,000 when the state apparently bought its stash. While it's usually foolish to try to time the market, better for Texas to have invested at that price than when bitcoin was at its peak of $126,000.

Five million dollars is a tiny percentage of the state's $338 billion budget, but it's still $5 million we can't afford to lose. If the bitcoin investment makes money, the comptroller should sweep those earnings into a less risky asset rather than letting them ride.

Every week, X, formerly known as Twitter, and Telegram light up with bold predictions: self-proclaimed prophets promising they've found the “next 1000x coin.”

The hype is always the same — charts full of rocket emojis, screenshots of overnight millionaires, and the promise that this one project will make you rich if you buy in right now.

Sometimes, a lucky few coins really do catch fire. But far more often, these so-called opportunities leave hopeful buyers holding worthless bags.

Advertisement

The pursuit of the next big crypto asset never stops. Presales, meme tokens, AI projects and brand-new blockchains are launched daily, each claiming it will disrupt the industry and deliver outsized gains.

For new investors, it can feel like a lottery ticket hunt — fun when it pays off, brutal when it doesn't.

There's simply no guaranteed formula for spotting the next 1000x crypto — which itself is a term that is mostly marketing shorthand, designed to spark FOMO (fear of missing out) rather than to guide smart investment decisions.

That doesn't mean you're powerless. Cut through the hype and get a tool like Best Wallet, which highlights verified token launches, scans for scams and tracks real sentiment data, helping you separate the rare gems from the endless noise.

This guide will break down what people mean when they talk about a “1000x crypto,” how to evaluate new projects, and what to watch for if you want to trade momentum without falling for the next rug pull.

The people who ask about the next 1000x crypto are fantasizing about the next unicorn that can turn a few hundred dollars into life-changing wealth.

As the term implies, 1000x crypto means the token that is likely to multiply in value by one thousand times, or more.

An investor who puts in $1,000 would theoretically walk away with $1 million if the coin achieved that explosive return.

History shows that this isn't entirely far-fetched. Bitcoin was once worth less than a penny. Ethereum launched at under $1 before soaring into the thousands.

Even Solana went from a few cents to over $200 at its peak. To early buyers, those projects delivered far more than 1,000 times the returns.

Most coins, however, never come close. The landscape has changed, becoming much more crowded.

There are tens of thousands of tokens circulating in the ether that are competing for traders' attention — rendering the odds of any one asset repeating Bitcoin's or Ethereum's trajectory slim.

In fact, the term “1000x” is more often used as marketing bait — particularly when it comes to presales, meme projects or low-liquidity tokens designed to lure in retail traders.

“Don't fall for the memes. Focus on real traction — active developers, a growing user base and disciplined tokenomics,” Ilir Salihi, founder and senior editor at IncomeInsider.org, said.

“It's only reasonable to expect 1000x at very small, illiquid starting valuations. Most launches today come with high fully diluted valuations that cap upside.”

Salihi added that “if you can get in early on a project with limited dilution and real fundamentals, that's where the potential lies.”

Investors can track early-stage projects intelligently by relying on tools such as Best Wallet, which offers a safer alternative when juxtaposed with hype accounts and unsubstantiated rumors on random Telegram chats.

Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens feature highlights presales and newly listed coins, then layers in market-sentiment signals, scam filters, and stage and pricing details. 

Best Wallet isn't just a wallet; it's also a launchpad for investing in coins before they hit the market. Its Upcoming Tokens feature provides early access to vetted presales, offering clear details on stages and pricing.

From meme coin presales like Maxi Doge and Pepenode, to utility-meme hybrids like Bitcoin Hyper, and even AI agents, GameFi and DePIN, BestWallet constantly updates its list of promising crypto launches across all blockchains.

At the same time, market sentiment tools, scam filters, watchlists and a portfolio tracker help users stay balanced and avoid risky moves. Together, these features make it easier and safer to discover and invest in new coins early. This way, you can monitor the buzz around fresh projects without blindly trusting the loudest shill on social media.

The phrase “next 1000x crypto prediction” sells the dream, but the reality is far riskier. If you're curious, it's better to treat these claims as speculation — and use data-driven tools to separate potential from pure hype.

Every cycle, investors ask which coin has the most upside. Even the pros can't know for sure. Markets move fast and hype outruns the numbers.

Advertisement

What you can do is stack the odds in your favor. Use Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens feature to spot credible presales early. Track sentiment and liquidity. Filter out red flags. Build watchlists and use a portfolio tracker to keep position sizes in check. 

Then focus on the basics that have separated winners from also-rans: real users, clear utility, steady development, sane tokenomics, and survivable drawdowns.

Analysts with years in the trenches can't reliably call the next breakout months in advance. But a disciplined process — data over buzz, tools over tweets — gives you a better shot at catching strength and avoiding fads.

Utility is often the first indicator.

Advertisement

Tokens that solve real problems, such as powering decentralized finance platforms, integrating artificial intelligence, or enabling faster payment networks, tend to be the ones that sustain demand longer than speculative, meme-based projects.

Community also plays a powerful role, as evidenced by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu — two digital assets that lack deep fundamentals but are nonetheless lifted by meme-driven loyalists into the mainstream, turning early holders into millionaires.

Exchange listings like Coinbase or Binance propel these token to a level of visibility and liquidity within a short time frame, often overnight.

Finally, there's the critical factor of developer activity. A team that ships updates regularly and continues to build signals demonstrates long-term commitment, which the market takes seriously.

Looking ahead, categories drawing attention include AI-related tokens, evolving DeFi projects, meme coins that thrive on cultural momentum and new layer-1 blockchains promising speed and scalability.

“The first and almost only important question to ask, at least from a long-term perspective, is what use case does the crypto serve?” said Paul Holmes, analyst at Brokerlistings.com.

“If it doesn't serve a genuine purpose, it might moon briefly thanks to social channels, but it will almost certainly crash back down.”

Holmes said he is keeping an eye on Aethir, which is tackling the colossal demand for AI computing power, and Worldcoin, which is experimenting with digital IDs tied to AI.

“Both have volatility but also genuine use cases,” he said.

“We may still see cryptos grow 1000x, but sustaining that growth is another matter.”

While Holmes stressed the importance of filtering out hype and sticking to fundamentals, other analysts are more willing to spotlight individual projects they believe are positioned to benefit from current trends.

Dawid Siuda, finance expert at Omni Calculator, points to three tokens with long-term promise.

“Chainlink (LINK) isn't new, but as tokenized assets and AI trading models scale, secure data feeds are more critical than ever,” Siuda said.

“LINK could finally break into mainstream adoption.”

Siuda also touted Render (RNDR) as “another contender, with exploding AI and graphics demand making distributed GPU networks more valuable.”

He also talked up Celestia (TIA), which he said “stands out in the modular blockchain movement, which could reshape infrastructure as developers move away from monolithic designs.”

It's also worth clarifying that “booming” does not necessarily mean achieving 1000x returns.

A token that doubles, triples or even climbs tenfold in value can be considered a major success, without ever reaching the fantasy-level multiples often promised on social media.

When people ask about the next big crypto coin, what they're really asking is which project will capture mainstream attention and go viral.

Historically, the “next big coin” has been the one that breaks out of the crypto echo chamber and into mainstream culture.

Think of Dogecoin's run during the meme-stock frenzy or Solana's climb as it landed big exchange listings and built an energetic developer ecosystem.

The formula is usually the same: a project lands a listing on a major exchange like Coinbase or Binance, social media chatter goes into overdrive, and a passionate community drives the narrative that this is one of the next cryptos to explode.

At that point, coverage snowballs; crypto blogs, mainstream financial outlets, and retail investors all pile in.

But for every coin that makes headlines, there are thousands more that fade into obscurity.

Search “new cryptocurrency release today” and you'll see a daily flood of tokens, most of them poorly designed, low-liquidity projects with no real use case.

Many never survive beyond a few weeks. For beginners, it can feel impossible to sort through the noise and identify which coins have real staying power.

Dave Ackerman, COO at Currency.com, warns against blind chasing.

“The biggest risk of chasing the next big coin is the same as with any speculative investment — you can lose your money,” Ackerman said.

“Opaque tokenomics, liquidity traps, or third-party manipulation can tank a price overnight.”

Ackerman also noted the risk of regulators stepping in, exchanges dropping a coin, or projects faking activity to appear more popular than they are.

“The dangers multiply,” he said.

Ackerman follows a simple rule: “Don't bet too big and be ready for sharp drops along the way.”

“Much like traditional investments, it's prudent to know your risk profile, your objectives and plan accordingly,” he adds.

Practical filters can help mitigate risk.

Investors are always encouraged to conduct their due diligence by verifying whether the project has a transparent team, whether developers are shipping updates, and whether there's genuine demand for the token beyond speculation.

Absent those benchmarks, community hype alone usually won't sustain a project for long.

Best Wallet aggregates all “new cryptocurrency releases today” in one dashboard and automatically applies scam filters.

So instead of chasing hype posts on X or Telegram, users can see verified launches in real time, track sentiment shifts, and set alerts for coins that show real traction.

Nobody can consistently call the next big crypto coin before it takes off.

But by combining healthy skepticism with smarter tools, you can avoid the endless parade of throwaway tokens — and focus your attention on projects with actual momentum.

Presales, meme coins, and low-cap tokens are high risk. Use wallets with scam filters, only buy from verified links, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. This guide is for informational purposes — not financial advice.

The search for the “next 1000x crypto” is more hype than science. While stories of early Bitcoin or Ethereum investors fuel dreams of overnight riches, today's market is far more crowded and far more dangerous.

Most new tokens will never deliver life-changing returns, and many will vanish altogether.

Smart investors know the goal isn't chasing lottery tickets, but focusing on fundamentals: real use cases, active development, sustainable tokenomics and communities that last longer than a meme cycle.

Just as importantly, it's about using the right tools to cut through the noise.

Best Wallet doesn't promise the next 1000x, but it does give you an edge by surfacing verified launches, filtering out scams, and tracking sentiment in real-time. It helps you avoid the traps and make smarter, more strategic bets in an unpredictable market.

No one can guarantee a “1000x” coin. Focus on projects with strong use cases, real communities, and transparent teams. Use alerts and watchlists in Best Wallet to track developing momentum.

Use launchpads, wallet presale dashboards (like Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens), and news feeds. Verify everything before buying.

Presale tokens are especially high-risk — always research the teams, verify official links, and use tools like scam scanners before committing funds.

                            Is Trump still bullish on crypto?                         

The White House's latest national security blueprint has raised concerns across the digital-asset sector.

Despite Donald Trump's pro-crypto rhetoric, the administration's new strategy document makes no direct mention of crypto, Bitcoin, or blockchain technology.

The recently published  plan frames America's “vital interests” around competition in fields such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing.

“We want to ensure that U.S. technology and U.S. standards — particularly in AI, biotech, and quantum computing — drive the world forward,” the administration said.

While these areas are indeed high-priority on the global stage, the narrow focus contrasts sharply with Trump's increasingly vocal promises regarding crypto.

Only last month, the President said he wanted the country to be “number one” in digital assets.

“I only care about one thing — will we be number one in crypto?” Trump said in a CBS 60 Minutes interview. 

“Crypto has turned out to be a massive industry […], and I'm very proud to say we are far and away ahead of China and everybody else. But China is getting into it very big right now,” he added.

Even though the new security strategy omits any mention of crypto, Trump has continued to advance crypto-friendly policies.

Recent actions include:

Over the past year, the Trump family has been building a broad crypto ecosystem.

Trump's growing portfolio includes a presidential memecoin, a Bitcoin mining venture, and World Liberty Financial, which has already launched multiple tokens.

These business expansions have coincided with the administration's decisions to scale back or drop several major regulatory actions involving crypto.

Following his election, Bitcoin and other global digital assets surged, with reports claiming the Trump family's net worth increased by hundreds of millions of dollars.

However, much of that momentum has since reversed.

Trump Media & Technology Group, which recently expanded into crypto, fell 5% on Dec. 2 and is now down roughly 70% since the inauguration. 

The family's flagship political memecoin, TRUMP, has fallen from a peak of around $45 near inauguration to just $5.73, a drop of nearly 90%.

World Liberty Financial's governance token has also declined, sliding roughly 50% since its September launch.

Trump's decision to omit crypto from his national security strategy has unsettled some in the industry, who say the absence raises questions about the administration's dedication to its future.

Trump has repeatedly cast Bitcoin and digital assets as tools of national power, especially in competition with China.

The absence in such a big document leaves room for uncertainty.

“Kinda wild seeing crypto completely missing from that list tbh,” wrote one user.

“Feels like they're pretending blockchain isn't already woven into half the new tech stack.”

Major jurisdictions, including the EU, have already integrated digital-asset policy into their national strategies — many want the U.S. to ensure they are keeping pace.

Another user said they felt “confused” by the omission, given that the President had “repeatedly promised to make the U.S. the crypto hub of the world.”

“We all bought into that idea. But in the National Security Strategy released today, there isn't a single word about BTC, ETH, or blockchain. Zero,” they added.

“Isn't that a massive contradiction?”

Since joining Crypto Valley VC (CV VC), a Swiss-based venture capital firm that backs blockchain-based startups, as Head of Investment for Africa in November 2024, Jarryd Kennedy has been at the centre of the firm's push to spot businesses using blockchain technology to solve everyday problems across fintech, payments, and data infrastructure on the continent.

Kennedy's career before CV VC began in investment banking, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and private equity across London, New York, and South Africa. His experience gives him a dealmaker's discipline and a technology-first lens, helping him identify use cases where blockchain reduces friction, improves trust and builds real economic infrastructure rather than hype.

In 2022, CV VC launched a $20 million Africa Blockchain Fund, which has invested in 13 early-stage Web3 startups across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Egypt, and Ghana, including Nigerian podcast-hosting platform Jamit, South African crypto investment startup Altify, Kenyan Web3 agritech Shamba Records, and South African neobank Kasi.

The firm's investment strategy writes direct cheques and backs early-stage startups from its accelerator. Through CV Labs, CV VC selects 7–9 startups to participate in a cohort each year, providing them with mentorship and growth strategy consultations. It backs nearly all the selected startups with $135,000 in funding in return for a 7% convertible note. It also writes $500,000 follow-on cheques for its portfolio startups.

After witnessing African startups' struggles to access additional capital and infrastructure for growth, the VC firm adjusted its take rate to a 6% equity through debt, increasing its ticket size to $150,000. As of October 2025, the firm claimed more than half of the startups in its portfolio have raised follow-on funding.

Circle Ventures, the investment arm of the US-based issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is among the external backers of CV VC's Africa Blockchain fund, signalling global interest in the firm's thesis.

I spoke with Kennedy for this week's Ask an Investor to understand his career, what it takes to lead CV VC's African team, and global investor appetite for African blockchain products. 

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

What brought you into Web3 venture capital, and which past roles mattered most?

My entry into the Web3 venture capital ecosystem has been shaped by a decade of experience across investment banking, M&A, and private equity, with roles spanning London, New York, and South Africa. The bulk of my career has been at Deutsche Bank, gaining exposure to Telco, Media and Technology (TMT) across capital markets and M&A.

Over time, I moved into private equity with Convergence Partners, a pan-African private equity firm focused on digital infrastructure. There, I led and supported investments into technology and telecom businesses across markets like Rwanda, South Africa, Kenya, and Malawi. That experience was pivotal because it gave me a deep appreciation for how technology can drive inclusion and development in emerging markets.

Importantly, throughout my career, there has been an enduring focus on technology: I have always viewed it as a tool to revolutionise monolithic, legacy systems, enabling the creation of more efficient outcomes. That is what ultimately drew me to Web3: I saw blockchain as an evolution in the global technology stack that could enable new structures for decentralised ownership, efficient value exchange, transparent governance, and the removal of intermediaries, thereby lowering barriers to entry and creating entirely new economic models.

At CV VC, I lead our venture investments across Africa, applying that same technology-oriented lens to early-stage startups that are building transformative real-world solutions by utilising blockchain technology.

What does being CV VC's Head of Investment for Africa mean from an operational lens?

At CV VC, no two days are the same. We are a Swiss-headquartered venture capital (VC) firm with a global footprint, and although we operate in a decentralised way, we stay tightly connected through daily team calls, cross-functional projects, and in-person engagements. 

On a typical day, I split my time across three areas: pipeline, portfolio, and investors. On the pipeline, it is all about travel, conferences, and networking, to enable relationship-building with the best startups and founders. Thereafter, we evaluate investment pitches and assess new opportunities through a data-driven lens to benchmark their performance.

On the portfolio side, I work closely with founders across our African investment portfolio, with a mix of relationship-building, hands-on support, and facilitating connections to other ecosystem participants. Finally, on the investor front, we are consistently engaged with investors to report on progress with the goal of leveraging investor expertise to bolster that progress, creating a flywheel of value creation across the ecosystem.

Across all three areas, staying sharp on market trends and emerging utility is important. This encompasses diving into data, strategic analysis, or contributing to knowledge-building efforts, which helps shape global understanding of blockchain's real-world impact on the continent.

African Web3 startups raised $122.5 million in 2024, a decline in deal value from the previous year, despite high user adoption on the continent. Why is there a gap between usage and investor appetite?

It is important to distinguish between crypto and blockchain: Crypto is one of the first applications of blockchain technology. Investors are not necessarily focused on crypto itself, but on the broader capability of blockchain technology to improve upon legacy technology stacks and to create new structures for ownership, value exchange, governance, and the removal of intermediaries.

The investment case for blockchain has never been stronger. What the internet has done for the exchange of data is equivalent to what blockchain is doing for the exchange of value. Nobody talks about a “cross-border email” because of the ubiquity with which data flows around the world! Blockchain is creating this ubiquity for the exchange of value on the internet, enabling an economic value layer which is democratised and globally accessible.

Encouragingly, we see blockchain adoption rates which are reminiscent of early internet adoption, and the blockchain economy has never been stronger. Top academics, visionary founders and over 26,000 blockchain developers are converging within the blockchain ecosystem, resulting in significant capital invested in blockchain companies and over 500 million global crypto users.

Has Africa's funding winter of 2023–2024 changed the quality or number of African Web3 startups raising capital?

Investor capital remains cautious, not just in Africa, but also across the rest of the world, which is mostly a reflection of heightened global uncertainty driven predominantly by geopolitical factors. Despite the slow start to the year, the remainder of 2024 was actually positive for Web3 venture funding, with blockchain startups taking an outsized share of venture investment in Africa.

Regardless of funding levels, blockchain builders on the continent have not been deterred in any way, with no shortage in quality or quantity of strong blockchain startups in Africa. Our pipeline is full of highly compelling investment opportunities across a wide range of sectors and geographies.

CV VC has kept writing cheques into African Web3 teams while others pull back. What explains that commitment?

Our commitment is rooted in a long-term investment philosophy and a belief in the transformative power of blockchain technology, especially in markets where it can solve real, structural problems. We focus solely on utility and ignore speculation. We're not just investing in trends; we're backing determined founders who are building infrastructure, improving access, and bringing trust to systems that need it most. That's exactly what we see happening across Africa.

Despite global funding fluctuations, innovation hasn't stopped; founders are still building, and the use cases for blockchain in multiple sectors are more relevant than ever.

How do accelerator programmes like CV Labs and ecosystem grants fit into your Africa strategy?

The proprietary CV VC accelerator program is designed to bring founders together, not just to gain investment but to share expertise, cross-pollinate ideas, and build resilience through community. Ultimately, it's about catalysing innovation that can flourish long after the initial investment.

In Africa, where markets are often fragmented and infrastructure is still evolving, accelerators play a crucial role in strengthening local capabilities and expanding access to global networks. They allow us to identify promising talent early, provide tailored support, and help founders scale solutions that are contextually relevant and often globally competitive.

Besides being highly beneficial for founders and the ecosystem at large, the accelerator is ultimately an additional mechanism used to deploy equity cheques alongside our traditional direct venture strategy. Investors benefit through an extended due diligence exercise and favourable risk-reward profiles given the early entry point.

Which African sectors best match CV VC's thesis on trust and decentralisation?

Our investment theme revolves around three key areas and applies to startups from any continent: first, applications built directly on blockchains. Second, we prioritise startups using blockchain to drive broader tech and social megatrends. Third, we also strongly consider service providers and infrastructure players that support the broader blockchain ecosystem.

From a sector point of view, we see a mature dispersion of activity across multiple sectors. Fintech leads the charge, which is in line with the broader African venture landscape and funding allocation. Beyond that, we see unique applications across the technology-enabled subset of agriculture, media, climate, property, mobility, healthcare, education, identity, gaming, and HR. Additionally, we see a focus on blockchain infrastructure development, including developer tooling and business-to-business (B2B) applications.

Given the global risk-off mood, are investors still cautious about Web3 in Africa? If so, why?

There is still some caution among investors when it comes to Web3 in Africa. This caution can be attributed to investors allocating capital based on a spectrum of risk, where blockchain, as an emerging technology and Africa, as an emerging market, are perceived as higher risk and therefore draw increased caution. This is influenced by the current risk-off sentiment globally, driven predominantly by geopolitical factors, and this is not, in our view, a critique of the technology or the market.

Having said this, many investors are intrigued by the potential of blockchain technology and its specific applications for the African continent, and appetite is growing. Investors are watching closely as African founders demonstrate real utility using blockchain to solve core issues like financial inclusion, identity, remittances, and land ownership provenance. 

We believe that as more success stories emerge from the continent, confidence will follow. Our role at CV VC is to be early in that cycle to back the builders today who will shape the narrative of tomorrow.

Do regulatory developments in key African markets matter? Which countries are leading?

Absolutely. Regulatory clarity is essential for economic competitiveness in the Web3 space. Well-defined policies attract risk-tolerant venture capital, as we've seen in Africa's leading all-sector VC hubs of Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa. In contrast, regulatory ambiguity drives talent and capital offshore, undermining trust and stalling innovation.

Investors are also encouraged by the global shifts happening, notably the US moving toward a more friendly stance in 2025. Many African lawmakers are pushing to replace fragmented oversight with clearer frameworks.

The Federal Reserve will hold its final policy meeting of 2025 this week. The market is heavily leaning towards a 0.25% rate cut on Wednesday, 10 December 2025 – the third cut that would take the rate to 3.5% – 3.75% target range. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference after Wednesday's decision is expected to be critical for markets. Bank of America said that it expects Powell to hint at “reserve management purchases.”

Anxiety grips markets ahead of Powell's speech.

And what are the other catalysts? Major tech names report results with a heavy focus on AI infrastructure. Oracle, Adobe, and the AI-chip heavyweight Broadcom are all set to release quarterly numbers this week.

Oracle enters earnings under a cloud after its November sell-off tied to debt-funded AI data-center investments. Broadcom rallied on optimism around its deepening relationship with Google parent Alphabet and potential new wins from Microsoft.

On the consumer side, a cluster of retail earnings is on its way too. Giants like GameStop, AutoZone, and Lululemon report this week. Costco reports Thursday, 11 December 2025, fresh off its lawsuit against the Trump Administration challenging tariff policies that the company argues are hurting its cost structure. 

On 9 December 2025 the JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) data will be released. If it is below 7.2 million, it will mean weakening jobs, and in simpler terms, more room for rate-cut. If it is above expectations, it may lower the rate cut odds in 2026.

On 11 December 2025 PPI inflation data will be out.

Crypto has grown from a digital experiment into a powerful force shaping global finance, luxury culture, and wealth creation. To understand the opportunities and the risks, we roped Brenton Nicker, Business Development Manager for Binance, one of Africa's leading voices in crypto and blockchain innovation. From how crypto fits into a diversified portfolio to why Africa is a rising frontier, Brenton breaks it all down with clarity and authority.

Cryptocurrency is no longer a buzzword reserved for tech bros and traders glued to price charts. It has woven its way into mainstream banking, luxury retail, global payments, and how young investors think about wealth. Africa, in particular, is becoming one of the most exciting regions for blockchain adoption with a young population, high mobile penetration, and increasing appetite for digital alternatives in economies marked by volatility. Here, Brenton offers an expert view on where crypto is today, and where it's going next.

Glamour: What is cryptocurrency in simple terms, and why has it drawn global interest?

Brenton Naicker: Cryptocurrency is essentially digital money secured by blockchain technology, meaning every transaction is transparently recorded and nearly impossible to alter. It has captured global interest because it offers a new, decentralised way to store and transfer value without relying on banks while opening the door to high-growth opportunities in an evolving tech ecosystem.

Glamour: What has fueled crypto's rise over the past decade?

Brenton: It's been a mix of technological innovation and economic shifts. Faster payments, easier cross-border transfers, inflation concerns, and the rise of digital lifestyles have all contributed. People also recognise blockchain's potential to disrupt traditional systems, from banking to proof of ownership.

Glamour: How should a sophisticated investor approach crypto in a diversified portfolio?

Brenton: Treat crypto as a high-growth, high-risk satellite investment rather than the foundation of your portfolio. It works best when balanced with equities, bonds, and real estate, acting as a modern diversifier for long-term strategy.

Glamour: Is crypto speculative, a store of value, or a hedge, especially for African investors?

Brenton: Depending on how it's used, crypto can be all three. African and diaspora investors often face currency volatility and limited access to traditional investment products. In that context, crypto can serve as a digital store of value and sometimes a hedge but its speculative price swings mean investors must remain conscious of risk.

Glamour: What portion of a high-net-worth portfolio is reasonable to allocate to crypto?

Brenton: Most wealth managers recommend 1–5% for conservative profiles and up to 10% for higher risk tolerance. The key is ensuring your allocation won't destabilise your broader portfolio during downturns.

Glamour: Why is Africa considered the next frontier for blockchain innovation?

Brenton: Africa has a young population, high mobile adoption, and underdeveloped financial infrastructure which makes it primed for blockchain-driven solutions. From mobile payments to digital identity systems, the continent is positioned to leapfrog outdated structures and adopt new technology faster than many developed markets.

Glamour: How are African governments responding to the crypto economy?

Brenton: Responses vary widely. Some countries are cautious, others are open, and a growing number are building regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with risk management. Overall, the trend is moving toward clearer guidelines as governments recognise crypto's economic potential.

Glamour: What blockchain use cases are emerging beyond trading?

Brenton: We're seeing tokenised real estate, digital art authentication, supply chain tracking, decentralised finance (DeFi), and even luxury goods verification. These applications show that blockchain's value extends far beyond speculation and is transforming multiple industries.

Glamour: What are the biggest risks in crypto, and how can investors mitigate them?

Brenton: Volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and project failures are still major risks. Mitigation comes from diversifying across established assets, using reputable platforms, avoiding hype-driven projects, and investing only what you can afford to risk.

Glamour: How can investors safeguard their digital assets?

Brenton: Start with trusted exchanges, enable two-factor authentication, and store long-term assets in hardware wallets. Avoid public Wi-Fi, use strong passwords, and stay vigilant against phishing attempts. Good digital hygiene is key.

Glamour: How important is regulation for crypto's future?

Brenton: Regulation is essential, not to restrict innovation, but to build trust, stability, and consumer protection. Clear frameworks encourage institutions to participate, which strengthens the entire ecosystem. I've sat with the Inter-Departmental Fintech Working Group in South Africa, and while the framework is still developing, the commitment to doing it right is encouraging.

Glamour: How is crypto influencing the luxury sector?

Brenton: Luxury brands are incorporating NFTs for product authenticity, using blockchain for supply tracking, and even accepting crypto payments. This merging of technology and exclusivity enhances customer confidence and elevates the ownership experience.

Glamour: Could tokenisation redefine how affluent investors see ownership?

Brenton: Absolutely. Tokenisation allows investors to own fractions of premium assets such as art, real estate, or fine wine without needing massive upfront capital. It democratises access and enables global liquidity, reshaping modern wealth-building.

Glamour: How will the global crypto landscape evolve over the next five years?

Brenton: Expect deeper institutional adoption, stronger regulation, more stable markets, and mainstream real-world use cases. Crypto will shift from a niche, speculative asset to an integrated part of traditional finance.

Glamour: What advice would you give first-time investors entering crypto?

Brenton: Start small. Do your research. Be cautious of scammers. Stick to reputable assets and avoid making emotional decisions. Think long-term, and always invest with a clear strategy and solid risk management. Crypto should be a learning journey not a quick win.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury firm, acquired 138,452 ether ETH$3,128.22 last week, accelerating its accumulation strategy that lifted its total holdings to 3.86 million tokens, the company reported Monday.

At current ETH prices, last week's acquisition is worth roughly $435 million. That's a 156% increase from four weeks ago when it added about 54,000 ETH, the firm pointed out, and it's also higher than the previous two weeks' haul of 97,000 and 70,000 tokens.

The firm also increased its cash holdings to $1 billion, up from the previous week's $882 million. Including its small bitcoin stash and a stake in Eightco Holdings (ORBS), the company's total crypto and cash assets are worth $13.2 billion.

The latest purchase increases BitMine's share of the second largest cryptocurrency's circulating supply to over 3.2%, reinforcing its position as the largest known ETH treasury.

BitMine's shares were up 3.8% pre-market with ETH modestly bouncing over the weekend back to $3,150.

Digital asset treasuries have slowed or reversed accumulation as token prices and equity valuations came under pressure in recent weeks. BitMine has taken the opposite approach, increasing purchases as ether continues to trade well below its summer highs.

Chairman Thomas Lee said the firm stepped up buying after Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade on December 3, which introduced improvements to the network's scalability and security. He also pointed to macro factors, including the Federal Reserve's expected rate cut this month and the end of quantitative tightening, as support for a stronger ETH market in early 2026.

Lee released a separate message Monday titled ""The Crypto Supercycle is Intact,"" arguing that expanding adoption and growing interest in tokenization could drive demand next year.

BitMine remained one of the most actively traded U.S. stocks, with about $1.8 billion in average daily volume, placing it among the top 40 most traded equities, the firm said. However, the firm is still sittting on hefty unrealized looses on its ETH stash, estimated at nearly $3 billion at current prices.

Long-term holder (LTH) supply reached a cyclical low on Nov. 21, the same day bitcoin BTC$90,547.56 bottomed out around $80,000. With the bitcoin price now back at $90,000, about 15% higher from the low, the data suggests that most spot-driven sell pressure has already washed through the market following the 36% peak to trough correction. 

This trend has become a key narrative in 2025, since persistent spot selling has been the primary reason bitcoin has traded largely flat year-to-date.

Long-term holders are defined as entities that have held their coins for at least 155 days. As coins age from short-term holders into this cohort, long-term holder supply naturally increases. 

The recent stabilization and early upturn suggest that the wave of distribution from these more seasoned holders is easing significantly, reducing structural sell pressure in the market.

Since the summer, long-term holders have reduced their holdings from 14,769,512 BTC in July to 14,330,128 BTC in November. 

The previous two troughs in long-term holder supply occurred in April 2024 and March 2025. The April 2024 decline took place soon after bitcoin reached its all-time high of $73,000, which showed long-term holders were distributing into strength. The March 2025 low arrived during the correction driven by the Trump tariff concerns, which ultimately saw bitcoin bottom in April at roughly $76,000.

Looking across previous cycles, long-term holder supply typically sees sharp declines during the retail driven mania phases that accompany cycle peaks, most notably in 2017 and 2021. 

This cycle, however, appears differently. Instead of a dramatic blow-off top followed by aggressive distribution, the pattern has been more measured, featuring steadier ebbs and flows. This indicates that market structure and holder behavior have evolved, which puts a dent in the four-year cycle structure as the onchain behaviour is different.

BlackRock has officially filed for a staked Ethereum ETH$3,128.22 exchange-traded fund, marking a key step in bringing staking exposure to the masses.

The world's largest asset manager submitted an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. SEC on Friday. The filing kicks off the review process, but to trigger a formal deadline for SEC approval or denial, the fund's listing exchange must still submit a separate 19b-4 form.

The proposed fund, called the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB), was first hinted at in November when BlackRock registered the name in Delaware. That move signaled intent but didn't count as a formal application with the SEC.

This isn't BlackRock's first Ethereum ETF. The firm launched the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) in July 2024 alongside other issuers. But at the time, the SEC—then led by Chair Gary Gensler—reportedly instructed firms to strip out staking components from their filings. The agency had previously argued that staking services offered by platforms like Kraken and Coinbase could constitute unregistered securities offerings.

Under new Chair Paul Atkins, that position appears to be softening. BlackRock and VanEck are now among several issuers resubmitting or amending ETF filings to include staking. While others are modifying their existing products, BlackRock opted to launch an entirely new fund.

ETHA, which holds about $11 billion in ETH, will remain separate from the staking version. The staked fund, if approved, would give investors exposure to Ethereum's yield-generating mechanism without having to stake assets themselves.

Welcome to CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025.

This year, Bitcoin broke an all-time high, reaching $126,000 a few short months ago, Ethereum saw not one but two major network upgrades take effect, Solana broke into Wall Street and through it all retail and institutional traders gained ever more access to crypto markets through wrapped products like exchange-traded funds.

Continuing the end of 2024's crypto industry optimism, 2025 saw the resurgence of the U.S. as a dominant market in crypto for both retail and institutional players, the cementing of cryptocurrencies as an asset class for the mainstream investor and even the growth of artificial intelligence in crypto spaces.

That's not to say the news has been consistently positive. Markets have slipped over recent months and the broader U.S. and global economy are showing signs of stress. The crypto industry received vivid and unfortunate reminders in the form of wrench attacks and kidnappings that personal security cannot just be taken for granted, and malicious actors are on track to break records for how much crypto they've been able to steal through hacks and other compromises.

All this to say: It's been a busy year.

For 2025, CoinDesk categorized the 50 individuals and groups we're recognizing for their contributions to the crypto industry this year — good and bad — into 10 different themes, with one of our Top 10 Most Influential individuals tied to four groups or people in their thematic orbit. Monday's theme — recognizing U.S. President Donald Trump and the outsize effect he has had on the crypto industry discourse this year — is kicking off our presentation of the list, and you can check back every day for the next two weeks to read the newest entries on our list.

Outside policymaking, our themes look at the role of money in politics, the growing attention on how capital is flowing in general, the behind-the-scenes work to keep decentralized networks humming and the industry's darker side, among others.

Finally, as a reminder, CoinDesk's Most Influential is not a ranking. It's not us honoring individuals or groups. Rather, it's our way of recognizing the role these people and groups have played in the industry. As we have in past years, this year our selections range from builders, policymakers and thought-leaders moving the industry forward to bad actors who arguably set it back. That's still influence, even if we would rather forget their roles.

As with every year's list, CoinDesk focuses on individuals who demonstrated — not to put too fine a point on it — influence in the crypto industry. Whether that's through bringing esoteric products mainstream, drawing attention to how people disclose their holdings or just through keeping the industry's technology moving, the list recognizes people who had a clear effect.

Every year, the final selection draws from a crowd-sourced long list, with CoinDesk reporters and the general public all weighing in. The months long process saw this list whittled down into the 50 names you'll read about over the next two weeks.

As in past years, we have made a deliberate effort not to include people who might be on the list every year. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Hester Pierce, for example, continues to be a majorly influential figure for the industry, guiding the agency's approach to crypto regulation from a position of power that has only increased under the leadership of crypto-friendly Chair Paul Atkins. And there's no question that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has massive influence on the crypto industry, particularly in the U.S.

However, some figures have such a significant impact that they necessitate a repeat appearance on our Most Influential list. This year, we are recognizing Trump again, due to the changes he's wrought since being elected president in 2024, and some other names may seem familiar as well. And as with every year, we welcome your feedback on our selections.

Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano Absolutely Destroys This Webcam in a Fiery New Video

Hawaii's Kilauea, one of Earth's most active volcanoes, sent lava fountains spewing into the air, obliterating a U.S. Geological Survey camera

Hawaii's Kilauea—one of Earth's most active volcanoes—is bringing the drama.

On December 6 lava fountains in the Halema‘uma‘u crater at the shield volcano's summit spewed more than 1,000 feet into the air, sending molten rock, boulders and ash hurtling into one of the U.S. Geological Survey's webcams, taking it completely offline.

The volcano is going through a long, intermittent eruption that began on December 23, 2024. Kilauea, located on the southeastern flank of Mauna Loa on the island of Hawai‘i, has blown dozens of times since the 1950s. In fact, it erupted practically uninterrupted from 1983 to 2018 along its East Rift Zone—only ending when the floor of the Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō crater collapsed, draining the lava lake at the volcano's summit. The lava poured through residential neighborhoods, destroying hundreds of homes and other buildings.

A 2019 paper revealed that fissures inside Kilauea caused a relatively small amount of magma to drain from the volcano's reservoir, ultimately setting off the collapse of the summit caldera.

How Sound Waves Can Fight Fires without Water

A new sound-based system could squelch small fires before they grow into home-destroying blazes

By Vanessa Bates Ramirez edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Thomas Fuchs

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

A wildfire burns in the hills of a Los Angeles suburb, leaping from one patch of dry brush to another as it approaches a cluster of homes. The landscaping at the first house burns, but the house itself stubbornly refuses to catch fire: any small flames that start along its walls or roof quickly die out. There's no water in sight—the flames are being quenched by sound waves. This kind of acoustic fire suppression may soon play a vital role in fighting wildfires.

The key ingredients for a fire are heat, fuel and oxygen; take one of these away, and the flames are extinguished. Sound waves can stifle a fire by pushing oxygen molecules away from the fuel, preventing the fire from getting the air it needs to continue its combustion reaction.

Geoff Bruder, an aerospace engineer who researched thermal energy conversion at NASA, co-founded Sonic Fire Tech to build a sound-generating machine for this purpose. “It's basically vibrating the oxygen faster than the fuel can use it, so you block the chemical reaction,” Bruder says. The company has demonstrated fire suppression from up to 25 feet away.

Using sound waves to fight fire isn't a brand-new concept. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency studied the method from 2008 to 2011, and academic researchers explored the technique over the next decade (including a George Mason University team that built an extinguisher similar to a subwoofer in 2015).

“Acoustic influence on flames is well known in combustion,” says Albert Simeoni, head of the department of fire protection engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. “The challenge is to scale up the technology without creating disrupting or even damaging sound effects.”

Sonic solves this challenge by using infrasound. Whereas previous efforts used sound waves in the range of 30 to 60 hertz, which can be produced with simpler equipment, Sonic stays at or below 20 hertz. These waves are inaudible to people, and they travel farther than higher-frequency waves.

Homes often catch fire from embers accumulating in adjacent foliage or entering attic vents, Bruder says. Sonic's system uses a piston pulsed by an electric motor to create sound waves, which travel through metallic ducts installed on a building's roof and under its eaves. The system autoactivates when sensors detect a flame, creating a kind of force field of infrasound to extinguish it and prevent new ignition.

Acoustic waves can have a strong effect on fire, but they work only on small flames, says Arnaud Trouvé, chair of the University of Maryland's department of fire protection engineering. Nevertheless, homeowners and utilities are game to give it a try: Sonic is working with two California utilities to demonstrate its technology. Homeowners have also signed contracts with the company, which is aiming to have 50 pilot installations early in 2026.

Included in the haul is a cannon, two porcelain cups, and three gold and bronze coins. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The hauling up of the world's most valuable shipwreck has to start somewhere. So crews have brought to the surface three small gold and bronze coins from the 1700s, pulled from the Spanish galleon the San José, considered the Holy Grail of all shipwrecks. But there's plenty more still sitting 1,970 feet below the ocean's surface off the coast of Colombia, as much as $17 billion worth. 

The San José, sunk by the British Royal Navy in the Caribbean during the War of Spanish Succession in 1708, was full of value. The ship was laden with 10 years' worth of gold, silver, and gems, tribute from Spanish colonies in Latin America headed back to the Spanish king. Experts have now pulled up the first pieces from the ship, including coins, a cannon, and porcelain cups. 

An English cannon sent the ship—part of the Flota de Tierra Firme fleet that left Peru in 1707—to the ocean's floor. where it laid dormant for hundreds of years. The Colombian government claims it found the ship in 2015. Current estimates of the on-board value have ranged from $10 billion to $17 billion in today's currency, sparking a custody battle between the Spanish and Colombian government over who has the rights to the loot.

A recent study confirmed the presence of macuquinas coins—knowns as cobs in English—strewn across the wreck site around the San José. The Colombian Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Knowledge has taken the next steps to recover the treasure, using a robotic underwater vehicle to secure samples of the cargo. 

The team used the equipment to search the structure of the vessel without disturbing the galleon, picking three coins, a bronze cannon (as well as fragments of wood, rope, and sediment from the cannon) and two porcelain cups—each with a different style. The team took the items to the Center for Archaeological and Historical Research and the National Museum of Colombia for preservation. 

Alhena Caicedo Fernandez, director of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History said in a translated statement that collecting the objects “opens the possibility that citizen can approach, through material testimony, the history of the San José galleon.” 

An estimated 200 tons of gold, silver, and uncut gemstones were aboard the ship, the result of 10 years of taxation saved up before the fleet's planed voyage back to Spain. The macuquinas were the main currency in the Americas during the time, typically cut from gold or silver ingots, and were the primary way the Spanish transported large volumes of wealth from the Americas to Europe. These coin hoards likely formed part of the royal treasure dispatched from Peru. But when the fleet of 18 ships left Cartagena bound for Spain on June 8, 1708, it was attacked by five British warships. The cannon battle resulted in the explosion of the San José's gunpowder stores, sinking the 150-foot-long ship. 

The shipwreck—and treasured cargo—has sat on the ocean floor ever since. Now, bit by bit, it may reach the surface once more.

Blood type A(B) is caused by a four gene mutations and was discovered when the blood of patients and donors was being studied in a Thai hospital.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

What's your sign? What's your aura? What's your blood type? While horoscopes and New Age crystals often provide clear answers to the first two questions, the last one on that list can get complicated sometimes.

Blood types are identified by antigens—compounds made of sugars and proteins that alert the immune system to the presence of something foreign in the body—and they are the foundation of the ABO blood group system laid out by Karl Landsteiner in 1901. The A antigen has N-acetylgalactosamine as its dominant sugar, the B antigen is dominated by the sugar D-galactose, and type AB blood has both antigens. Type O positive uses a different antigen altogether (known as the rhesus, or Rh, factor), and Type O negative has none of the above. All of this complexity is encoded into proteins by out ABO gene, located on our ninth chromosome. 

While interesting in and of themselves, antigens become especially important when it comes to donating blood to and receiving blood from others. For blood transfusions to succeed, the antigens of the patient's blood and the donor's blood have to match, or else the new blood will be rejected by antibodies in the plasma. This is whytype O negative blood is seen as the universal donor type—because it has neither of the A or B antigens nor the Rh(D) antigen, there is virtually no risk of rejection.

But even rarer blood types than O negative exist. There are fifty people on the entire planet with Rh-negative blood, nicknamed “golden blood,” which is completely devoid of Rh antigens. And there is only one individual known to have Gwada negative blood, which was only discovered earlier this year. While O negative is only found in 7% of the global population, researchers who tested the blood of patients and donors in a Thai hospital have now discovered yet another new type that runs through the veins of only three known individuals (it was found in one patient and two donors). What is now recognized as type B(A) has mostly B antigens, but also trace A antigens. 

“ABO discrepancies were distinct between donors and patients even in the same ethnicity,” the researchers said in a study recently published in the journal Transfusion and Apheresis Science. “This finding highlighted the influence of the patient's conditions and therapy on the anomalous ABO typing. Additionally, the B(A) individuals identified in this study carried identical genetic alterations that differed from all antecedent alleles of the B(A) phenotype.”

The researchers saw four alleles—alternative forms of certain genes at the same location on a chromosome—on the B(A) type that differed from alleles associated with other blood type and created B(A). Mutations like this had previously been seen in many ethnicities, including individuals from other parts of Asia, but it was the first time such a phenomenon was ever recorded in the Thai population. B(A) adds one more type to the 48 already known to occur in humans. 

There could be more blood types out there that remain undiscovered, and more individuals with those extremely rare blood types. And the three currently known occurrences of B(A) may not be the only ones in the world. Further research may find more of either, and this discovery is proof that blood typing is not so simple as ABO.

The two-masted schooner was fully intact—a rarity in Great Lakes shipwreck finds.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A team of five divers descended over 300 feet into Lake Ontario's dark waters near Toronto and found much more than they were dreaming of. In a search for what the team surmised could be a ship lost in 1917, they instead found a shipwreck they believe is possibly 100 years older. 

The divers discovered a two-masted schooner sitting upright, with both masts still fully intact, in what the Ontario Underwater Council called an “extraordinary state of preservation for a Great Lakes vessel.” After some preliminary investigation, the team believes the ship may come from an under-documented period of Great Lakes shipbuilding, sometime between 1800 and 1850. 

“It took us a few moments to calm ourselves down because it's overwhelming finding a pristine wreck that is all in one piece,” Heison Chak, the president of the Ontario Underwater Council, told the CBC. “It's got its shape. It hasn't broken down both masts. We saw two—both masts were standing, which is pretty rare. In all the rest that I have dove, either they have fallen off, because boats come across them, anchors wreck them, [or] divers damage them.”

A fiber-optic cable survey of the lake from Buffalo to Toronto alerted experts to an anomaly sitting on the lakebed, leading experts to surmise it could be the Rapid City vessel, an 1884-built schooner lost in 1917. 

Now, though, they don't think it can be that recent a wreckage.

James Conolly, Trent University archaeologist and diver, said there were features that just weren't common for ships built after 1850, a period that experienced a bit of a technological leap for Great Lakes ships. Post-1850s ships had metal rigging, whereas the one found is rope-rigged. “It immediately puts it into, likely, the first half of the 19th century,” Conolly said. 

Other features were different than what the team was expecting to find, including the ship having no wheel on the aft deck, an early windlass design, and no centerboard winch that became a standard movable keel for Great Lakes ships during the 1850s.  

While the 1850s may have seen a modern boon for shipbuilding in the Great Lakes, the previous 50 years helped kickstart lake-travel trade, even if the ships built were commonly lost due to storms and mishaps. Much of the history of the era is also lost. 

“This is deep enough that I don't think anyone's been on it,” Chak said. “I think we're the first group and that joy was just overwhelming.” 

Not everyone is so readily convinced. Charles Beeker, a Great Lakes shipwreck expert and professor at Indiana University, told the CBC it's too early to say the vessel is from 1800 to 1850. “I don't want to diminish the value of it,” he said. “They may be able to identify the vessel, maybe identify the shipyard, and that would be useful to look at an actual intact vessel on the bottom to compare to what little we do have in terms of drawings, and tonnage, and information from these vessels, and the older you go, the less information we have.” 

Layers of invasive quagga mussels cover much of the woodwork, eroding the detailing. “Where a wreck might once have survived intact for centuries,” Conolly said, “we now have only decades to study it before biological and environmental factors take their toll.” 

The team plans to further explore the wreck, hoping to get more detailed measurements, photography, and wood sampling to pinpoint the ship's age and history.

“We don't know, but if it is really that era,” Chak said, “from 1800 to 1850, I think we will have even more celebration because we hit the jackpot where there is very little history or studied documented material about shipwrecks, ships, or shipbuilding in that era.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Humans are built for nature not modern life","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251207031335.htm","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 05:49:56 GMT","

A new analysis by evolutionary anthropologists Colin Shaw (University of Zurich) and Daniel Longman (Loughborough University) argues that the modern world has developed faster than human biology can adapt. Their work proposes that chronic stress and many widespread health concerns stem from a fundamental mismatch between our nature-shaped physiology and the highly industrialized environments most people live in today.

For hundreds of thousands of years, humans evolved to meet the physical and psychological demands of hunter-gatherer life, which required frequent movement, short bursts of intense stress and daily exposure to natural settings. Industrialization has altered these conditions within only a few centuries by adding noise, air and light pollution, microplastics, pesticides, continuous sensory input, artificial lighting, processed foods and long periods of sitting.

""In our ancestral environments, we were well adapted to deal with acute stress to evade or confront predators,"" says Colin Shaw, who leads the Human Evolutionary EcoPhysiology (HEEP) research group with Daniel Longman. ""The lion would come around occasionally, and you had to be ready to defend yourself -- or run. The key is that the lion goes away again.""

Modern stressors such as traffic, workplace pressure, social media and persistent noise activate the same biological pathways that once helped humans survive predators. Unlike the rapid resolution our ancestors experienced, these stressors rarely subside. ""Our body reacts as though all these stressors were lions,"" Longman explains. ""Whether it's a difficult discussion with your boss or traffic noise, your stress response system is still the same as if you were facing lion after lion. As a result, you have a very powerful response from your nervous system, but no recovery.""

Industrialization and Its Impact on Health and Reproduction

In their review, Shaw and Longman evaluate research suggesting that the shift toward industrial and urban living is reducing human evolutionary fitness. Evolutionary success depends on both survival and reproduction, and the authors argue that both have been negatively influenced since industrialization began.

They highlight falling fertility rates across much of the world and increasing rates of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions as evidence that modern environments are placing stress on human biology. ""There's a paradox where, on the one hand, we've created tremendous wealth, comfort and healthcare for a lot of people on the planet,"" Shaw says, ""but on the other hand, some of these industrial achievements are having detrimental effects on our immune, cognitive, physical and reproductive functions.""

One of the most studied examples is the steady decline in sperm count and sperm motility observed since the 1950s. Shaw notes that these trends appear to be linked to environmental exposures. ""This is believed to be tied to pesticides and herbicides in food, but also to microplastics,"" he says.

Searching for Solutions That Support Human Wellbeing

Technological and environmental conditions continue to change far more rapidly than biological evolution can respond to. ""Biological adaptation is very slow. Longer-term genetic adaptations are multigenerational -- tens to hundreds of thousands of years,"" Shaw says.

According to the researchers, this means the mismatch between human physiology and modern living conditions will not correct itself through natural evolutionary processes. Instead, they argue that societies must take active steps to reduce these pressures by strengthening connections to nature and creating healthier, more sustainable environments.

Addressing this mismatch requires both cultural and environmental changes. Shaw suggests treating nature as a crucial component of public health and protecting or restoring landscapes that resemble those in which humans originally evolved. He also advocates for rethinking city design to better align with human physiology and reduce harmful exposures.

""Our research can identify which stimuli most affect blood pressure, heart rate or immune function, for example, and pass that knowledge on to decision-makers,"" Shaw says. ""We need to get our cities right -- and at the same time regenerate, value and spend more time in natural spaces.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Garlic mouthwash shows shockingly strong germ-fighting power","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251207031338.htm","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 06:18:26 GMT","

Garlic extract has been found to offer antimicrobial effects that are on par with commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants such as chlorhexidine, according to medical researchers at the University of Sharjah.

The study, published in the Journal of Herbal Medicine, reports that garlic-based mouthwash may produce more discomfort than chlorhexidine but appears to provide longer-lasting residual activity.

""Chlorhexidine is widely used as a gold standard mouthwash but is associated with side effects and concerns over antimicrobial resistance,"" the authors explain. ""Garlic (Allium sativum), known for natural antimicrobial properties, has emerged as a potential alternative.""

Systematic Review Compares Garlic and Chlorhexidine

The researchers based their conclusions on a systematic review examining how garlic extract performs against chlorhexidine in clinical settings and whether it can realistically function as an herbal substitute.

Their analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 2020 guidelines, which are designed to increase the reliability and transparency of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The authors also used the PICO framework to structure their clinical research questions.

""A total of 389 articles were identified from six electronic databases in January 2024, and an additional 13 articles were included through manual citation searching. After removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, only five articles were included,"" they report.

Review Finds Comparable Antimicrobial Performance

The selected literature consisted of randomized controlled trials and clinical studies with varying designs and low-to-moderate risks of bias. Overall, the authors found that higher concentrations of garlic extract mouthwash showed antimicrobial results similar to those of chlorhexidine.

""The effectiveness varied based on mouthwash concentration and duration of application, contributing to differences in outcomes,"" the review noted. ""Some studies favored chlorhexidine for maintaining higher plaque/salivary pH, while others reported garlic extract to be more effective at certain concentrations. However, garlic mouthwash may cause greater discomfort.""

Side Effects and Patient Considerations

Although garlic extract can produce side effects, they are typically milder than those associated with synthetic chemicals. Reported issues include a burning sensation and unpleasant odor, which may influence whether patients are willing to switch from chlorhexidine to garlic-based options.

Even with these drawbacks, the review offers strong support for the clinical antimicrobial activity of garlic extract, reporting ""significant reductions in bacterial counts from baseline … suggesting the possible use of garlic extract mouthwash as a viable alternative to chlorhexidine in certain contexts.""

The authors recommend additional clinical trials with larger participant numbers and longer follow-up periods to confirm the ""effectiveness and improve clinical applicability"" of garlic as an alternative to chlorhexidine, which is still considered the gold standard antimicrobial mouthwash.

Garlic's Long History as a Natural Antimicrobial

Garlic has long been recognized as one of the most potent naturally occurring antibacterial and antifungal crops. Scientific interest has focused particularly on allicin, a compound known for its strong antimicrobial activity. Although classified botanically as a vegetable, garlic is commonly used as both an herb and a spice.

Worldwide garlic usage reached about 30 million metric tons in 2024. China accounted for nearly 80 percent of global consumption and production. That same year, the global garlic extract market was valued at more than 15 billion dollars.

Growing Interest in Herbal Oral Care Alternatives

Garlic extracts are widely available in various health products over-the-counter. By comparison, synthetic agents like chlorhexidine usually require a prescription from a dentist or physician.

""Antimicrobial mouthwashes constitute an essential adjunct element in oral and dental care, acting against oral diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses attacking oral hard or soft tissues,"" the review states. ""Different antimicrobial mouthwashes, whether available over-the-counter or on prescription, can be used in the management of gingivitis, dental caries, periodontal diseases, halitosis, etc.""

Evidence Expands but Clinical Gaps Remain

The review points to numerous studies that demonstrate antimicrobial effects of garlic extracts against a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. It also notes that garlic extract has been explored in areas such as denture stomatitis, dentinal tubule disinfection, and intracanal medication.

""These studies have contributed to understanding the antimicrobial role of garlic extract in comparison to synthetic agents like chlorhexidine,"" the authors write. ""However, most studies are in vitro, vary in methods, and lack clinical standardization, highlighting the need for further research to confirm garlic's efficacy in dental practice. This uncertainty presents a significant gap in the literature on evidence-based antimicrobial therapies.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This simple ingredient makes kale way healthier","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251207031339.htm","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:33:26 GMT","

Many people assume a bowl of kale automatically counts as a nutritional powerhouse. However, without the right companion ingredient, that leafy salad may not deliver the benefits you expect.

Fortunately, there is an easy fix.

Researchers at the University of Missouri have identified a simple (and tasty) way to help the body absorb more of kale's valuable nutrients: using oil-based dressings or sauces. With the right fat source, you can enjoy kale while actually getting more from it.

Oil Helps Release Kale's Hard-to-Access Nutrients

A study from Mizzou's College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR) found that it makes little difference whether kale is eaten raw or cooked. The key factor that improves nutrient absorption is pairing it with olive oil, mayonnaise or another oil-based dressing. The team is now looking into how nanotechnology-inspired dressings could be designed to boost this effect even further.

""Kale is a nutrient-rich vegetable that contains carotenoids, including lutein, α-carotene and β-carotene, which have beneficial effects on overall health,"" Ruojie (Vanessa) Zhang, assistant professor in the Division of Food, Nutrition and Exercise Sciences at CAFNR, said. ""The problem is our bodies have a hard time absorbing these nutrients because they are fat-soluble rather than water-soluble.""

Testing Whether Cooking or Special Sauces Improve Absorption

With this challenge in mind, the researchers examined whether cooking kale or using specially formulated dressings/sauces could make carotenoids easier for the body to access. These compounds, along with vitamins C and E and other bioactive plant chemicals in kale, have been associated with stronger immunity, improved vision and lower risk of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.

To test this, the team used a laboratory model that mimics human digestion. They evaluated kale prepared in different ways: raw, cooked, raw or cooked with dressing/sauce, and cooked directly in sauce.

The experiments showed that raw kale on its own resulted in very low carotenoid absorption, and cooking kale slightly reduced absorption even further. The major breakthrough appeared when the researchers added a nanoemulsion-based sauce. In the simulated digestion model, this sauce significantly increased the amount of absorbed carotenoids, whether the kale was raw or cooked. Cooking the kale with the sauce provided the same benefit as adding the sauce after cooking.

A New Strategy for Getting More Nutrition From Vegetables

These results highlight practical, science-backed ways to help the body take in more beneficial nutrients from produce. They also suggest new possibilities for improving everyday meals simply by changing how foods are prepared or seasoned. Zhang hopes future work will lead to innovative dressings and sauces that enhance nutrient absorption not only for kale but for other vegetables as well.

""Our team is committed to advancing food science with the goal of improving human health through the development of innovative foods and technologies,"" she said. ""We believe impactful science can drive meaningful change in global nutrition and well-being, and we're excited to contribute to that mission.""

Study Details and Research Team

The study, ""Culinary strategies for improving carotenoid bioaccessibility in kale: The role of thermal processing and excipient emulsions,"" was published in Food Nutrition.

Co-authors include Dr. Zipei Zhang from Mizzou's College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources; Hangxin Zhu, a doctoral student at Mizzou; and Dr. David Julian McClements from University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists capture most detailed look inside DNA droplets","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251208014625.htm","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 11:50:56 GMT","

Inside every human cell, an extraordinary feat of molecular organization takes place. Roughly six feet of DNA has to be packed into a nucleus that is only about one-tenth the width of a human hair, yet the DNA must remain accessible enough to carry out essential functions.

To make this possible, DNA coils around proteins to form nucleosomes. These nucleosomes connect like beads on a string and fold into chromatin fibers. The fibers are then compacted even more tightly to fit inside the nucleus.

Discovering How DNA Reaches Its Most Compact Form

For many years, researchers did not know how this extra level of chromatin compaction occurred. In 2019, HHMI Investigator Michael Rosen and his team at UT Southwestern Medical Center reported that lab-made nucleosomes naturally cluster together into membrane-less droplets called condensates. They found that this process occurs through phase separation, a phenomenon similar to oil droplets forming in water, and they believe it reflects how chromatin condenses inside living cells.

Chromatin condensates are made of hundreds of thousands of fast-moving molecules. When they come together, they display emergent properties that do not exist in the molecules individually. These group behaviors determine how condensates form and how they maintain their physical characteristics.

To understand these properties in detail, scientists needed to observe chromatin fibers and nucleosomes deep inside the droplets.

Rosen's group, working with HHMI Investigator Elizabeth Villa at the University of California, San Diego; Rosana Collepardo-Guevara at the University of Cambridge; and Zhiheng Yu at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus, has now achieved that goal.

High-Resolution Imaging Reveals Droplet Structure

Using advanced imaging tools at Janelia, the researchers captured the most detailed views to date of how molecules are arranged inside synthetic chromatin condensates. These images provide a direct look at how chromatin fibers and nucleosomes are packaged within the droplet-like structures. The same imaging methods were also applied to examine chromatin inside actual cells.

By combining these images with computer simulations and light microscopy, the team analyzed the molecular structures and interactions within the synthetic condensates. This allowed them to begin uncovering how droplets form and how they behave.

One important discovery was that the length of linker DNA between nucleosomes influences the overall arrangement of the structures. That arrangement determines how chromatin fibers interact and shapes the network inside the condensates.

These features clarified why some chromatin fibers undergo phase separation more easily than others and why condensates built from different chromatin types have distinct material properties. The researchers also found that synthetic condensates closely resemble compacted chromatin found in cells.

""The work has allowed us to tie the structures of individual molecules to macroscopic properties of their condensates, really for the first time,"" Rosen says. ""I'm certain that we're only at the tip of the iceberg -- that we and others will come up with even better ways of developing those structure-function relationships at the meso (intermediate) scale.""

A Broader Framework for Understanding Condensation

The findings extend well beyond chromatin. The approach offers a model for studying many kinds of biomolecular condensates, which are membrane-less droplets involved in essential cellular tasks from gene regulation to stress responses.

Understanding how these structures assemble and operate may also shed light on what happens when condensation is disrupted, a problem thought to contribute to various diseases from neurodegenerative disorders to cancer.

""By doing this research, we will better understand how abnormal condensation could lead to different diseases and, potentially, that could help us develop a new generation of therapeutics,"" says Huabin Zhou, a postdoctoral scientist in the Rosen Lab and the lead author of the new research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Gut molecule shows remarkable anti-diabetes power","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251208052518.htm","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:53:56 GMT","

An international group of scientists led by Professor Marc-Emmanuel Dumas at Imperial College London & CNRS, along with Prof. Patrice Cani (Imperial & University of Louvain, UCLouvain), Dr. Dominique Gauguier (Imperial & INSERM, Paris) and Prof. Peter Liu (University of Ottawa Heart Institute), has identified an unexpected natural compound that helps counter insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The compound, trimethylamine (TMA), is a metabolite created by gut microbes from dietary choline. According to a study in Nature Metabolism, TMA can interrupt a key immune pathway and contribute to healthier blood sugar levels.

The discovery builds on work that began 20 years ago. During his postdoctoral research, Patrice Cani found that high-fat diets allow bacterial components to pass into the body, prompting the immune system to activate and ignite inflammation. This immune response was shown to play a direct role in insulin resistance among people with diabetes. Although this idea faced skepticism in 2005, it is now widely recognized and scientifically accepted.

In 2025, researchers at the University of Louvain and Imperial College London clarified how this harmful chain reaction might be counteracted. They reported that TMA, formed by gut microbes from dietary choline present in several foods, can support improved blood-sugar control.

TMA Blocks a Critical Immune Protein

The key lies in the molecule's interaction with IRAK4, a protein that helps regulate immune activity. Under a high-fat diet, IRAK4 responds by triggering inflammation to signal that the body is experiencing dietary imbalance.

However, when the body is exposed to elevated fat intake for extended periods (as in type 2 diabetes), IRAK4 becomes overstimulated. This constant activation drives chronic inflammation, which contributes directly to insulin resistance.

Using a combination of human cell cultures, animal studies, and molecular screening tools, the research team demonstrated that TMA can attach to IRAK4 and reduce its activity. This interaction lowers inflammation caused by fatty foods and restores the body's ability to respond to insulin. The findings suggest that TMA may help recalibrate harmful metabolic responses triggered by poor dietary habits. The molecule also showed an impressive ability to protect mice from sepsis-related death by weakening overwhelming inflammatory responses.

IRAK4 Targeting Offers New Therapeutic Possibilities

Further experiments confirmed that removing the IRAK4 gene or inhibiting it with drugs produced the same beneficial effects seen with TMA. Because IRAK4 is already a well-established target in drug development, the results point toward promising treatment strategies for diabetes.

""This flips the narrative,"" said Prof. Dumas. ""We've shown that a molecule from our gut microbes can actually protect against the harmful effects of a poor diet through a new mechanism. It's a new way of thinking about how the microbiome influences our health.""

""This shows how nutrition and our gut microbes can work together by producing molecules that fight inflammation and improve metabolic health!"" said Prof. Patrice Cani, co-senior author, University of Louvain, Belgium and visiting professor at Imperial College London.

Global Impact and Future Directions

With more than 500 million people worldwide living with diabetes, the identification of TMA as a microbial signal that shapes immune responses introduces a potential new avenue for treatment. Approaches that enhance TMA production, whether through diet or medication, could help reduce insulin resistance and improve long-term health outcomes.

""What we eat shapes our microbes and some of their molecules can protect us from diabetes. That's nutrition in action!"" said University of Louvain, Prof. Cani.

This work was supported by an extensive network of collaborators across Europe and North America, involving teams in Belgium, Canada, Australia, France, Italy, and Spain. Funding came from numerous European (ERC, FEDER) and national (MRC, Wellcome Trust, ANR, FNRS, EOS, WELRi, ARC) sources, highlighting the large-scale effort behind this breakthrough.

Ten years after the first detection of gravitational waves from two merging black holes, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, which includes Columbia University astronomer Maximiliano Isi, has captured a remarkably similar event with far greater detail. Advances in detector sensitivity allowed the team to observe this latest collision almost four times more clearly than the original discovery. With this improved view, researchers were able to verify two major predictions: that black holes produced through mergers never become smaller in total size, as proposed by Stephen Hawking, and that disturbed black holes vibrate in a way that resembles the ringing of a bell, a behavior expected from Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.

""This unprecedentedly clear signal of the black hole merger known as GW250114 puts to the test some of our most important conjectures about black holes and gravitational waves,"" Isi said.

Revisiting Hawking's Prediction

In 1971, Stephen Hawking proposed that a black hole's event horizon, its outer boundary where neither light nor matter can escape, cannot shrink.

In 2021, Isi and colleagues used LIGO data to examine gravitational waves emitted during a black hole merger and produced one of the first observational confirmations of Hawking's idea. At the time, The New York Times noted that if this confirmation had come while Hawking was still alive, it might have contributed to him receiving a Nobel Prize.

Higher Precision Reinforces the Theory

The newly analyzed signal strengthens the earlier findings with far greater accuracy. It shows that the surface area of the final merged black hole is always at least as large as the combined areas of the two original black holes. This level of precision was possible because the study drew on data from both LIGO detectors, located in Washington state and Louisiana.

Researchers also succeeded in separating and examining the gravitational waves produced after the merger. By studying the pitch and duration of these post-collision waves, they uncovered new insights into the size and internal characteristics of the newly formed black hole. (The process works in much the same way that analyzing the pitch of a sound emitted by a hollow instrument can tell you about the size and shape of both the instrument and the object that struck it.)

Strongest Evidence Yet for a Kerr Black Hole

Their findings showed that the final black hole matches the expectations of a ""Kerr black hole."" In the 1960s, mathematician Roy Kerr solved Einstein's equations to describe the precise structure of a rotating black hole. Physicists generally expect all black holes to behave according to this solution, but obtaining direct proof has been extremely difficult. By analyzing the vibrations of the merged black hole in this especially clear signal, Isi and the LIGO team produced the most compelling evidence to date that real black holes follow Kerr's model.

""Over the next decade, gravitational wave detectors like LIGO will continue to improve, giving us a sharper view of black holes and their mysteries,"" Isi said, ""I can't wait to see what we find out.""

""Why are we here?"" remains one of the most enduring questions humans have posed. One way scientists approach this idea is by tracing where the elements around us first formed. Many elements are created inside stars and in the explosive debris of supernovae, which scatter this material across space, but the origins of several important elements have been difficult to explain.

Chlorine and potassium fall into this category. They are classified as odd-Z elements -- possessing an odd number of protons -- and are crucial for both life and the development of planets. Current models, however, indicate that stars should produce only about one-tenth of the chlorine and potassium that astronomers actually observe in the universe, leading to a long-standing scientific puzzle.

XRISM Offers a New Way to Study Supernova Debris

This gap in understanding led researchers at Kyoto University and Meiji University to investigate whether supernova remnants might hold the missing clues. They used XRISM -- short for X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission, an X-ray satellite launched by JAXA in 2023 -- to gather high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic data from the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant in the Milky Way.

To accomplish this, the team relied on the microcalorimeter Resolve instrument on XRISM. The device provides energy resolution roughly ten times sharper than earlier X-ray detectors, which allowed the researchers to pick up faint emission lines associated with rare elements. After collecting the data from Cassiopeia A, they compared the measured amounts of chlorine and potassium with several theoretical models of how supernovae create elements.

Evidence That Supernovae Produce Life-Related Elements

The results showed clear X-ray emission lines of both chlorine and potassium at levels far higher than expected from standard models. This marks the first observational confirmation that a single supernova can generate enough of these elements to match what astronomers see in the cosmos. The researchers believe that strong internal mixing inside massive stars, possibly driven by rapid rotation, binary interactions, or shell-merger events, can greatly increase the production of these elements.

""When we saw the Resolve data for the first time, we detected elements I never expected to see before the launch. Making such a discovery with a satellite we developed is a true joy as a researcher,"" says corresponding author Toshiki Sato.

Insights Into How Stars Shape the Building Blocks of Life

These findings show that the chemical ingredients essential for life formed under extreme conditions deep within stars, far removed from anything resembling the environments where life later emerged. The work also demonstrates how powerful high-precision X-ray spectroscopy has become in uncovering the processes at work inside stellar interiors.

""I am delighted that we have been able, even if only slightly, to begin to understand what is happening inside exploding stars,"" says corresponding author Hiroyuki Uchida.

Next Steps for Understanding Stellar Evolution

The team plans to continue studying additional supernova remnants with XRISM to determine whether the elevated levels of chlorine and potassium found in Cassiopeia A are typical of massive stars or unique to this particular remnant. This will help reveal whether the internal mixing processes identified here are a widespread feature of stellar evolution.

""How Earth and life came into existence is an eternal question that everyone has pondered at least once. Our study reveals only a small part of that vast story, but I feel truly honored to have contributed to it,"" says corresponding author Kai Matsunaga.

On a video call in early September, Sarah Tabrizi first saw the data that she and other researchers studying Huntington's disease had been chasing for decades: compelling evidence that a gene-targeting therapy could slow the relentless progression of the neurodegenerative brain disorder.

Before these results, “I was beginning to get a little bit worried that maybe, by the time people develop symptoms, that it was going to be too late to treat”, says Tabrizi, a neurologist who directs the Huntington's Disease Centre at University College London. But here was powerful validation that the window for treating the rare, hereditary condition remains open — offering a chance for meaningful, disease-modifying interventions.



“It's a giant step forward,” says Tabrizi, who was the trial's lead scientific adviser. “The dial has been shifted.”

The first-in-class gene therapy — called AMT-130 and developed by uniQure, a biotechnology company in Amsterdam — uses a harmless virus to deliver strands of genetic material into affected brain regions. Once there, the therapy switches off production of the faulty mutant huntingtin protein that slowly destroys brain cells.

The clinical data set was small, involving just 12 people who received a high dose of the therapy. And the treatment is invasive, requiring lengthy brain surgery. But the results were striking. On a standard rating scale used to assesses motor and cognitive functions and other measures of daily living, the scores of participants receiving the high dose dropped by just 0.38 points over three years. That's compared with a reduction of 1.52 points for people in a control group, meaning that the treatment slowed the rate of decline by 75%. That clinical benefit was reinforced by molecular validation: spinal-fluid levels of a protein linked to dying brain cells had gone down in the treatment recipients, the opposite of what typically occurs as the disease progresses.

After digesting the findings, Tabrizi and her close collaborator Ed Wild, a fellow neurologist at University College London, shared what Wild describes as a “massive hug”. But, after that, it was right back to the daily demands of patient care and research. “We'll celebrate very unreservedly — but briefly,” Wild says. “We're like an episode of The West Wing: it's always, ‘What's next?'”

Next for Tabrizi and Wild are leading roles in evaluating five other huntingtin-lowering therapies in clinical development, along with several others poised to enter human trials soon. Tabrizi is also spearheading laboratory studies into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration — work that could yield many other drug candidates in the future.

“Sarah is amazing,” says Hugh Rickards, a neuropsychiatrist at the University of Birmingham, UK. “She's the spider in the middle of the web. You name a disease-modifying therapy in HD — she's got her hand on it somewhere.”

Plus, “she's one of the nicest people you'll ever meet”, says Samuel Frank, a neurologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, who, like Rickards, has worked with Tabrizi on Huntington's trials.

Playing a part in nearly every important clinical advance means that she also carries the scars of the field's most agonizing disappointments. Only four years ago, another promising huntingtin-targeted therapy, tominersen, faltered in late-stage trials. Overall, the drug failed to improve people's outcomes compared with those of the control group and it came with dangerous side effects at higher doses. As principal investigator of the nearly 800-person study, the unenviable task of explaining the results to participating families fell to Tabrizi. “It was heartbreaking,” she says.

She recalls her message to the distraught community: “Trials are scientific experiments,” she says. “Through failure, as painful as it is, is often how you learn.”

Synthesizing perceivable artificial neural inputs independent of typical sensory channels remains a fundamental challenge in developing next-generation brain−machine interfaces. Establishing a minimally invasive, wirelessly effective and miniaturized platform with long-term stability is crucial for creating research methods and clinically meaningful biointerfaces capable of mediating artificial perceptual feedback. Here we demonstrate a miniaturized, fully implantable transcranial optogenetic neural stimulator designed to generate artificial perceptions by patterning large cortical ensembles wirelessly in real time. Experimentally validated numerical simulations characterized light and heat propagation, whereas neuronal responses were assessed by in vivo electrophysiology and molecular methods. Cue discrimination during operant learning demonstrated the wireless genesis of artificial percepts sensed by mice, where spatial distance across large cortical networks and sequential order-based analyses of discrimination predicted performance. These conceptual and technical advances expand understanding of artificially patterned neural activity and its perception by the brain to guide the evolution of next-generation all-optical brain−machine communication.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells. While plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are poor antigen-presenting cells at steady state, myeloid DCs (mDCs), which include DC1s, DC2s and DC3s, are specialized in T cell priming. To generate unbiased human DC atlases, we integrated DCs from 13 tumor tissues across 40 datasets to create a pDC + mDC-VERSE (DC-VERSE) and an mDC-VERSE single-cell RNA-sequencing compendium. We characterized DC subsets and ‘states' across these tissues. Most studied tumors contained CD207+ DCs, a subset of CD1c+ DCs, whose expansion inversely correlated with tumor CD8+ resident memory T cells, T cell clonality and the survival of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Similarly to CCR7+ mDCs (a common state of DC1s, DC2s and DC3s), we found that CD207+ DCs were a common state of DC2s and DC3s. Spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic and immunohistofluorescence analyses of human carcinomas demonstrated that lymphocytes and most DCs were enriched within the tumor stroma, while CD207+ DCs were mostly embedded within tumor nests. These DC-VERSEs provide a robust resource available to the scientific community on DCs in health and pathology.

Controlled multimode wave propagation can enable more space-efficient photonic processors than architectures based on discrete components connected by single-mode waveguides. Instead of defining discrete elements, one can sculpt the continuous substrate of a photonic processor to perform computations through multimode interference in two dimensions. Here we designed and demonstrated a device with a refractive index that can be rapidly reprogrammed across space, allowing arbitrary control of wave propagation. The device, a two-dimensional programmable waveguide, uses parallel electro-optic modulation of the refractive index of a slab waveguide with about 104 programmable spatial degrees of freedom. We implemented neural network inference on benchmark tasks with up to 49-dimensional vectors in a single pass, without digital pre-processing or post-processing. Theoretical and numerical analyses further indicated that two-dimensional programmable waveguides may offer not only a constant-factor reduction in device area but also a scaling benefit, with the area required growing as N1.5 rather than N2.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained widespread adoption across many domains ranging from computer vision to natural language processing1. The size of DNN models has been increasing exponentially over the past decade, leading to exponentially increasing energy costs for running them. Limits to energy costs now impose a practical constraint on how large models can be2, strongly motivating the exploration of alternative and energy-efficient computing approaches for executing DNNs, with a computational cost that is typically dominated by that of matrix–vector multiplications (MVMs). Optical neural networks, particularly those integrated on photonic chips that specialize in performing MVMs with optics instead of electronics, are one promising candidate approach3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

The dominant paradigm for designing integrated photonic neural networks is to construct networks of discrete, programmable photonic components, such as Mach–Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), microring resonators or phase-change memory cells, connected by single-mode waveguides10. These networks execute a linear optical operation: an MVM between the vector encoded in the optical input to the chip and the matrix programmed in the discrete components. However, the maximum vector size, N, supported by chips using this approach has so far been restricted (Supplementary Table 1) to sizes far below what is necessary for optics to deliver an energy-efficiency advantage (N ≳ 1,000)11,12,13,14. The scale of such chips has been limited by at least two factors. First, the co-integration of optical and electrical components poses the challenge of routing \({\mathcal{O}}({N}^{2})\) electronic wires carrying the parameters of the matrix multiplication through the perimeter of the chip, often limiting the controllable degrees of freedom to a few hundred parameters. Second, individual optical components are rather bulky owing to the comparably large optical wavelength and the often weak programmability of optical materials. On top of that, substantial portions of the chip's area need to be dedicated to sprawling interconnection regions comprising well-isolated waveguides.

We could achieve far greater spatial efficiency if we treated the entire chip as a blank slate with refractive index distribution, n(x, z), as a function of space, which we could arbitrarily and reprogrammably sculpt, instead of building the integrated photonic neural network from discrete components15,16,17,18,19,20. This study addressed a central challenge: how to make a photonic chip with a programmable refractive index distribution, ideally without the integration complexity of introducing electronic wiring. In conventional nanophotonic chips, n(x, z) is controlled by etching away material in lithographically defined regions and is fixed at fabrication time. Although inverse-designed chips21 realizing MVMs with fixed matrices can be made19, we generally would like to be able to program the matrix. Photorefractive crystals were explored several decades ago as a means to implement programmable linear operations with slab waveguides22,23 but fell out of favour because the small achievable refractive index modulation (10−4) meant that even centimetre-scale waveguides were unable to perform large-scale operations. Additionally, phase-change materials have recently been demonstrated to realize arbitrary refractive index distributions24,25 but suffer from a limited number of rewrite cycles (4,000 in ref. 26) and high loss (greater than 2.8 dB mm−1 in refs. 25,26). The scale is currently limited; a previous study reported programming a device with a three-dimensional input and a three-dimensional output25.

Here we introduce a photonic chip with a waveguide that is fully programmable in two dimensions: a two-dimensional (2D) programmable waveguide. The chip uses massively parallel electro-optic modulation to program n(x, z) across ~10,000 individual regions of a lithium niobate slab waveguide. We trained multimode photonic structures within the chip that perform neural network inference (Fig. 1). The structures realized by our 2D-programmable waveguide are similar to inverse-designed nanophotonic devices19,21; they are computer-optimized 2D metastructures that control multimode wave propagation. A distinguishing feature of our device is its programmability, setting it apart from typical inverse-designed photonic devices, which are fixed after manufacturing. We achieve programmability optically, decoupling the electronic wiring for programming from the photonic chip; a pattern of light shone on top of our device creates a spatially varying refractive index modulation Δn(x, z) in the slab waveguide. This is achieved by using the principle of photoconductive gain27,28 to induce a refractive index modulation via the strong electro-optic effect in lithium niobate. In our study, we show how we can train the refractive index distribution so that the complex wave propagation through the device performs a desired neural network inference (Fig. 1c).

a, The fundamental unit of an artificial neural network (a layer) transforms an input vector into an output vector via a trainable matrix multiplication. b, Analogous to a neural network layer, the 2D-programmable waveguide linearly transforms an input optical field into an output optical field via wave propagation through a lithium niobate slab waveguide with 2D refractive index modulation Δn(x, z) that can be continuously and arbitrarily programmed (up to practical limits on resolution and maximum modulation; Supplementary Information sections 1C,D). This refractive index modulation, which is directly set by the illumination pattern projected onto the device (shown in green), is trained so that wave propagation through the waveguide performs machine learning tasks (handwritten-digit classification shown here as an example). To determine the result of the classification, the intensity of the output beam is measured across equally sized bins; the bin with the highest total power corresponds to the predicted label. c, Simulated wave intensity in the slab waveguide, which shows that the neural network computation is performed with complex multimode wave propagation.

Figure 1 shows a schematic of the machine learning process using the device. In machine learning, data are often encoded in vector form, \({\bf{x}}_{l}\), and processed via programmable matrices W and activation functions f in ‘layers': \({\bf{x}}_{l+1}=f(W{\bf{x}}_{l})\) (illustrated in Fig. 1a). We amplitude-encoded the machine learning input data \({\bf{x}}_{l}\) into the one-dimensional (1D) input optical field distribution, E(x, z = 0) (Fig. 1b), which serves as the initial condition for programmable wave propagation described by the following partial differential equation:

where z denotes the propagation direction, x represents the transverse direction, k0 is the wavenumber in free space and k is the wavenumber in the slab waveguide. A solution of the equation is shown in Fig. 1c. The refractive index distribution of the slab waveguide, n(x, z) = n0 + Δn(x, z), has two contributions: a spatially uniform part, n0, which is the refractive index of the waveguide when no programming light is impinging on it, and a programmable part that is induced by electro-optic modulation, Δn(x, z), loosely corresponding to the programmable matrix weights W. After the optical field has propagated through the device, we measured its intensity, Iout(x) ∝ ∣E(x, z = L)∣2, at the output facet and binned it to produce the output vector, \({\bf{x}}_{l+1}\), for the machine learning task.

Figure 2 shows how patterns of light program the refractive index modulation, Δn(x, z). First, the device converts the projected pattern of light into a spatially varying quasi-static electric field. Second, the electro-optic waveguide changes its refractive index Δn(x, z) in response to this electric field. Our device is an electro-optic waveguide coated by a photoconductive film and sandwiched between a pair of electrodes with an oscillating bias voltage applied across them. For regions of the chip that are illuminated at intensities of tens of milliwatts per square centimetre, the impedance of the photoconductor drops substantially, increasing the bias electric field within the slab waveguide. The lithium niobate waveguide locally changes its refractive index via the Pockels effect, owing to the spatially varying bias electric field. In our device, the largest refractive index modulation is approximately 10−3, limited by the geometry of the material stack and a safety margin to prevent dielectric breakdown (Supplementary Information section 1C). The refractive index modulation in our device can take on continuous values by continuously varying the intensity of the projected pattern.

a, The 2D-programmable waveguide consists of a nanophotonic stack of four layers: a conductive silicon substrate that doubles as the ground electrode, a Z-cut lithium niobate (in red) slab waveguide with silicon dioxide cladding (in white), a photoconductive layer for optical control of the refractive index and a gold electrode. b,c, Electrical circuit models of the 2D-programmable waveguide in regions with (c) and without (b) illumination. There is a voltage division between the photoconductor and the slab waveguide, with impedances, Zpc and Zwg, respectively. c, Upon illumination, the resistance of the photoconductor decreases, leading to an increase in the electric field (blue arrows) inside the waveguide, which induces a refractive index modulation via the electro-optic effect. d, A photograph of our prototype 2D-programmable waveguide in our experimental set-up. e, Experimental realization of a Y-branch splitter on the 2D-programmable waveguide, which splits the input light into two equal output beams. The projected pattern (in green) directly corresponds to the induced refractive index modulation (in grey). A simulation of the wave propagating through the device is overlaid with the patterns (in red).

We projected illumination patterns across a 9 mm × 1 mm area, achieving a pixel resolution of 9 μm × 9 μm. (Limits to the spatial resolution are discussed in Supplementary Information section 1C.) This configuration enabled us to control the refractive index distribution, n(x, z), with 10,000 degrees of freedom (see Supplementary Information section 3A for our calculation of the parameter count) and update the entire distribution at a rate of 3 Hz. To maximize the refractive index modulation, we set the amplitude of the oscillating bias voltage across the electrodes to be up to 1,000 V. Given that complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor electrode backplanes can only support spatially programmable voltages of around 10 V, our use of photoconductive gain was essential for achieving large electro-optic modulation. This approach allowed us to apply a large voltage to a single unpatterned electrode and realize controllable high voltages at virtual electrodes via the patterned illumination27,28. Owing to the large impedance of the device, less than 1 mW of electrical power was dissipated across its active area at the highest voltages.

To illustrate the operating principle of our device, we projected a pattern in the shape of a Y-branch splitter onto the 2D-programmable waveguide (Fig. 2a). The refractive index modulation was approximately proportional to the projected pattern, Δn(x, z) ∝ I(x, z) (Fig. 2e), up to spatial smoothing and a weak nonlinearity owing to voltage division. We coupled a single input Gaussian beam into the device using a beam shaper and measured the intensity of the output light with a camera, as shown in Fig. 2e. Because we used an oscillating bias voltage to drive the device, the induced refractive index pattern also oscillated in time. Therefore, measurements of the output intensity (and of the optical inputs, if not continuous wave) must coincide with the driving voltage peaking. We discuss approaches to overcome this limitation and further details on the experimental set-up in Methods.

We next applied the 2D-programmable waveguide to perform machine learning tasks: vowel classification29 and Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten-digit classification30. Both tasks are used as benchmarks in studies of similar on-chip optical neural networks, providing useful points of comparison3,6,20.

The vowel classification dataset29 comprises formant frequencies extracted from audio recordings of spoken vowels by various speakers. The task was to predict which of the seven vowels is spoken, given a 12-dimensional input vector of formant frequencies. We divided the dataset into a training set and a test set, comprising 196 (75% of the dataset) and 63 (25%) samples, respectively.

Figure 3 presents our experimental results on performing vowel classification with the 2D-programmable waveguide. As shown in Fig. 3a,b, we encoded the 12-dimensional input vectors in the amplitudes of 12 equidistant spatial Gaussian modes that were simultaneously projected onto the input facet of the device. For readout, we measured the intensity at the output facet with a camera and binned the camera pixels into seven different regions, with each region corresponding to a specific vowel. The predicted vowel for an input was given by the region that received the most optical power. Thus, as shown in the simulated intensity distribution, ∣E(x, z)∣2, in Fig. 3b, the device learned to use complex multimode wave propagation to direct most power towards the region corresponding to the correct vowel. Further details on output decoding and the overall computational model of our optical neural network demonstrations are provided in Supplementary Information section 5A.

a, Overview of the approach. The task involved predicting a spoken vowel, here ‘er', from a 12-dimensional input vector representing formant frequencies extracted from audio recordings.

The refractive index distribution to implement vowel classification was learned using physics-aware training31, a modified backpropagation algorithm (Fig. 3c). In this algorithm, the forward pass is performed by the experimental set-up, whereas the backward pass is computed with a digital model of the experiment. The hybrid in situ–in silico nature of the algorithm allows for efficient training even in the presence of both imperfect models and experimental noise (Supplementary Information section 3C). The digital model was challenging to construct because of the large number of parameters and the complexity of the wave propagation. Initially, a purely physics-based model (using equation (1)) provided qualitative but not quantitative agreement with the experimental results. The remaining discrepancies were largely removed with data-driven refinements to the physics-based model (Supplementary Information section 4).

Using physics-aware training, we trained the 2D-programmable waveguide for a total of 300 epochs, which took approximately 1 h on the experimental set-up (Fig. 3d). Figure 3e shows the evolution of the initially uniform illumination pattern into a complex pattern that resembles the refractive index distributions found in inverse-designed photonic devices. Figure 3d shows that despite the complexity of the projected pattern, the 2D-programmable waveguide successfully performed the vowel classification task and achieved a test accuracy of 96% after training.

Figure 4 presents the experimental results on MNIST handwritten-digit classification. The task consisted of classifying 14-by-14-pixel images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. We divided the MNIST dataset in the standard manner into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. We downsampled each MNIST image to 7-by-7 pixels and then flattened it to a 49-dimensional input vector.

a, We performed MNIST handwritten-digit classification with the 2D-programmable waveguide. Each image from the MNIST dataset was electronically downsampled and reshaped to a 49-dimensional vector. We trained the device to perform machine learning on this high-dimensional input vector with the same procedure as the vowel classification task (Fig. 3). b, The confusion matrix was derived from evaluations on the test dataset comprising 10,000 images. After ten epochs of training, the system achieved 86% accuracy on the test dataset. As a baseline, a single-layer digital neural network with a 49 × 10 matrix achieves 90% accuracy on this same task.

To train the refractive index distribution to perform MNIST classification, we followed the same procedure used for the vowel classification task (Fig. 3). The 2D-programmable waveguide processed the 49-dimensional input vector to produce a ten-dimensional output vector that corresponds to the ten possible digits (more details in Supplementary Information section 5C). As shown in Fig. 4b, the system achieved 86% accuracy on the test dataset after ten epochs of training, which took about 10 h on the experimental set-up. This falls 4% short of the 90% accuracy that a one-layer digital neural network achieves on this downsampled MNIST classification task, likely because of imperfect modelling and experimental drifts. Nevertheless, this result demonstrates that complex wave propagation in our device can be harnessed to perform computations comparable to that of a single-layer neural network with a 49 × 10 matrix of trainable parameters.

We turn to a discussion of the theoretical size scaling of different on-chip photonic processors. Integrated photonics can be used to implement matrices of size N × N using circuits of width much wider than ~Nλ0 (N well-isolated waveguides, where λ0 is the free-space wavelength) and length greater than ~Nλ0/Δnprog (N π-phase shifters)32,33. Because the programmable refractive index Δnprog is often very small, this limits circuits to be either very long or operate on low-dimensional inputs. In the 2D-programmable-waveguide paradigm presented in this paper, the required device width scales as ~Nλ0, imposed by the diffraction limit. One might intuitively expect that the length Lz of 2D-programmable waveguides would also need to scale as ~Nλ0/Δnprog, just as it does for the aforementioned circuit approaches for universal linear transformations on chip32. In this section, we present the analytical and numerical results showing that, beyond the constant-factor improvement in spatial footprint by avoiding single-mode waveguides, 2D-programmable waveguides may offer a different size scaling.

Our analytical argument, presented in detail in Supplementary Information section 8A,B, investigates the amount of phase shift necessary to optically implement a given unitary transformation of dimension N in a programmable multimode waveguide. As the unitary dimension increases, the phase shift per element, linked to the generator of the unitary, becomes smaller. (More precisely, for any given unitary, one can always find a generator with elements that have a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) smaller than \(\pi /\sqrt{N}\)). This suggests an exciting possibility. High-dimensional optical matrix–vector multipliers based on interference may require much less propagation distance through phase shifters than commonly assumed. This property of unitary matrices has recently34 been exploited to show that in three-MZI meshes, the average length of phase shifters can scale as \(1/\sqrt{N}\), but universal MZI meshes by construction have a circuit depth that scales as N, independent of how short the individual phase-shifter elements are. However, in 2D-programmable waveguides, this insight can potentially lead to large practical benefits because the devices effectively consist entirely of phase shifters, with nothing else constraining the total system length. The intuitive core of the mathematical argument is that if one needed a full π-phase shift per phase shifter, the required device length would scale as Nλ0/Δnprog, but because the required phase shift goes as \(\pi /\sqrt{N}\), the total required length scales as \(N{\lambda }_{0}/(\sqrt{N}\Delta {n}_{{\rm{prog}}})=\sqrt{N}{\lambda }_{0}/\Delta {n}_{{\rm{prog}}}\).

We analytically found a refractive index distribution, Δnprog(x, z), with a magnitude (or, equivalently, length) that scales only as \(\sqrt{N}\) (as measured by the r.m.s. of the distribution). Our construction is similar to the one presented by Larocque and Englund17 in that it couples the modes of a multimode waveguide but crucially differs by implementing parallel global couplings rather than a sequence of pairwise mode couplings, thereby achieving better scaling.

Our analytical argument relies on strong approximations. We used coupled-mode theory under a rotating wave approximation to calculate the propagation of unidirectional scalar waves in a perturbed multimode waveguide. To validate our theory, we present the results from numerical simulations that make far fewer assumptions. We simulated unidirectional scalar waves in a perturbed multimode waveguide (Supplementary Information section 8D). Our analytical argument only shows that the r.m.s. of the refractive index distribution scales as \(\sim \sqrt{N}\). However, in practical devices, it is usually the maximum value of the refractive index change that is limited. Our simulations show that even with a strictly imposed maximum value of the programmable refractive index strength, unitaries can be implemented accurately over a propagation distance that scales as \(\sim \sqrt{N}\). We emphasize that our analytical argument permits completely general dense unitary matrices.

This length scaling is surprising in part because fundamental geometric considerations in linear optical devices suggest that the length required to perform arbitrary operations on N modes is proportional to Nλ0 (refs. 35,36). Our theory, showing that \({L}_{z} \sim \sqrt{N}{\lambda }_{0}/\Delta {n}_{{\rm{prog}}}\) is sufficient to perform universal optical operations on N modes, implies a different length scaling but does not contradict the bound by Miller35 unless N is very large, often ≫1,000 using common values (Supplementary Information section 8D). Therefore, our result suggests that there is a large practical regime in which the better-than-linear length scaling can be exploited to create universal optical processors with modest programmability or short propagation distances.

However, we note that the length-scaling argument does not directly apply to the device used in our experiments because our scaling result assumes guided modes in the x direction, whereas our experiments were performed in a slab waveguide wide enough that light was effectively unguided. It is nonetheless the case that one could, as far as we can tell without having explicitly performed these experiments, realize devices and experiments that satisfy the assumptions of the theory (see discussion in Supplementary Information section 8D). For example, we simulated a multimode waveguide with a modest width of 0.3 mm, length of 5 mm and a refractive index programmability no larger than Δnprog = 5 × 10−3 with 500-nm resolution, and showed that such a waveguide can realize a 200 × 200-dimensional unitary with high fidelity (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Information section 8D). A device measuring 1.5 mm in width and 11 mm in length, with the same programmable refractive index magnitude and resolution, should be able to realize arbitrary unitaries with dimensions as high as 1,000 × 1,000.

a, We considered a weak refractive index profile Δnprog(x, z) embedded into a step-index multimode waveguide with profile nwg(x). As light propagated through the perturbed waveguide, its N eigenmodes interacted with each other, as described by the coupled-mode theory. These interactions generated an N × N unitary MVM. b, Vectors \(\bf{a}\) are encoded in the modal amplitudes of the input electric field. Given a unitary matrix Utarget, we analytically determined the refractive index perturbation Δnprog(x, z) embedded in the step-index waveguide (Supplementary Information section 8B) or via in silico inverse design (Supplementary Information section 8C). We verified that after propagation through the multimode waveguide, the modal amplitudes transformed according to Urealized ≈ Utarget. c, Fidelities of N × N Haar-random unitary matrices realized in waveguides of various lengths Lz with an inverse-designed \(\Delta {n}_{{\rm{prog}}}(x,z) < \Delta {n}_{\max }=5\cdot 1{0}^{-3}\). The separation between unitaries realized with high versus low fidelity is well described by the line \({L}_{z}=\sqrt{N}{\lambda }_{0}/\Delta {n}_{\max }\).

We introduced and demonstrated a 2D-programmable photonic processor comprising a lithium niobate slab waveguide with a refractive index distribution, n(x, z), that can be continuously programmed. The device design enables programming by parallel electro-optic modulation with approximately 10,000 degrees of freedom. We used our chip to perform neural network inference by training the refractive index distribution and consequently the multimode wave propagation through the chip. To train the device, we developed a physics-based model of the behaviour of the chip, along with a data-driven refinement, allowing the model to be sufficiently accurate that it supports backpropagation-based training31.

The predominant approach to building integrated photonic neural networks is to fabricate large arrays of discrete components connected by single-mode waveguides10. In contrast, we adopted the conceptual approach of using wave propagation in distributed spatial modes15,16,17,18,19,23,37 and experimentally validated the theoretical predictions16,17,37 that this approach will be more space-efficient. Our prototype chip was able to perform neural network inference with input vectors of dimension up to 49, which is larger than the capability of the neural network photonic chips reported in previous studies3,6,8,9,20,38,39,40 and more space efficient than any of these chips based on networks of discrete components (see Supplementary Information section 6 for a detailed comparison). This large input dimension enabled us to use our chip to perform MNIST handwritten-digit classification with a single pass through the chip and without using any digital electronic parameters.

One of the most promising applications of our approach is in reducing the energy cost of neural network inference, which remains (and is likely to remain) dominated by linear MVM. There exists a breakeven point beyond which optical devices could outperform electronic hardware on this metric, owing to the more favourable energy scaling with dimension N (optics: E ~ N; electronics: E ~ N2) (refs. 11,12,13,14). Reaching this regime requires high-dimensional operations. At low N, the overhead cost from analogue-to-digital conversion and optical–electronic transduction outweighs the benefits, with estimates placing the breakeven point around N = 1,000, far beyond what is currently possible on a single chip. We derived a theoretical scaling law (Supplementary Information section 8) describing how the dimension of possible MVMs in a 2D-programmable waveguide scales with the device dimensions and the refractive index change. Surprisingly, the device length only needs to scale as \(\sqrt{N}\), better than the most common approaches of designing photonic circuits32,33. This result may enable all-optical matrix–vector multipliers with a dimension exceeding the breakeven point of energy efficiency. The development of such devices would make hybrid neural network architectures, in which analogue optics performs the linear operations and electronic circuits implement the nonlinearities, energy-competitive, changing the energy scaling of neural network inference.

To conclude, we believe that our device concept, with its ability to programmably control multimode wave propagation, may create new opportunities in the broader fields of optical computing and optical information processing10,14,41. Although our study has focused on machine learning, our device could also be used to solve integral equations42 and combinatorial optimization problems43. More broadly, our chip is essentially an arbitrary (passive) photonic device that can be reconfigured on demand. Any photonic device that can be specified as an inhomogeneous refractive index distribution can be realized. Such devices can even be learned directly and effectively by performing inverse design21 but in situ in real time. Our concept will potentially enable the development of reprogrammable photonic simulators supporting new studies of bound states in the continuum44 and topological photonics45 and applications in engineering. It may ultimately even be possible to make a device that combines programmable linear wave propagation (this study), programmable nonlinear wave propagation15,18,46,47 (a natural extension of this study to having programmable χ(2)(x, z) (ref. 48)) and programmable gain/loss (demonstrated in ref. 20), giving rise to a reconfigurable on-chip platform capable of realizing almost every functionality we have in free-space optics.

As shown in Extended Data Fig. 1, we started our fabrication processes from a thin-film lithium niobate wafer purchased from NANOLN. It was a p-type silicon wafer with a substrate conductivity of 0.01–0.05 Ω cm, 2 μm of silicon dioxide deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and 700 nm of Z-cut MgO-doped lithium niobate that was wafer-bonded with the ion-cut technique. We diced small pieces from the wafer using a DISCO Dicing Saw for further processing. We deposited an additional 1 μm of silicon dioxide via PECVD as a cladding, followed by another deposition of 4 μm of silicon-rich silicon nitride, which was the photoconductive layer, via PECVD. The silicon-rich silicon nitride layer was deposited in an Oxford Plasmalab 100 by flowing 40 sccm of SiH4, 10 sccm of N2O and 1,425 sccm of N2 into the deposition chamber at a temperature of 350 °C and a pressure of 1,900 mTorr. We alternated pulses of high-frequency and low-frequency power during deposition to minimize film stress using 160-W low-frequency pulses for 12 s and 200-W high-frequency pulses for 8 s.

Next, we evaporated electrodes onto the chip using a CVC SC4500 E-gun Evaporation System. We first evaporated 10 nm of titanium as an adhesion layer and then 5 nm of gold. To prevent dielectric breakdown between the top electrode and the conductive substrate through air at the edges of the chip, we covered the perimeter of the chip with tape before evaporation. The tape acted as a mask, preventing deposition closer than around 1 mm to the edges, thereby increasing the path length between the top electrode and substrate through air. To minimize coupling losses into the waveguide, we used an Allied MultiPrep Polisher to polish the waveguide facets. We polished using silicon carbide paper of successively finer grain size, starting at 3 μm and then moving to 1 μm and 0.5 μm.

We used Z-cut lithium niobate for the slab waveguide so that the crystal axis of the lithium niobate is parallel to the strong electric field induced by the bias voltage, which points out of the waveguide plane (in the y direction). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, we used the transverse magnetic mode of the slab waveguide, with an optical electric field that is also oriented in the y direction. Because the r33 electro-optic coefficient is largest in lithium niobate, this configuration maximized the strength of the electro-optic modulation.

The thickness of the lithium niobate layer was chosen for single-mode operation (Supplementary Information section 1A). To maximize the refractive index modulation, it is beneficial to have a thicker photoconductor and a thinner silicon dioxide cladding (Supplementary Information section 1B). The silicon dioxide cladding was chosen to be sufficiently thick to ensure low propagation loss. Thus, we balanced these tradeoffs to arrive at the device geometry shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. The device has a propagation loss of <1 dB cm−1 at a wavelength of 1,550 nm (Supplementary Information section 1E).

To maximize the refractive index contrast of the slab waveguide between the bright (illuminated) and dark regions, it is important to design the photoconductor to have high dark resistance and low bright resistance. Thus, to optimize the material properties of the photoconductor, we swept the silicon-to-nitrogen ratio in the silicon-rich silicon nitride photoconductor (by varying the amount of SiH4 gas we flowed into the PECVD) and chose the material with the largest photoconductive contrast. We characterized the refractive index modulation as a function of the intensity of the projected pattern with an off-axis holography set-up (Supplementary Information section 1C). The maximum refractive index modulation that we achieved in this study was approximately 10−3. We show in Supplementary Fig. 3 that this can be increased to beyond 4 × 10−3 by using a photoconductor layer that is twice as thick (8 μm) and by further optimizing the photoconductive properties. In Supplementary Information section 7B, we also discuss how the refractive index modulation can be further increased by switching to a different material for the waveguide core.

As shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, the experimental set-up can be roughly divided into five units: (1) an optical beam shaper to create spatially varying 1D electric field inputs for the 2D-programmable waveguide; (2) a projector to create a programmable illumination pattern that controls the refractive index distribution inside the waveguide; (3) a butt-coupling set-up to couple light in and out of the 2D-programmable waveguide; (4) a high-voltage source to apply an oscillating bias voltage across the electrodes of the 2D-programmable waveguide; and (5) a camera to measure the intensity of the output beam. We note that the experimental set-up relies on more free-space optical components than usual for an integrated photonics experiment. This is a direct consequence of our decision to keep the fabrication of the device simple, without lithographically defined structures for this initial proof-of-concept demonstration. We envision that a more compact, fully integrated version of the 2D-programmable waveguide could be built by integrating on-chip lithium niobate modulators and detectors and a micro-light-emitting-diode display (Supplementary Information section 7D).

In this section, we provide an overview of the key components and functionalities of the experimental set-up. For a more detailed description, including photographs of the optical set-up and specifics on the components, such as part numbers and manufacturers, see Supplementary Information section 2.

The free-space beam shaper allows for the realization of arbitrary input optical fields E(x, z = 0) up to a spatial resolution of 2 μm and over a distance of 600 μm. In this experiment, we used the beam shaper to create both simple input fields, such as a single Gaussian beam for the Y-branch splitter demonstration, and more complex input fields for the machine learning demonstrations. This flexibility also enabled us to freely vary the encoding of input vectors into the optical field. For instance, we varied the width of the input modes and adjusted their spacing, which was tailored to each machine learning task. Finally, because the beam shaper is capable of shaping both the amplitude and phase of the input field, it was also used to calibrate the 2D-programmable waveguide (Supplementary Information section 4B).

The design of the beam shaper that we built closely follows that of a previous study49, which also programmably shapes the input light coupled into slab waveguides. The core working principle of the beam shaper is to create spatially varying phase gratings on a 2D-phase spatial light modulator50 (SLM; Meadowlark Optics UHSP1K-850-1650-PC8). We varied the amplitude and relative positions of these phase gratings to control the input optical field E(x, z = 0). A lens after the SLM performed a Fourier transform that separated the diffraction maxima of the phase gratings, and a spatial filter selected the first-order diffraction maximum. Finally, an optical relay system (comprising lenses 2 and 3, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 2) demagnified the optical field at the focal plane of the first lens and coupled the light into the 2D-programmable waveguide. Owing to the response time of the liquid crystal in SLM, the fastest update speed of the beam shaper was approximately 50 Hz.

The projector set-up was designed to create a high-resolution programmable illumination pattern over a large field of view. We used a digital micromirror device (DMD; Vialux V-7000) with a resolution of 1,024 × 768 pixels and a pixel pitch of 13.7 μm. The DMD was illuminated with green light (525 nm) from an LED. We imaged the surface of the DMD onto the surface of the 2D-programmable waveguide via a 4f set-up consisting of two tube lenses. The focal length of the tube lenses was chosen to demagnify the image of the DMD by a factor of 1.5, resulting in a projected pattern on the surface of the 2D-programmable waveguide with dimensions of 9.1 mm × 6.8 mm, with each individual pixel of the projected pattern measuring 9 μm × 9 μm. Because the complex wave propagation spans a distance of 1 mm in the x direction, in practice, we used only a 9.1 mm × 1 mm region of the projected pattern to control the wave propagation in the 2D-programmable waveguide. Finally, although the DMD provides only binary modulation, we achieved continuous refractive index modulation by applying pulse-width modulation to the illumination pattern. This is feasible because the DMD can be switched on and off at a rate of 20 kHz, much faster than the resistance–capacitance time constant of the device, which is about 10 Hz.

To maximize the electro-optic effect in lithium niobate, we used high voltages of about 1 kV. We created sinusoidal voltages with an arbitrary function generator and amplified the voltage with a Trek 2220 high-voltage amplifier, which has a voltage gain of 200× and is capable of outputting voltages of up to 2 kV. We electrically contacted the device using high-voltage-rated probe arms with BeCu probe tips; one probe tip was put in contact with the gold electrode on top of the device, whereas a grounded probe tip touched the silicon substrate (Supplementary Fig. 9).

We used an a.c. frequency of 10 Hz for the experiments shown in Fig. 2 and 26 Hz for the experiments shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Because a.c. voltage was applied, the desired refractive index distribution was realized at the peak of the sinusoidal modulation. Thus, we triggered the camera to this peak, which explains the use of a higher frequency for the machine learning demonstrations to maximize the update rate of the experiment. Finally, we opted for a.c. over d.c. operation because the resistivity of the silicon dioxide cladding exceeds the dark resistance of the photoconductor; under d.c. operation, the photoconductor would not modulate the overall impedance of the circuit. Future modifications can enable d.c. operation, such as using an alternative cladding material that is more conductive or by increasing the dark resistivity of the photoconductor (Supplementary Information section 1B).

To measure the output of the computation performed by our device, we imaged the output facet of the device with an infrared camera (Allied Vision Goldeye CL-033). We built a 4f relay with a magnification factor of 5.3, allowing us to image the intensity distribution at the output facet, Icamera(x, y), with a resolution of 2.8 μm per pixel and a field of view of 1.7 mm in the x direction. We defined a small range of y to be the region of interest and integrated the intensity over this range to obtain the 1D intensity output of the 2D-programmable waveguide: \({I}_{{\rm{out}}}(x)=| E(x,z=L){| }^{2}=\mathop{\int}\nolimits_{{y}_{\min }}^{{y}_{\max }}{I}_{{\rm{camera}}}(x,y){\rm{d}}y\). We used an exposure time on the order of 500 μs, chosen to be much shorter than the period of the a.c. voltage, which was approximately 40 ms.

Devices were fabricated from thin-film lithium niobate on insulator wafers consisting of a heavily doped p-type silicon substrate with a resistivity of 0.01 to 0.05Ω ⋅ cm, a 2 μm PECVD silicon dioxide layer, and 700 nm Z-cut MgO-doped lithium niobate bonded by ion-cutting. After dicing, we deposited 1 μm of SiO2 cladding and 4 μm of silicon-rich SiN (photoconductive layer) by PECVD with alternating plasma pulses to minimize stress. Electrodes were formed by evaporating 10 nm Ti and 5 nm Au, with tape masking to prevent breakdown at chip edges. Waveguide facets were polished using progressively finer abrasives to reduce coupling loss. The final device has facet dimensions of approximately 10 mm × 10 mm.

The setup consists of five key units: (1) a beamshaper to generate spatially varying one-dimensional optical inputs to the 2D-programmable waveguide, (2) a digital micromirror projector to impose a programmable illumination pattern controlling the refractive-index distribution, (3) butt-coupling optics to couple light in and out of the device, (4) (not shown) a high-voltage source applying oscillating fields across the electrode and conductive silicon wafer, and (5) an infrared camera to record the output intensity profile. The beamshaper provides full amplitude and phase control of input fields, while the projector enables spatial refractive-index modulation with continuous pixel-values via pulse-width modulation.

Organometallic reagents are essential in organic synthesis, with organolithium compounds being most widely used. However, as lithium becomes less abundant and increasingly expensive, organosodium compounds have emerged as promising alternatives, but their use in organic synthesis is limited by their poor solubility in organic solvents, the need for pre-activated sodium sources and the necessity for highly anhydrous conditions. Here we report a mechanochemical protocol for the direct generation of organosodium compounds from cheap and shelf-stable sodium lumps and readily available organic halides under bulk, solvent-free conditions. These reactions generate an array of organosodium compounds in minutes, without special precautions against moisture or temperature control. These nucleophiles can be used directly for one-pot nucleophilic addition reactions with electrophiles and nickel-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. Furthermore, this mechanochemical approach enables the sodiation of inert C–F bonds in organic fluorides. This method is anticipated to drive progress in sodium-based synthetic chemistry.

Organolithium compounds have played a dominant role as carbon nucleophiles, Brønsted bases and precursors for a variety of other organometallic reagents in organic synthesis for over 100 years (Fig. 1a)1,2,3,4. Their widespread use is attributed to their relatively high stability in organic solvents, coupled with well-established methods for their preparation5,6. However, from a sustainability standpoint, there is an increasing demand for alternatives to lithium, which is becoming both less abundant and more expensive7. The growing demand for lithium-ion batteries is expected to further intensify competition for lithium resources8,9,10.

Sodium, another s-block metal, is much more earth abundant than lithium (crustal abundance 22,700 ppm versus Li abundance 18 ppm)11 and is therefore an attractive candidate for replacing lithium to explore sustainable organic synthesis (Fig. 1a)12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. The first reports of organosodium chemistry emerged in the 1850s, pioneered by J. A. Wanklyn24, but substantial challenges exist that have prevented the widespread adoption of organosodium reagents within the field of organic synthesis25,26,27,28,29. First, the highly reactive nature of organosodium reagents makes them incompatible with many solvents, including ethers, which can react via C‒H and C‒O activation, and even aromatic solvents such as toluene and benzene29. Only alkane solvents (for example hexanes) can be considered genuinely inert towards organosodiums, but the poor solubility of organosodium reagents in hydrocarbon solvents often causes substantial problems, limiting the potential for widespread application. Second, while direct metallation of organic halides with metallic sodium is an attractive and straightforward synthetic method, it has severe drawbacks: (1) traditional solution-based methods involving direct metallation of organic halides with metallic sodium suffer from a severe side reaction, Wurtz coupling, where the newly formed organosodium (RNa) reacts with unreacted organohalide (RX) to form the homocoupling product R‒R and sodium halide (NaX)30; (2) reactions often require a large excess of sodium lumps or unstable, expensive pre-activated sodium sources such as sodium dispersion13,17. To avoid Wurtz coupling, the mainstream method to prepare organosodiums is Li–Na exchange, by reacting organolithium (RLi) with sodium tert-butoxide (NaOtBu) to generate RNa and LiOtBu in a hydrocarbon solvent (usually hexanes), driven by the poor solubility of RNa in these solvents (see above)31. This Li–Na exchange still requires Li, which eliminates the sustainability merit of organosodiums. The need for rigorously dry and deoxygenated organic solvents and relatively complex setups involving inert-gas atmospheres presents additional practical drawbacks.

Mechanochemical organic synthesis using ball-milling techniques has emerged as a new methodology to carry out organic synthesis under solvent-free conditions32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43. The advantages of this protocol include reduced solvent waste, fast reaction kinetics and operational simplicity under ambient conditions. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that vigorous mechanical agitation can activate zero-valent metals by removing the unreactive surface oxide layer and increasing the reactive surface area44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53. These mechanochemically activated, zero-valent metals readily undergo metal–surface reactions with organic halides to produce the corresponding organometallic species efficiently51. Surprisingly, by utilizing this strategy, organometallic compounds previously thought to be synthesizable only in solution have been successfully prepared under mechanochemical conditions, including Grignard reagents54,55,56,57, organozinc58,59,60, organocalcium61,62,63, organomanganese64,65, organobarium66 and organolithium reagents67. However, the direct mechanochemical synthesis of organosodium compounds has yet to be explored. Recently, mechanochemical activation of sodium lumps has been utilized for highly efficient ammonia-free Birch reduction and the preparation of a sodium anion complex (Fig. 1b)68,69. Building on these successful results, we envisioned that a mechanochemical protocol could offer a practical and efficient solution to address the challenges associated with conventional solution-based methods for the preparation and application of organosodium compounds in synthetic chemistry.

In this Article, we report a mechanochemical generation of organosodium compounds from various organic halides and commercially available, cheap and stable sodium lumps and their application to organic synthesis (Fig. 1c). This protocol can be performed under ambient conditions without the need for pre-activated sodium metal, large amounts of anhydrous organic solvents or complex synthetic procedures that require precautions against moisture and strict temperature control. Furthermore, these rapid reactions complete within minutes. This is likely to be due to the mechanical activation of sodium metal in situ. The resulting organosodium species readily react with a wide range of electrophiles in a one-pot mechanochemical process. Nickel-catalysed direct cross-coupling of organosodium compounds with aryl halides also proceeded under mechanochemical conditions. Additionally, this mechanochemical strategy was applicable to the direct sodiation of poorly soluble aromatic halides as well as organic fluorides, which are unreactive towards sodiation under conventional solution-based conditions. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis and NMR spectroscopy studies were successfully performed to confirm the identity of the key mechanochemically generated organosodium intermediates. Overall, the present study provides a synthetic platform centred on organosodium compounds, which has the potential to replace conventional organolithium-based synthesis with a more sustainable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach.

We initially attempted the generation of organosodium species through the reaction of bromobenzene (1a) with sodium lumps using a Retsch MM400 mixer mill (5 ml stainless-steel milling jar with one stainless-steel ball; ball diameter: 10 mm). The mineral oil on the sodium lumps was removed by wiping them with a paper towel, before the lumps were cut into pieces approximately 4–5 mm in width and depth. Subsequently, the sodium-metal pieces were weighed and introduced into the jar, followed by addition of 1a under atmospheric conditions. After optimization (see Supplementary Table 1 for details), we established the following mechanochemical protocol for generating organosodium compounds (Fig. 2): ball milling of 1a (2.0 equiv.) and sodium lumps (4.4 equiv.) in the presence of n-hexane (4.4 equiv.) as a liquid additive for efficient grinding was conducted for 5 min. The jar was opened in air and N-benzylideneaniline 2a (1.0 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. The jar was then quickly closed (without any inert gas purging) and a second phase of ball milling was conducted for 5 min, yielding the desired amine 3a in excellent yield (87%). The scope of the aromatic halides and electrophiles using this one-pot, two-step mechanochemical protocol is shown in Fig. 2. Phenylsodium could also be generated from chlorobenzene, and subsequent reaction with 2a produced 3a in 85% yield. Organosodium species were prepared from various alkylated aryl halides (1b–1f) and reacted with 2a smoothly to produce the corresponding amines (3b–3f) in moderate to excellent yields (50–91%). Biphenyl bromides (1g and 1h) were also readily metallated, and subsequent reaction with 2a afforded 3g and 3h in 53 and 61% yields, respectively. Aryl halides bearing trimethylsilyl, dimethylamino and methoxy groups were compatible with this reaction, and the corresponding amines (3i–3k) were obtained in moderate to high yields (34–73%). We tested the generation of organosodium compounds from sterically hindered aryl bromides such as mesityl bromide (1l) and 2-bromo-1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (1m). Mesityl sodium was efficiently generated, and subsequent nucleophilic addition to 2a proceeded to give 3l in 90% yield. A more sterically hindered aryl halide 1m also underwent direct sodiation under mechanochemical conditions to afford the desired product 3m in 45% yield. N-(4-Methoxybenzylidene)aniline (2b) also reacted with the mechanochemically generated aryl sodium compound, 4-tolyl sodium, to give 3n in 66% yield.

Conditions: 1 (2.0 mmol), Na (4.4 mmol), n-hexane (4.4 mmol) and electrophile (1.0 mmol) in a stainless-steel ball-milling jar (5 ml) with a stainless-steel ball (10 mm). Ball milling (30 Hz) was carried out. Isolated yields are reported as percentages. a15 min for first step. b15 min for first step and 30 min for second step. c1 (3.0 mmol), Na (6.0 mmol) and n-hexane (6.0 mmol). dFirst step: 1 (1.0 mmol), Na (2.2 mmol) and n-hexane (2.2 mmol) for 5 min. Second step: dry ice (excess) for 30 min. eFirst step: 1 (2.5 mmol), Na (5.0 mmol) and n-hexane (5.0 mmol) for 5 min. Second step: Ar–Cl (1.0 mmol), NiCl2(dppe) (0.10 mmol). iPr, isopropyl; tBu, tert-butyl; TMS, trimethylsilyl; pin, pinacol.

In addition to imines as trapping reagents, aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes also smoothly reacted with mechanochemically generated organosodium compounds to afford the corresponding alcohols (3o–3s) in moderate to excellent yields (56–81%). Methyl benzoate could also be used as an electrophile and the desired tertiary alcohol 3t was obtained in 97% yield. Nucleophilic additions to aromatic ketones also proceeded rapidly, providing the corresponding alcohols (3u–3x) in moderate to excellent yields (42–80%). Additionally, various aromatic ketones (3y–3aa) were successfully prepared by reactions between organosodium compounds and Weinreb amides in good to excellent yields (65–85%). Morpholine amides were also reactive with the organosodium compounds, and the desired ketone 3ab and aldehyde 3ac were obtained in 53 and 67% yields, respectively. Reactions of dimethylphenyl silane (HSiMe2Ph) with the organosodium compounds bearing biphenyl and fluorene moieties provided the corresponding silylated products 3ad and 3ae in 92 and 89% yields, respectively. Mechanochemically generated phenylsodium could be trapped by dry ice, and benzoic acid 3af was obtained in 83% yield. The feasibility of mechanochemical nickel-catalysed cross-coupling reaction with organosodium compounds was also investigated70. Following catalyst optimization (see Supplementary Table 2 for details), we found that NiCl2(dppe) (dppe, 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) was an ideal catalyst for this reaction, and the cross-coupling between phenylsodium and 2-chlorolonapthalene gave the corresponding coupled product 3ag in 43% yield. In our substrate scope studies, side products such as homocoupled products of organic halides were not detected.

Unfortunately, unlike aryl halides, alkyl halides proved difficult to use in one-pot, two-step reactions, and the desired products were not obtained. This was probably due to rapid decomposition of the reactive alkyl sodium intermediates formed during the metallation step. To address this limitation, we explored one-pot, one-step transformations in which the electrophile was introduced at the start of the reaction, enabling trapping of the reactive organosodium intermediate as soon as it was formed (Fig. 3). Pleasingly, we found that employing this Barbier-type approach, a reaction between 1-chlorohexane, sodium lumps and imine 2a proceeded smoothly to provide the corresponding amine 3ah in 95% yield. Shorter and branched primary alkyl chlorides could also be used for this reaction, and the desired products 3ai and 3aj were obtained in 87 and 90% yields, respectively. Reactions using secondary and tertiary alkyl chlorides produced the corresponding amines 3ak and 3al in 63 and 18% yields, respectively. Fortunately, morpholine amides were also compatible under these strongly reducing conditions, enabling nucleophilic acyl substitution with n-butyl sodium to deliver the corresponding ketones (3am–3ap) in 42–66% yield. Nucleophilic addition to cyclopropyl phenyl ketone also readily proceeded and alcohol 3aq was obtained in 70% yield. Aldehyde electrophiles were also compatible, enabling access to secondary alcohol products (3ar–3at) in moderate to good yields (55–60%). Additionally, mechanochemical borylation of in situ-generated primary alkyl sodium species provided the corresponding boronic esters 3au and 3av in yields of 75 and 62%, respectively (in the latter case, 5% of Wurtz-type homocoupled product was detected as a minor side product).

Conditions: 1 (2.0 mmol), Na (4.4 mmol), n-hexane (4.4 mmol) and electrophile (1.0 mmol) in a stainless-steel ball-milling jar (5 ml) with a stainless-steel ball (10 mm). Ball milling (30 Hz) was carried out. Isolated yields are reported as percentages. aAddition of n-hexane (4.4 mmol). b1 (1.0 mmol), Na (2.2–4.0 equiv.) and iPrO–B(pin) (2.0 mmol). iPr, isopropyl; tBu, tert-butyl; pin, pinacol.

We also applied this operationally simple one-pot, one-step protocol to reactions using aryl sodium compounds (Fig. 3). Under our optimized conditions, both 4-chlorotoluene and 4-tert-butylbromobenzene reacted with morpholine amides to furnish the corresponding ketones 3ab and 3aw in 76 and 74% yields, respectively. Nucleophilic additions of aryl sodium compounds to aldimine 2a and 4-tert-butylbenzaldehyde were also investigated, and the desired products 3b and 3o were successfully obtained in 77 and 40% yields, respectively. One-pot, one-step borylations were applied to 4-bromotoluene and 4-bromoanisole to deliver boronic esters 3ax and 3ay in 64 and 56% yields, respectively. These results are comparable to the corresponding one-pot, two-step reactions (Fig. 2).

To underline the practical utility of our developed mechanochemical protocol, we investigated its use in preparative-scale reactions (Fig. 4). 4-Tolyl sodium was successfully prepared on a 12-mmol scale under mechanochemical conditions, and its nucleophilic addition to aldimine 2a gave 3b without any decrease in efficiency (96%, 1.582 g) compared to small-scale synthesis. Likewise, a one-pot, one-step reaction between 1-chlorobutane and 4-benzoylmorpholine was also carried out on a gram scale to furnish 3am in 69% yield. These results underscore the practical utility of this protocol.

Isolated yields are reported as percentages. See Supplementary Section 4 for full details.

To further expand the range of synthetically accessible organosodium compounds, we explored C–H sodiation of heteroaromatic arenes using a mechanochemically generated sodium amide (Fig. 5)71. We were delighted to find that sodium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (NaTMP) could be generated by the reaction between phenylsodium and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMPH), and employed to deprotonate benzothiophene. Subsequent addition to aldimine 2a proceeded smoothly to afford 3az in 97% yield. Benzofuran and 1-methylindole were also deprotonated by mechanochemically generated NaTMP and the resulting organosodium compounds reacted with aldimine 2a to produce 3ba and 3bb in good yields. Aldehyde and Weinreb amide electrophiles could also be employed as electrophiles, delivering the corresponding alcohol (3bc) and ketone (3bd) products in yields of 93 and 85%, respectively.

Isolated yields are reported as percentages. Conditions: 1a (1.0 mmol), Na (2.2 mmol), n-hexane (2.2 mmol), TMPH (1.0 mmol), 1 (1.0 mmol) and electrophile (0.5 mmol) in a stainless-steel ball-milling jar (5 ml) with a stainless-steel ball (10 mm). Ball milling (30 Hz) was carried out. See Supplementary Section 3F for full details.

To highlight the synthetic utility of our developed mechanochemical protocol, we applied it to synthesize the drug molecule orphenadrine, an anticholinergic agent used to treat painful muscle spasms (Fig. 6). After minor optimization, the generation of phenylsodium, followed by nucleophilic addition to 2-methylbenzaldehyde under mechanochemical conditions, afforded the intermediate 3q in 86% yield. Subsequent alkylation and reduction with LiAlH4 yielded orphenadrine in 85% yield over two steps.

Isolated yields are reported as percentages. TMPH, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine; THF, tetrahydrofuran; r.t., room temperature. See Supplementary Section 6 for full details.

Due to the high basicity of organosodium species, the scope of available solvents is limited to simple hydrocarbon solvents. Therefore, aryl halides containing a large π-conjugated system, which are often sparingly soluble in such solvents, are difficult to directly sodiate under conventional solution-based conditions. For example, 1-bromo-3,5-diphenylbenzene (1be) is poorly soluble in n-hexane, and an attempted solution-state sodiation followed by addition to cyclopropyl phenyl ketone did not afford the desired product 3be (Fig. 7a). By contrast, we were delighted to find that our mechanochemical protocol was successfully able to deliver alcohol 3be in excellent yield (89%), highlighting the potential of this approach to access organosodium compounds that cannot be accessed via conventional solution-based reactions.

Isolated yields are reported as percentages. Integrated 1H NMR spectroscopy yields are shown in parentheses. TMS, trimethylsilyl. See Supplementary Section 5 for details.

In a similar vein, we also explored the generation of organosodium species from organic fluorides via inert C–F bond cleavage (Fig. 7b)72. Direct metallation of organofluorine compounds is challenging because it involves breaking a strong C–F bond, and reports on the direct sodiation of fluoroarenes with unactivated sodium lumps are lacking73. Indeed, an attempted solution-phase (n-hexane) sodiation of fluorobenzene followed by addition of aldimine (2a) resulted in no product formation. On the other hand, we discovered that phenylsodium was rapidly generated from fluorobenzene in 5 min under mechanochemical conditions, and subsequent nucleophilic addition to aldimine 2a furnished 3a in 96% yield. We found that other sodium-meditated transformations via C–F bond activation were feasible under mechanochemical conditions (Fig. 7c). For example, sodiation of 4-fluorobiphenyl also proceeded smoothly, and nucleophilic addition to phenyl ethyl ketone produced 3u in 59% yield. Likewise, fluoroarenes bearing trimethylsilyl (TMS) and methyl groups could also be successfully sodiated, and nucleophilic substitutions with Weinreb amides afforded the corresponding ketones 3bf and 3bg in 76 and 53% yields, respectively. A Barbier-type reaction between [1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl(morpholino)methanone and 1-fluoropentane afforded 3bh in 35% yield. 4-Tolyl sodium could be generated from 4-fluorotoluene and reacted with HSiMe2Ph to give the silylation product 3bi in 70% yield.

Finally, to offer unambiguous evidence for the mechanochemical generation of the Na‒C bond during our reactions, we attempted to isolate and characterize a mechanochemically generated organosodium compound. For these structural studies, we selected a model aromatic organosodium bearing a lipophilic tert-butyl substituent, which we hoped would ensure sufficient hydrocarbon solubility to enable crystallization. Given that organosodium compounds are well known to form poorly soluble aggregates74 that could hamper their study by SCXRD, we also introduced a neutral amine ligand, namely N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ,Nʹ-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDTA), to break up these aggregates and form a soluble compound, allowing for crystallization.

Accordingly, under an argon atmosphere, 3-chloro-tert-butylbenzene and 2.2 equiv. of Na metal were ball milled with 2.2 equiv. of n-hexane according to our standard optimized conditions (Fig. 8). The crude product was treated with 0.6 equiv. of PMDTA solution in n-hexane followed by filtration to remove NaCl. Concentration followed by crystallization from n-hexane solution at −35 °C afforded a dimeric PMDTA-coordinated organosodium compound [Na(μC-3-tBu-C6H4)(κ3-N,Nʹ,Nʹ-PMDTA)]2 (4) (28% yield based on 1-(tert-butyl)-3-chlorobenzene). The single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure of 4 is shown in Fig. 8b, featuring two bridging phenyl groups, with Na‒C bond lengths within the range 2.61–2.65 Å. Solution state characterization of 4 was also performed by 1H, 13C and 23Na NMR spectroscopy in d12-cyclohexane. The 23Na NMR spectrum of 4 features a broad signal at –14.90 ppm (line width at half height LW1/2 approximately 10 ppm), which matches reported Na+ cation signals69. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 clearly exhibits a characteristic pattern of four protons consistent with a 1,3-disubstituted phenyl group, and the PMDTA remains coordinated (Fig. 8c). The 13C NMR spectrum (d12-cyclohexane) of 4 features a Na‒Csp2 quaternary carbon signal at 195.1 ppm similar to other PMDTA-ligated aryl sodium complexes described in the literature75. The NMR spectra indicate that the SCXRD structure of 4 persists in solution in cyclohexane—this is particularly important in organo-alkali metal chemistry, where fast equilibria are often prevalent, such as ligand coordination–dissociation and deprotonation–reprotonation. The isolation and characterization of 4 unambiguously supports the formation of a Na‒C bond during the mechanochemical sodiation reactions in our methodology.

Organosodium compounds have garnered substantial attention as promising, sustainable alternatives to organolithium reagents. However, their practical and widespread application in organic synthesis has been hindered by the lack of efficient generation methods using easy-to-handle sodium sources and their limited solubility in organic solvents. This study demonstrates that a mechanochemical protocol can overcome these challenges, enabling rapid synthesis of a wide range of organosodium compounds, including aryl, primary, secondary alkyl and benzylic examples from inexpensive, abundant sodium lumps and organic halides within minutes, without the need for large volumes of solvents or complex inert-gas techniques. The resulting mechanochemically generated organosodium compounds react smoothly with various electrophiles in a one-pot manner (either stepwise or Barbier-type conditions), negating any requirement to isolate the organosodium intermediates. The operational simplicity of the procedure, in particular the ability to proceed without exclusion of air is especially noteworthy, substantially lowering the barrier for synthetic chemists to make and apply these reagents. Notably, this method facilitated the direct sodiation of poorly soluble halides, which are typically unreactive to sodiation under solution-based conditions. Furthermore, the study revealed that the sodiation of organofluorides, which are generally inert in solution, could be achieved via C–F bond cleavage under mechanochemical conditions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of this mechanochemical approach in expanding the accessible scope of organosodium chemistry. Finally, the isolation and characterization of mechanochemically generated organosodium compounds by single-crystal X-ray analysis and NMR spectroscopy was performed, providing unambiguous support for the key organosodium species proposed in this methodology. Given the increasing demand for organosodium compounds, this efficient and straightforward mechanical strategy is expected to advance the development of sodium-based synthetic chemistry, contributing to more sustainable syntheses of value-added molecules.

Sodium lumps (4.4 equiv.) were cut into small pieces (approximately 4–5 mm in width and depth) and weighed in air after wiping off the mineral oil on them with paper. These were then added into a milling jar (5 ml) with a ball (10 mm diameter). An organic halide (2.0 equiv.) and n-hexane (4.4 equiv.) were added to the jar. After the jar was closed without purging with inert gas, it was placed in the ball mill (Retsch MM400, 30 Hz). After grinding for 5 min, the jar was opened in air and charged with an electrophile (1.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) as quickly as possible. The jar was then closed without purging with inert gas, and was placed in the ball mill (Retsch MM400, 30 Hz). After grinding for 5 min, the reaction mixture was quenched with a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl and extracted with EtOAc (30 ml × 3). The solution was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by flash chromatography (SiO2, typically EtOAc/n-hexane, typically 0–10:90) to give the corresponding product.

A team of physicians specializing in genetics and neurology discovered that mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are closely linked to mutations in the GRIN2A gene. The scientists mantain that identifying this genetic risk factor opens up the possibility of designing preventive therapies in the future.

The GRIN2A gene regulates communication between neurons by producing the GluN2A protein. When functioning optimally, it promotes the transmission of electrical signals between nerve cells and facilitates essential processes such as learning, memory, language, and brain development.

In their article, published in Molecular Psychiatry, the researchers demonstrated that the gene mutation reduces the activity of the NMDA electrical receptor, which aids in neuronal communication, thereby increasing the risk of developing mental disorders.

Of the 121 individuals studied, 85 had a GRIN2A variant and 23 of them developed a mental illness. These results show that carriers of the mutation have a significantly higher risk than those without variations. Furthermore, the patients exhibited strictly psychiatric symptoms, which largely rules out environmental or contextual explanations.

The finding contradicts the general consensus on the polygenic origin of mental disorders. Until now, clinicians have considered that these diseases arise from the interaction of multiple factors, including genetic ones. This study demonstrates for the first time that a mutation in a single gene can decisively influence the development of a mental disorder.

The report also cites previous research that treated NMDA receptor deficiency, caused by the GRIN2A mutation, with L-serine, an amino acid. The four schizophrenia patients who participated in the trial showed remarkable improvements: disappearance of hallucinations, remission of paranoia symptoms, and improved behavior after receiving the treatment.

As this trial was conducted prior to the main study, the authors clarify that it cannot yet be considered a definitive therapeutic method. However, they point out that the efficacy of L-serine can be confirmed in a randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial.

Schizophrenia is a mental illness that manifests itself with delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and language, behavioral changes, and loss of motivation or pleasure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this disorder affects some 23 million people worldwide, equivalent to 0.29 percent of the global population. In adults, the rate rises to 0.43 percent, meaning that 1 in every 233 people develops it.

Specialists now have a good understanding of its symptoms and have identified the age ranges in which it typically appears. Effective therapies exist, and several risk factors are recognized, including genetics, neurochemistry, and external elements such as stress or drug use.

Even so, science has not identified a single cause or fully explained the variability among those at risk. Some people develop the illness and others do not, even if both parents have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. There is also no clear strategy for preventing its onset.

The air is getting thin up here. Nvidia recently shattered records by reaching a staggering $5 trillion valuation. It is a number that defies gravity, logic, and, historically speaking, sustainability.

But if you look closely at the pillars holding up this massive financial edifice, you'll see they aren't made of superior silicon or magical AI dust. They are built on a foundation of software lock-in known as CUDA. Thanks to a small, virtually unknown company named Spectral Compute, that foundation is about to turn into sand.

We are standing on the precipice of a massive correction in the AI market, one that will likely see Nvidia's valuation stripped down to reality. The catalyst isn't a better chip from AMD or Intel; it is a piece of code that makes the hardware irrelevant.

Let's talk about how Spectral could bring down Nvidia's house of cards. Then, I'll close with my Product of the Week: HP's OmniBook 5 Laptop 16″ AI PC.

How did Nvidia get to five trillion dollars? It wasn't just by selling GPUs. If this were purely a hardware race, AMD and Intel would have eroded the margins years ago. Nvidia reached this height by creating a walled garden so high and so thick that developers felt they had no choice but to stay inside. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is that wall.



For over a decade, Nvidia has aggressively pushed CUDA as the only viable language for accelerated computing. Nvidia gave it away to universities, hooked researchers early, and ensured that the entire AI software stack — from PyTorch to TensorFlow — ran natively and best on Nvidia green. The result was a classic monopoly strategy: lock the customer in so tightly that the cost of leaving is higher than the cost of staying, no matter how abusive the pricing becomes.

Investors looked at this moat and saw infinite returns. They didn't value Nvidia as a hardware company; they valued it as the owner of the AI standard. However, monopolies built on coercion rather than preference are notoriously fragile.

The cracks in the armor are already visible, and they are coming from the very top of the food chain. Microsoft, arguably Nvidia's most important customer, has effectively sounded the alarm.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been increasingly vocal about the logistical nightmares associated with Nvidia's latest hardware. While diplomatically phrased, his recent comments about having “chips sitting in inventory that I can't plug in” highlight a critical failure in Nvidia's roadmap. The Blackwell architecture, touted as the next leap forward, has been plagued by overheating issues and massive power requirements that existing data center infrastructure simply cannot support.

When your biggest customer tells you that your product is effectively unusable in the current environment, a listening company pivots. A company drunk on its own lock-in power, however, tends to double down. Microsoft has reportedly cut orders for Blackwell racks, signaling that the pain of staying with Nvidia is finally starting to outweigh the fear of leaving.

While the giants fight over power grids and heat dissipation, a small British startup, Spectral Compute, has quietly forged the key to the CUDA prison.



Almost no one has heard of Spectral. It doesn't have flashy keynotes or leather-jacketed CEOs. What it has is a technology called Scale, a “C to silicon” compiler that allows CUDA applications to run natively on AMD hardware — and eventually on other hardware — without porting, without performance loss, and without the headaches that have plagued previous conversion attempts.

This isn't vaporware. Spectral's technology is working today. For the first time, a company can run a massive library of legacy CUDA code on AMD's MI300 or upcoming MI400 chips by simply recompiling.

This changes the math entirely. If CUDA code can run on any hardware, Nvidia's “moat” evaporates. The hardware becomes a commodity again, and commodities do not trade at 40x revenue.

Spectral isn't the only one swinging a sledgehammer at the wall, though it may have the sharpest tip. There is a quiet army of major and minor players working on breaking CUDA's grip.

Microsoft has been developing toolkits to convert CUDA to ROCm, aiming to leverage its massive investment in AMD silicon. AMD has its HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) and HIPIFY tools. There are open-source projects, like the recently resurrected Zluda, attempting similar feats.

The difference with Spectral is the seamlessness. If it succeeds in making the transition invisible, the floodgates will open. CIOs, currently sweating over Nvidia's extortionate pricing and delivery delays, will look at AMD's comparable performance at half the price and realize they finally have a choice.

I have seen this movie before. In fact, I had a front-row seat.

Working at IBM in the 1980s, I saw the same hubris that currently permeates Nvidia. IBM's leadership genuinely believed that the customer's opinion didn't matter. We weren't just selling mainframes; we were, as one executive famously put it, “selling air.” The implication was that our customers needed us to breathe. They were locked into our architecture, our software, and our service contracts. We believed they had nowhere to go.

This arrogance creates a culture of deafness. When you believe your customers are captives, you stop listening to their complaints about price, complexity, or power consumption. You stop treating them as partners and start treating them as resources to be mined.

At IBM, this strategy laid the groundwork for the company's near-collapse in the early 1990s. The moment the market offered a viable alternative (client-server computing), the exodus was violent and rapid. Customers didn't just leave; they fled with a vengeance, angry at years of being taken for granted. Nvidia is currently generating that same level of resentment among the hyperscalers and enterprises that feed it.

So, what happens when the correction hits?

If Spectral's technology gains traction — and I believe it is a matter of when, not if — Nvidia's stock won't just dip; it will crater. A valuation of $5 trillion implies total domination for decades. The realization that it is just another hardware vendor in a competitive market could easily wipe 50% to 70% off Nvidia's market cap overnight.

This will send shockwaves through the tech sector. The AI bubble, inflated largely by Nvidia's multiplier effect, will burst. Companies that leveraged themselves to buy H100s and Blackwells will see their asset values plummet.

But the most immediate human toll will be inside Nvidia itself.

Right now, thousands of Nvidia employees are paper millionaires or billionaires. They are “resting and vesting,” meaning they are waiting for their stock options to mature. A massive correction turns those options from lottery tickets into confetti.

When a workforce that expects to retire at 35 suddenly realizes they have to work for another 20 years, morale doesn't just drop; it disintegrates. The talent drain that follows will further accelerate the company's decline, creating a death spiral that is incredibly difficult to pull out of.

We are in the calm before the storm. The technology to break Nvidia's monopoly exists. The customer resentment required to drive adoption is at an all-time high. The specific technical failures of the Blackwell generation have provided the opening.

I expect Spectral's power to pivot this market will become widely known within the next two quarters. Once a major player — likely Microsoft or Meta — publicly announces they are shifting a significant portion of their production workload to AMD using Spectral's Scale, the illusion of Nvidia's invincibility will shatter.

The market correction will be brutal, but it is necessary. It will return competition to the chip industry, lower AI development costs, and serve as a harsh history lesson that, in technology, no wall is high enough to keep the future out forever.

Often, the “doorbuster” specials are older models, refurbished units, or devices so underpowered they struggle to run a web browser and a spreadsheet simultaneously. However, every once in a while, a deal surfaces that forces you to double-check the price tag. This season's standout is the HP OmniBook 5 Laptop 16” AI PC.



For the holiday shopping season, HP has aggressively positioned the OmniBook 5 to capture the mainstream market, offering configurations that are arguably the best consumer values in the laptop space right now.

Historically, the laptop market has been segmented by size and price. If you wanted a budget laptop (under $500), you were generally relegated to 13” or 14” screens. If you wanted a 16” or 17” display — often preferred for the “desktop replacement” experience — you had to pay a premium for the extra glass and chassis materials.

The OmniBook 5 disrupts this pricing structure.

A 16” screen is incredibly useful for a variety of reasons. It offers enough real estate to have two full-sized windows open side by side, which is essential for productivity. For entertainment, it provides a far more immersive streaming experience than smaller notebooks. Furthermore, for users with aging eyes, the larger screen allows for increased font scaling without losing too much context on the page. Getting this form factor at these price points is highly unusual.

HP offered three distinct tiers of discounts during Black Friday and Cyber Week, when I wrote this column, making this machine accessible to almost anyone.

The star of the lineup is the AI-enabled configuration. It features the Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 255U processor, which includes 12 cores and 14 threads, capable of speeds up to 5.2 GHz. This isn't a budget chip; it's a high-performance engine designed for heavy multitasking.

Getting a Core Ultra 7 machine with a 2K touch display for just over $600 is a standout bargain.

Where things get truly disruptive is with the customizable SKUs.

To find a brand-new 16″ laptop from a tier-one manufacturer like HP for under $380 is exceptionally rare. That price point is usually reserved for Chromebooks or low-end Celeron-based Windows machines, not devices equipped with Core i5 processors.

Because of the pricing spread, the OmniBook 5 fits several demographics perfectly:

Beyond the specs, HP continues its push for sustainability. The OmniBook 5 is constructed using recycled metals and post-consumer recycled plastics. It features a modern design with a micro-edge display and includes the dedicated Copilot key, offering instant access to Microsoft's AI assistant — a feature that is becoming standard on premium devices but is a welcome addition at this price tier.

We are accustomed to paying a “screen tax” for larger laptops, but HP has effectively eliminated that barrier this season. Whether you opt for the high-performance AI model or the incredibly affordable entry-level SKU, you get a premium chassis and a massive display for a fraction of the expected cost. Because it brings the productivity benefits of a 16” display to a price point accessible to almost everyone, the HP OmniBook 5 16” Laptop is my Product of the Week.

Scowtt, a Seattle-based startup that wants to reshape how advertisers optimize paid campaigns, raised $12 million in Series A funding round led by New York venture firm Inspired Capital. 

Founded in 2024, Scowtt helps companies analyze their first-party CRM data to predict who is most likely to convert and how valuable they'll be. Then it sends those predictions to ad platforms as enhanced signals to help boost return on ad spend and conversions without requiring marketers to change their existing tools, the company said.

Founder and CEO Eduardo Indacochea told GeekWire that the 10-person startup has $3.2 million in annual recurring revenue.

Scowtt also uses AI to interact with prospects and schedule calls. The company's longer-term ambition is to grow beyond ad optimization into a broader, AI-driven “operating system for growth” that connects marketing and sales using the intelligence already embedded in a customer's CRM.

Scowtt is targeting enterprise advertisers that rely on lead generation and other performance-driven models across search and social.

The company's timing reflects two trends: the industry's accelerating push toward first-party data as privacy rules tighten, and the rise of AI as the new performance lever in paid media. U.S. internet ad revenue grew nearly 15% in 2024 to $258.6 billion, and more growth is expected in 2025.

Indacochea spent more than 13 years at Microsoft before leadership stints at Google and most recently Meta, where he was a vice president in advertising.

Abhishek Priya, Scowtt's head of engineering, was director of engineering at Everlaw and is a former engineering manager at Meta. Eric Schwartz, chief revenue officer, was an exec at Scibids Technology and MiQ.

Scowtt was previously featured in GeekWire's Startup Radar spotlight.

LiveRamp Ventures, Angeles Investors, and Angeles Ventures also invested in the Series A round. Total funding to date is $13 million, including a $1 million pre-seed round last year.

by Taylor Soper on Dec 8, 2025 at 7:30 amDecember 8, 2025 at 10:25 am

Pallavi Wahi‘s latest career move is both a professional leap and a personal bookend.

Wahi, a veteran lawyer and business community leader, came to Seattle 25 years ago as an immigrant with no local network. She built a career and civic presence, and is now helping bring a nationally prominent firm deeper into the city's legal and innovation ecosystem.

Wahi recently joined Arnold & Porter to launch its Seattle office and lead strategic growth on the West Coast, following a long tenure at K&L Gates, where she was a managing partner.

Arnold & Porter signed a lease in downtown's U.S. Bank Center and wants to add at least 60 lawyers in Seattle within two years. Planting a flag in the Pacific Northwest is squarely aimed at the region's innovation economy — and the rising regulatory complexity around it.

“Arnold and Porter has a very deep regulatory bench, and that is really what makes them so much of a differentiator in the market,” Wahi said. The firm's specialties span healthcare, technology, manufacturing, cross-border trade, FDA and antitrust work — areas where she said corporate clients increasingly need strategic and practical guidance as rules evolve.

The view on AI

Arnold & Porter says it's using generative AI for document review, legal research, collaboration, litigation prep, transactional diligence, and regulatory review. The firm uses tools such as Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic Claude Enterprise, and ChatGPT Enterprise alongside in-house models. 

Wahi described the firm as “very open to accepting and moving forward with new technology,” including pilots that use AI tools to support client work. 

But she also draws a clear boundary for the legal profession: while AI can help lawyers, it can't replace them.

“We have to be careful that it doesn't substitute for actual legal work,” Wahi said. “You should not be filing briefs or doing anything which is generated by AI. You are the author — and the minute you forget that … is when trouble comes.”

Bullish on Seattle

The city, Wahi said, has become more welcoming, entrepreneurial and dynamic over the past quarter-century, and remains “an incredible incubator of change.” 

“There's an energy here,” Wahi said. “There's a fabric of electricity.”

She added: “This city makes you bigger than you are. I truly believe that the reason for the success of many in this city is because of Seattle.”

Wahi has spent much of her legal career arguing cases and advising companies. Her other job has been to push Seattle's business community to look beyond its own walls. She has done so by example, plugging into the boards of the Seattle Chamber, the Federal Reserve Bank, the Woodland Park Zoo, Seattle Rep, the King County Bar Foundation and more. She even participated in a dance competition to raise money for Plymouth Housing.

Her message to other leaders in Seattle is straightforward: participation matters.

“As a lawyer, I do believe I have a role to be a community leader, to really try and show up in ways that can help,” she said. “We need to show up for more than doing our jobs. We need to show up for each other in ways that make sense to ourselves.”



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Founder Institute, the global business incubator and pre-seed startup accelerator, is getting up and running again in Seattle.

Tech veteran Aniket Naravanekar, co-founder and CEO of Skillsheet, is one of the program directors working to rekindle the effort. Naravanekar previously led product at Seattle startups avante and CHEQ, and spent more than 11 years at Microsoft.

He's joined by Nicole Doyle, founder and CEO of Aspir; Jewel Atuel, a technical program manager at Averro; and Angie Parker, executive director of the Alliance of Angels.

“I think the Seattle ecosystem has such a large amount of talent that it deserves more opportunities for aspiring founders to turn their ideas into a real business,” Naravanekar told GeekWire. “I've been going through this process as a founder myself and I want to provide more options to those that are still on the fence or want to build but not sure how.”

Founded in Palo Alto, Calif., in 2009, Founder Institute operates across across six continents and more than 200 cities, and has had more than 8,100 graduates, according to its website.

Naravanekar believes a lack of community and leadership derailed Founder Institute's in-person efforts in Seattle and applicants were directed to remote/virtual cohorts starting around 2021.

“We're now bringing back the local community — local mentors, local partners, sponsors, investors and in-person meetups and events,” he said.

Naravanekar said Founder Institute is using a new approach in which the Seattle leadership team is empowered to run things instead of being treated as a “satellite.”

“We're still using the same FI tooling and branding but have a lot more leeway in decision making to suit the unique needs of the Seattle ecosystem,” he said.

The first cohort in Seattle begins in March. An open house on Dec. 12 at AI House in Seattle will serve as an official launch event and will feature two panels: “Building in Seattle” and “Scaling & Leverage.” Panelists include Evan Poncelot of Venture Black; Loti founder Luke Arrigoni; AI2 Incubator's Jacob Colker; Nick Hughes of Founders Live; Taylor Black of Microsoft AI Ventures; Brooks Lindsay of Light Legal; Sarah Studer of the University of Washington's Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship; and moderator Louis Newkirk of Venture Black and Founders Live.

Levi Reed, a former managing director at Seattle Founder Institute, is now an entrepreneur-in-residence at Startup425, a non-profit funded by six Seattle-area city governments, which announced a new accelerator last year. The 15-week program is modeled after the Founder Institute curriculum.

OpenAI and Instacart are launching a grocery shopping experience inside of ChatGPT, allowing customers to brainstorm meal ideas, make a grocery list, and check out, all without leaving the chat interface. 

This builds upon an existing partnership between OpenAI and Instacart; more than two years ago, Instacart launched an in-app AI search tool powered by ChatGPT, which helps shoppers ask questions about what to make for dinner or how to accommodate dietary restrictions.

The relationship between OpenAI and Instacart seems to have only deepened after former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo — who was already an OpenAI board member — joined the company as the CEO of Applications in May.

Agentic commerce — the use of AI tools to do shopping research and make purchases on a user's behalf — is a current priority for OpenAI. Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT. In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with Target, Intuit, and others.

Leading up to this year's holiday shopping season, both OpenAI and Perplexity announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season.

Despite ChatGPT's immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and it may not for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don't account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it'll take an undisclosed “small fee” when it helps merchants make a sale. But it would take a whole lot of ChatGPT-based shopping for these fees to make a dent in OpenAI's debt.

An increasing number of browsers are experimenting with agentic features that will take actions on your behalf, such as booking tickets or shopping for different items. However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. 

Google detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months.

The company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don't serve the user's goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content.

What's more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren't. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page.

“This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. 

Google is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model. This can prevent navigation to harmful model-generated URLs, the company said.

The search giant said that it is also handing over the reins to users for sensitive tasks. For instance, when an agent tries to navigate to a sensitive site with information like banking or your medical data, it first asks the user. For sites that require sign-in, it'll ask the user for permission to let Chrome use the password manager. Google said that the agent's model doesn't have exposure to password data. The company added that it will ask users before taking actions like making a purchase or sending a message.

Google said that, in addition to this, it also has a prompt-injection classifier to prevent unwanted actions and is also testing agentic capabilities against attacks created by researchers. 

AI browser makers are also paying attention to security. Earlier this month, Perplexity released a new open source content detection model to prevent prompt injection attacks against agents.

Last week, pet products and services giant Petco confirmed that it experienced a data breach involving customers' personal information, without specifying what type of data was affected.

On Friday, in a legally required filing with Texas' attorney general's office, Petco reported that the affected data included names, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, financial information such as account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, and dates of birth. 

Petco filed similar legally required notices in California, Massachusetts, and Montana. In the latter two states, Petco reported one and three affected residents, respectively. 

The company did not disclose the exact number of victims in California, where companies are required to disclose breaches involving at least 500 state residents, which suggests there are more victims than that number in the state. 

Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera did not respond to a series of questions sent on Monday, which included how many customers in total were affected by this incident; whether Petco has any technical means, including logs, to determine whether any cybercriminals had access and stole the customers' exposed data; what and when was the specific issue identified; and what was the application involved in the incident. 

For context, in 2022, Petco said it served more than 24 million customers.

On Friday, Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera said in a statement to TechCrunch that the company had “provided further information to individuals whose information was involved.” 

California's attorney general published a sample letter that Petco is sending to its customers. The message said Petco discovered an issue with “a setting within one of our software applications that inadvertently allowed certain files to be accessible online,” that the company “immediately took steps to correct the issue and to remove the files from further online access,” and that it “corrected” the setting and implemented unspecified “additional security measures.” 

The company is offering free credit and identity theft monitoring services to victims in California, Massachusetts, and Montana. Under California law, for example, companies must provide these services if a data breach victim's driver's license number or Social Security number are compromised. It's unclear if Petco is also offering these services to victims in Texas.

President Donald Trump said on Monday he plans to ink an executive order this week that would limit states from enacting their own regulation of AI technology.

“I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week,” Trump posted on social media. “You can't expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something.”

“There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump said. “We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won't last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS…AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY!” 

Trump's statement comes days after an effort to preempt states from regulating AI was quashed in the Senate, as Congress couldn't agree to insert the deeply unpopular proposal into a must-pass defense budget bill. 

The fast pace of AI development and the lack of general consumer protections from the federal government has led many states to enact their own rules around the technology. California, for example, has the AI safety and transparency bill SB 53, while Tennessee's ELVIS Act protects musicians and performers from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes of their voices and likenesses. 

Silicon Valley figures, including OpenAI President Greg Brockman and VC-turned-White House “AI czar” David Sacks, have argued that such laws by states would create an unworkable patchwork of laws that would stifle innovation and threaten the U.S.'s lead against China in the race to develop AI technology. 

Silicon Valley has a mighty lobbying arm that has blocked meaningful technology regulation for years, and proponents of states' regulatory rights say there's no reason to believe state AI laws could “destroy AI progress,” as VCs and tech companies claim. 

Trump's executive order, a draft of which was leaked a couple of weeks ago, would create an “AI Litigation Task Force” to challenge state AI laws in court, direct agencies to evaluate state laws deemed “onerous,” and push the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission toward national standards that override state rules. 

The Order would also give Sacks direct influence over AI policy, superseding the usual role of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, currently headed by Michael Kratsios. 

“Christmas comes early for AI billionaires who keep getting exactly what they want from The White House: a massive handout that makes it that much easier for them to make massive profits for themselves with exactly zero consideration for the risks to our kids, to our safety, and to our jobs,” New York Assembly member Alex Bores, who sponsored New York's RAISE Act, said in a statement. 

Attempts to block states' power to regulate AI have been deeply unpopular on both sides of Congress. Earlier this year, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced a proposal that would place a 10-year moratorium on AI legislation into the federal budget bill, but it was rejected 99-1, in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement that tech companies shouldn't operate without oversight.

And when Trump's draft was leaked last month, several Republican politicians spoke out. 

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) posted on X: “States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state. Federalism must be preserved.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) posted late last week: “I oppose stripping Florida of our ability to legislate in the best interest of the people. A ten year AI moratorium bans state regulation of AI, which would prevent FL from enacting important protections for individuals, children and families.”

DeSantis has also called data centers as drains on power and water resources, as well as potential job killers. 

“The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,” he said in a November X post. 

Late last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) warned Trump against the EO, advising him to “leave AI to the states” to preserve federalism and allow local protections. 

The desire to protect people from potential harms of AI technology is not unfounded. There have been several deaths by suicide following prolonged conversations with AI chatbots, and psychologists have recorded an uptick in cases of a condition they're calling “AI psychosis.” 

A bipartisan coalition of over 35 state attorneys general warned Congress last month that overriding state AI laws could have “disastrous consequences,” and more than 200 state lawmakers have issued an open letter opposing federal preemption, citing setbacks to progress on AI safety.

This article has been updated with comment from Alex Bores (D-NY).

IBM is buying data infrastructure company Confluent for $11 billion in cash in a bid to bolster its data and automation products as ever more companies move their tech operations to the cloud and deploy AI technology.

The tech giant said it would offer $31 for each Confluent share, which is about 50% more than what the smaller company's shares closed at on Friday, before news of the deal. 

Confluent offers a platform that helps enterprises manage streams of data in real time, a use case that's exploded in demand as ever more companies develop and deploy AI products, which require significant back-and-forth processing of data for inferencing.

IBM said Confluent will complement its existing data and automation products, as well as improve upon its existing offerings across AI, automation, data, and consulting. The company expects the deal to add to EBITDA and free cash flow in the two years after the deal is closed.

This is the latest in a string of deals IBM has struck in recent months as it seeks to capitalize on the AI boom, though at $11 billion, Confluent would be the tech giant's largest buy in years, following its acquisition of HashiCorp in 2024. 

IBM in October signed a deal with AI lab Anthropic to deploy the Claude large language model into some of its products; it has partnered with AMD to develop a new computing architecture that combines quantum systems with AI-specialized chips; and it acquired data analysis startup Seek AI in June.

TikTok is launching “Shared Collections,” a new way for users to share and organize TikTok content in one place with friends or family. The company also teased the upcoming launch of “Shared Feeds,” which will let users watch TikTok content together through a shared interest-based feed.

TikTok rolled out individual Collections earlier this year to let users save content in custom folders. With Shared Collections, users can now do things like create a space to share cookie-swap plans and holiday-dinner ideas with their family. Or, they can create Shared Collections to organize decor inspo or Secret Santa ideas.

“Whether it's content from their favorite creators, inspiration for a home design project, or a new skill they're learning together, Shared Collection makes it easy for people to stay organized as they discover and save on TikTok,” the company explained in the blog post.

You can only create a Shared Collection with someone if you're both following each other. Collections can stay just between friends and family, or they can be made public. 

Shared Collections are available globally to accounts of those over age 16.

As for Shared Feeds, which are launching in the coming months, TikTok sees them as a way for users to discover content together. Users can generate Shared Feeds in one-on-one direct messages. 

Shared Feeds will surface new content tailored to both users' tastes, such as sports or winter activities, and their favorite creators. The feeds are generated based on users' TikTok activity, such as what they like, watch, and comment on.

It's worth noting that the feeds aren't continuous, as users will find a selection of 15 videos in their Shared Feed each day. 

The feature is similar to Instagram Reels' Blend feature that lets you create a custom, personalized reels feed for you and your friends.

Users will be able to create a Shared Feed by sending an invite to another user. Once the invitation is accepted, they can create a feed and chat about it in DMs. After both people have watched all the videos, they can view metrics, including which videos they both liked, in their “Shared Likes” history. 

TikTok also announced that it's launching greeting cards that users can send each other. Users will be able to select a greeting card inside their chats, write a message, and send it. The receiver will get a festive animation alongside the message.

But maybe it's just because I started reading his works long after their initial release. In particular, I was quite surprised to later learn that ""Asimov's New Guide to Science"" was originally published as ""The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science"".

I work on a large product with two decades of accumulated legacy, maybe that's the problem. I can see though how generating and editing a simple greenfield web frontend project could work much better, as long as actual complexity is low.

I think generating more than one method at a time is playing with fire. Individual methods can be generated by the LLM and tested in isolation. You can incrementally build up and trust your understanding of the problem space by going a little bit slower. If the LLM is operating over a whole set of methods at once, it is like starting over each time you have to iterate.

When I give AI a smaller or more focused project, it's magical. I've been using Claude Code to write code for ESP32 projects and it's really impressive. OTOH, it failed to tell me about a standard device driver I could be using instead of a community device driver I found. I think any human who works on ESP-IDF projects would have pointed that out.AI's failings are always a little weird.

Definitely.  I've found Claude at least isn't so good at working in large existing projects, but great at greenfielding.Most of my use these days is having it write specific functions and tests for them, which in fairness, saves me a ton of time.

And I think it's less about non-deterministic code (the code is actually still deterministic) but more about this new-fangled tool out there that finally allows non-coders to generate something that looks like it works. And in many cases it does.Like a movie set. Viewed from the right angle it looks just right. Peek behind the curtain and it's all wood, thinly painted, and it's usually easier to rebuild from scratch than to add a layer on top.

Somewhat unfortunately, the sheer amount of money being poured into AI means that it's being forced upon many of us, even if we didn't want it. Which results in a stark, vast gap like the author is describing, where things are moving so fast that it can feel like we may never have time to catch up.And what's even worse, because of this industry and individuals are now trying to have the tool correct and moderate itself, which intuitively seems wrong from both a technical and societal standpoint.

The problem is, you have to know enough about the subject on which you're asking a question to land in the right place in the embedding. If you don't, you'll just get bunk. (I know it's popular to call AI bunk ""hallucinations"" these days, but really if it was being spouted by a half wit human we'd just call it ""bunk"".)So you really have to be an expert in order to maximize your use of an LLM. And even then, you'll only be able to maximize your use of that LLM in the field in which your expertise lies.A programmer, for instance, will likely never be able to ask a coherent enough question about economics or oncology for an LLM to give a reliable answer. Similarly, an oncologist will never be able to give a coherent enough software specification for an LLM to write an application for him or her.That's the achilles heel of AI today as implemented by LLMs.

He started the steps but one of them mentioned configuring an option that did not exist in the system at all. Textbook hallucination. It was obvious on the call that he was very surprised that the AI would give him an incorrect result, he was 100% convinced the answer was what the LLM said and never once thought to question what the LLM returned.I've had a couple of instances with friends being equally shocked when an LLM turned out to be wrong. One of which was fairly disturbing, I was at a horse track and describing LLMs and to demonstrate i took a picture of the racing form thing and asked the LLM to formulate a medium risk betting strategy. My friend immediatately took it as some kind of supernatural insight and bet $100 on the plan it came up with. It was as if he believed the LLM could tell the future.Thank god it didn't work and he lost about $70. Had he won I don't know what would have happened, he probably would have asked again and bet everything he had.

Coding agents are only as good as the context you give them. General models are trained on public code and documentation that is often old, and they usually have no idea what is inside your actual repo, internal wiki, or the exact version of a third party SDK you use. The result is very familiar: you paste URLs and code snippets into the prompt, the agent confidently uses an outdated API or the wrong framework version, and you spend more time verifying and correcting it than if you had written the code yourself. Once models are good enough at generating code, feeding them precise, up-to-date context becomes the bottleneck.I ran into this pattern first on my own projects when (a few months ago) I was still in high school in Kazakhstan, obsessed with codegen tools and trying every coding agent I could find. I saw it again when I got into YC and talked to other teams who were also trying to use agents on real work.The first version of Nia was basically “my personal MCP server that knows my repos and favorite doc sites so I do not have to paste URLs into Cursor anymore.” Once I saw how much smoother my own workflow became, it felt obvious that this should be a product other people could use too.Under the hood, Nia is an indexing and retrieval service with an MCP interface and an API. You point it at sources like GitHub repositories, framework or provider docs, SDK pages, PDF manuals, etc. We fetch and parse those with some simple heuristics for code structures, headings, and tables, then normalize them into chunks and build several indexes: a semantic index with embeddings for natural language queries; a symbol and usage index for functions, classes, types, and endpoints; a basic reference graph between files, symbols, and external docs; regex and file tree search for cases where you want deterministic matches over raw text.When an agent calls Nia, it sends a natural language query plus optional hints like the current file path, stack trace, or repository. Nia runs a mix of BM25 style search, embedding similarity, and graph walks to rank relevant snippets, and can also return precise locations like “this function definition in this file and the three places it is used” instead of just a fuzzy paragraph. The calling agent then decides how to use those snippets in its own prompt.
One Nia deployment can serve multiple agents and multiple projects at once. For example, you can have Cursor, Claude Code, and a browser based agent all pointed at the same Nia instance that knows about your monorepo, your internal wiki, and the provider docs you care about. We keep an agent agnostic session record that tracks which sources were used and which snippets the user accepted. Any MCP client can attach to that session id, fetch the current context, and extend it, so switching tools does not mean losing what has already been discovered.A lot of work goes into keeping indexes fresh without reprocessing everything. Background workers periodically refetch configured sources, detect which files or pages changed, and reindex those incrementally. This matters because many of the worst “hallucinations” I have seen are actually the model quoting valid documentation for the wrong version. Fixing that is more about version and change tracking than about model quality.We ship Nia with a growing set of pre-indexed public sources. Today this includes around 6k packages from common frameworks and provider docs, plus package search over thousands of libraries from ecosystems like PyPI, npm, and RubyGems, as well as pre indexed /explore page where everyone can contribute their sources! The idea is that a new user can install Nia, connect nothing, and still get useful answers for common libraries. Then, as soon as you add your own repos and internal docs, those private sources are merged into the same index.
Some examples of how people use Nia so far: - migrating from one payments provider or API version to another by indexing the provider docs plus example repos and letting the agent propose and iterate on patches; - answering “how do I do X in this framework” by indexing the framework source directly instead of relying only on official docs that might be stale; - turning an unfamiliar public codebase into a temporary wiki to self onboard, where you can ask structural questions and jump to specific files, functions, or commits; - building a browser agent that answers questions using up to date code and docs even when the public documentation lags behind.Nia is a paid product (https://www.trynia.ai/) but we have a free tier that should be enough for individuals to try it on real projects. Above that there is a self-serve paid plan for heavier individual use, and organization plans with higher limits, SOC 2, seat based billing, and options for teams that want to keep indexing inside their own environment. For private GitHub repos we can clone and index locally so code does not leave your infrastructure.We store account details and basic telemetry like query counts and errors to operate the service, and we store processed representations of content you explicitly connect (chunks, metadata, embeddings, and small graphs) so we can answer queries. We do not train foundation models on customer content and we do not sell user data.
Moreover, I can see Nia play out in the larger context of the agents space due to the global problem of providing reliable context to those systems. Early signals show that people are already using Nia for healthcare data, cloning Paul Graham by indexing all of his essays and turning him into an AI agent, using Naval's archive to build a personalized agent, and more.I would love to get Nia into the hands of more engineers who are already pushing coding agents hard and see where it breaks. I am especially interested in hearing about failure modes, annoying onboarding steps, places where the retrieval logic is obviously wrong or incomplete, or any security concerns I should address. I will be in the thread to answer questions, share more technical details, and collect any brutal feedback you are willing to give!

The first version of Nia was basically “my personal MCP server that knows my repos and favorite doc sites so I do not have to paste URLs into Cursor anymore.” Once I saw how much smoother my own workflow became, it felt obvious that this should be a product other people could use too.Under the hood, Nia is an indexing and retrieval service with an MCP interface and an API. You point it at sources like GitHub repositories, framework or provider docs, SDK pages, PDF manuals, etc. We fetch and parse those with some simple heuristics for code structures, headings, and tables, then normalize them into chunks and build several indexes: a semantic index with embeddings for natural language queries; a symbol and usage index for functions, classes, types, and endpoints; a basic reference graph between files, symbols, and external docs; regex and file tree search for cases where you want deterministic matches over raw text.When an agent calls Nia, it sends a natural language query plus optional hints like the current file path, stack trace, or repository. Nia runs a mix of BM25 style search, embedding similarity, and graph walks to rank relevant snippets, and can also return precise locations like “this function definition in this file and the three places it is used” instead of just a fuzzy paragraph. The calling agent then decides how to use those snippets in its own prompt.
One Nia deployment can serve multiple agents and multiple projects at once. For example, you can have Cursor, Claude Code, and a browser based agent all pointed at the same Nia instance that knows about your monorepo, your internal wiki, and the provider docs you care about. We keep an agent agnostic session record that tracks which sources were used and which snippets the user accepted.

w nia the agent can dynamically search, traverse, and validate information outside the local project so it never hallucinates against out-of-date or incomplete sources.

How does this fare with codebases that change very frequently? I presume background agents re-indexing changes must become a bottleneck at some point for large or very active teams.If I'm working on a large set of changes modifying lots of files, moving definitions around, etc., meaning I've deviated locally quite a bit from the most up to date index, will Nia be able to reconcile what I'm trying to do locally vs the index, despite my local changes looking quite different from the upstream?

reply

For large and active codebases, we avoid full reindexing. Nia tracks diffs and file level changes, so background workers only reindex what actually changed. We are also building “inline agents” that watch pull requests or recent commits and proactively update the index ahead of your agent queries.Local vs upstream divergence is a real scenario. Today Nia prioritizes providing external context to your coding agents: packages, provider docs, SDK versions, internal wikis, etc. We can still reconcile with your local code if you point the agent at your local workspace (cursor and claude code already provide that path). We look at file paths, symbol names and usage references to map local edits to known context. In cases where the delta is large, we surface both the local version and the latest indexed version so the agent understands what changed.

`@Docs` — will show a bunch of pre-indexed Docs, and you can add whatever you want and it'll show up in the list. You can see the state of Docs indexing in Cursor Settings.The UX leaves a bit to be desired, but that's a problem Cursor seems to have in general.

+ as I mentioned above there are many more use cases than just coding.Think docs, APIs, research, knowledge bases, even personal or enterprise data sources the agent needs to explore and validate dynamically.

reply

From a business point of view I am not sure how you get traction without being 10x better than what Cursor can produce tomorrow. If you are successful the coding agents will copy your idea and then people being lazy and using what works have no inventive to switch.I am not trying to discourage. More like encourage you to figure out how you get that elusive moat that all startups seek.As a user I am excited to try it soon. Got something in mind that this should make easier.

Kobo devices have root exposed but don't let users boot their own kernels (and the kernel they ship was not compiled with kexec either).I really don't know the reason so many devices these days don't have an unlock method. It seems predatory. Who knows where in the chain this happens... maybe it's Kobo, or maybe MediaTek won't sell you their SoCs for mass-market devices unless you lock them.

If you can do either of those, it should be trivial to get kexec working by just loading it as a module.

The way you install additional software is literally just moving files into folders whilst its plugged into your computer. I'm sure it could handle Tailscale.

4 technologies that didn't make our 2026 breakthroughs list

If you're a longtime reader, you probably know that our newsroom selects 10 breakthroughs every year that we think will define the future. This group exercise is mostly fun and always engrossing, with plenty of lively discussion along the way, but at times it can also be quite difficult.  

The 2026 list will come out on January 12—so stay tuned. In the meantime, we wanted to share some of the technologies from this year's reject pile, as a window into our decision-making process. These four technologies won't be on our 2026 list of breakthroughs, but all were closely considered, and we think they're worth knowing about. Read the full story to learn what they are.

How wind tech could help decarbonize cargo shipping

Inhabitants of the Marshall Islands—a chain of coral atolls in the center of the Pacific Ocean—rely on sea transportation for almost everything. For millennia they sailed largely in canoes, but much of their seafaring movement today involves big, bulky, diesel-fueled cargo ships that are heavy polluters.

They're not alone. Cargo shipping is responsible for about 3% of the world's annual greenhouse-­gas emissions, and that figure is currently on track to rise to 10% by 2050.

The islands have been disproportionately experiencing the consequences of human-made climate change: warming waters, more frequent extreme weather, and rising sea levels. Now its residents are exploring a surprisingly traditional method of decarbonizing its fleets. Read the full story.

Like the worst sort of father, Xbox doesn't show much care for its youngest consoles anymore, at least judging solely by recent sales data. Black Friday weekend, normally one of the most important for any brand for pre-holiday sales, shows Xbox got beat out by Nintendo, Sony, and—to give the news an ounce of irony—even a relatively obscure Kinect-like console.

Mat Piscatella, a video game industry analyst at Circana, reported that the PlayStation 5 accounted for 47% of total Black Friday week console sales, in the U.S. ending Nov. 29. That makes sense, considering the console was on sale for about 40% at some retailers. Sony's console—both the digital version and one with a disc drive—was on sale for less than even its pre-hike price. Meanwhile, coming up second was the Nintendo Switch 2 at 24% of total sales. The second-generation handheld console was on sale for $50 off the normally $500 Mario Kart World bundle from Walmart and Amazon. Finally, coming in third was the NEX Playground at 14%.

What's the NEX Playground, you may ask? It's an Android-based platform made for younger children. It includes motion sensors that can read body movements for games such as Fruit Ninja or tie-in titles like How to Train Your Dragon: Riders of the Skies. Yes, that's very much like the long-defunct Kinect. It's a very specific kind of console that may make sense for budget-conscious families. What's missing from this pie chart is the Xbox Series S and Series X.

Microsoft pushed no sales for its consoles during Black Friday week. Even if some retailers went out of their way to move stock with extra gift cards or game sales, Xbox itself wasn't helping push the needle. The current Xbox Series X costs $650 after this year's latest price hike. The same console cost $500 at launch in 2020. Piscatella wrote on Bluesky, “Stuff that does not price promote (generally speaking, here) does not see much of a seasonal lift at all from the prior week (usually none).” Since the PS5 was the most heavily discounted, it received the lion's share of additional sales. Xbox either did not think it was necessary to push sales, or the brand just doesn't care anymore.

Xbox's whole strategy is now focused on software. If it does finally release a next-gen Xbox, it will likely be a premium, expensive gaming device made for players who want the very best. That means the Xbox Series consoles don't really have a place anymore. There have been signs that Xbox has been shipping far fewer consoles to retailers, such that Costco removed the company's consoles from its U.S. and UK websites.

The move toward a software-based gaming ecosystem is inevitably disappointing for Xbox fans. At the same time, the cost of RAM and SSD memory blew past the point of reason several weeks ago, and it keeps getting worse. Burgeoning AI data centers are willing to pay so much for memory that semiconductor companies have created a drought of consumer-ready DRAM (dynamic random access memory). The reliable leaker Moore's Law is Dead reported Sony stockpiled enough memory for the short term, but the RAM shortage could last through 2028. Yes, RAM prices could still be out of control a few years from now.

Meanwhile, Xbox's cloud gaming service has reportedly seen an uptick in total usage hours lately. Whether that means there are more people buying into Game Pass is another question entirely. Microsoft hasn't been willing to share total subscriber numbers recently. There's a chance Microsoft's strategy will win out over the traditionalists like Sony and Nintendo. But for now, its console business is bleeding out so fast, it likely won't last long.

And things aren't going to get easier for Xbox. Valve is launching its Steam Machine in early 2026 and there will no doubt be all kinds of third-party console-sized PCs of the same ilk. When the next-gen Xbox does arrive, it won't be a battle directly with Sony's “PS6.” The console wars will have changed by then, with more players fighting for the living room than ever before.

The main subtext of the unpleasant announcement on Thursday that Netflix planned to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal worth $82.7 billion was that Silicon Valley is still grabbing all it can amid the ongoing looting of culture by Big Tech. That subtext may have overshadowed some additional, equally nauseating subtext that anonymous sources have confirmed to Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw: that if it succeeds, it will likely be in part the product of a personal lobbying effort aimed at winning President Donald Trump's approval. That push reportedly included Netflix leadership visiting the White House for a meeting with Trump that lasted for hours, but only after a chummy dinner at Mar-a-Lago almost a year earlier. To refresh your memory, Netflix is buying a vast cache of cultural properties on top of the streaming infrastructure at Warner Bros. Discovery, including HBO Max. Just for starters, it locks down four of the most oft-cited “best movies of all time,” Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Blade Runner, and Gone with the Wind. Same goes for TV. Netflix will now own The Sopranos, The Wire, and my personal favorite media property in existence: Curb Your Enthusiasm. By absorbing the very best of legacy showbiz, Netflix has seemingly no lands left to conquer without becoming such an obvious monopoly that no presidential administration could possibly tolerate it. And Trump is historically more of a monopoly hawk than previous Republican presidents. So such meetings, grubby or not, were probably inevitable.

According to Bloomberg's reporting, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos sat down with Trump at the White House in mid-November to gently broach this, and make his company's case, and during the meeting Trump is said to have told Sarandos that Warner Bros. ought to go to the highest bidder—which must have been music to Sarandos' ears. Apparently Sarandos claimed at the time that Netflix ranked 5th or 6th on the list of biggest TV distributors, and that with this deal, it would become as big as YouTube. But apparently Sarandos had set the stage for the success of this conversation almost exactly a year ago, at a December 2024 Mar-a-Lago dinner—just after Trump won the presidential election, in other words. That was when Silicon Valley leaders like Mark Zuckerberg were trekking to Florida to kiss Trump's ring before he was sworn in.Sarandos, Shaw writes, “had deep ties with the Obama and Biden administrations” because he's married to Nicole Avant, who was Obama's ambassador to the Bahamas. It's mainly in this Obama-centric context that Sarandos had schmoozed with global power players, so in his view he needed to fix that. Per Shaw, “the two traded stories and struck up a bond over their childhoods and their shared love of entertainment.” And Trump and Sarandos still chat, apparently.

Elon Musk's SpaceX has set ambitious goals for next year, aiming to roll out the next generation of Starship, launch its first uncrewed mission to Mars, and demonstrate key technical feats such as in-orbit refueling. Amid media reports of soaring valuation, Musk has shared new details about the company's finances heading into fiscal year 2026.

Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX was initiating a secondary share sale that would raise the company's valuation to $800 billion, doubling its mid-2025 valuation. Musk denied this in a Saturday X post but did not address the report's claim that SpaceX is weighing a potential initial public offering for 2026.

“There has been a lot of press claiming [SpaceX] is raising money at $800B, which is not accurate,” Musk wrote, clarifying that the company has been “cash flow positive for many years” and does regular stock buybacks twice a year to provide liquidity for employees and investors. He did not share a more accurate valuation for SpaceX.

Gizmodo reached out to SpaceX for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

There has been a lot of press claiming @SpaceX is raising money at $800B, which is not accurate. 

SpaceX has been cash flow positive for many years and does periodic stock buybacks twice a year to provide liquidity for employees and investors.

Valuation increments are a…

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 6, 2025



While Musk's post offers some clarity, it also raises more questions about SpaceX's financial state. With the reported $800 billion valuation in question, it's unclear how much the company is currently worth, and how much of a boost these stock buybacks could provide. In June, Musk said SpaceX's 2025 commercial revenue would be roughly $15.5 billion.

The aerospace company is competing with OpenAI—currently worth about $500 billion—to become the world's most valuable private company. But the question of whether SpaceX could go public in 2026 is perhaps even more tantalizing.

SpaceX has achieved dominance in the commercial spaceflight sector, securing its role as a critical launch provider for the U.S. government. It also operates the largest constellation of broadband internet satellites in low-Earth orbit: Starlink. An IPO would unlock enormous value for investors, but SpaceX has not officially announced any plans to go public.

SpaceX may be NASA's most active launch provider, but these contracts make up a surprisingly small portion of the company's revenue. Musk followed up his Saturday X post by stating that Starlink is by far the company's greatest revenue driver, and that NASA will contribute to less than 5% of SpaceX's revenue next year.

“Some people have claimed that SpaceX gets ‘subsidized' by NASA. This is absolutely false,” Musk wrote, adding that the company won its NASA contracts based on merit and affordability. “With regard to astronaut transport, SpaceX is currently the only option that passes NASA safety standards.”

He makes a valid point, but it's also important to note that SpaceX has a lot to achieve in 2026 if it hopes to keep its largest NASA contract: the Artemis Human Landing System (HLS). NASA awarded SpaceX $2.89 billion in 2021 to build the spacecraft that will land the Artemis 3 astronauts on the Moon, but development is severely off-track for a launch target of mid-2027.

Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reopened the contract in October, and now, SpaceX is racing against Blue Origin to provide a viable lunar lander. To win, SpaceX will first have to get Starship Version 3 off the ground, then demonstrate key capabilities such as full reusability, in-orbit refueling, and an uncrewed Moon landing.

It's a tall order. Looking ahead to next year, SpaceX faces daunting technical challenges that could influence investor confidence and future valuations if the company decides to go public. While much remains uncertain, 2026 is shaping up to be a high-stakes year for SpaceX.

Creative professionals have been abuzz with the recent news that Canva had folded Affinity into a subscription model that included a free tier, making slimmed-down versions of Affinity Photo, Designer, and Publisher accessible for no money at all. The first question was, would this cause a stampede of Adobe subscribers to the free Affinity versions?

Answer: Highly unlikely. Beginners and anyone needing a one-off flyer or other creative project might opt for Affinity's free-version suite, but the true pros and anyone else wanting to create high-quality creative work is almost certainly going to stick with Adobe Creative Cloud Pro, anchored by the big three of their creative apps: Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. But Adobe has decided to sweeten the incentive even more with a Free Generative AI offer that is running now through Dec. 15 for Creative Cloud Pro subscribers.

See at Adobe

This Free Generative AI offer from Adobe includes free unlimited Firefly and third-party image generations, plus unlimited Firefly video generations. Since the offer is for Creative Cloud Pro subscribers, you're already aware of the incredible potential of combining free AI and Firefly features with the 20-plus professional creative tools that make up this industry-best suite. As the Creative Cloud Pro suite is constantly being updated with new features by Adobe, now you'll get free Firefly features, new automation, and enhanced control across the entire suite.

Those continuous automatic updates aren't just cosmetic changes or minor UX tweaks. They're powerful new tools and features that creative professionals will use often. Some of the newest update highlights include:

The advantage that Adobe Creative Cloud Pro has long held over its competition is that all of the 20+ apps work together. A creative professional can get Illustrator to talk to Photoshop, and Photoshop to InDesign, and so forth. Nothing gets lost in translation or requires outside apps or untested 3rd party plug-ins, but there are hundreds of 3rd party integrations with other very useful apps like Figma and Blender.

And no creative shop is as on top of the newest AI integrations and tools than Adobe, which is how they're able to offer Creative Cloud Pro subscribers this Free Generative AI addition. Freeware is nice, but the real heavyweight of the creative world has always been and continues to be Adobe Creative Cloud Pro. Subscribe now, or if you're already a Creative Cloud Pro subscriber, be sure to cash in on Adobe's Free Generative AI offer before it expires on Dec. 15.

In the wake of Netflix's shock announcement that it had emerged out of Warner Bros.' sale season victorious last week, frankly very few people outside of Netflix itself were really happy at the news. Perhaps chief among those detractors was Paramount, after its own bid failed… but they're not going to let that failure go quietly.

Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, whose arrival on the Hollywood scene has ruffled feathers ever since Skydance's $8 billion takeover of Paramount went through earlier this year, confirmed to CNBC this morning that the studio planned to approach Warner Bros.' investors with a direct bid. Coming in at $30 per share (just over Netflix's ultimately accepted bid of approximately $28 a share, totaling an almost $83 billion sale), Paramount's new $108 billion bid, in contrast to Netflix's, would be for the purchase of the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, rather than just Warner Bros.' film and TV studios, streaming apparatus, and gaming divisions after its broader split from Discovery.

“We're really here to finish what we started,” Ellison told CNBC. “We put the company in play.”

The hostile bid comes in the wake of Paramount publicly criticizing Warner Bros.' sale process, accusing the studio's leadership of bias towards Netflix during the process. Paramount Skydance had aggressively pursued an acquisition of Warner Bros. since the studio began floating it was considering a sale earlier this year, emboldened by its own successful merger and its approval by the Trump administration (which itself raised plenty of eyebrows for how much Skydance and Paramount were willing to sweeten the deal for federal approval).

If anything, Ellison has argued that his prior relationship with the Trump administration makes Paramount's bid even stronger. Ellison noted to CNBC this morning that Paramount had already had “great conversations with the President” about its renewed bid, preparing to make the argument that Paramount's smaller size in comparison to Netflix would make a potential deal face fewer roadblocks in the path to regulatory approval—especially given the Ellison family's friendly relationship with Trump, a relationship that isn't necessarily matched by any of Netflix's own executive leadership.

President Trump already indicated this past weekend that Netflix and Warner Bros.' deal could face significant hurdles, telling reporters at the Kennedy Center Sunday night that Netflix's increased market share in the wake of the merger “could be a problem.”

“They have a very big market share, and when they have Warner Brothers, you know, that share goes up a lot,” Trump told the press (also via CNBC). “So I don't know, that's going to be for some economists to tell.”

One repeated concern raised about a potential Paramount takeover of Warner Bros. was that it would give the megacorporation, with leadership unabashedly open about its support of President Trump, control of two of the United States' most prominent and influential newsrooms in CNN and CBS, giving the administration itself a potent level of influence in communicating its agenda to the American public. And that's even before the fact that, although not quite on the scale of concerns over a potential Netflix takeover, such a deal should raise similar antitrust concerns.

Whether it would, given the aforementioned willingness Ellison and his family have indicated to make overtures to the Trump administration to smooth over any hurdles, remains to be seen. Regardless, the future of Warner Bros.—and with it the broader future of Hollywood as we currently know it—remains in flux.

Acer's Nitro 60 gaming mid-tower ($1,599 as tested from Micro Center) delivers gaming essentials without the premium price of its Predator towers. Its combination of an Intel Core i7-14700F and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 is effective for entry-level 4K gaming performance. Outside, its attractive, glass-trimmed case lends it an upscale appearance, while inside, its RGB fans operate quietly even while gaming. It misses a few things – namely, the wireless standard is only Wi-Fi 6 and no peripherals are included – but does well everywhere else.

The Nitro 60 sticks to a familiar mid-tower gaming template, built around an all-black chassis with a tempered glass side panel that highlights its internals. Four RGB fans — two front intakes, one on the CPU cooler, and a rear exhaust — provide the expected glow of color. While it certainly looks the part, the design doesn't differentiate it from the many towers in this price bracket. It's a welcome demonstration of restraint from Acer, known for bolder and occasionally polarizing designs in its gaming line. This conventional approach provides a sense of normalcy.

 




The Nitro 60's stout dimensions of 8.5 x 14.9 x 15.9 inches (WDH) make it smaller than many other mid-towers. Build quality is solid, with clean edges, a blackout interior, and tempered glass that lends a premium feel.

Lighting is divided into two zones: one for the two RGB DIMMs and another for the four fans. You can adjust colors and patterns in the Windows Dynamic Lighting app. Acer includes Gigabyte's Dynamic Light app, but I wasn't able to get this to open, preventing me from changing the lighting on the fans or DIMMs. I instead installed Gigabyte's RGB Fusion, which ultimately enabled independent customization of the fans and DIMMs.

Up front, the Nitro 60 provides two USB 3.2 Type‑A ports, 3.5 mm headphone and microphone jacks, plus power and reset buttons. It's a decent selection, though the lack of a USB-C port is notable, particularly there is room for another USB port, but the cutout is blocked off. These connections are conveniently placed if the tower sits on a floor, though less so on a desk where cables tend to cascade downward.

 




Rear I/O includes a USB‑C 3.2 Gen 2x2 port, a USB‑A 3.2 Gen 2 port, four USB 2.0 ports, and three 3.5 mm audio jacks. An old‑school PS/2 port is also present, which feels dated (though it's still fairly common). The motherboard's HDMI and DisplayPort outputs are disabled since the Core i7‑14700F lacks integrated graphics.

 




Networking is handled with a 2.5 Gbps Ethernet jack alongside built‑in Wi‑Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3. Faster Wi‑Fi 6E or 7 would have been better, but this configuration should suffice for most users. The included wireless antennas must be screwed in.

The side panels detach after you unscrew two thumbscrews for each. The tempered glass panel falls to the side after the screws are removed, so it's important to support it while doing so.

 




Inside, the Gigabyte B760M C V2 motherboard and a tall 120 mm CPU air cooler take center stage. It's notable that Acer used a readily available aftermarket motherboard rather than an OEM or proprietary model. Its expansion is generous, with four DIMM slots, four PCIe slots, and three M.2 slots. Cable management is mostly hidden thanks to the isolated PSU chamber, though the right‑side panel conceals some untidy bundles.

 




Storage expansion supports one 2.5‑ or 3.5‑inch drive, with SATA cables included. A modular 850 W Thermaltake power supply is a surprising inclusion, as many systems in this price range ship with non‑modular units. Extra cables are provided in the box.

For maintenance, the case features slide‑out dust filters beneath the PSU and on the top panel, simplifying cleaning. The front panel also comes off by tugging the handhold on its bottom edge.

Our Acer Nitro 60 features a Core i7-14700F processor, a GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of DDR5 RAM. Although the memory is rated for 6,000 MHz, it was only running at 4,800 MHz out of the box, which is how we conducted our testing. I had to access the BIOS to enable XMP1 for it to run at its rated speed.

To test the Nitro 60, I played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III at 3840 x 2160 at the Extreme preset with DLSS enabled and observed a fluid 90 to 100 fps in most maps, with no stuttering.

For context, we compared the Nitro 60 to several gaming towers. The closest rival is the Asus ROG G700 ($2,029 as tested), which pairs a Core Ultra 7 265KF with the same GeForce RTX 5070. We also included the CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme ($1,859), built around an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and RTX 5060 Ti, and the iBuyPower Y40 Pro ($1,899) which features a higher-end Ryzen 9 7900X and RTX 5070 Ti.

In Shadow of the Tomb Raider at the game's Highest detail preset, the Nitro 60 competed with the ROG G700, producing 194 FPS to the latter's 199 FPS at 1080p, while both produced 68 FPS at 4K. The RTX 5070 Ti-powered iBuyPower led the results, with 228 FPS at 1080p and 89 FPS at 4K, while the CyberPower with its RTX 5060 Ti trailed, with 149 and 46 FPS.

The demanding Cyberpunk 2077 (at the Ray Tracing Ultra preset) saw the desktops in a similar pecking order, with the Nitro 60's 65 FPS at 1080p just behind the ROG G700's 70 FPS. Both units also showed similar performance at 4K, with the Nitro's 21 FPS against the ROG's 20 FPS. The iBuyPower's 87 and 29 FPS proved to be the best of the bunch, with the CyberPowerPC trailing with 53 and 15 FPS.

In Far Cry 6 (Ultra), the results were skewed at 1080p, with the CyberPowerPC taking the lead with 138 FPS, the iBuyPower in second place with 125 FPS, and our Nitro 60 narrowly behind it with 121 FPS. The desktops went back to their expected places at 4K, with the Nitro 60's 81 FPS just ahead of the ROG G700's 80. It remained behind the iBuyPower (102 FPS) and well ahead of the CyberPowerPC (59 FPS).

In Red Dead Redemption 2 (Medium preset), the Nitro 60's respective 143 and 54 FPS at 1080p and 4K slightly outperformed the ROG G700's 120 and 50 FPS, significantly outperformed the CyberPowerPC's 104 and 37 FPS, and trailed the iBuyPower's 161 and 66 FPS.

Last, in Black Myth: Wukong (Cinematic preset), the Nitro 60 remained consistent, producing 56 FPS at 1080p and 24 FPS at 4K, which was within one FPS of the ROG G700 at both resolutions. The CyberPowerPC slotted behind, with 41 FPS at 1080p and 17 FPS at 4K, while the iBuyPower's stronger RTX 5070 Ti propelled it to 66 FPS at 1080p and 32 FPS at 4K.

The Nitro 60 demonstrates strong gaming performance in line with what we expect from an RTX 5070 desktop. Despite using an older Core i7-14700F, its gaming numbers were largely identical to what we saw from the ROG G700 featuring the newer, higher-wattage Core Ultra 7 265KF, particularly at 4K where most games will be GPU-limited. Had Acer enabled the XMP memory settings out of the box, its performance might have been even closer to the ROG G700's.

 




To evaluate sustained gaming performance, we run 15 loops of the Metro Exodus stress test at RTX settings. During the approximately 30-minute test, the Nitro 60 produced an average framerate of 121.3 FPS across all runs, with minimal variation between runs suggesting stable thermal performance. The Core i7-14700F maintained an average temperature of 52 degrees Celsius while the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti averaged 61 C. The Nitro 60's fans were well-behaved throughout testing. While not inaudible, they wouldn't be distracting over typical household background noise.

Our Nitro 60 features a Core i7-14700F CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD. While the 65-watt CPU isn't as formidable as the 125-watt K-series chips, it's still a formidable performer for almost any task.

In our Geekbench 6 CPU test, the Nitro 60's Core i7-14700F trailed the single-core results, producing 2,865 points. The iBuyPower did slightly better, with 2,953 from its Ryzen 9 7900X, the ROG G700 produced 3,092 with its Core Ultra 7 265KF, and the CyberPowerPC led with 3,335 courtesy of its Ryzen 7 9800X3D. In multi-core, the Nitro landed mid-pack, its 18,315 points ahead of the iBuyPower (17,226) and just trailing the CyberPowerPC (18,601) but out of range of the ROG G700 (19,057).

Our Handbrake 4K to 1080p video transcoding test saw the Nitro 60 finish dead last, completing the test in 3 minutes and 10 seconds. The others all broke the three-minute mark, with the CyberPowerPC finishing in 2:58, the iBuyPower in 2:29, and the ROG G700 in 2:03. This is the one test where the Nitro 60's 65-watt CPU is not that adept.

Last, the Nitro 60 produced the best transfer rate of 1,861.6 MBps in our 25 GB file transfer test. The ROG G700 was second (1,816.5) while the CyberPowerPC (1,664.1) and the iBuyPower (1,501.6) picked up the last two spots.

The Nitro 60 we received did not include any peripherals. This is a mild omission at best, considering bundled peripherals are usually of entry-level quality, which most users will want to replace with a better keyboard and mouse anyway. Some people may even prefer picking out their own accessories.

The Nitro 60 ships with relatively little preinstalled software. Acer Care Center is the most practical inclusion, offering system updates and easy access to support resources. Acer also bundles Gigabyte's Dynamic Light utility for RGB control, though it failed to launch during testing. I installed Gigabyte's RGB Fusion on my own, which functioned properly and allowed customization of both the RAM modules and fans.

Less welcome is the assortment of bloatware, including a McAfee security trial and several lightweight game demos. Fortunately, these can be quickly uninstalled.

Acer provides a one‑year warranty with the system.

Our review unit, sourced from Micro Center, features an air‑cooled Core i7‑14700F processor, GeForce RTX 5070 graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD is on sale for $1,599 as of this writing but is $2,099 at normal price..

This configuration is competitively priced with the sale. At Best Buy, desktops with similar RTX 5070 setups—such as models from CyberPowerPC and HP's Omen 35L—were within $100 of the Nitro 60. It also undercuts the $1,749 Asus ROG G700, which offers comparable specifications but swaps in a Core Ultra 7 265KF.

Entry‑level Nitro 60 models start at $879 at Micro Center, pairing a Core i5‑14400F with an RTX 5060, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. A $1,399 tier matches most of our review unit's specifications but uses an RTX 5060 Ti. For $1,499, buyers can step up to an RTX 5070 paired with a Ryzen 7 7700. The highest‑end configuration, available from Acer's online store, mirrors our review unit but upgrades to an RTX 5070 Ti for $1,799.

Acer's Nitro 60 delivers more than expected for a mid‑tier gaming desktop. With the Core i7‑14700F and GeForce RTX 5070 in our review unit, it proves to be a capable all‑around performer, even stretching into 4K gaming at the right settings. The design has appeal with its tempered glass side panel and the welcome inclusion of a modular power supply, a rarity at this price point.

There are a few shortcomings. Out of the box, the memory runs below its rated speed since XMP settings are not enabled, and no peripherals are included. Networking also tops out at Wi‑Fi 6 rather than newer standards, though this is unlikely to hinder most users.

Competition in this segment is intense. The Asus ROG G700 offers a liquid‑cooled CPU and a more eye-catching design, but at a higher cost. Meanwhile, the Nitro 60 remains price‑competitive against numerous mid‑tower alternatives from Best Buy and Micro Center. Taken together, its performance, design, and value make the Nitro 60 a strong contender for gamers seeking a well‑rounded desktop without overspending.

Creality's K2 Pro Combo 3D printer is a mid-sized, four-color speedster with a lot of polish, but not quite as good as the earlier K2 Plus.

Four color printing

Impressive speed

Heated chamber

Step-servos on the X and Y axis and the extruder

Printing TPU is challenging

Long, high-flow hotend requires more purge waste

Cables to CFS are too short to allow installation anywhere but on top of the printer

Expensive

The Creality K2 Pro is the smaller companion to 2024's massive K2 Plus, which was Creality's first foray into four-color Core XY 3D printing. We've been waiting a long while for the K2 and K2 Pro, which are a more manageable size and price. We first saw the smaller K2s at Rapid TCT this year, but only recently got our hands on one for review.

Creality's naming system for the K2 lineup is misleading and confusing. The K2 is about the size of a Bambu Lab X1C, but bigger than the first Creality K1, which stuck to the old Ender 3 220 x 220mm build size. The K2 Pro is the size of a K1 Max at 300 x 300 mm, and the K2 Plus is a 350 x 350 mm-sized beast. Confused? So are we.

All that aside, the Creality K2 Pro really shows how far we've come since the old Ender 3. Now we expect printers to work out of the box and produce flawless multicolor prints, all without tuning, modding, or going through voluminous test prints with every change of filament. The K2 Pro with its CFS box did just that. It has excellent print quality, even though it produces a lot of purge waste due to its high-flow nozzle. Other than a bit of trouble with TPU, the K2 Pro pleasantly surprised me with a long run of perfect prints and no fails.

The list of features packed into the K2 Pro is impressive. The sturdy die-cast aluminum frame sits on squishy vibration-dampening feet. The machine is fairly quiet with the door closed, and the chamber cooling through the air purifier is good enough in practice to run PLA and PETG without the door open. Chamber heating does take some time to reach its maximum temperature of 60 degrees, but it makes printing ABS and PC (Polycarbonate) a breeze. Dual AI cameras for failure detection and flow compensation, a high flow hotend, step-servos on the X, Y, and extruder, smart auto leveling, which taps only the area to be printed on, and the CFS is the easiest loading filament system on the market.

It retails for $999 as a combo with its four-color CFS and can also be purchased separately for $799. It's not quite one of the best 3D printers you can buy, but it's pretty close.

The Creality K2 Pro Combo is built like a tank. Its matte-finished die-cast aluminum frame is solid, and the printer by itself tips the scales at over 50 lbs. The glass door and lid with acrylic side panels allow for good viewing of the print area. The interior is well lit, and the print-monitoring camera provides an excellent view of the action, which can be set to run in full screen from the device tab. The primary camera can also create good-quality time-lapse videos, which is nice, while the second camera focuses on the nozzle for flow adjustment and problem detection. Unfortunately, there is no access to the video of the nozzle camera.

Chamber cooling is provided by a rear-mounted exhaust fan with filtration and a chamber fan mounted near the top rear of the printer. When printing lower-temperature filaments, the chamber fan will kick on whenever the chamber reaches 35 °C. The filtration fan runs continuously. There is a large side-mounted fan for part cooling, and a blower fan mounted on the rear of the tool head. The cooling is good enough to run the printer with the door closed for PLA and PETG, which is a personal pet peeve of mine.

The Core XY motion system is driven by step-servo motors on the X and Y axis, running on a linear rail on the X axis and linear rods on the Y axis. Unlike the usual stepper motors, which are designed to move a certain distance on command, step-servo motors provide feedback on how far they actually move. This allows for greater movement precision and alerts the printer to any problems.

 




The Z axis is driven by a single stepper motor belted to two lead screws, with the bed riding on four linear rods.

The spring steel build plate is single-sided with a textured PEI coating that was nice and sticky from the start. The bed heats up quickly, and the smart-auto leveling only requires the nozzle to tap the area occupied by the print.

The Creality CFS is a well-heeled multicolor system that compares favorably to the Bambu Lab AMS. At this time, it cannot dry filament, but it may be the easiest to load a multicolor system available. The PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) guide tubes make loading effortless, and the filament retracts to within a few inches of the CFS when done printing, making it super easy to swap spools. Creality is still providing extremely short cables to attach the CFS to the printer, which means it can only be set on top of the printer, not next to it on the table. This means powering down and unhooking the cables if you have to take off the lid to get at the tool head.

 




Thankfully, Creality is still using the same “unicorn” style high flow nozzle for the entire K2 line up. It's also compatible with the Creality Hi, so hopefully they've settled on one size going forward for now.

Like the K2 Plus, the K2 Pro has a single filament spool you can bolt to the side if you didn't opt for the CFS or have a spool that doesn't fit inside the box. There is an RFID tag reader on the side of the machine, so it can still read Creality branded filament.

The Core XY motion system can hit acceleration rates of 20,000 mm/s², which is less than the beefy K2 Plus. Rubber feet are included, which help dampen vibrations, though it still jiggles like crazy on some fast prints.

It has the same screen and easy to use menu system as the other core XY printers, with helpful thumbnails supplied by Creality Slicer.

The Creality Filament System (CFS) looks a lot like a Bambu Lab Automatic Material System (AMS), and operates largely the same way. I found it to be much easier to load as there are no stiff buttons to release the feed mechanism tension. It has a similar compartment for desiccant packs to keep filament dry, and a large display on the front of the CFS tells you what the temperature and humidity levels are inside the box. There's no active heating element in the box, so the temperature fluctuations would only be from sitting on a hot printer.

The Creality K2 Pro arrives fully assembled and only needs to be unboxed and unpacked. There are a few well-marked screws to release the CFS and the bed, some foam to remove and some zip ties to cut. The touch screen slots in without tools after the ribbon cable is attached.

 




There is a single spool holder that attaches with 2 m3 screws, and the CFS buffer attaches to the rear with two m3 screws. That just leaves the CFS cables and Bowden tube for completion.

 




 




The Creality K2 Pro Combo has a smart auto leveling program that uses the nozzle to tap the bed only in the area the current print will be using. Full bed auto leveling is part of the initial calibration and can be refreshed from the calibration options if needed.

 




Loading and unloading filament using the CFS is super simple. Insert the filament into the PTFE guide tube and the CFS will take it from there. Once the printer is done with the filament it retracts to a point where it is easily removed. Creality filament will be automatically detected and show up on the printer's screen and in the slicer once you hit the auto mapping option. Other brands of filament will require you to enter the filament type and color from the printer's touch screen.

 




I downloaded Creality Print 6.3 from Creality.com. It is a custom program based on Orca Slicer and Cura. The slicer is fairly intuitive, but not exactly beginner-friendly. Thankfully, the default settings are pretty good as they are, so you don't need to poke around too much.

Creality Print connects to Creality Cloud for both downloading models from Creality's file-sharing site and uploading to your printer. If you don't like the Cloud, you can avoid it by dropping STL files from your computer into the slicer and transferring them to the printer via LAN or using a USB stick.

The interface has a LOT going on, but once you find all the buttons, it's as good as Bambu or OrcaSlicer. The “device tab” is a simplified Klipper screen that shows your printer's file storage, temperatures, motion system, and camera. To access the full Fluidd screen (Klipper UI), type your machine's IP address followed by :4408.

Creality Slicer now allows you to tweak your purge volumes by color as well as the overall “multiplier,” which is a welcome change. You'll need to use caution with tuning light colored filaments, as they still require a hefty purge amount due to the size of the high-flow nozzle.

 




The Creality K2 Pro Combo comes with a partial spool of white Hyper PLA. If you want more colors and materials, you should check out our guide to the best filaments for 3D printing for recommendations.

For the first print, I ran the printer's presliced four-color Benchy, which printed in 35 minutes using Creality's Hyper PLA. The Benchy looks fantastic, as you'd expect from a presliced file.

 




I decided to slice something myself in the same colors. The stock purge volumes and the super long melt zone in the unicorn hotend produce a ton of purge waste, but the results on this four-color Flexi catfish are really, really nice. This file is from FilliFuu on Makerworld. It showed excellent color transition with zero bleed-through going from dark to light colors. A plate of four catfish took 13 and a half hours to print using a .16 layer height and average print speed of 180 mm/s. The result is a very nice print with a nice matte finish using four colors of Creality Hyper PLA.

 




For PETG, I printed something a bit more involved: a kilo's worth of Gridfinity storage for hardware. It took three build plates and 28 hours to print. The print came out very nice, with just a little stringing, using a .2mm layer height and average print speed of 170 mm/s using Prusa Jet Black PETG.

The K2 Pro Combo can print TPU (allegedly, but I have yet to see proof of it. I tried multiple TPU filaments, from hard TPU for AMS from Bambu Lab, to my favorite rainbow TPUs from Inland. The hard TPU print did finish, but the result was an under-extruded mess. Bumping up the flow in the slicer made no difference, nor did running from the external spool holder or directly to the tool head.

(An internet search found that others also have difficulty with TPU on Creality K2 Pro, and some found success, but only if you're willing to replace a spring inside the toolhead.)

 




Thankfully, with the ability to run 300 °C on the nozzle, 110 °C on the bed, and 60 °C in the chamber, the Creality K2 Pro Combo can print the majority of the more technical filaments out there. It prints ABS well, but my favorite, though slightly persnickety, technical filament is Polycarbonate (PC). The CFS cannot dry filament, but it can prevent further moisture absorption if you keep it shut with fresh desiccant packets in place. It did an excellent job printing dry Polymaker Poly Max PC with no warping and excellent bed adhesion.

One of many prints I did in PC is a handy little Utility Blade Scraper. Using a .2 mm layer height and an average speed of 100 mm/s, the scraper took a little under 30 minutes to print, and it is both a pretty and functional print.

 




 




The Creality K2 Pro Combo is a send-it-and-forget-it printer for anything other than TPU. It has Core XY speed and produces excellent quality prints. It's easy to load, levels perfectly, and features dual AI cameras. Retailing for $999, the K2 Pro Combo is not cheap, but it makes up for it with its extra 300 mm³ of “helmet class” build volume.

Ultimately, the K2 Pro Combo lands in a sweet spot: larger and more refined than entry-level machines, but easier to live with than the heavyweight K2 Plus. It's not a revolution, but it's Creality's most polished and capable Core XY to date.

Competition among Core XY printers is getting fierce. If you want more bang for your buck, there's always the smaller 250 x 250 x 250 mm Anycubic Kobra S1 Combo on sale for $459, or the Bambu Lab P1S Combo, which has been marked down to $549 on the anticipation of the P2S launch in the US. If you want an even bigger color Core XY, check out the Bambu Lab H2S with a 340 x 320 x 340 mm print volume for $1,499.

Welcome, my name's Splave, or Allen Golibersuch, and I am a professional overclocker. You may have read some of my previous articles on Tom's Hardware, or spotted me in a YouTube video or two. In this column, I will delve into extreme overclocking and muse about what it's like to run your own bespoke system integrator business. But first of all, if you're not acquainted with who I am or what I do, here's an introduction.

For me, overclocking started as just a hobby, but a fairly serious one. I would jet across the world to events like Computex and other live events, winning or placing across overclocking competitions. Unfortunately, not many places or people were willing to pay folks to overclock hardware. Shocking, I know. After some experimentation with launching my own bespoke PC, I knew that I didn't ever want to just sell normal PCs. I wanted to make performance computers that are better than what's out there for a similar price, where my overclocking talents could be used as an added benefit, not merely a pricing burden.

 




That's when a company I had a long-time relationship with approached me, and asked if they could take a percentage share of ownership and invest in launching my own brand of PCs. It all initially started as a very boutique operation, but eventually rolled over into a full-on system integrator, which is where I am today. Do you know how many Fractal Design cases you can fit into a garage? Asking for a friend.

Anyway, at this point, building and tinkering with PCs isn't just my hobby, or my work, it's my love. I hope you enjoy the forthcoming columns on Tom's Hardware Premium, where I get a chance to stretch my legs and wax lyrical about the things I love.

For the inaugural edition of Splave's Cave, I pick apart a very special graphics card, the Asus ROG Astral RTX 5090. Yes, the 5090 came out months ago, and yes, there is a gold version, which I sadly do not own. But while the GPU I'm using isn't made of real gold, it's capable of capturing world-record gold. Here's how I set a 3DMark Port Royal World Record. Don't catch your fingers on that silicon, because it's about to get cold.

 




While I hate to be late to the party, a lot of work goes into overclocking top-tier hardware. Luckily, Asus has crafted an incredibly performant graphics card, with excellent R&D and overclocking departments that work hard on providing workarounds for the protections that any GPU might have. Yeah, those protections, the ones that make sure that the cards don't go boom or catch fire. We're finally in a place where those protections have extended far enough that we can pull out some wild performance from these GPUs at sub-ambient temperatures.

But, there is one thing: You can't try this specific technique at home. I am using a special, non-public BIOS for the GPU that offers a much higher power limit than the standard one would allow. I want to be fully transparent about this, and I'm sorry, but if you want to acquire the BIOS, it's not mine to give out. With that in mind, I know what I am doing, and I am fully prepared to smoke an incredibly expensive graphics card.

 




Equipped with the bespoke BIOS, another challenge awaits. Even if the GPU's standard power limits are removed, thermal limits remain a bottleneck. If you let your card get super hot, it's going to still lower its clock speed in an attempt to avoid outright failure. So, this bespoke BIOS with its extended power limits is practically useless without sub-ambient cooling. For the standard OC BIOS, there's plenty of headroom, which the ROG Astral RTX 5090's cooler is equipped to handle; many cards can run +2000 MHz memory speeds without additional cooling, which is a feat of engineering in itself.

Simply put, the card is incredible. I've been doing this for a long time, and Asus' latest effort is head-and-shoulders above the next-best card I have touched. I'm not trying to wax lyrical about Asus because I am ""glazing,"" as the kids like to say; they've really earned it, and I have nothing negative to say about it at all. The GPU is heavy because the cooler is so well designed. It commands a pricing premium because the components used within it are premium. It runs quietly and looks elegant and discreet. The Asus ROG Astral 5090 just shows up and does work; it's a real powerhouse of a GPU.

Despite all of that fantastic engineering and being equipped with a custom BIOS, the GPU hates being cold. When using liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling, the ROG Astral RTX 5090 starts misbehaving at around -10°C to -20°C. By misbehaving, I mean that the screen goes black, the system hangs, and you have to wait until the card is above 0°C before you can boot it back into Windows — otherwise known as a 'cold bug.'

This is one of those situations where I just have to take a step back, take a deep breath, turn around toward my punching bag, and away from the expensive electronics, to let off some steam for a few minutes.

But, not liking the cold isn't an issue specific to Asus' ROG Astral 5090; it's an Nvidia issue. The RTX 5090 die itself doesn't like being cold, with users of other brands reporting similar experiences. Situations like this make me feel like we could really use a Kingpin right about now. He always had a way to finesse Nvidia into fixing cold bug issues, which isn't something a basement hobbyist can achieve.

 




But, with that being said, the ROG Astral RTX 5090 can still pull off some pretty impressive feats, without reaching extremely cold temperatures; this card could hit core clock speeds of 3600MHz+.

For comparison, the Asus ROG Matrix 4090, the first GPU to run at over 4 GHz, required cooling down to -190°C to accomplish that feat. Now, just imagine if the RTX 5090 could come close to running at those temperatures, it would simply be absurd. I know that Asus is exploring ways to overcome the cold limits of the RTX 5090 die, and I'll keep testing the new BIOSes they send my way. Hopefully, any amount of additional cold temperature tolerance will yield even greater results.

 




Meanwhile, with the card safely idling at -20°C, the ROG Astral RTX 5090 demands over 1,000 watts of power when you start a benchmark. This spikes the temperature from -20°C to +10°C instantly, and that's with a five-pound copper pot filled with LN2 attached to it. Whatever the case may be with the cold, the GPU has significant thermal demands, given the amount of power it's sucking up.

This can be tricky to maintain throughout the benchmarking process. If the benchmark ends before you taper down on pouring the LN2, it will drop from +20°C all the way to -50°C instantly when there is no load. That means more black screens, more time waiting to get it back to 0°C, and yes, you'll have to start over and attempt the benchmark again. Needless to say, that punching bag I mentioned earlier is getting a lot of use.

 




Regardless of all those headaches, once you manage to figure out the perfect cocktail of pouring the LN2 throughout the benchmark, and you see the score pop up, it makes the entire effort worthwhile. After a good amount of trial and error, I was able to set a 3DMark Port Royal record with a score over 48,000. A standard RTX 5090 usually achieves around 35,000.

Additionally, I achieved the GPUPI 32B world record and both Unigine Superposition records with the 1080p and 8K configs. These were achieved a little while ago, so it's likely that you'll spot me elsewhere on the leaderboards, too.

That about wraps it up for the first edition of Splave's Cave on Tom's Hardware Premium. Coming up next will be a guide on how to actually set yourself up for extreme overclocking, with a similar setup to the images posted in the article. Keep your eyes peeled, and thanks for reading.

He shares his insights into the latest processors with Tom's Hardware readers from a hardcore, push-it-to-the-limit overclocker's perspective.

Low-cost remote management device shipped with an active audio recording pipeline.

A Slovenian security researcher has published an analysis of Sipeed's NanoKVM that raises far-reaching concerns about the €30-€60 ($35-70) remote management device. Alarmingly, the researcher's teardown shows the device ships with a catalogue of security failures and an undocumented microphone that can be activated over SSH.

The compact RISC-V board, which arrived on the market last year as a budget alternative to PiKVM, offers HDMI capture, USB HID emulation, remote power control, and browser-based access to a connected PC. It is beginning to show up in IT environments precisely because it requires no software on the target machine and can operate from BIOS to OS install.

The researcher says the device's software stack exposes weak points from the moment it boots. Early units arrived with a pre-set password and open SSH access, a problem the researcher reported to Sipeed and which the company later corrected. The web interface still lacks basic protections, including CSRF defence and any mechanism to invalidate active sessions.

More troubling, the encryption key used to protect login passwords in the browser is hardcoded and identical across all devices. According to the researcher, this had to be explained to the developers “multiple times” before they acknowledged the issue.

 




The NanoKVM's network behavior raises further questions, as it routes DNS queries through Chinese servers by default and makes routine connections to Sipeed infrastructure to fetch updates and a closed-source binary component. The key verifying that component is stored in plain text on the device, and there is no integrity check for downloaded firmware.

The underlying Linux build is also a heavily pared-down image without common management tools, yet it includes tcpdump and aircrack, utilities normally associated with packet inspection and wireless testing rather than production hardware intended to sit on privileged networks.

All this, paired with the discovery of a tiny surface-mount microphone, should make any user suspicious of the device's true intentions. The researcher says the microphone is not documented in product materials, yet the operating system includes ALSA tools such as amixer and arecord that can activate it immediately. With default SSH credentials still present on many deployed units, the researcher demonstrated that audio could be recorded and exfiltrated with minimal effort, and streaming that audio in real time would require only modest additional scripting.

Thankfully, because NanoKVM is nominally open source, community members have begun porting alternative Linux distributions, first on Debian and later Ubuntu. Reflashing requires opening the case and writing a new image to the internal microSD card, but early builds already support Sipeed's modified KVM code. Physically removing the microphone is possible, though the component's size and placement make it a fiddly job without magnification.

When CPU and motherboard platforms started to turn towards DDR5, it soon became one of the most expensive parts to buy, and put a lot of early adopters off switching to the newer platforms like AM5. It's funny how this RAM-pocalypse has turned full circle, with RAM prices up in the stratosphere due to market conditions and the AI juggernaut sucking up the silicon. Not so much a deal, but more of a public service announcement, the cheapest 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5-6000 RAM kit available is available at Best Buy. Crucial's Pro Overclocking 32GB RAM kit is $273.99. If you need DDR5 RAM, get it fast, as the prices only continue to rise, and indications are that this isn't a blip.

For the foreseeable future, RAM price increases are here to stay, whether we like it or not. Waiting just a few weeks has seen RAM prices rise higher and higher, with no end in sight. With large memory manufacturers like Crucial pulling out of the consumer market, the future is looking very grim indeed for PC enthusiasts looking to build computers. A lack of supply and extortionate prices for what RAM is left on the shelves are going to drive up the costs of any build. Earlier in the year, I was spotting deals on similar RAM kits for between $80-$100 for 32GB. It's not a pretty picture when you see how much the prices have risen on sites like PC Partpicker, where you can visually see the upward price trends in their charts.

This 32GB DDR5-6000 RAM kit consists of 2x16GB sticks that have a 6000MHz speed, and timings of  36-38-38-80, with a CAS latency of 36. 

Crucial's Pro Overclocking 32GB DDR5-6000 RAM kit consists of 2x16GB sticks that have a 6000MHz speed. They aren't the flashiest or fastest RAM sticks available, but they do come with timings of 36-38-38-80 and a CAS latency of 36. The kit is AMD EXPO and Intel XMP ready with profiles ready to set in your BIOS, and 6000MHz is also the sweet-spot for AM5 CPUs. The heat spreader is black and simple, with no RGB lighting in sight.

Walking aid training provided by physiotherapists in the emergency department (ED) improved mobility and reduced fear of falling in adults aged 65 years or older at 90 days post-discharge, a trial showed. The addition of telemonitoring provided no significant additional benefit compared with walking aid training alone.

""In this randomized clinical trial, provision of walking aids with training by a physiotherapist in the ED improved mobility, fear of falling, gait, functionality, and cognition in older adults at 90 days,"" the authors wrote. ""While telemonitoring did not demonstrate incremental benefit, these findings support the integration of specialized geriatric assessment and intervention in the ED to optimize functional recovery following discharge,"" they added.

The study was led by Fernanda Sato Polesel, PT, Hospital Sírio-Libanês, São Paulo, Brazil. It was published online on November 21, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The study was limited by its single-center design and the inability to blind participants due to the obvious nature of the intervention.

This study was funded by the Advanced Geriatrics Center and Instituto de Ensino e Pesquisa, Hospital Sirio-Libanés. One author reported receiving grant support from the Alzheimer's Association outside the submitted work.

The combination of the cardiovascular risk score (CVRS) and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) improved risk stratification for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), offering a potentially valuable approach for routine clinical practice.

“These scores could be implemented in routine clinical practice (especially now with the implementation of lung cancer screening with chest CT in COPD patients) in order to identify patients who might benefit from invasive testing or more intensive primary preventive measures,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Juan P. de-Torres, MD, Pulmonary Department, Clínica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain. It was published online on October 14, 2025, in Chest.

The cohort primarily consisted of male patients. All sites were in Spain (a region with a low risk for MACE); hence, the findings may not be generalizable to non‑European populations or to populations with a higher risk for MACE. The observational design precluded causal inference. Exacerbation and medication were not systematically recorded, which could have confounded the associations.

This study did not receive any funding, and no conflicts of interest were reported.

Long-term isotretinoin therapy in patients with acne was not associated with an increased risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in a study that also found transient lipid elevations with treatment.

The study results “provide reassurance that isotretinoin is not a trigger for IBD and that its gastrointestinal safety profile is favorable,” the authors of the study concluded. “Continued laboratory monitoring during therapy remains appropriate, particularly for lipids,” they added, “but long-term concerns about IBD risk appear unsupported.”

The study was led by Neal Gupta, MD, Dermatology Service, Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System – Brooklyn Campus, and the State University of New York Downstate Health Sciences University, both in Brooklyn, New York. It was published online on November 25 in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology.

The study limitations included observational design, reliance on the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases codes, lack of individual chart validation, and residual unmeasured bias.

The authors reported having no disclosures, and no funding was received for the study.

The presence of a positive chronic urticaria index, low blood histamine content, or both low immunoglobulin (Ig) E content and low blood histamine content in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) was associated with an increased likelihood of nonresponse to omalizumab at 12 weeks. Among patients with all three negative biopredictors, 69% had poor symptom control.

“Although some patients with negative biomarkers may still respond, these biomarkers provide useful context for guiding shared therapeutic decision-making with patients, particularly as new therapeutic options continue to emerge,” the authors of the study wrote.

Sarbjit S. Saini, MD, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on November 28 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

The study was limited by variation in background antihistamine therapy across trials, which may have confounded associations; the lack of data on omalizumab updosing, which prevented the assessment of higher‑dose efficacy or predictors of response to updosing; and the use of UAS7 ≤ 6 (rather than UAS7 = 0) combined with overlapping baseline biopredictors, which may have overstated clinical control and hindered the determination of the independent predictive value.

The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

The growing pressure on global food systems has intensified the interest in sustainable protein sources. Four insect species have been authorized as novel foods in the EU following safety evaluations by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

These authorizations allow insect-derived products to be placed on the EU market in specified forms, including frozen, dried, and powdered, under defined conditions of use.

Approvals have renewed attention to the potential role of insect-based proteins in aging populations, sports nutrition, and dietary diversification, while also highlighting the economic, safety, and allergenicity issues that will shape their wider adoption.

Insects are increasingly being considered as alternative protein sources. While consumption in Europe remains limited, edible insects are part of established diets in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, including Mexico, Brazil, India, Thailand, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Four insect species have been authorized as novel foods under Regulation (EU) 2015/2283, following the scientific opinions issued by the EFSA.

Tenebrio molitor, the yellow mealworm, received its EFSA opinion in January 2021; Acheta domesticus, the house cricket, in August 2021; Locusta migratoria, the migratory locust, in July 2021; and Alphitobius diaperinus, the lesser mealworm, in July 2022.

These opinions formed the basis for European Commission authorizations and reflected the EU's structured approach to assessing insects as novel foods, with a particular focus on safety, processing methods, allergenic potential, and labelling requirements.

A recent study published in Food Science and Nutrition examined the performance of insect-based ingredients in consumer foods.

Speaking with Univadis Spain, part of the Medscape Professional Network, Marta Ros-Baró, a researcher at the NUTRALiSS Research Group, Faculty of Health Sciences, Open University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, described the nutritional profile and said, “Insect protein is a high biological value protein source rich in essential amino acids, but also in healthy fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals (such as iron and zinc). In addition, it offers an excellent protein/fat ratio and high digestibility.”

Approved species contain 48%-67% protein by dry weight, 21-39% fat with meaningful levels of unsaturated fatty acids, and significant concentrations of vitamins and minerals.

Ros-Baró added “T molitor stands out for its high nutritional value, especially its high-quality protein content, with all the essential amino acids necessary for the human body, making it comparable to traditional sources like meat or eggs. Furthermore, its healthy fats include polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, which are key for cardiovascular and brain health, as well as monounsaturated fats that can help lower cholesterol. It is also a good source of minerals, such as iron, zinc, and calcium, and vitamins, such as B12 and riboflavin.”

Insects also provide dietary fiber in the form of chitin, a structural polysaccharide of the exoskeleton, which distinguishes insect-based foods from other animal-derived ingredients.

The project incorporated T molitor protein, supplied as flour or hydrolysate, into pasteurized dairy products and brownies to evaluate their sensory acceptance. This study represents the first systematic taste testing of insect-enriched foods in the Mediterranean region.

In the dairy tasting, 21 adults older than 60 years evaluated pasteurized dairy products enriched with T molitor flour and flavored with hazelnut, vanilla, or a combination of both. The hazelnut and vanilla formulations received high ratings.

The second tasting was used to assess the enriched solid products. Twenty-five participants 19-73 years of age evaluated three brownie formulations: one made with insect flour alone, one incorporating flour and yogurt, and one combining flour with insect protein hydrolysate. The formulation containing both flour and hydrolysate received the highest ratings, with participants noting a softer and more pleasant texture. This version also improved the protein-to-lipid ratio without reducing the sensory appeal compared with conventional brownies.

A central finding of this study is that consumer acceptance depends strongly on how insect protein is incorporated.

In a press release, Ros-Baró said, “These results confirm that not all forms of insect protein have the same potential. The way they are incorporated into consumer products is key to obtaining foods that are not only sustainable and nutritious but also highly valued.”

Earlier studies have shown that insect flour is more readily accepted than whole insects because it can be easily integrated into familiar foods. Hydrolysates obtained through enzymatic or acid hydrolysis offer another option for developing functional, nutrient-dense products with favorable sensory qualities.

Researchers are investigating the use of T molitorflour in cookies for postexercise studies because of its high protein content and rich mineral profile, which can aid in muscle recovery and enhance nutrition. “We want to expand the research with a larger sample to corroborate the results of the pilot study.” The study will compare blood markers and anthropometric changes in individuals consuming insect-enriched cookies compared with those consuming conventional cookies after exercise, said Ros-Baró.

According to Ros-Baró, insect protein-enriched foods may be useful for groups with higher protein needs, including older adults and athletes.

She also highlighted the potential to modulate the nutritional profile of insects through their diet. For example, modifying the insect diet may enrich it with beneficial fatty acids or other bioactive compounds, allowing tailored nutritional profiles in foods made from insect-derived ingredients.

Regarding fiber, Ros-Baró said, “Chitin, present in the exoskeleton, is considered a form of dietary fiber, although it differs from plant fiber. Some studies suggest that chitin may have prebiotic effects, promote microbiota diversity, and support the growth of beneficial bacteria. Combining chitin with plant fiber may produce complementary effects and potentially additional digestive benefits.”

Despite this promise, several challenges remain. “There are still economic challenges. The industry remains in its early stages, and limited production volumes increase the cost of processing, including breeding, harvesting, drying, and converting insects into powders. There are also risks, such as potential contaminants, including heavy metals and microbes; allergenicity, particularly cross reactivity with crustacean allergens; and the need to ensure food safety through appropriate regulatory measures.”

Recent literature reviews have identified numerous bioactive compounds in insects, including those with antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, antihypertensive, and antilipidemic properties. Research in this field is expected to expand significantly in the future.

The study authors, including Ros Baró, reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

A 29-year-old woman, a psychiatric hospital resident with schizoaffective disorder, developed toxic megacolon while on clozapine. She presented with 24 hours of delirium, altered mental status, and a distended, painful abdomen.

This case highlights the severe and rare complication of toxic megacolon in a patient with treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder treated with clozapine.

The patient with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder presented to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of delirium, altered mental status, and a painful, distended abdomen while on a regular diet.

Her psychotropic regimen included clozapine 300 mg at bedtime, which is associated with anticholinergic effects such as constipation and gastrointestinal hypomotility — a known risk factor for bowel obstruction and toxic megacolon — along with glycopyrrolate 1 mg three times daily, a potent anticholinergic further increasing gut dysmotility risk.

Additional medications included haloperidol 100 mg intramuscular every 4 weeks, divalproex sodium 500 mg every morning and 750 mg every night, topiramate 50 mg twice daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, famotidine 20 mg twice daily, and loratadine as needed.

Initial physical examination revealed abdominal distension, tenderness, hypotension, and altered mental status. Abdominal x-ray demonstrated marked colonic dilation and loss of haustral markings, consistent with toxic megacolon, prompting admission for acute abdominal emergency management.

On admission, the patient was confused, hypotensive (blood pressure [BP], 85/50 mm Hg), and tachypnoeic (28 breaths/min). She was intubated for mechanical ventilation and started on norepinephrine (5 µg/min) for BP support. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics included vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours) and piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 8 hours); emergent decompressive laparotomy revealed a massively dilated colon filled with solid stool, followed postoperatively by abdominal compartment syndrome requiring ICU monitoring.

On hospital day 2, exploratory laparotomy revealed diffuse colonic necrosis, necessitating total colectomy; the patient returned to the ICU with an open abdomen. Persistent hypotension was managed with vasopressin (0.03 U/min) and norepinephrine titration; antifungal therapy with micafungin (100 mg daily) and voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours) was initiated for suspected fungal superinfection.

Throughout the hospital stay, severe hypoxia from bronchial mucus plugging required bronchoscopy with suctioning. Additional complications included small bowel obstruction, thrombosis of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava and superior mesenteric vein, volume overload managed with furosemide infusion 10 mg/h, and pulmonary embolism on CT imaging treated with heparin infusion 18 U/kg/h.

Despite maximal supportive care over the next 2 weeks, including paralytics for hypoxia and escalating antimicrobials, the patient's condition deteriorated, with multiple bradycardic/asystolic arrests by hospital day 19.

Following family discussions, care transitioned to a do-not-resuscitate status; she died on hospital day 20 from bronchopulmonary pneumonia complicated by large bowel obstruction, sepsis, and multiorgan dysfunction.

Clozapine remains the gold standard therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with robust evidence supporting its superiority over other agents, despite significant adverse effects from its broad receptor profile.

Haematologic complications such as agranulocytosis are well known and closely monitored, yet gastrointestinal hypomotility is less recognised but clinically important. This patient's presentation implicated clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility as the aetiology of severe colonic dilation, distinct from typical associations with inflammatory bowel disease or infectious colitis.

Toxic megacolon is characterised by acute colonic distension with severe toxicity and high perforation risk; though uncommon, it carries substantial mortality and morbidity, with limited literature.

Clozapine's mechanism involves anticholinergic and serotonergic effects inhibiting gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction and peristalsis, plus antagonism of muscarinic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic receptors impairing colonic motility and transit, underlying high constipation prevalence and predisposition to complications, such as toxic megacolon. Concomitant glycopyrrolate may have a compounded risk, but clozapine is most consistently linked in the literature.

Clozapine is effective for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. Haematologic complications such as agranulocytosis are well recognised and routinely monitored, but gastrointestinal hypomotility receives less attention despite its clinical importance. Evidence shows that laxatives can significantly shorten colonic transit time in people taking clozapine and reduce medication-related hypomotility.

 December 08, 2025  

Wider use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), glycemic management during cancer treatment, and individualized dosing of obesity drugs in people with diabetes are just a few of the new topics and major updates in the American Diabetes Association (ADA)'s Standards of Care in Diabetes - 2026.

Also new in 2026 are recommendations to remove certain treatment requirements for coverage of insulin pump therapy, along with new guidance on treatment of obesity in type 1 diabetes (T1D); use of glucose-lowering therapies for indications including heart, kidney, and liver protection; nutrition for type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention; and management of older adults with both diabetes types.

ADA updates its guidelines every year, which “means we are very current with the evidence base,” Raveendhara Bannuru, MD, PhD, ADA vice president of medical affairs and lead author of the guidelines, told Medscape Medical News.

“We are also pragmatic,” he added. “We don't try to come up with recommendations that cannot be easily implemented in the clinic.”

In addition to trying to improve and streamline care for individuals with diabetes, some of the guidelines are “aimed at working with policy people” to help change policy and increase coverage, said Bannuru.

The summary of revisions for 2026 spans seven pages. These are among the highlights:

Wider CGM use. ADA now recommends CGM use at diabetes onset and anytime thereafter to improve outcomes for anyone who could benefit from it and not just those using insulin or who are at a risk for hypoglycemia.

“We're not saying everybody should be put on CGM, but technology has come a very long way, and now the evidence base is more robust to advocate for greater access. The evidence has shown that CGM can improve glycemic management, not just in individuals on insulin therapy,” said Bannuru. 

“We were making a kind of soft recommendation, but we wanted to open the doors for policy makers to please think about covering these for whoever is eligible,” he explained.

Glycemic management during cancer treatment. Entirely new guidance has been added for managing people with diabetes who initiate cancer treatment or those who develop hyperglycemia from such treatments, including mTOR inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, and glucocorticoids. Recommendations address glucose monitoring of people initiating these drugs, along with the use of metformin as first-line treatment for cancer drug-induced hyperglycemia, and consideration of insulin therapy for more severe hyperglycemia. For people with preexisting diabetes, the guidance addresses dose adjustment of all glucose-lowering therapies as needed.

“There's a lot of emerging evidence about hyperglycemia due to chemotherapy. We're getting consults from our oncology and primary care colleagues saying things like they have a patient who didn't have diabetes before, but suddenly now their glucose level is 250 [mg/dL],” Bannuru told Medscape Medical News.

“In some cases, these newer cancer therapies are altering immune pathways and showing up as type 1 diabetes,” he said. “We thought it was important to provide some guidance.”

Obesity management. Several new recommendations fall under this heading, both for diabetes prevention and treatment. These include the addition of an adiposity measure in addition to BMI for screening, the need to individualize dosing and dose titration of obesity medications, and inclusion of GLP-1 agonists or metabolic surgery as options for people with T1D and obesity.

There are “a lot of issues with tolerability and adverse events” with anti-obesity medications, so dosing “has to be a gradual, stepwise titration,” said Bannuru. “Some individuals might benefit from a slower rate than recommended by the manufacturer, and some may not need the full maximum approved dose. We want to optimize medication-taking behavior.”

And for T1D, he noted, the hope is that the GLP-1 drug labels will remove the current contraindication for diabetes treatment in this population. Until then, the obesity formulations, that is, Wegovy and Zepbound, can be prescribed as adjuncts to insulin for those with obesity.

Removal of pump prerequisites. A new recommendation calls for removal of requirements for C-peptide levels, presence of islet autoantibodies, or duration of insulin treatment before initiation of pump or automated insulin delivery therapy. Medicare and some other plans still impose such requirements.

“These things are not associated with responsiveness to these technologies. We're trying to advocate for more access,” Bannuru commented.

Other 2026 updates include new recommendations for the use of nutrition — including the Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate eating patterns — to prevent T2D and additional guidance on the use of glucose-lowering drugs for indications beyond obesity and diabetes, such as those affecting the heart, kidney, and liver.

For older adults, new recommendations address CGM use, blood pressure targets, physical activity, protein intake, and treatment modification. New perioperative guidance advises an A1c goal of < 8% or time in range > 50% prior to elective surgery and a glucose target of 100-180 mg/dL during surgery.

The 2026 Standards have picked up two new endorsements from other professional organizations. The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research approved the section on bone health, and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes approved ADA's guidance on children and adolescence. Endorsement of relevant sections from previous years continues from the American College of Cardiology, The Obesity Society, the American Geriatrics Society, and the National Kidney Foundation.

Bannuru reported being employed by the ADA. He reported having no further disclosures.

TORONTO — GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) have transformed diabetes and obesity management, offering improvements in glycemic control and weight loss and reductions in cardiometabolic risk.

But “an emerging concern of these therapies is the unintended loss of skeletal muscle mass, which has important implications for metabolic health, physical function, and long-term outcomes,” said Jenna Gillen, PhD, assistant professor of exercise physiology at the University of Toronto, Toronto.

Gillan moderated a session mitigating muscle loss at the Diabetes Canada and Canadian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism (CSEM) Professional Conference 2025.

In mouse studies, the pronounced weight loss due to GLP-1s “seems to be explained to a large extent by reductions in food intake, at least during the initial week or two,” David Wright, PhD, professor of kinesiology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said during the session's first presentation. “Importantly, we see exactly the same thing clinically as well.”

A 2021 study published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism found that semaglutide reduced food intake in people with type 2 diabetes and affected appetite and food preference, including by shifting participants away from consumption of sweet or high-fat foods. “There seems to be an effect on both the total amount of calories that individuals are eating and the type of calories,” he said.

Daniel Moore, PhD, professor of muscle physiology at the University of Toronto, emphasized in his presentation that muscle breakdown is a natural process and is balanced out by muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, “what you eat and when you eat it matters for your muscles, especially around the importance of dietary protein,” he said.

He emphasized that each meal is an opportunity to rebuild muscle lost during fasting, also pointing out that muscle protein synthesis lasts for about 4-6 hours after a meal. Therefore, eating protein-rich meals or snacks throughout the day can help maintain muscle mass.

In addition, muscle breakdown is particularly high in the morning after sleep because of the longer fasting period. This finding makes breakfast a key opportunity to rebuild muscle with a protein-rich meal.

When it comes to muscle protein synthesis, not all amino acids used to build that protein are equal. Protein synthesis is “driven almost exclusively by the essential amino acids found in the protein food,” said Moore. “If we give people just the essential amino acids, we get a very similar [protein synthesis] response as if we gave them a complete protein.”

Animal sources of protein contain complete proteins, or all essential amino acids, so people who eat those regularly are likely to get enough essential amino acids. In contrast, some foods in plant-based diets may be deficient in certain amino acids, which means combining things like “beans and rice will allow for a more complete protein mixture,” said Moore.

Other factors can affect muscle protein synthesis. For example, “the obese state…can make the muscle resistant to the food that we eat,” said Moore. “We have to correct for that, which will occur through weight loss.”

Similarly, “as we age, we get less responsive to the food that we eat,” he said, older adults “need more protein in the meal” to get to the same protein saturation point as young individuals.

In addition to consuming sufficient complete protein, “physical activity has to be considered when talking about efficiency of food intake,” said Moore. “In my view, the only way to minimize this loss of muscle mass that we get with diet or incretin-based therapies is to be active.”

Moore said that walking 8000 steps per day is a good low-impact activity. As for resistance exercise, it doesn't need to involve working at your maximum effort. Using lighter weights and doing 20-25 repetitions can be just as effective for preserving muscle mass as seven or eight repetitions of heavier weights, which could predispose an individual to muscle injury, he said.

Peminda K. Cabandugama, MD, DABOM, internal medicine and obesity medicine specialist at the Cleveland Clinic and spokesperson for the Obesity Society, commented on these topics for Medscape News Canada.

Muscle loss is always a concern when it comes to weight loss, whether it is driven by diet or GLP-1s, he said. Muscle loss is a particular concern for older patients, who may be prone to sarcopenic obesity (ie, the simultaneous presence of sarcopenia and excess body fat).

To mitigate the effects of muscle loss, Cabandugama recommends aiming for at least 35 g of protein per meal or around 0.4 g of protein per kg of body mass. Older adults may require more.

Regarding exercise, people should meet the US physical activity guidelines of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity and at least 2 days per week of strength training, he said. “Diet and exercise continue to be the foundation that the long-term success of weight management stands on,” said Cabandugama.

Wright, Moore, and Cabandugama reported having no relevant financial relationships.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Social media affects children's ability to concentrate, study reveals","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251208/Social-media-affects-childrens-ability-to-concentrate-study-reveals.aspx","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 11:02:00 GMT","

Children who spend a significant amount of time on social media tend to experience a gradual decline in their ability to concentrate. This is according to a comprehensive study from Karolinska Institutet, published in Pediatrics Open Science, where researchers followed more than 8,000 children from around age 10 through age 14.

The use of screens and digital media has risen sharply in the past 15 years, coinciding with an increase in ADHD diagnoses in Sweden and elsewhere. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Oregon Health & Science University in the USA have now investigated a possible link between screen habits and ADHD-related symptoms.The study followed 8,324 children aged 9-10 in the USA for four years, with the children reporting how much time they spent on social media, watching TV/videos and playing video games, and their parents assessing their levels of attention and hyperactivity/impulsiveness.

Children who spent a significant amount of time on social media platforms, such as Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter or Messenger, gradually developed inattention symptoms; there was no such association, however, for watching television or playing video games.

Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children's ability to concentrate. Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.""

Torkel Klingberg, professor of cognitive neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet

The association was not influenced by socioeconomic background or a genetic predisposition towards ADHD. Additionally, children who already had symptoms of inattentiveness did not start to use social media more, which suggests that the association leads from use to symptoms and not vice versa.The researchers found no increase in hyperactive/impulsive behaviour. The effect on concentration was small at the individual level. At a population level, however, it could have a significant impact.""Greater consumption of social media might explain part of the increase we're seeing in ADHD diagnoses, even if ADHD is also associated with hyperactivity, which didn't increase in our study,"" says Professor Klingberg.

The researchers stress that the results do not imply that all children who use social media develop concentration difficulties, but there is reason to discuss age limits and platform design. In the study, the average time spent on social media rose from approximately 30 minutes a day for 9-year-olds to 2.5 hours for 13-year-olds, despite the fact that many platforms set their minimum age requirement at 13.""We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children's cognitive development,"" says the study's first author Samson Nivins, postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet.The researchers now plan to follow the children after the age of 14 to see if this association holds.The study was financed by the Swedish Research Council and the Masonic Home for Children in Stockholm Foundation.

According to a new study, lower doses of approved immunotherapy for malignant melanoma can give better results against tumors, while reducing side effects. This is reported by researchers at Karolinska Institutet in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

The results are highly interesting in oncology, as we show that a lower dose of an immunotherapy drug, in addition to causing significantly fewer side effects, actually gives better results against tumors and longer survival.""

Hildur Helgadottir, last author, researcher at the Department of Oncology-Pathology at Karolinska Institutet

The traditional dose of nivolumab and ipilimumab is the one that is approved and established. Due to the extensive side effects, Sweden has increasingly begun to use a treatment regimen with a lower dose of ipilimumab, which is the most expensive part of this immunotherapy and causes the most side effects.

""In Sweden, we have greater freedom to choose doses for patients, while in many other countries, due to reimbursement policies, they are restricted by the doses approved by the drug authorities,"" says Hildur Helgadottir.

The study included nearly 400 patients with advanced, inoperable malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. The study shows that the regimen with the lower dose of ipilimumab is more effective, with a higher proportion of patients responding to treatment, 49 percent, compared to the traditional dose, 37 percent.

Progression-free survival, the time the patient lives without the disease worsening, was a median of nine months for the lower dose, compared to three months for the traditional dose. Overall survival was also longer, 42 months compared to 14 months.

Serious side effects were seen in 31 percent of patients in the low-dose group, compared to 51 percent in the traditional group.

""The new immunotherapies are very valuable and effective, but at the same time they can cause serious side effects that are sometimes life-threatening or chronic. Our results suggest that this lower dosage may enable more patients to continue the treatment for a longer time, which is likely to contribute to the improved results and longer survival,"" says Hildur Helgadottir.

There were some differences between the two treatment groups, but even after adjusting for several factors such as age and tumor stage, the better outcome for the lower dose of ipilimumab remained. The study is a retrospective observational study and therefore it is not possible to definitively establish a causal relationship.

The study was conducted in collaboration with the Sahlgrenska Comprehensive Cancer Center at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and was funded by the Cancer Foundation, Region Stockholm, and the Radiumhemmet Research Fund.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Virtual diet and exercise program shows promise in reducing lymphoma treatment side effects","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251207/Virtual-diet-and-exercise-program-shows-promise-in-reducing-lymphoma-treatment-side-effects.aspx","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 02:47:00 GMT","

Patients undergoing treatment for lymphoma often experience adverse side effects that can be so severe that they stop or slow treatment. But a new study shows that a virtual program focusing on diet and exercise is a feasible strategy for minimizing the side effects of cancer therapies and increasing treatment retention.

Early findings from the LIFE-L study will be presented on behalf of the multidisciplinary team by Melissa Lopez, Ph.D., RDN, at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting in Orlando. Lopez is a postdoctoral associate in the CRANE Lab at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

""A lot of the work that has been done in the area of lifestyle and oncology has been in the prevention setting or in the survivorship setting after treatment,"" said Lopez, who explained that there is a significant lack of data on how lifestyle during treatment may impact treatment outcomes.

For the trial, the research team-led by Tracy Crane, Ph.D., RDN, co-lead of the Cancer Control Program and director of lifestyle medicine, prevention and digital health at Sylvester, and Craig Moskowitz, M.D., Sylvester director of academic clinician development-72 individuals were recruited and received standard, six-cycle combination chemotherapy regimens for lymphoma.

""Our goal with LIFE-L is to show that lifestyle interventions aren't just for prevention or post-treatment-they can make a real difference during treatment. If we can help patients feel stronger and reduce side effects, we're not only improving quality of life, we're supporting them in completing all of their prescribed therapy, which is critical for outcomes,"" said Crane.

Forty-four of those patients received immediate access to a virtual diet and exercise program designed to help them maintain their fitness and reduce the burden of side effects so that they can tolerate their prescribed cancer treatment regimen. Twenty-eight participants were placed on a waitlist control group to allow for comparison with the intervention group.

The program included weekly online coaching sessions with a registered dietitian and an exercise physiologist throughout chemotherapy. The sessions were individualized to each patient's needs.

We first needed to evaluate if it's feasible to do this, before even attempting to see the effects on the patients and their outcomes. We had to ask, 'Could patients do this while they're receiving treatment?' We can offer it all day long, but are people going to want to be a part of it? Are they able to physically and mentally be in the headspace that they want to do this?""

Melissa Lopez, Ph.D., RDN

Not only did 81% of the eligible patients enroll in the program, but the research team found that attendance rates were high. Diet sessions had 86% attendance and exercise sessions 81%.

Those in the intervention group reported lower rates of various symptoms, including anxiety (17% vs. 34% for the waitlist group), depression (46% vs. 67%), pain (22% vs. 39%), fatigue (46% vs. 67%), and constipation (17% vs. 25%). Additionally, participants in the program demonstrated greater grip strength and outperformed waitlisted individuals on a series of physical performance tests.

As the study progresses, the team will assess whether reducing treatment burden improves participants' adherence to their treatment plans. This is vital, as it's well-known that interruptions due to side effects can diminish the effectiveness of cancer therapies.

""We know that if patients receive less than 85% of their prescribed chemotherapy, there are implications for survival,"" said Lopez. ""The goal is to keep patients above the 85% and to do that, patients need to be healthy enough to be able to tolerate the dose that was prescribed.""

Lopez hopes that presenting the LIFE-L findings at ASH will encourage more clinicians to refer their patients to lifestyle medicine programs. She aims to highlight the importance of diet and exercise to hematologist-oncologists, as there is often a lack of knowledge or awareness about available recommendations for patients. The virtual program is designed to help bridge this gap.

""It's been very, very rewarding to see the physicians referring patients,"" said Lopez. ""The physicians are key stakeholders in all of this.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New trial shows major survival gains with epcoritamab added to standard R2 therapy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251207/New-trial-shows-major-survival-gains-with-epcoritamab-added-to-standard-R2-therapy.aspx","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:08:00 GMT","

In a new trial, patients with follicular lymphoma had a significantly higher response to treatment and a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death or disease progression if they received epcoritamab in addition to the standard second-line regimen versus the standard regimen alone. The study is the first reported randomized controlled trial to test a bispecific antibody combination in follicular lymphoma and suggests the combination could offer an effective alternative to chemotherapy that can be safely administered on an outpatient basis.

Based on the study results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved epcoritamab with rituximab and lenalidomide for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma in November 2025.

The addition of epcoritamab to rituximab and lenalidomide very substantially increased the response rates, depth of response, and duration of benefit and therefore may represent a new standard of care in patients with follicular lymphoma. We are at a point in time when chemo-free approaches based on immunotherapy can seriously challenge chemotherapy as the standard of care. We will not know for a long time if [this regimen] is curative, but it's certainly the beginning of a bright era for chemo-free therapy for follicular lymphoma.""

Lorenzo Falchi, MD, lead study author, assistant attending physician in the lymphoma service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York

Follicular lymphoma is a slow-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can progress to a more aggressive form. Patients who see their cancer return after an initial round of treatment have limited options and often experience subsequent relapses.

The immunotherapeutic combination rituximab and lenalidomide (known as R2) has become a standard second-line treatment for follicular lymphoma, while epcoritamab, a bispecific antibody, was more recently approved for follicular lymphoma that is relapsed or refractory (R/R) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. R2 and epcoritamab operate through different mechanisms to enhance the ability of a patient's immune system to recognize and eradicate cancer cells.

The study randomized 488 patients with R/R follicular lymphoma to receive epcoritamab plus R2 or R2 alone for up to 12 cycles. At a median follow-up of just under 15 months, the group receiving epcoritamab plus R2 showed a significantly higher overall response rate (95.1% versus 79.2% among the control group) and a significantly longer progression-free survival (85.5% versus 40.2% at 16 months), meeting both of the trial's primary endpoints.

Epcoritamab plus R2 also outperformed R2 alone for the trial's secondary endpoints, with 82.7% of patients in this arm seeing a complete response (CR) to treatment versus 49.8% among those who received R2 alone. Participants who received epcoritamab plus R2 also showed a significantly longer duration of response and CR. The results were consistent across all subgroups analyzed.

Additionally, researchers noted that very few patients who received epcoritamab required subsequent treatments during the study period, suggesting that the new regimen can help patients avoid or delay further treatments and their associated toxicities. At 16 months, 92.8% of patients in this group remained free from new anti-lymphoma treatments, compared with 64.9% among those who received R2 alone.

""A time-limited therapy that is not followed by another therapy for a long time is certainly a very good value for patients,"" said Dr. Falchi.

Participants who received epcoritamab plus R2 experienced a higher rate of adverse events, with grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurring in 90.1% of patients receiving epcoritamab and 67.6% of patients in the control group. This increase was driven largely by a higher rate of low white blood cell counts and infections among those receiving epcoritamab. There was no evidence of neurological toxicity and no reports of grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS). According to researchers, this suggests that the combined regimen is safe to administer in a variety of medical settings.

""There has been some hesitancy to use bispecific antibodies in a community setting because of CRS,"" said Dr. Falchi. ""The prospect of a subcutaneous, completely outpatient treatment that does not result in a significant rate of CRS is good news for giving more patients the best opportunity for a response.""

The study also tested two different step-up dosing regimens for the epcoritamab–R2 combination, showing that three initial smaller doses resulted in a reduced rate of low-grade CRS compared with a course of just two initial smaller doses.

Given the study's relatively short median follow-up time to date, the researchers will continue to track participants to assess longer-term outcomes. In addition, a separate study is underway to test the epcoritamab–R2 combination in a frontline setting. Dr. Falchi added that epcoritamab could also be investigated as a single-agent treatment for patients who are not candidates for R2.

The study was funded by Genmab and AbbVie Inc. The results were simultaneously published in the Lancet.

Lorenzo Falchi, MD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, will present this study on Sunday, December 7, 2025, at 10:15 a.m. Eastern time in West Hall D2 of the Orange County Convention Center.

Road crossings need to slow down to allow people with mobility issues and older pedestrians enough time to use them, research has indicated. 

The time interval of crossings in the UK is more than two seconds shorter than people with reduced mobility need, according to a new study by researchers at the Universities of Bath, Birmingham and Exeter. 

Led by Dr. Max Western from the University of Bath Centre for Motivation and Behaviour Change, the study found that just 1.5% of older adults with mobility limitations walk fast enough at their comfortable speed to cross the road within the time normally allowed by pedestrian signals. 

The research analyzed walking speeds of 1,110 adults aged 65 and over from two major UK trials. Their average walking speed was 0.77 meters per second, well below the 1.2 m/s assumed by most pedestrian crossing designs. This means the average participant would take 6.5 seconds to cross a 5-metre road – over two seconds more than the green crossing signal typically allows. 

Current crossing times might be unrealistic for many older people who face challenges with their mobility. This isn't just a safety issue – it's potentially a barrier to independence, physical activity, and social connection, all of which often decline in later life."" 

Dr. Max Western, University of Bath Centre for Motivation and Behaviour Change

The study also found that older age, lower strength and balance were associated with slower walking speeds. Over half of participants would need to increase their comfortable walking speed by 50% or more to cross an average road safely. 

Professor Afroditi Stathi from the University of Birmingham, who leads the two UK research trials underpinning the findings, commented: ""Older adults often face challenges staying active and connected, especially when mobility is reduced. Designing outdoor spaces that work for everyone – such as allowing enough time to cross the road – can boost confidence, support independence, and help them remain engaged in their communities - all key to a better quality of life."" 

The researchers argue that even small changes, such as extending green signal times by a few seconds, could make a big difference. They propose adjusting crossing times to reflect a more realistic walking speed of 0.7 m/s, which would allow more people to cross safely and confidently. 

While innovations like smart crossings and countdown timers are emerging, the team warns that without targeted public awareness and inclusive design, these technologies may not benefit those most in need. 

The research team is calling for: 

The adoption of urban design standards that account for slower walking speeds by extending crossing times and improving pedestrian safety features. This ensures older adults can move confidently and remain active in their communities. 

The integration of mobility support into public health strategies by creating age-friendly outdoor spaces such as safe walkways, benches, and extended crossing times to encourage regular physical activity among older adults 

The paper, Why didn't the senior citizen cross the road? Gait speed in community-dwelling older adults with mobility limitations relative to pedestrian crossing times, is published in Age and Ageing today, Monday 8 December (DOI: 10.1093/ageing/afaf345). 

The research paper presents a secondary analysis of data collected as part of two NIHR Public Health Research Programme grants (reference: 13/164/51 and 130156).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Chemotherapy-free combination treatment outperforms traditional regimens in patients with Ph+ ALL","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251207/Chemotherapy-free-combination-treatment-outperforms-traditional-regimens-in-patients-with-Ph2b-ALL.aspx","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 02:48:00 GMT","

A chemotherapy-free combination treatment outperformed a combination of targeted therapy and chemotherapy among patients with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a new study. The phase III trial, which included adult patients with no upper age limit, is the first formal comparison of the efficacy and safety of these two approaches in newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL.

Researchers say the findings offer reassurance that chemotherapy can be omitted without detrimental effects and suggest that a chemo-free targeted agent and immunotherapy combination could become the new standard of care for this patient group.

The chemo-free approach significantly reduced the rate of death in addition to increasing the rate of complete remission. The significance was very impressive, a more than 20% difference in terms of molecular response achievement [a sensitive test for residual cancer cells following treatment], so this approach truly is better.""

Sabina Chiaretti, MD, lead study author, associate professor, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy

ALL is a fast-growing type of leukemia affecting white blood cells, while Ph+ ALL is a genetic subtype characterized by the causal genetic abnormality in the Philadelphia chromosome. Patients with Ph+ ALL have historically faced a poor prognosis and increased resistance to chemotherapy, pointing to a need for improved treatments. In recent years, targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immunotherapies have brought promising results, with good efficacy and fewer side effects than chemotherapy. Researchers have sought to identify the optimal combination of therapies among TKIs, immunotherapies, and chemotherapy. 

For the trial, researchers enrolled 236 adult patients with Ph+ ALL, ranging in age from 19 to 84 years. Two-thirds of participants were randomly assigned to the experimental arm and received a TKI plus immunotherapy; one-third were assigned to the control arm and received a TKI plus chemotherapy. Patients in the experimental group received an initial course of steroids, a 70-day induction with the TKI ponatinib, and two to five cycles of the immunotherapy blinatumomab. Patients in the control group received the TKI imatinib along with either four or six cycles of chemotherapy for patients older or younger than age 65, respectively.

Patients in the chemo-free experimental arm had a significantly higher rate of event-free survival and a better response to treatment. At a median follow-up of 23 months, event-free survival was 87% in the experimental arm and 71% in the control arm, while the rate of death was 3.5% in the experimental arm and 10% in the control arm. The relapse rate was similar among arms (6% in the experimental group and 8% in the control group), although about half of the relapses in the experimental group occurred in patients who had discontinued their treatment.

Complete remission was achieved in 94% of those in the experimental arm and 79% of those in the control group. The chemo-free treatment regimen also resulted in a higher rate of negative measurable residual disease (MRD) status, an indicator that all or nearly all cancer cells have been eradicated. While only 49% of those in the control group achieved MRD-negative status, 71% of those in the experimental group achieved MRD-negative status after two cycles of blinatumomab, and 80% reached this status after five cycles. 

""The more cycles with blinatumomab, the more the molecular remission rate increased,"" said Dr. Chiaretti. ""This suggests that patients really should receive the planned five cycles. This is important because we have been working with blinatumomab for years, but we did not yet know how many cycles should be recommended.""

Participants randomized to the control group were offered the option to cross over to the experimental arm if their disease was MRD-positive. About 37% of patients in the control arm eventually received the experimental treatment regimen, and 62% of these patients subsequently achieved MRD-negative status.

Most of the deaths occurred in older patients, and infections were a primary cause of death among those that occurred in the experimental arm. The safety profiles were consistent with those expected for each therapy involved in the study, and researchers said that most adverse events were successfully addressed by reducing dosage.

While the study was conducted exclusively in Italy, Dr. Chiaretti noted that the results should be applicable in any country. She added that a chemo-free treatment approach can bring economic benefits by reducing the need for hospitalization and allowing patients to continue working while undergoing cancer treatment.

A separate study is now underway to determine whether patients with sustained MRD-negative status can discontinue TKI treatment without raising the risk of a relapse.

Sabina Chiaretti, MD, of Sapienza University of Rome, will present this study on Sunday, December 7, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time in W224A-F of the Orange County Convention Center.

Abstinent smokers experience increased pain sensitivity during withdrawal, to the point that they often require more pain relief after surgery. Why? New from JNeurosci, Zhijie Lu, from Fudan University Minhang Hospital, and Kai Wei, from Shanghai Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, led a team of researchers to explore brain activity linking nicotine withdrawal and pain sensitivity. 

The researchers found that 30 abstinent smokers had altered functioning of specific brain areas, increased pain sensitivity, and a need for more postoperative pain relief-particularly with opioids-compared to 30 nonsmokers. The longer that smokers abstained from their use, the more sensitive they were to pain, which was associated with a distinct set of brain regions. Notably, this effect was constrained to a specific timeframe of abstinence, supporting previous findings that pain sensitivity may return to normal levels once abstinence exceeds 3 months. The relationship between postoperative care requirements and withdrawal symptoms from abstinence was linked to a different set of brain regions. 

We'd like to emphasize that our study does not discourage smokers from quitting before surgery. Our aim is to encourage researchers to delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying elevated pain sensitivity during short-term abstinence, with the goal of developing strategies to mitigate the clinical challenge of increased analgesic (especially opioid) use associated with preoperative smoking cessation.""

Kai Wei, Shanghai Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital

 The researchers have already begun exploring the mechanisms of a postoperative pain reliever that may be more effective than opioids in abstinent smokers as well as the mechanisms and effectiveness of preoperative nicotine replacement therapies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New combination treatment offers significant benefits for people with recurring grade 3 astrocytoma","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251208/New-combination-treatment-offers-significant-benefits-for-people-with-recurring-grade-3-astrocytoma.aspx","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:48:00 GMT","

Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah (the U) participated in a clinical trial that found that a new combination treatment plan helped people with recurring grade 3 astrocytoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, live longer.

Astrocytoma is an extremely challenging diagnosis for both patients and physicians, as the range of treatments and efficacy is limited. It's incredibly rewarding to be involved in a study like STELLAR, which demonstrated a combination treatment that has a significant benefit and offers incredible potential for patients with this specific diagnosis.""

Howard Colman, MD, PhD, co-leader of the Neurologic Cancers Disease Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute, Jon M. Huntsman Presidential Professor in the Department of Neurosurgery at the U, and primary investigator of the STELLAR trial

The Phase 3 trial from Orbus Therapeutics evaluated the efficacy and safety of a treatment plan using a combination of the drug eflornithine, a compound that targets an enzyme to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and the oral chemotherapy lomustine, which is used to treat a variety of brain cancers.

The international trial enrolled 343 patients from 74 hospitals and clinics in North America and Europe, including Huntsman Cancer Institute. All patients had to have previously received radiation and chemotherapy, as well as had recurrence of the disease after treatment.

The study initially enrolled patients who had a type of brain tumor called anaplastic astrocytoma. But as medical definitions changed, the study ended up including three types of brain tumors: glioblastoma, grade 3 IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytoma.

Astrocytomas are primary brain tumors that can form in the brain or spine. IDH, a gene that mutates and is thought to drive the conversion of normal cells in the brain into tumor cells, is the most common driver of astrocytoma tumors. Glioblastoma is a different type of astrocytoma that is more aggressive and does not involve mutations in the IDH gene.

In the STELLAR trial, the experimental group of patients received oral eflornithine in combination with lomustine. The other half, the control group, received lomustine alone.

Among all patients, the study found no difference in overall survival rates between the control and experimental group. There was also no benefit of eflornithine for patients with grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas or glioblastoma.

But for patients with grade 3 IDH-mutant astrocytoma, the new treatment helped them live much longer-about 35 months compared to 24 months with the standard treatment.

Colman and his team also considered the progression-free survival rates of each group, which measure how long it takes for a patient's disease to worsen after starting treatment. For patients with grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytoma or glioblastoma, there was no significant improvement. But, as in overall survival rates, patients with grade 3 IDH-mutant astrocytoma on the combination therapy fared better. Patients taking lomustine alone had a median progression-free survival rate of 7.2 months. In patients taking the combination therapy of lomustine and eflornithine, the median was more than twice as long, at 15.8 months.

""This is a groundbreaking development. Advances in treating brain tumors are critical to overcoming this difficult diagnosis for Huntsman Cancer Institute's patients and patients throughout the country,"" says Neli Ulrich, PhD, MS, chief scientific officer and executive director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute and Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Presidential Professor in Cancer Research in the Department of Population Health Sciences at the U. ""With every breakthrough in the treatment of astrocytoma, we move closer to transforming uncertainty into hope. Through federally funded cancer research and strong public–private partnerships, we are accelerating scientific discovery and bringing new, powerful treatments to the patients who need them most.""

This clinical trial is supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute, including cancer center support grant P30 CA042014, as well as Huntsman Cancer Foundation.

The results of the study were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Evidence grows for pirtobrutinib as a safer and effective alternative for CLL and SLL","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251207/Evidence-grows-for-pirtobrutinib-as-a-safer-and-effective-alternative-for-CLL-and-SLL.aspx","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:18:00 GMT","

Pirtobrutinib, a non-covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, met the primary endpoint for non-inferiority in terms of overall response rate in the first head-to-head comparison with ibrutinib, a covalent BTK inhibitor. Based on the study results, researchers suggest pirtobrutinib shows promise as initial BTK inhibitor therapy, including in the frontline setting, for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

Non-covalent BTK inhibitors were initially developed to overcome resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors. This study is the first phase III clinical trial to directly compare a non-covalent BTK inhibitor to a covalent BTK inhibitor in patients with CLL or SLL. It included patients who had not received any previous treatment, a first for any phase III study directly comparing BTK inhibitors, as well as patients who had their cancer come back (relapse) or not respond (refractory) after receiving treatments other than a covalent BTK inhibitor.

""Pirtobrutinib was clearly non-inferior to ibrutinib, and the response rate actually favors pirtobrutinib in the total cohort,"" said lead study author Jennifer Woyach, MD, Bertha Bouroncle, MD, and Andrew Pereny, chair of medicine at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. ""This shows that pirtobrutinib is a reasonable choice in both the treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory settings.""

lead study author Jennifer Woyach, MD, Bertha Bouroncle, MD, and Andrew Pereny, chair of medicine at The Ohio State University College of Medicine

CLL and SLL are slow-growing forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that develop when lymphocytes grow out of control and abnormal B cells build up in bone marrow (CLL) or lymph nodes (SLL). BTK inhibitors work by blocking the BTK enzyme, which plays a role in B-cell growth and proliferation.

The study enrolled 662 adult patients with CLL or SLL. Of these, 225 had not received any prior treatments, and 437 were R/R to prior treatments and had not received any BTK inhibitors. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either pirtobrutinib or ibrutinib and remain on their assigned therapy unless their disease progressed or they experienced unacceptable side effects.

The study's primary endpoint, non-inferiority of pirtobrutinib for overall response rate (ORR), was achieved in the full study population. Of 662 participants, the ORR was 87.0% among those receiving pirtobrutinib and 78.6% among those receiving ibrutinib. The results consistently favored pirtobrutinib across the majority of subgroups, including those who were treatment-naive, relapsed/refractory (R/R) to prior treatments, and those with various high-risk disease characteristics.

Survival without disease progression, the study's secondary endpoint, will be formally assessed at a later time. Early results suggest that pirtobrutinib may offer some benefit over ibrutinib for this endpoint as well, showing 18-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates of 86.9% in the pirtobrutinib arm and 82.3% in the ibrutinib arm. Preliminary results suggest treatment-naive participants saw the most pronounced benefit for this endpoint.

The PFS is still a little bit immature at this point, but trends toward favoring pirtobrutinib in all of the groups – in the total cohort, in the R/R group, and, importantly, in the treatment-naive cohort. That's really important, because given the safety of pirtobrutinib, it suggests that this might be a good option in the future for some patients with frontline CLL/SLL.""

Dr. Jennifer Woyach, The Ohio State University College of Medicine

The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuation due to AEs were overall similar between arms. However, those receiving pirtobrutinib experienced lower rates of AE-related dose reductions, treatment discontinuation due to progressive disease, and certain cardiovascular AEs including hypertension and development of atrial fibrillation or flutter.

These results may indicate pirtobrutinib is especially suitable for use in older or more frail patients. ""While the efficacy and safety of pirtobrutinib have been very clearly established when given after a covalent BTK inhibitor, there are likely going to be subgroups of patients where pirtobrutinib is a more attractive option instead of the covalent BTK inhibitors,"" said Dr. Woyach.

In addition to continuing to track outcomes from this study, Dr. Woyach said that future clinical trials could help refine the use of pirtobrutinib alone or in combination with other therapies as a frontline treatment. She added that researchers are also continuing to investigate possible mechanisms through which cancer may become resistant to non-covalent BTK inhibitors to further optimize treatment strategies.

This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company, maker of pirtobrutinib. The results were simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Jennifer Woyach, MD, of The Ohio State University College of Medicine, will present this study on Sunday, December 7, 2025, at 5:30 p.m. Eastern time in W224ABEF of the Orange County Convention Center.

By directly measuring vitamin C inside human skin, researchers show that diet can boost skin vitamin C content and influence skin structure, while also revealing clear limits to its effects on collagen formation and UV protection.

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is widely promoted for supporting collagen production and skin health, yet little is known about how oral intake changes dermal or epidermal ascorbate concentrations. A new study in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology directly examines how skin compartments respond to dietary ascorbate and whether these changes translate into measurable improvements in skin function.

Vitamin C is present in both skin layers: the collagen-rich dermis and the highly cellular epidermis. As an antioxidant, ascorbate neutralizes ultraviolet-induced free radicals, protects against oxidative stress, and stimulates both fibroblast collagen synthesis and keratinocyte proliferation, processes central to skin thickness and anti-aging benefits.

Topical products must stabilize dissolved ascorbate and deliver it across the stratum corneum, an effective barrier that complicates absorption. Systemically, the skin relies on sodium-dependent vitamin C cotransporters (SVCT1/SVCT2) to actively import circulating ascorbate. Prior research has offered almost no data on dermal vs. epidermal ascorbate content or on functional consequences of dietary supplementation.

Researchers quantified ascorbate concentrations in dermis, epidermis, and whole skin from healthy adults. They also conducted a pilot dietary intervention using kiwifruit, providing ~250 mg/day of vitamin C, to test whether increasing plasma ascorbate levels elevate skin ascorbate content and alter skin function outcomes.

Using per-cell measurements of DNA content, investigators found that the epidermis had 11-fold more DNA than the dermis, enabling cellular-level concentration estimates. Dermal fibroblasts contained ~6.4 mM ascorbate, whereas epidermal keratinocytes contained ~0.9 mM, a seven-fold difference. High dermal ascorbate parallels levels in adrenal and brain tissue, where ascorbate acts as an enzymatic cofactor, likely supporting robust collagen synthesis in fibroblasts.

Whole-skin, dermal, and epidermal ascorbate concentrations rose proportionally with blood ascorbate. In the kiwifruit supplementation cohort, participants with below-average baseline levels achieved plasma saturation (>60 μM), accompanied by higher dermal ascorbate in biopsy samples. At a second study site, suction-blister sampling showed that increases in plasma ascorbate were mirrored in blister fluid and epidermal blister-roof tissue, confirming active epidermal uptake via SVCT transporters.

Kiwifruit supplementation increased skin density from ~0.15 to ~0.23 scanner units, an indicator of greater dermal structural protein content. Epidermal cell proliferation also increased. However, skin elasticity declined by a small (~7%) amount, and UVA-induced oxidative stress protection did not improve. Procollagen type I peptides in blister fluid also did not increase, suggesting that changes in collagen synthesis may be subtle or not captured by this biomarker, despite rising skin density.

Findings suggest that dietary vitamin C effectively elevates ascorbate levels across all skin compartments through active transport mechanisms. Improvements in skin density and epidermal renewal may reflect enhanced collagen support or TET-mediated transcriptional regulation, as observed in prior in vitro work. The authors conclude: “Increasing dietary ascorbate intake will result in effective uptake into all skin compartments and will benefit skin function.”

A nationwide analysis of prescription data reveals that young Australians are staying on antidepressants for longer than ever, highlighting growing gaps between clinical guidelines and real-world practice.



Increasing Prevalence of Long-Term Antidepressant Use in Australia: A Retrospective Observational Study. Image Credit: marevgenna / Shutterstock

A recent study published in the journal Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety highlights a steadily increasing prevalence of long-term antidepressant use in Australia, especially among adolescents and young adults aged 10 to 24 years.

Antidepressants are widely prescribed medications for the treatment of various mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. However, clinical evidence indicates that a significant proportion of antidepressant prescriptions do not align with the officially approved therapeutic uses.

Clinical guidelines recommend a 6–12 month duration of antidepressant therapy for the optimal management of depression. For high-risk patients, therapy duration can be extended to reduce the risk of relapse.

However, a growing trend in antidepressant therapy for more than one year or longer has been observed in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, and Sweden. In Australia, a continuous long-term use of antidepressants has been observed among users even in the absence of clearly documented clinical indications.

This trend of long-term antidepressant use has raised significant clinical concerns regarding the possibility of potential adverse effects, as well as the risk of withdrawal symptoms of varying intensity and duration that may arise after treatment cessation.

Given the potential negative consequences associated with long-term antidepressant use and the limited evidence describing national long-term utilisation patterns, University of South Australia researchers conducted an epidemiological study to understand the trends in long-term antidepressant use in Australia between 2014 and 2023.

The researchers analyzed a 10% population-based sample of patients from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), which included a complete record of PBS-subsidised antidepressant dispensings for individuals aged 10 years and above, excluding most inpatient hospital medicines and private prescriptions.

The study analysis revealed that the prevalence of antidepressant use had increased from 107.7 per 1000 population in 2014 to 128.8 per 1000 population in 2023, with a notable acceleration during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period.

The annual proportion of new users rose from 29.4 per 1000 population in 2014 to a peak of 32.4 per 1000 population in 2021, before declining back to 29.4 per 1000 population in 2023. The proportion of new users relative to prevalent users gradually declined over time, with the lowest percentage observed in 2023.

Regarding long-term antidepressant use, the study found an overall increase from 66.1 per 1000 population in 2014 to approximately 85 per 1000 population by 2022, with a small decline to 84.6 per 1000 population in 2023. The analysis by gender revealed a consistently higher prevalence among female users during the entire study period.

The increased prevalence of long-term antidepressant use was observed across all age groups, with the highest increase observed in the 10–24 years age group (110%), corresponding to a rise from 15.4 to 32.3 per 1000 population, and the second largest increase observed in the 25–39 years age group (37%).

Regarding the duration of antidepressant therapy, the study found a 25% increase across all age groups during the study period. The analysis by age revealed that the therapy duration was longer in older age groups compared to that in younger age groups. However, the highest increase in duration was observed in the 10–24 years age group, which was a 56% increase between 2014 and 2023. Average treatment duration was estimated using prevalence–incidence relationships rather than direct observation of individual treatment episodes. Long-term use was defined as continuous antidepressant treatment for at least 365 days, allowing short gaps between dispensings.

The percentage of long-term users with apparent dose reductions showed minimal change over time. These dose reductions were identified using dispensing-based metrics and may not always reflect intentional clinical deprescribing.

The study highlights an increasing trend in long-term antidepressant use across all age groups in Australia, particularly among patients aged 10–24 years. A similar increasing trend in treatment duration has been observed, which is accompanied by limited efforts in apparent dose reduction.

According to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015, 2017, and 2021, antidepressant therapy should be continued for 6–12 months after symptom remission. The guidelines also recommend extending treatment duration for patients with recurrent depressive disorder.

Despite these guidelines, this study finds a significant increase in long-term antidepressant use and treatment duration and a reluctance to deprescribe. These observations raise vital concerns about potential over-prescription, difficulty in withdrawing from therapy, and suboptimal deprescribing practices.

The most concerning trends in antidepressant use have been observed in the 10–24-year age group, which showed a 110% increase in long-term antidepressant use and a 56% increase in treatment duration between 2014 and 2023. An exponential rise in social media use in the last decade and its negative influence on mental health may have contributed to the observed trend. Furthermore, social isolation and movement restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic may also have adversely affected mental health in young people.

The expansion of healthcare services, particularly telemedicine, has improved access to mental health care among young people. Although encouraging the youth to seek medical help more proactively, these services may also contribute to unnecessary initiation of pharmacological interventions, suboptimal deprescribing practices, and the overprescription of antidepressants.

These adversities in clinical practice should be addressed by promoting current guidelines that recommend psychological strategies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, as first-line and primary treatments for young people with mental health conditions, with pharmacological therapy reserved for selected cases or used as adjunctive treatment.

Considering the overall findings, researchers highlight the need for comprehensive research to investigate the complex relationships among non-pharmacological management practices, healthcare provider attitudes, and patient acceptance.

The traditional finger-pricking method has long been the standard approach, using lancets and test strips to measure capillary blood glucose. However, using this method every day, multiple times a day, is impractical for continuous glucose monitoring, leading to under-testing and an increased risk of severe health complications in people with diabetes.

Several wearable devices have also been developed for continuous glucose monitoring through sensors implanted just under the skin. These commercially available continuous glucose monitors rely on minimally invasive microneedles to measure glucose levels in interstitial fluid and typically need to be replaced every 10 to 14 days. However, these systems are not fully noninvasive and contribute to ongoing cost and device burden.

To overcome these limitations, several noninvasive methods have been developed, including vibrational spectroscopy that directly targets the molecular signatures of glucose, and photothermal and photoacoustic spectroscopy that analyze thermal or acoustic changes in tissue properties induced by glucose absorption.

Some indirect methods, such as photoplethysmography and breath analysis, have also emerged to monitor glucose levels by measuring secondary physiological effects or byproducts of glucose metabolism.

Many of these methods use artificial intelligence (AI) to process complex and noisy signals, which requires extensive training and may lack robustness and generalisability across different individuals and physiological conditions.

To address these challenges, MIT researchers developed a compact, noninvasive, portable sensor based on Raman spectroscopy using a band-pass Raman spectroscopy (BRS) approach for continuous glucose monitoring. Raman spectroscopy is a technique that shines near-infrared or visible light on tissues or cells to reveal their chemical compositions. The basic principle is to analyze how near-infrared or visible light is scattered, or deflected, as it encounters different kinds of molecules in tissues or cells.

The researchers developed this Raman-based system to efficiently and accurately quantify glucose levels through optimized optics and physically interpretable spectral metrics. The system was mounted on breadboards and enclosed, resulting in a compact, portable glucose-monitoring device capable of directly measuring glucose Raman signals from the skin.

The glucose Raman signals, which were generated through near-infrared (830 nm) light, are generally too small to be easily distinguished from all other signals generated by cellular or tissue molecules. To filter out these unwanted signals, researchers shone near-infrared light onto the skin at an angle different from that used to collect the resulting Raman signal. This off-axis configuration suppresses elastically scattered light and enhances glucose-specific Raman features.

A Raman spectrum typically contains approximately 1,000 bands, which are spectral regions that correspond to specific molecular features. Among these bands, the researchers selected and analyzed only three strategically chosen spectral bands around the main glucose Raman peak, using two adjacent sidebands as intraspectrum references to measure blood glucose levels. This approach allowed them to measure with a cost-effective device about the size of a shoebox, without requiring full-spectrum acquisition or complex AI-driven models.

The researchers conducted initial validation experiments using optical tissue phantoms across a wide range of glucose concentrations, followed by a pilot intraskin study to investigate the efficiency of this Raman-based portable system in continuously monitoring blood glucose levels in a human participant.

The study was conducted on a healthy male volunteer aged 27 years, who put his arm on the top of the device, and a near-infrared beam from the device shone through a small glass window onto the skin to perform the measurement. The measurements were taken every five minutes over a period of four hours.

For a comparative analysis, two commercially available, invasive continuous glucose monitors were inserted into the participant's other arm to measure glucose levels every 5 minutes. A one-finger-prick standard glucometer was also used to measure blood glucose levels every 10 minutes.

To induce dynamic changes in blood glucose concentrations, the participant was instructed to drink two 75-gram glucose drinks during the trial. The final trial findings indicated that measurements from the Raman-based device closely tracked glucose trends and agreed with those from commercial invasive devices, with performance metrics comparable to those of current commercial continuous glucose monitors.

The portable, noninvasive Raman-based device developed in the study demonstrates promising preliminary performance for continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels, with measurement accuracy comparable to that of commercially available invasive glucose monitors in this pilot setting. The device takes approximately 36 seconds to complete a measurement, resulting in a total measurement time of under one minute.

While the current findings are based on a single healthy participant, these preliminary observations provide a strong basis for future studies with larger, more diverse populations, including people with diabetes, to better understand the potential of this point-of-care technology.

The device shows promise in transforming glucose monitoring, offering portability, accessibility, accuracy, and continuity for future clinical and personal health management applications, with the potential to reduce reliance on finger-prick testing and under-the-skin sensors over time.

Adults with chronic pain who participated in New York State's (NYS) Medical Cannabis Program were significantly less likely to require prescription opioids, according to a new study published today in JAMA Internal Medicine and led by researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Health System.

Chronic pain and opioid addiction are two of the most pressing health challenges in the United States. Our findings indicate that medical cannabis, when dispensed through a pharmacist-supervised system, can relieve chronic pain while also meaningfully reducing patients' reliance on prescription opioids. Supervised use of medical cannabis could be an important tool in combatting the opioid crisis.""

 Deepika E. Slawek, M.D., M.S., study's lead author, associate professor of medicine at Einstein, and an internal medicine and addiction medicine specialist at Montefiore

The study involved 204 adults who were prescribed opioids for chronic pain and were newly certified for medical cannabis between September 2018 and July 2023. Participants were tracked for 18 months, with data on both their cannabis and opioid use collected from the New York State Prescription Monitoring Program.

At the beginning of the study, most participants reported high levels of pain and were taking an average daily opioid dose equivalent to 73.3 mg of morphine. Over the 18-month follow-up period, that average daily dose fell to 57 mg, a 22% reduction.

More specifically, those participants who received a 30-day supply of medical cannabis used the equivalent of 3.5 fewer mg of morphine per day than those who received no cannabis during the same month. ""Those changes may seem small, but gradual reductions in opioid use are safer and more sustainable for people managing chronic pain than stopping suddenly,"" Dr. Slawek noted.

""This research adds to the growing body of evidence supporting a medicalized model of cannabis use, where pharmacists are actively involved in dispensaries and cannabis is treated like other prescription drugs,"" said Julia Arnsten, M.D., M.P.H., the study's senior author, chief of the division of general internal medicine at Montefiore Einstein, and professor of medicine, of epidemiology & population health, and of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. ""We hope these findings will lead to new policies encouraging the effective management of chronic pain through use of regulated substances.""

In a new trial, patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) fared significantly better with a combined regimen of azacitidine and venetoclax compared with conventional induction chemotherapy. The azacitidine–venetoclax combination (known as aza-ven) is the standard of care for older adults who are not fit enough for intensive chemotherapy. The trial is the first to test the superiority of this regimen to intensive induction chemotherapy, the current standard for fit patients.

Our study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that aza-ven improves event-free survival. It also leads to higher rates of overall response and composite complete response than intensive induction chemotherapy in younger, intensive-chemotherapy-eligible patients. A greater proportion of patients successfully proceeded to transplant following response with less early mortality, significantly improved quality of life during initial treatment, and less time in the hospital.""

Amir Fathi, MD, lead study author, director of the Center for Leukemia at Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute and associate professor of medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston

AML is a cancer of the bone marrow that causes an overabundance of abnormal white blood cells and impedes the production of healthy blood cells. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can cure AML, but this option is not available to everyone, and almost all patients must undergo initial treatments to reduce cancer in the bone marrow before proceeding to transplant. Intensive induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracyclines has long stood as the standard frontline treatment, but this treatment requires patients to spend about a month in the hospital and carries a high risk of infection, bleeding, and other complications and side effects.

Azacitidine is a chemotherapy drug that has been used for years, in injectable forms, for older patients with AML. Venetoclax is an oral targeted therapy that inhibits the BCL-2 protein, which is involved in cancer cell survival. The two agents are generally well tolerated and can be administered and managed safely on an outpatient basis over time.

In the trial, 172 adult patients were randomly assigned to receive either aza-ven or standard intensive induction chemotherapy. The results were significantly better in the aza-ven arm for the trial's primary endpoint, event-free survival (EFS), with events defined as relapse, disease progression, disease refractoriness prompting change in therapy, or death. With a median follow-up of just under 22 months, EFS was significantly longer in the aza-ven arm; the median EFS was more than 14 months among those receiving aza-ven compared with a median of just over six months for those receiving induction chemotherapy. The effect of aza-ven remained protective even after adjusting for other variables, and at one year, 53% of those in the aza-ven arm met criteria for EFS compared with 36% of those in the control arm. 

Patients whose cancer had certain characteristics, including core binding factor fusions, FLT3 mutations, or NPM1 mutations (unless age 60 or over), were excluded from the trial. As a result, the study reflects a patient population of predominantly intermediate-to-high-risk AML, although all patients were fit enough to undergo intensive induction chemotherapy.

""I believe the data support the use of this treatment in this population,"" said Dr. Fathi. ""It applies to adverse risk and intermediate risk patients who don't have FLT3 mutations. That doesn't mean that other patient populations may not benefit, but they require their own focused study.""

Participants receiving aza-ven experienced a higher overall response to treatment than those receiving induction chemotherapy, with 88% of those in the aza-ven arm seeing an overall response and 78% seeing a composite complete response, compared with 62% and 54% in the control arm, respectively. They were also more likely to progress to a transplant, which occurred in 61% of those receiving aza-ven and 40% of those receiving induction chemotherapy.

The rate of grade 3 or 4 therapy-related adverse events was similar between study arms. No patients who received aza-ven died within 60 days, while 5% of those in the control group died by this timepoint. Hospitalization was also longer among patients in the control group. Ten percent of patients in the induction arm required admission to the intensive care unit during their index hospitalization, compared with zero in the aza-ven arm. Patients in the aza-ven arm also reported a lower symptom burden and lower rates of depression at two weeks, according to quality of life assessments.

The researchers plan to conduct further analyses to compare costs, the rate of infectious complications, and other factors that may inform treatment decisions for this patient population. In addition, they will assess the use of measurable residual disease status to provide key prognostic and predictive information across arms of the study and inform the optimal amount of treatment needed for aza-ven prior to transplant. 

The study was investigator-initiatied; Genentech and AbbVie Inc. (maker of venetoclax), provided the study drug and funding to support research staff.

Amir Fathi, MD, of Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School will present this study on Sunday, December 7, 2025, at 3:45 p.m. Eastern time during the Plenary Scientific Session in West Hall D2 of the Orange County Convention Center.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","US Soccer Launches Kang Women's Institute for Women's Health Research in Sports","https://femtechinsider.com/us-soccer-launches-kang-womens-institute-for-womens-health-research-in-sports/","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:36:56 GMT","

US Soccer has announced the launch of the Kang Women's Institute, a platform for research and standards development in women's soccer. The institute is backed by an investment from Michele Kang, founder and CEO of Kynisca, a global organization dedicated to women's sports, headquartered in London, United Kingdom.

The Kang Institute will establish research-backed best practices for the training and wellbeing of women and girls at every level of soccer. Only 6% of published research in sports and exercise journals is focused exclusively on women, according to a recent analysis.

“For too long, women have trained, played and recovered using models built for men. That ends now,” said Kang. “This Institute will put female athletes at the center of U.S. Soccer's scientific research and build the evidence, systems and standards that will allow women and girls to reach their full potential.”

In November 2024, Kang pledged a $30 million gift to US Soccer to scale competitive opportunities for youth players, expand talent identification, and support professional development for female players, coaches, and referees. In April 2025, Kang made an additional $25 million investment to integrate the Kynisca Innovation Hub into Soccer Forward‘s research initiatives.

“For far too long, women and girls have trained under systems and standards built for men, and the Kang Women's Institute is an essential first step in changing that,” said US Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone. “By grounding our work in real research and evidence, we can finally give female players the support, care, and understanding they deserve.”

The Kang Institute will evolve from the Soccer Forward Foundation's Research & Innovation Group and work in collaboration with the National Women's Soccer League's Foundation. The institute has begun work on several projects, including conducting the first comprehensive national study to assess the current and emerging needs of female players at every level, including injury prevention, mental health, workload management, menstrual health, and the transition from youth to elite competition.

The institute is co-creating a framework with the National Women's Soccer League and United Soccer League that defines best practices in player health, safety, training, and development ahead of the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women's World Cups. The institute is also developing tools to support female athletes' physical and mental wellbeing, address dropout points, and provide evidence-based support systems for coaches, parents, and clubs.

The research generated by the Kang Institute will be disseminated across the global soccer ecosystem for use by clubs, leagues, coaches, and federations worldwide. The US is co-hosting the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Trinity Rodman's next move will impact the entire NWSL. John Hefti / Imagn Images

National Women's Soccer League commissioner Jessica Berman promised to “fight for” Trinity Rodman during the ongoing negotiations to keep the superstar in the league.

“We want those top players here in the NWSL,” Berman said before last month's NWSL Championship, where Gotham FC defeated Rodman and the Washington Spirit, “and particularly we want Trinity in the NWSL.”

But eight days later, Berman rejected a proposed four-year, multi-million dollar contract — agreed to by both the Spirit and Rodman — that would have kept the 23-year-old free agent in the league, without overhauling the salary cap or introducing any new rules.

As things stand now, the NWSL isn't fighting for Rodman. It's fighting against her, and shadowboxing with its own potential in the process.

The NWSL said Washington's deal violated the “spirit” of the league's rules and, according to a grievance filed by the NWSL Players' Association on Rodman's behalf on Dec. 3, accused the player of “salary cap circumvention.”

A league source, who wasn't authorized to freely discuss the sensitive topic, said that the structure of the deal would provide Washington with an unfair advantage in competition and that the proposed salary would make it unfeasible for the Spirit to field a team in 2028 and still be salary cap compliant. The league has yet to cite a rule or section of the collective bargining agreement that the contract, as proposed, violated.

The NWSL might think the Spirit are making a nonsensical decision, and they may be right. It's still the Spirit's call to make. If they can't meet the 2028 cap by the time it rolls around, then the league can step in.

Rodman has interest from top European clubs and an offer in the same market she has called home since turning pro, thanks to D.C. Power of the Gainbridge Super League, a Division I U.S. professional women's league that started in 2024. Her agent, Mike Senkowski, confirmed on CBS Mornings on Friday that these potential avenues offered “greater value” than the deal she had agreed to with the Spirit before it was vetoed by Berman and the league.

And as for Rodman, who has stayed silent since the Spirit's loss in the NWSL Championship as this contract negotiation has played out publicly, her agent said she is “disappointed” over the latest turn of events.

“She wanted to go back and play in D.C. in front of the fans, continue to work with (Spirit owner) Michele Kang and be a part of the league,” Senkowski said.

The use of the past tense feels intentional. So does Senkowski speaking on a program broadcast by one of the league's four partners, especially since the rejected contract hinged so heavily on the next media rights deal and the potential bump to the subsequent 2028 salary cap. (A league source has said that the deal assumes unrealistic growth not realized by any other league.)



The NWSL, as it has so many times before, had a head start and let an advantage slip through its grasp. Rodman was eager to stay in the NWSL. Now, the league has opened up an opportunity for top European clubs. It's a fight no NWSL team can currently win, under the current plan for the salary cap.

“With no sure, certain way to get her fair market value within the NWSL, naturally that forces you to look elsewhere,” Senkowski said Friday on CBS.

The league has already faced the narrative of an “exodus” of talent to Europe, but Rodman's case is markedly different than those of Naomi Girma or Alyssa Thompson, both of whom departed the NWSL this season for Chelsea. While Rodman told ESPN earlier this year that she'd “kick herself” if she didn't play overseas before she retired, it was not an immediate plan. The league — until now, at least — wasn't actually in competition with the mystique of Champions League or life in London.

Many suspect Berman is simply serving as a shield for her owners, too nervous (or cheap) to set a precedent with Rodman that could blow up the salary cap or increase the level of investment across the board. But anyone with long-term vision can see that the Spirit and the NWSL retaining Rodman benefits everyone. It means more tickets sold, an outsized impact on sponsorships and the upcoming broadcast deals for the 2028 season and her cultural presence helping push the NWSL's awareness across the U.S.

“Washington Spirit drive viewership: Three of the top five most-watched NWSL matches on ABC and ESPN featured the Washington Spirit, led by U.S. Women's National Team star Trinity Rodman,” read the top line of ESPN's press release on 2025 viewership. (Rodman only played in two of these three games due to injury.)

Crucially, the NWSL Championship featuring Rodman and the Spirit finally broke the million-viewer barrier, averaging 1.184 million viewers. Washington's attendance has risen year over year since the move to Audi Field, but in 2025, eight other NWSL teams saw higher-than-average attendances when the Spirit were in town.

Every NWSL owner, not just Michele Kang, stands to benefit from Rodman staying.

One way or the other, the league will set a precedent with Rodman. As the NWSL Players' Association said, right now, that message is that if the league can mess with Rodman's free agency, they can mess with any current or future player's free agency, too.

“Our goal is to ensure that the very best players in the world, including Trinity, continue to call this league home. We will do everything we can, utilizing every lever available within our rules to keep Trinity Rodman here,” a league spokesperson said Wednesday night. Last Thursday, league sources said the NWSL would approve a $1-million-per-year deal immediately if that was presented.

NWSL operates as a single entity, a status which the league says allows it final say on every player contract, the league source said. The league has attempted to use the single-entity concept as a defense for its decisions over a single player's contract before, with Olivia Moultrie. It did not end well for the NWSL — the judge in the case wrote in her preliminary injunction that while the league may operate as a single LLC, in practice, the teams function as “separate economic entities competing for player rights.”

Maybe all of these explanations, in the league's eyes, are evidence of how they're fighting for Rodman — and implying the rejected deal, as structured, is worth more than $4 million total across the four years. But it's another slippery slope if the NWSL takes full responsibility for how every team might use its cap space on a single player, no matter what the final number may be.

The competition manual has multiple safety valves built into the rules that would allow the Spirit and Rodman to either restructure or end her contract. There is no maximum salary set by the collective bargaining agreement. The Spirit are willing to take a massive risk on a generational player, betting not just on her performance but the league's own future as a revenue-generating business.

So maybe the NWSL wants to fight for Rodman, but Berman and the league front office only want a fight they're guaranteed to win: parity above all, no new salary cap rules, no new roster rules setting a precedent, protecting all its owners and its single entity status — and somehow keeping Rodman at the same time.

But the NWSL can't have it all.

Something will get lost in this fight. Rather than living its purported value of innovation, or forcing owners to dig into their wallets moving forward for top players, the NWSL is daring Rodman to walk out the door on a free transfer — where the league gets nothing.

The Spirit tried to find a solution. The NWSL is on the clock.

Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Catherine Newman details the creation of the “Never Chase Reality” effort as soccer prepares for a stronger U.S. spotlight.

U.S. Soccer launched a new campaign, “Never Chase Reality,” in support of the U.S. Men's National Team — and fans across the country — ahead of next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup. The campaign's early December launch was timed to coincide with the final draw that set the table for the global soccer tournament, which will be co-hosted by the U.S. for the first time since 1994.

Anchored by a 90-second video, the campaign chronicles iconic moments in U.S. Men's National Team's history and puts the team's chase for the cup in line with other American traditions. The tagline encourages players and fans to “chase greatness, chase dreams, chase legacy, but never chase reality.”

The campaign was created in-house by the new marketing and communications department at U.S. Soccer, the nonprofit body that governs American soccer at the international, professional and amateur levels. Billed as one of the largest public-facing efforts from the organization to date, “Never Chase Reality” will run across broadcast, digital, out-of-home and experiential channels, and was informed by a deep psychological profile of U.S. soccer fans.

“We understand how we should be creating our ads and how we should be talking to the fans, but also putting them at the heart of everything that we do,” said Catherine Newman, chief marketing and communications officer at U.S. Soccer.

Newman joined U.S. Soccer in July 2024 with a remit to reset the organization's marketing function ahead of the Men's and Women's World Cup tournaments and the 2028 Summer Olympics — events where increased fandom around soccer has attracted major marketers including Unilever, Kellanova, AB InBev and more.

Marketing Dive spoke with Newman about the genesis of the campaign, the roadmap ahead for U.S. Soccer and lessons learned during her previous marketing role for WWE. 

The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

CATHERINE NEWMAN: Soccer is always about more than the game. It's always emotional. There's a saying in the UK that “soccer is more than life,” and I think it translates well for everybody. We wanted to work closely with Mauricio [Pochettino, head coach of the USMNT] and his team and the players, because we wanted to reflect the sentiment that they're feeling: the drive, the ambition and the journey that they're on. But we also wanted to acknowledge the journey that soccer has been on in the U.S. for a number of years. From a fan sentiment point of view, they want to understand how the team is feeling, and to be part of the journey. 

The script talks a lot about “us,” and that “us” isn't just about the team, because we have the 12th man — we have the fan. We wanted to make sure that we created something that recognized the team as a complete circle: the coaching staff, the staff at U.S. Soccer, the men's team and then the millions of people who are going to be supporting the team at the tournament. 

We produced this in-house. We reset the marketing communications function and brought it together, so we now have a holistic view across everything we do as a brand, which we didn't before. Part of this has been science, and part of this has been creativity, which I think is where the best ads always live: they understand the job that they need to do, but they are data-informed. 

The brief was very rich for the creative team, but also our content team, who helped produce this ad and are also with the players, day in, day out. We travel to Europe with them at times to capture content, but when we're in camp with them, we are there, 24/7, so it enables us to make it in-house, because we have an insight that no agency could ever hope to have in that respect. 

Whilst we have an agency partner in M+C Saatchi… we felt very confident in the capability of the folks in-house. We were trusted with something so intimate — the thoughts, hopes and dreams of the players and the coaching staff — that it felt like we were very well equipped to make that in-house.

We obviously have our owned and operated channels, and we will be doing paid as part of this [campaign]. But we also have 118 members organizations and a large fan database. Those people will see the ad first. They are our most precious media and distribution channels, because there are members, coaches, referees, volunteers and staff, and our most loyal fans, so we are actually putting the ad in the hands of those folks to actually push it out first. It will then appear on broadcast media, which is no surprise, and will actually be featured in Times Square. 

But this is also a campaign that is going to live for many months. The sentiment encapsulates the journey that we're on, of which the tournament is one part, but it will very much continue. So you will see this campaign evolve, just like our journey will be evolving. So you'll see the media continue in that respect.

We are also working with a number of partners, as well, to make sure that we are building our own affiliate network for U.S. Soccer. We are looking at seeding out our content with a few selected media partners. Snap is one of them, for example. They are now a distribution partner for us, and we work with them in a very different way for our content, and making sure that they have exclusives.

Ahead of “Never Chase Reality,” we launched our Soccer Forward campaign called “Keeping Score of What Matters,” and it talks about soccer as a force for good. Regardless of your politics, a 90-minute game is a great way to spend time with friends and family. It's good for your mental health, particularly if you're physically involved, and it gives people an opportunity to come together. 

Part of the psychological driver of the work that we did, [we found] the number one reason that people love soccer above any other sport was it because it was a place that they felt they belonged. We don't check your status when you come in. That's not who we are. If you want to play, if you want to watch, if you want to commentate, if you want to have a view, then you are very welcome in soccer. The World Cup will be a beautiful and unifying moment that everybody in the country can enjoy.

If I learned nothing else at WWE, it's that every moment is an is an opportunity for a story. It may not always be the one that people want to hear. It may not always be the thing that people hoped for, but storytelling is incredibly powerful, and keeping people updated with what you're doing is just so important.

We are working to share the U.S. Soccer journey much more than we've ever done before, and it's not because we're doing everything right. We're testing, we're learning. We'll make mistakes along the way, but we are hopefully humble enough to understand that we won't get there by ourselves, that we are a service organization. We need the help of our members, partners, donors, fans and staff. 

WWE talked a lot about the WWE universe, because they recognize everybody had a role to play, and that could not be more true at U.S. Soccer as well. There are different characters here, for sure. We don't have anyone body slamming anyone in a meeting, but it's all good fun.

Mauricio Pochettino hopes soccer fans will feel intense passion and non-soccer fans will get swept up by patriotism during the World Cup run. Jamie Sabau / Getty Images

As the 2026 World Cup came into focus after Friday's draw, U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino reiterated his call for the entire country to get behind his players — and for those players to fight for their country.

The national team, he said, is “not a normal team,” and the World Cup is not a normal event.

“Did you see today?” Pochettino rhetorically asked reporters a few hours after the draw, which doubled as a bizarre, patriotic show described by others in attendance as “very American.”

“We are going to have a country behind us,” Pochettino said. “We are going to play with the emotion of the people.”

He then sent a message to his players: “People need to feel proud about you, but not because you are going to win — we cannot promise that we are going to win — but in the way that you are going to defend your shirt, your flag, your culture, your philosophy. How we are, how the people are here, how the society is, how you think, in a cultural way.

“Every time that we are going to play a game, the World Cup is this.”

Pochettino, an Argentine coach who took charge of the USMNT last year, has spoken frequently about the need for the American public to get behind his team. He began delivering passionate monologues during and after this past summer's Concacaf Gold Cup, when Guatemala and Mexico fans outnumbered U.S. fans at the semifinal and final in St. Louis and Houston.

“The fans,” he said in July, “have one year to realize how important fans are in soccer.”

He now assumes the World Cup will be different. Soccer fans will feel intense passion; non-soccer fans will get swept up by patriotism. SoFi Stadium in Southern California and Lumen Field in Seattle, the USMNT's two group stage venues, will fill with red, white and blue.

For a while, there were questions about public support, as even USMNT die-hards were frustrated by losses and overcome by apathy. The team's second-to-last game of 2025, a 2-1 win over Paraguay — the opponent it will face in its World Cup opener — did not fill an 18,500-seat stadium.

But the U.S. is now riding a five-match unbeaten streak. Its final match of the year was a stunning 5-1 shellacking of Uruguay.

“The last few games, the last few windows, I think the team (showed) a very good thing to the fans,” Pochettino said Friday. “To attract, to say, ‘C'mon, guys, you need to support us,' that is how we feel, how we are. We need your energy, your support. And I think the fans are there, behind the team. And I think it's going to be exciting. We are building a very good relationship. I think we start to show that we are USA.”

With the positive results, the dream of a World Cup run has been rekindled. And the vision of American flags flying, of millions of people inspired, has returned.

That's what people at U.S. Soccer and around the team have envisioned for years. Gregg Berhalter, Pochettino's predecessor, recalled being in Germany during the 2006 World Cup. “Just to see how the fans got behind the country — and it just pivoted, it changed, it became a wave,” Berhalter said in 2024. “And that's what I'd say to fans: This is your opportunity. … The team is trying to do something that's never been done before. So, be part of that.”

Over the nine-decade history of the men's World Cup, there is solid evidence to suggest home advantage can be a powerful force. Six hosts have won the tournament: Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934, England in 1966, West Germany in 1974, Argentina in 1978 and France in 1998. In 2002, co-host South Korea embarked upon a stunning run that saw its group of domestic-based players make it all the way to the semifinals, collecting famous victories over Spain and Italy along the way.

Four years later, as Berhalter referenced, Jurgen Klinsmann united Germany behind a young team that had been written off before the tournament and took it to the brink of the final, before an extra-time defeat to eventual victor Italy. And eight years ago, while the U.S. was licking its wounds from a humiliating and doomed qualifying campaign, Russia's squad quickly drew nationalistic support behind it, ousting heavily-favored Spain in the round of 16 before being squeezed out by Croatia on penalties.

The U.S., which advanced to the round of 16 in 1994, probably belongs in the category of hosts who outperformed their talent as well, a group stage victory over Colombia being the highlight.

Some others have struggled, either unable to lift their standard despite the home support or perhaps overwhelmed by it. Qatar was the first team eliminated from the 2022 World Cup without a single point. South Africa was valiant in 2010 but ultimately exited in the group stage. Brazil crumbled under the unimaginable pressure of hosting the 2014 tournament and infamously lost to Germany in the semifinals 7-1.

Pochettino is wary of that pressure but said, “I think it's good pressure.”

“We need to be careful (with) the message we are going to send,” he continued. “Because every time we are here talking, the players are listening.” But pressure, he said, is OK as long as it's not pressure to win. What it should be is pressure that pushes him and his team to “try to be better.”

Two U.S. midfielders, two contributions for their teams in Europe over the weekend but two contrasting finales. Plus Chris Richards' and Crystal Palace's ascent continues and Noahkai Banks got one over Malik Tillman in Bundesliga.

Welcome to the latest USMNT Player Tracker.

USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino will have clocked Brenden Aaronson and Weston McKennie producing key creative moments this weekend. Both produced differing outcomes.

The former has struggled for consistent starts and minutes back in the Premier League with Leeds United, but on Saturday he took his opportunity from the bench at Elland Road against Liverpool.

Introduced on 65 minutes, the USMNT midfielder produced a trademark driving run to open space down the left, swapped passes with fellow sub Wilfried Gnonto, then played in Anton Stach, who scored from 10 yards out.

🔥 “OHHHH IT'S ANTON STACH!” pic.twitter.com/PLXchW9QXX

— Leeds United (@LUFC) December 7, 2025



It was a big moment in a thrilling game, as Leeds got it back to 2-2. They fell behind again but managed to grab a point thanks to Ao Tanaka's 96th-minute leveller.

The result kept Leeds a couple of points away from the drop zone and may have reminded coach Daniel Farke what the 25-year-old and his ceaseless energy is all about.

Farke will take credit for bringing on the American, alongside Gnonto and Tanaka after his side went 2-0 down. And fair enough, the trio changed the game.

After having to sit and watch the previous surprise win over Chelsea, Aaronson ensured he made his mark when the chance came with all his abundance of energy and commitment.

Meanwhile, in Naples, with his team looking to remind everyone that Juventus can still bother the big boys after a start to the season which has left them outside looking in at the European places in Serie A, McKennie shone until he didn't.

Expectations at Juve usually centre around challenging for domestic titles and major honours, but such is the turbulence of their season so far, that's seemed unlikely.

Instead, they are in seventh place and travelled to face Antonio Conte's Scudetto-chasing side on Sunday.

Even if their form has improved under new manager Luciano Spalletti, Juve's run of eight winless fixtures that saw his predecessor Igor Tudor fired in October, had undermined the first part of their campaign.

So when they were behind after seven minutes courtesy of Rasmus Hojlund's goal, it was a tough start at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.

But just before the hour, McKennie intervened to get them back on track. He was alert to a clever run by striker Kenan Yildiz, and laid a deft pass into the 18-yard box for his team-mate to score.

It was McKennie's first assist of this Serie A season, and seemed a timely moment for him to deliver.

Alas, his evening ended in less satisfactory fashion than Aaronson's. Juve wilted under home pressure as Hojlund got another on 78 minutes that condemned the visitors to their first defeat in six games.

And to add insult to injury, McKennie played a part in Napoli's winner. He got above Noa Lang to try and deal with a cross, but his header went across the face of his own net for Hojlund to score.

At least he has Spalletti's backing. Before the game, the former Italy national team coach told a press conference McKennie is “a strong person who makes a strong footballer.”

“He has this attitude, this way of meeting you halfway, like he's saying: ‘You ask, I'll do,'“ Spalletti said.

“He starts and becomes effective; you can tell he faced his fears when he was young because to become brave, you have to face what scares you. He tries plays that wouldn't normally be a part of his repertoire, but he still tries them.”

It does not sound like the late error will go too heavily against him.

Chris Richards and Crystal Palace just keep getting better.

After winning the club's first major trophy with last season's FA Cup triumph, they have continued as they left off.

Their 2-1 win against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday lifted them into fourth, and the Champions League qualification places, ahead of Chelsea.

The club seem in fine fettle, and in an exclusive interview with The Athletic's Matt Woosnam today, owner Steve Parish credited the recent investment of the New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, who bought a stake in the club previously owned by John Textor.

“Woody has been absolutely fabulous since he's come in,” Parish said. “The speed he did everything in the summer was unbelievable. He flies over for a day to watch a game. He wants to invest in the team and in the stadium and in the players. He loves watching us do well.”

There were goals for a pair of U.S. forwards over the weekend.

In the EFL Championship, Josh Sargent was badly in need of a goal. He had not scored for club or country since the end of August, so will have been encouraged to arrive at Vicarage Road to face Watford on Saturday.

It took him 11 minutes to score what became his sixth goal at Watford's ground, and he has now scored every time he has played there.

That early boost did not ultimately help his ailing team. Norwich City lost 3-2 and are second from bottom.

In Holland, Ricardo Pepi and PSV are enjoying different fortunes.

The defending Eredivisie champions are purring, and the 22-year-old got his fifth league goal of the season in Saturday's 2-0 win at Heerenveen that opened up a six-point gap between them and second-placed Feyenoord.

In Germany, it was another big test for teenage centre-back Noahkai Banks and Augsburg. In opposition were his compatriot Malik Tillman and Bayer Leverkusen, who were on the back of a big away win at Borussia Dortmund.

Augsburg had just been comfortably beaten by Hoffenheim, but on Saturday they bounced back in style to climb away from the relegation places with a surprise 2-0 win.

Banks was excellent, winning the most duels (eight) in the game according to Opta, and is improving all the time.

All that amid the backdrop of manager Sandro Wagner being sacked last week, and replaced by interim coach Manuel Baum.

There's more Champions League action this week. But to kick us off in Serie A today, see if Christian Pulisic returns for Milan as they travel to Torino (14:45, Paramount +).

On Wednesday, Tillman and company will have the opportunity to respond to their defeat by Augbsurg when they host Newcastle United in the Champions League (3pm, Paramount +).

PSV and their American duo will want to keep their winning streak going when they take on Johnny Cardoso's Atletico Madrid on Tuesday (3pm, Paramount +), although the Atleti midfielder missed their weekend defeat by Athletic Club with a knee injury.

Then on Thursday in the Europa Conference League, Chris Richards and Crystal Palace head to Ireland to play Shelbourne at their 5,700-capacity Tolka Park stadium (3pm, Paramount +).

Next Monday, Tyler Adams will be back from his one-game suspension for picking up five bookings and will hope to help Bournemouth beat Manchester United at Old Trafford (3pm, Peacock Premium).

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Draw

Last summer's Club World Cup featured many afternoon games during a heat wave across the U.S. PAUL ELLIS / Getty Images

Every 2026 World Cup game will pause for three minutes in the middle of each half for a “hydration break”, FIFA announced Sunday.

The new measure — which will essentially split the match into quarters, à la basketball or American football — was discussed at meetings with coaches and broadcasters this weekend adjacent to Friday's World Cup draw.

It received sufficient support from all parties, including FIFA's medical team. It is, first and foremost, a player safety measure, FIFA said. But it will also have sporting implications; the breaks allow coaches to speak with players and tweak tactics.

For decades, professional soccer games worldwide have comprised two halves of 45 minutes. They are only interrupted by injuries or if hot weather calls for a “cooling break”. Those cooling breaks have been increasingly introduced in recent years as the planet warms, and as science around exertion in extreme heat has become more advanced.

But the breaks have typically been dependent on temperature and humidity. In most leagues and tournaments, if it's a cool 70 degrees Fahrenheit, matches don't pause mid-half.

In 2026, for the first time at a World Cup, they'll pause no matter what, around 22 minutes into each half.

“There will be no weather or temperature condition in place, with the breaks being called by the referee in all games, to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches,” FIFA said in a release posted online late Sunday night.

Manolo Zubiria, FIFA's 2026 World Cup chief tournament officer, told stakeholders at a World Broadcaster Meeting in Washington, D.C., that the breaks would “be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves.”

“Obviously, if there's an injury (stoppage) at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee,” Zubiria added, according to FIFA.

The clock will not stop for the breaks, but three minutes will be added at the end of each half as stoppage time.

The new policy will please player welfare advocates, though it's not exactly what FIFPRO, an umbrella organization representing players unions worldwide, argued for this past summer.

“Cooling breaks at the 30th minute and 75th minute are quite traditional, but from a physiological point of view it does not make sense,” Vincent Gouttebarge, FIFPRO's medical director, said on a Zoom call with reporters in June. “Even if you ingest more than 200 milliliters of fluid, you already cannot take it all. So I would definitely like to see some project where we look at the efficacy of perhaps more frequent but shorter cooling breaks — every 15 minutes, rather than only one during each half.”

Concern spiked last summer during the Club World Cup, which featured many afternoon games during a heat wave across the U.S. The semifinals and final all kicked off at 3 p.m. in temperatures above 90 degrees at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (FIFA, responding to concerns and player complaints, lowered the threshold for cooling breaks mid-tournament.)

FIFA crafted the 2026 World Cup schedule to largely avoid such heat. Most afternoon games will be played in air-conditioned, roofed stadiums or in cities with temperate climates. Most games in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Miami, Kansas City and Monterrey will kick off in the evening to mitigate risk. (Most, though not all; the final will once again start at 3 p.m. at MetLife.)

The hydration breaks will also allow broadcasters to air more mid-game commercials, if they wish.

Also at the broadcast meeting, representatives from TV rights holders around the globe were told that FIFA plans to stage three different opening ceremonies at the 2026 World Cup — one before the tournament's very first game at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, one before Canada's opener at BMO Field in Toronto, and a third later that day before the U.S. opener at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.

The tournament will open June 11 and feature 104 matches in 39 days, concluding with the final on July 19.

The countdown is on! From epic NFL arenas to legendary soccer cathedrals, these are the top 5 stadiums hosting the world's biggest crowds at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

FIFA says it will include three-minute hydration breaks in each half of every game at next year's World Cup, not just those played in hot weather.

The referee will stop the game 22 minutes into each half for players to take drinks, regardless of the temperature, the host country — the United States, Canada or Mexico — or whether the stadium has a roof and air conditioning.

The change may also be a hit with broadcasters, since it makes the game schedule more predictable. FIFA said it was first announced when the governing body's chief tournament officer for the 2026 World Cup, Manolo Zubiria, attended a meeting with broadcasters.

He indicated that referees may have some flexibility if there's a stoppage shortly before the 22-minute mark for an injury.

“This will be addressed on the spot with the referee,” Zubiria said.

FIFA said the move is a “streamlined and simplified version” of an earlier practice of having breaks after 30 minutes over a certain temperature threshold, once set at 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit) on the wet bulb global temperature system.

The change comes after heat and humidity affected players during some games at this year's Club World Cup in the U.S.



At that tournament, FIFA reacted by lowering the threshold for cooling or water breaks and also placing more water and towels around the edge of the field.

Heat has long been an issue at major soccer tournaments. Amid concerns ahead of the 2014 World Cup, a Brazilian court ordered FIFA to make its recommended breaks mandatory or face fines.","{'href': 'https://www.nbcmiami.com', 'title': 'NBC 6 South Florida'}","soccer"

The 2026 World Cup will be the largest edition in the tournament's history, but it will also serve as the stage for several new rule changes in global soccer. Adjustments are still being finalized with less than seven months until kickoff, and one of FIFA's most recent announcements directly targets concerns raised during the 2025 Club World Cup.

The United States has hosted multiple major soccer events, including the 2024 Copa América and the 2025 Club World Cup, all with the aim of preparing for the 2026 World Cup. One of the main worries ahead of the tournament, which kicks off in June of next year, is the extreme heat players will face, a concern that also surfaced during the Club World Cup. Now, FIFA has taken steps to address the issue.

FIFA announced Sunday that the 2026 World Cup will feature a three-minute pause in the middle of each half for a designated “hydration break.” While cooling breaks have been used in recent years, this marks the first time a specific timeline and duration will be formally established, giving players a structured window to recover and fans clearer expectations for when play will resume.

With matches now effectively split into quarters (featuring a 15-minute halftime break and short stoppages around the 22nd and 67th minutes) the measure aims to protect player health and safety during a tournament held at the peak of summer. Coaches will also be allowed to communicate with players during these pauses, creating opportunities for tactical adjustments.

To suit global audiences, several matches in the 2025 Club World Cup, especially those involving European teams, were scheduled for midday in the United States. While convenient for fans watching from across the Atlantic, the heat created serious concerns among players who struggled to cope with the high temperatures.

One of them was Chelsea's Enzo Fernández, who required medical attention for heat exhaustion during the match against Fluminense. Before the final, the midfielder voiced his frustration: “The heat is incredible. The other day I got a bit dizzy during a play and had to go down to the ground. Playing in this kind of temperature is very dangerous… Hopefully next year they change the schedule at least, so that it's more of a show, and football stays beautiful and exciting.”

FIFA president Gianni Infantino later addressed the issue directly during a media briefing in New York: “Every criticism we receive is a source for us to study and analyze what can do better. Of course the heat is an issue. Last year, at the Olympic Games in Paris, games during the day, in all sports, took place in very hot conditions. Cooling breaks are very important and we will see what we can do, but we have stadiums with roofs and we will definitely use these stadiums during the day next year.”

With the World Cup spread across three countries, venue conditions will vary, and not all stadiums can guarantee relief from extreme heat. Now, FIFA has taken a major step by formally defining the timing, duration, and purpose of in-match cooling breaks for the first time.

Nine (9) MLS clubs will compete in the 2026 Concacaf Champions Cup, the 27-team continental tournament that occurs from February through May 2026.

The winner secures a spot in the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA Intercontinental Cup.

^ Bye to Round of 16

Every team that qualified

FC Cincinnati fell short of a trophy in 2025, though Pat Noonan's squad remained among the most competitive in MLS.

Best XI midfielder Evander (18g/15a) and club-record signing Kévin Denkey (15g/2a) proved lethal in the final third, and USMNT center back Miles Robinson kept chasing a 2026 FIFA World Cup roster spot.

Inter Miami will compete in their third straight Concacaf Champions Cup and, as MLS Cup champions, have earned a bye to the Round of 16. They also made the Leagues Cup final in 2025.

During last campaign, Lionel Messi set an MLS record with 63 goal contributions across the regular season and Audi MLS Cup Playoffs. This winter, they'll look to replace Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets after the Spain and FC Barcelona legends retired from professional soccer.

Son Heung-Min will make his CCC debut after joining LAFC in August on a league-record deal from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur.

The South Korean superstar tallied 12g/4a in 13 games (all competitions), striking up a dangerous partnership with three-time MLS Best XI forward Denis Bouanga.

Galaxy midfielder Riqui Puig returns from an ACL injury in 2026, giving the six-time MLS Cup champions a huge boost. The Spanish midfielder missed the club's entire 2025 campaign while recovering.

Without Puig, LA's title defense fell well short. Joseph Paintsil was their top scorer with 10 goals; he helped Ghana qualify for the 2026 World Cup.

Nashville won their first title in 2025, securing a 2-1 victory at Austin FC in the US Open Cup final. That came during the club's first full season under head coach B.J. Callaghan.

Star attackers Sam Surridge (24g/5a) and Hany Mukhtar (16g/12a) were named MLS All-Stars alongside right back Andy Najar. Additionally, Surridge finished third in the MLS Golden Boot presented by Audi race behind Messi and Bouanga.

Philadelphia lifted their second Supporters' Shield title during the 2025 campaign, their first under Bradley Carnell. That propelled the South African manager to 2025 Sigi Schmid MLS Coach of the Year honors.

With a development-centric club philosophy, is Union midfielder Cavan Sullivan due for a breakout year? The US youth international phenom recently starred at the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup.

San Diego make their CCC debut after a historic season. In 2025, they set expansion records for regular-season points (63) and wins (19) en route to the Western Conference Final.

Anders Dreyer was named the MLS Newcomer of the Year following 19g/19a in 34 games, while Mexican star Chucky Lozano provided 10g/9a in 27 matches.

Seattle earned a bye into the Round of 16, courtesy of a 3-0 victory over Inter Miami in the Leagues Cup final. That match was played before a tournament and club-record 69,314 fans at Lumen Field.

The Sounders have filled their trophy cabinet with every major piece of North American silverware on offer, and had a solid showing last summer at the FIFA Club World Cup.

Vancouver won their fourth consecutive Canadian Championship, though technically qualified via their MLS regular-season performance.

The Whitecaps, who also made CCC and MLS Cup finals in 2025, are led by German star Thomas Müller. He contributed 9g/4a in 13 matches (all competitions) upon arriving mid-summer from Bayern Munich.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

Seattle's World Cup “Pride Match” will feature Iran and Egypt, two countries where homosexuality is illegal, on June 26. 

The Group G clash, taking place on a Friday at Lumen Field, coincides with the city's pride weekend. 

The Pride Match was planned before the teams were selected and in advance of the Friday's 2026 World Cup Draw in Washington D.C.

“The Pride Match has been scheduled to celebrate and elevate Pride events in Seattle and across the country, and it was planned well in advance,” a spokesperson of the Pride Match Advisory Committee told Outsports. 

“It is a Host City–led expression of Seattle and Washington State's commitment to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone belongs: players, fans, residents, and visitors alike. Soccer has a unique power to unite people across borders, cultures and beliefs.

“We are honored to host a Pride Match and to celebrate Pride as part of a global football community. This match reflects our ongoing commitment to respect, dignity, and unity for all.”

The local organizing committee in Seattle, which is one of the U.S. host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, announced a Pride Match design contest over the summer — inviting artists from Washington State “with credibility in authentically representing the LGBTQ+ community” to submit their concept.

In a disclaimer on the Seattle World Cup website, the organizing committee said “the Pride Match design is an independent creation specifically for the Seattle FWC26 LOC and is not an official FIFA asset. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by FIFA.”

Last month, the Seattle World Cup committee announced the three finalists selected for their original Pride Match designs. 

Lumen Field will host six World Cup events in total, including the USMNT's second group stage match on June 19. 

The anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising is June 28, commemorating when New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay club located in Greenwich Village. 

The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar ran into issues regarding LGBTQ+ rights in the Middle East.

Homosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable up to three years in prison. 

At the time, FIFA said players that wore “OneLove” armbands in support of LGBTQ+ community would receive yellow cards.

Security also cracked down on rainbow banners and other Pride related logos and messaging during the 2022 World Cup. 

American journalist Grant Wahl — who died of an ascending aortic aneurysm in Qatar while covering the World Cup — tweeted that he was not let into the stadium for the US-Wales match because of his shirt, which had a soccer ball surrounded by a rainbow.

His brother, Eric Wahl, who is a member of the Seattle Pride Match Advisory Committee and an out gay man, said he believes the Iran-Egypt match “is a good thing” because “all are welcome to to be themselves in Seattle.”

FIFA World Cup 2026 to have two mandatory hydration breaks lasting three minutes each

Two scheduled hydration breaks will take place in every match: one at 22 minutes in each half

The decision follows concerns raised during the FIFA Club World Cup 2023 in the United States

FIFA has confirmed that three-minute hydration breaks will be implemented in both halves of every match at the 2026 World Cup, making the practice standardised rather than dependent on heat conditions.

The decision applies across all three host nations – the United States, Canada and Mexico – regardless of temperature, venue design, or the presence of air-conditioning systems in the stadiums.

Under the new procedure, the referee will halt play 22 minutes into each half to allow players to rehydrate. FIFA noted that officials may exercise limited discretion. If there is a natural stoppage shortly before the planned break, such as an injury, the referee may make an on-sport adjustment.

This uniform approach replaces the previous system, in which water breaks were triggered only when temperatures exceeded a set threshold – formerly 32°C on the wet-bulb globe temperature scale. FIFA described the new model as a “streamlined and simplified” version of earlier protocols.

The governing body's decision comes after player welfare concerns resurfaced during last year's FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, where high heat and humidity had a clear impact on performances. In response, FIFA temporarily lowered the threshold for cooling breaks and increased access to water and towels around the pitch.

The new rule is therefore framed as a proactive, player-first measure designed to reduce fatigue, heat stress and overall physical risk.

FIFA acknowledged that the rule may also benefit broadcasters by making match timing more predictable. The policy was first outlined by Manolo Zubiria, FIFA's chief tournament officer for the 2026 World Cup, during a meeting with broadcast partners.

By formalising the breaks, scheduling becomes more consistent, reducing uncertainty for live coverage and commercial slots.

Heat management has been a recurring issue in major international competitions. During the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, concerns over player safety led a Brazilian court to mandate water breaks, threatening fines if FIFA failed to implement them.

With the FIFA World Cup 2026 set to be the largest in history, featuring 48 teams and increased travel between venues, FIFA's universal hydration-break policy represents an effort to standardise protections across all matches and climates.

Egypt and Iran have been drawn in 2026 World Cup Group G alongside Belgium and New Zealand

A 2026 World Cup fixture designated by organisers as an LGBTQ+ 'Pride Match' will feature two countries where homosexuality is illegal.

The local organising committee in Seattle, one of the host cities for the Fifa tournament next summer, have said the match at the city's Lumen Field on 26 June will feature celebrations of the LGBTQ+ community.

The plans were put in place before the teams involved in the fixture were selected or the draw for the 2026 World Cup was made.

And following Friday's draw and Saturday's fixture allocation, it has been confirmed that the game on 26 June in Seattle will be the Group G match between Egypt and Iran.

In Iran, the maximum punishment for homosexual relations is the death penalty, while in Egypt, morality laws are frequently used to suppress LGBTQ+ rights and relationships.

The event - which is organised solely by the local committee and is not affiliated with Fifa - will take place on the Friday of Seattle's official Pride weekend, with artists in Washington state invited to submit designs of artwork, external celebrating LGBTQ+ people for display around the game and city.

The Seattle Pride Match Advisory Committee, set up by organisers to help with the event, say the game will still go ahead as planned.

A spokesperson told LGBT news outlet Outsports:, external ""The Pride Match has been scheduled to celebrate and elevate Pride events in Seattle and across the country, and it was planned well in advance.

""Soccer has a unique power to unite people across borders, cultures, and beliefs. We are honoured to host a Pride Match and to celebrate Pride as part of a global football community. 

""This match reflects our ongoing commitment to respect, dignity, and unity for all.""

It is not the first time an attempted gesture of support for LGBTQ+ people at the World Cup has run into issues.

At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - which also has laws against same-sex relationships - Fifa said players that wore the OneLove armband in support of LGBTQ+ people would receive yellow cards. 

England and Wales were among the teams who had planned to wear the band, but decided against it following Fifa's ruling.

BBC Sport has contacted Fifa, the Seattle organising committee and the Egyptian and Iranian Football Associations for comment.

The Group G clash, taking place on a Friday at Lumen Field, coincides with the city's pride weekend. 

The Pride Match was planned before the teams were selected and in advance of the Friday's 2026 World Cup Draw in Washington D.C. 

“The Pride Match has been scheduled to celebrate and elevate Pride events in Seattle and across the country, and it was planned well in advance,” a spokesperson of the Pride Match Advisory Committee told Outsports. 

“It is a Host City–led expression of Seattle and Washington State's commitment to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone belongs: players, fans, residents, and visitors alike. Soccer has a unique power to unite people across borders, cultures and beliefs. 

“We are honored to host a Pride Match and to celebrate Pride as part of a global football community. This match reflects our ongoing commitment to respect, dignity, and unity for all.”

The local organizing committee in Seattle, which is one of the U.S. host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, announced a Pride Match design contest over the summer — inviting artists from Washington State “with credibility in authentically representing the LGBTQ+ community” to submit their concept.

In a disclaimer on the Seattle World Cup website, the organizing committee said “the Pride Match design is an independent creation specifically for the Seattle FWC26 LOC and is not an official FIFA asset. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by FIFA.” 

Last month, the Seattle World Cup committee announced the three finalists selected for their original Pride Match designs. 

Lumen Field will host six World Cup events in total, including the USMNT's second group stage match on June 19. 

The anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising is June 28, commemorating when New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay club located in Greenwich Village. 

The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar ran into issues regarding LGBTQ+ rights in the Middle East.

Homosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable up to three years in prison. 

At the time, FIFA said players that wore “OneLove” armbands in support of LGBTQ+ community would receive yellow cards.

Security also cracked down on rainbow banners and other Pride related logos and messaging during the 2022 World Cup. 

American journalist Grant Wahl — who died of an ascending aortic aneurysm in Qatar while covering the World Cup — tweeted that he was not let into the stadium for the US-Wales match because of his shirt, which had a soccer ball surrounded by a rainbow.

His brother, Eric Wahl, who is a member of the Seattle Pride Match Advisory Committee and an out gay man, said he believes the Iran-Egypt match “is a good thing” because “all are welcome to to be themselves in Seattle.”

A World Cup match hosted in Seattle in the summer of 2026 and billed as a celebration of LGBTQ+ pride will feature Egypt and Iran—two nations where homosexuality is all but illegal and queer communities face severe repression.

SeattleFWC26, the local organizing committee, emphasized that the Pride Match designation is independent and “not affiliated with or endorsed by FIFA,” according to its website. 

Newsweek reached out to the Seattle FWC26 committee for comment on Monday.

The Group G fixture, set for June 26 at Lumen Field, was designated a “Pride Match” by Seattle's local organizing committee well before the tournament draw. Timed to align with the city's official Pride weekend, the event is intended to promote inclusion and visibility within the global football community.

Local organizers have partnered with artists across Washington state to create LGBTQ-themed public artwork that will be displayed throughout the city during the match.

As the World Cup draw unfolded and match assignments were finalized, none of the host cities—including Seattle—knew in advance which countries they would be staging. But once the schedule confirmed that Egypt and Iran would meet in Seattle's designated Pride Match, the pairing quickly drew international attention.

Both governments criminalize same-sex relationships: in Iran, homosexuality can be punishable by death, while in Egypt, LGBTQ+ individuals are frequently targeted under public morality laws and prosecuted for “debauchery.”

The match presents a complex scenario for Seattle organizers, who have set up a Pride Match Advisory Committee (PMAC) to “shape the communications, community activations, and cultural programming” for the festivities. Yet the PMAC remains confident.

“The Pride Match has been scheduled to celebrate and elevate Pride events in Seattle and across the country, and it was planned well in advance,” a spokesperson for the Pride Match Advisory Committee (PMAC) said in a statement to Outsports. “It is a Host City–led expression of Seattle and Washington State's commitment to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone belongs—players, fans, residents, and visitors alike.”

The matchup presents an early test for FIFA. During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, another country with draconian laws against same-sex relationships, the soccer governing body faced international criticism for threatening to sanction players who wore the rainbow-colored “OneLove” armbands.

Several European teams, including England and Wales, dropped plans to wear the bands after FIFA warned that players could be penalized on the field. Others, like Germany, protested by covering their mouths during the team photos before their matches.

Hedda McLendon, Senior Vice President of Legacy at SeattleFWC26, to Outsports: “We're working with small businesses so the region's LGBTQ+-owned enterprises are ready to benefit from the tournament's unprecedented visitor surge.”

Eric Wahl, member of the Seattle PMAC and brother of late journalist Grant Wahl, on social media: ""The match-up of two countries where it is illegal to be gay is actually a 'good thing' for the Pride Match"".

FIFA has not yet commented on the Seattle Pride Match, nor have the football federations of Egypt or Iran. It is too early to say whether players or officials from either side will participate in or acknowledge the Pride-focused aspects of the event.

Urban Pitch contributor Zach Lowy gives his personal experience at what was a chaos-filled draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

Snow. Why did there have be to snow?

As I roused from my bed at 7:30 a.m. on Friday morning, I was greeted with a peculiar sight: snow in December. As someone who has spent his entire life in the Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area, I had grown accustomed to snow coming — if at all — only in January or February.

Many people hadn't even bought their Christmas trees yet, but there was the snow, falling down from the sky and sticking to the ground like a parasite to a host. It was akin to opening your curtains to see a giraffe chewing on a pine tree. I immediately was tasked with a dilemma, one that I failed and paid dearly for: whether to wear my hiking boots or my sneakers.

I was going to have to brave the weather, as today was the highly anticipated 2026 FIFA World Cup draw, hosted at the Kennedy Center, two miles west of the White House. And I was going to be there in person.

The drive from the Maryland suburbs to Washington D.C. was fairly straightforward, save for some road closures and traffic congestions in the final stretch of the commute, but I eventually arrived at the Watergate Hotel, where I picked up my accreditation before heading for the Kennedy Center. It was there where I found myself up against my worst nightmare: two makeshift lines teeming with people.

If I was going to make it to the start of the draw, I was going to do it the hard way. This would prove to be an omen for the actual TV broadcast of the World Cup draw.

As I engaged new friendships with colleagues from Germany, Egypt, and the United States, discussing everything from study abroad experiences in Madrid to Arsenal's title prospects and Said El Mala's emergence in Cologne's attack, I found myself getting more and more desperate for warmth. And while another line magically opened up on the left side and cleared in a matter of minutes, us mere mortals were stuck waiting in the frigid D.C. winter.

“Getting to the Kennedy Center was simple on public transportation, but the security experience outside was abysmal,” said Forbes journalist Vitas Carosella to Urban Pitch. “One security checkpoint for all media and guests in the freezing cold was a poor logistical decision and made journalists scramble to get food and find seating ahead of the draw. The security experience dampened the draw experience, but the draw itself and the mixed zone were executed well given the amount of media there.”

My puffer jacket provided a stalwart barrier from the torrid weather, however my Nikes offered no such protection, with the hibernal conditions showing no signs of letting up just as the lines showed no signs of moving forward. This was no light snow — it was as if Zeus was loading up a magazine of snowballs and launching it down to Earth, with the snow melting on my decidedly non-weatherproof shoes and chilling my feet. Pretty soon, the only thing on my mind wasn't football, but avoiding frostbite and pneumonia.

But just when I found my way to the front of the line, I was told that security had announced a hard pause on scanning people through and inspecting their bags; the lines screeched to a halt for 20 minutes before things finally got back on track. After three hours of waiting it out in frigid conditions, I finally reached the finish line, where I found a catacomb of water bottles whose owners had been led to believe they could bring with them.

I walked through the metal scanner and opened my jacket to be examined before finally making it through and heading to the media entrance, where I embraced the building's heating system with the utmost gratitude. At last, I had finally arrived to my first-ever live tournament draw. At last, the arduous journey was over and done with, at last, I could focus on the destination.

The first stop was the media cafe where, for once, I entered a line moving at a reasonable pace and inched my way towards a three-pronged buffet featuring Mexican, American, and Canadian cuisine like tacos, burgers, and poutine, as well as water, soda and coffee. I then oscillated between the various adjacent media theaters, watching on the big screen as the “draw” took place in a different section of the Kennedy Center.

Ultimately, the draw seemed to be the last thing on FIFA's mind. Instead, it was shoved into the background to make space for non-footballing matters, be that musical performances from the likes of Lauryn Hill, Robbie Williams, and Nicole Scherzinger, whose last big hits came two decades ago, commercials with famed actors like Matthew McConaughey and Salma Hayek, or a cringeworthy skit featuring a group of kids trying to teach Rio Ferdinand how the new selection process works.

The Kennedy Center featured a plethora of sporting legends like Eli Manning, Thierry Henry, Iker Casillas, Hugo Sánchez, and Ronaldo Nazario as well as political figures like Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. But there was no doubt about who the most important person in the room was, at least in the eyes of FIFA President Gianni Infantino: U.S. President Donald Trump.

Two months after missing out on a Nobel Peace Prize that he steadfastly lobbied for, Trump was awarded the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. The participation trophy was the latest in a long line of love letters from Infantino to Trump, which include overseeing FIFA's rental of office space in Trump Tower in New York just two years after opening a new facility in Miami, allowing Trump to be in the post-match celebrations at the FIFA Club World Cup final, and even hosting the draw at the Kennedy Center, conveniently located down the street from the Oval Office.

Infantino became FIFA president in 2016, the same year that Trump was first elected — and since taking the reigns he has made sure to ingratiate himself to Trump in order to ensure a smooth operation at the 2026 World Cup. We saw a subtle reminder of this when, after requesting Trump to walk to the front of the stage, he obliged, “You can do what you want,” when he decided to walk behind the podium instead.

All things considered, it seemed that the actual draw of countries was the last thing on anyone's minds. Two hours had passed, and nobody knew anything about the different groups — it was as if they were cramming the most important thing into the bottom the suitcase to make room for as many other objects as they could.

Eventually, the World Cup draw finally got underway, with Ferdinand and Samantha Johnson replacing Kevin Hart and Heidi Klum as the presenters and welcoming a host of North American sports stars in Shaquille O'Neal, Aaron Judge, Wayne Gretzky, and Tom Brady to crack open the balls and reveal which teams from which pots were going in which groups.

Prior to this point, every single step in this journey had been seemingly delayed to the maximum. But when it came to actually going over the key talking points, discussing each group and the potential match-ups, and analyzing what was at stake, the draw itself was played at 1.5x speed.

Instead of gradually building the excitement and shining the spotlight on the main spectacle, FIFA chose to sacrifice precious time for other pressing topics, like consistently interrupting the draw so that Danny Ramirez could complete a flash interview with a retired athlete.

By jamming so many other unnecessary items into the show, FIFA was forced to leave out so many other important things, like the announcements of the time and location of each game, which was postponed for Saturday. They zoomed through the only part that actually mattered like a speed racer on the Autobahn, and it wasn't until I was back home that I was able to truly process and absorb the various group stage matchups.

Rather than watching The Village People perform “YMCA,” I chose to exit the building and head for the mixed zone center, where, despite having my badge successfully scanned through, I was forced to go through two subsequent examinations by two different FIFA volunteers before finally being allowed to do my job and interview the game's top international managers and get a proper discussion of the next summer's action.

Mexico will kick off the tournament against South Africa in a rematch of the 2010 opener, with Mexico playing host this time around. These two sides will compete against South Korea and a pending European team in Group A. Denmark will face off against North Macedonia on March 26 in Copenhagen, and if they win, they will meet either Czechia or the Republic of Ireland five days later in a do-or-die match. Out of these four teams, only Denmark competed in the last World Cup in Qatar.

“A lot of things have happened since the last World Cup,” said Denmark manager Brian Riemer to Urban Pitch. “There has been kind of a generational change throughout the last six to seven months. You saw that in the last two games we played, 10 of the guys had fewer than 10 caps, so it's quite a young team that's developing and that has a great future at the moment. Hopefully we can start that journey in Mexico and America. Denmark is doing really well right now, but they also have a great future ahead of them.”

Similarly to co-hosts Mexico and the U.S., Canada was given a fairly hospitable draw after landing in the same group as Qatar, Switzerland, and a to-be-determined European team: either Wales, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, or Northern Ireland.

Canada has built some momentum in recent years, and reached the semifinals of the 2024 Copa América. However, the nation has still yet to register a point at the World Cup, losing all six of its matches across two tournaments.

“We're clearly more advanced as a team than we were at [the Copa],” said Canada manager Jesse Marsch in an interview with R.Org. “We also caught some teams by surprise a little bit because they didn't know everything that we were going to be about.”

But while Canada have a golden opportunity to secure their first-ever result in the World Cup, Switzerland looms large as a nation with plenty of talent.

“We have players who have played in big teams and big leagues, we know how the World Cup works, so all of our players are motivated,” said Switzerland manager Murat Yakin to Urban Pitch. “We have a good mix of leaders like Granit Xhaka and Manuel Akanji and young players.

“From the last World Cup, a lot has changed as experienced players have stopped their careers, and we've found a good solution by getting through strong teams like Sweden, Slovenia, and Kosovo and making it through qualification. All of this has helped to build up our team's potential, and we are now ready to go in this fight and are happy to play in Canada.”

In group C, Brazil is seeking a record-extending sixth World Cup title and will be challenging Morocco, who had an inspired run to the semifinals in 2022, for the top spot. Meanwhile, Scotland is seeking to make a splash in its first World Cup since 1998, and Haiti is looking to impress in what will be its first World Cup in 52 years.

“The main strength for Haiti is unity,” said Haiti manager Sébastien Migné to Urban Pitch. “If we continue like that during the World Cup, it will not be easy for our opponents. Of course, in terms of individuality, we cannot compete with Brazil; it would be stupid to say that. But in terms of unity, we will be there. I expect that. We have no other choice if we want to qualify [for the knockout round].”

Now with the chaos of the draw behind us, the time for speculation, prediction, and even further anticipation is upon us. Stay tuned for what promises to be an epic World Cup in North America.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Friday's ceremony in Washington DC was cringe-inducing and craven enough to make football fans nostalgic for the reign of Sepp Blatter

Well, that was awful, wasn't it? Donald Trump's heroic victory over a field of one to claim the inaugural Fifa peace prize, on-stage banter so dead it was already fossilized, Gianni Infantino doing crowd work, and Wayne Gretzky struggling through the pronunciation of “Macedonia” and “Curaçao” in the draw's linguistic group of death: even with the benefit of a few days' distance it's impossible to overstate how impressively bad the draw for the 2026 World Cup, held last Friday at the Trump-purged Kennedy Center in Washington DC, was.

“This is America, so we have to put on a show!” roared Fifa president Infantino, resembling a Sphinx cat in a borrowed suit, at the beginning of the ceremony. And put on a show Fifa did – just not one that anyone wanted to watch, least of all a desperately bored-looking Trump, who sat through Andrea Bocelli's Nessun Dorma with the granitic joylessness that has become his default expression at each of the sporting events he's ruined with his presence this year. Just let the man get back to the White House; he's the president of the United States, for god's sake, he has bathrooms to redesign.

If this was a preview of next summer, the 23rd Mundial is on course for catastrophe. Danny Ramirez and Rio Ferdinand, in particular, seemed to generate some kind of purely negative chemistry that could make a useful contribution to science. The US president may have been the headliner but Infantino stole the show: he led the American, Canadian, and Mexican segments of the audience in a series of chants that pointlessly chewed up 10 minutes on the clock, then got properly frothing – the real work of the Fifa president at an event such as this – as he welcomed the host nations' leaders on stage to begin the draw. “Which team – will be drawn – by Mr Mark Carney?” he devilishly asked, with all the charisma of a middle-aged magician doing card tricks for small change at a weekend farmer's market.

Infantino genuinely seems to believe he's some kind of comedian, but all the laughs he raised from the audience on Friday sounded coerced – like the laughter you might offer a wisecracking dentist as you're in the treatment chair about to undergo an extraction. It takes a rare talent to make football fans nostalgic for Sepp Blatter, but Fifa's presiding gollum is so insistently unpleasant, such a strange, damp little man, that he makes his famously venal predecessor look positively dapper and twinkle-eyed in comparison. The last World Cup draw held on US soil, in which Robin Williams monkeyed about on stage calling Blatter “Mr Bladder”, was a minor comic miracle. Instead of Robin Williams, this launch got Robbie Williams, a devastating drop in off-field quality that also showed how much football's ambitions in America have changed over the past 30 years. Rather than conquering America in a blaze of ambition and comedy, as the World Cup aimed to in 1994, this tournament is all about the consolidation of football as a tepid global lifestyle product, combining the worst of American sport's commercialism, European football's extractivism, and the moral turpitude of the Washington-to-Riyadh illiberal axis.

“We love soccer! We rock!” the chorus echoed as Williams moped about the Kennedy Center stage on Friday, grayly delivering his rendition of the new official Fifa anthem, Desire. But is it soccer, or football? Well, unfortunately the World Cup draw had a lot to say about that too, in a series of “fun” segments debating what to call the sport in America (who cares?) that briefly threatened to kill anyone with an IQ over 50. Over on the set of host broadcaster Fox, new network talent Thierry Henry, holding on for dear life in the blast zone of Alexi Lalas's jingoism, looked almost immediately regretful about his decision to accept the assignment as American TV's token big tournament Euro. Giorgio Chiellini and others have taken on this task in previous years and made it to the end looking like they've lived through centuries. Why, Titi, why?

Predictably, all the emotional meat of Friday's ceremony was in the theatre of a Fifa president groveling before America's would-be king. Over the past few months, as Trump has overseen the destruction of the East Wing, begun work on his cherished ballroom, and set about transforming the White House into a Live Laugh Love-themed suburban wedding reception center, it's been reasonable to wonder where exactly they'll put Infantino's bedroom. A closet with a camp bed off the ballroom kitchen, perhaps? A tent illuminated by the light of Trump's iPad on the new Rose Garden patio? Now we have the answer: Infantino does not need a room in the presidential home because he's taken up residence directly in Trump's pocket. Through all the trials and setbacks of power, it must be reassuring for Trump to wake every morning and slip straight into his Gianni slacks, safe in the knowledge that the head of the world's biggest sport – hairless dome crowning from the hip pocket – will gas him up no matter how many US citizens he sends to the gulag in El Salvador or blameless fishermen he blasts out of the Caribbean. Would that we could all have a Gianni in our lives, though preferably not in our pants.

Infantino introduced Trump on stage and presented him with three mementoes to mark the inaugural Fifa peace prize: a trophy, modeled seemingly on a UN sculpture in Geneva but echoing in its form the cover of a racist novel of the 1970s that has inspired the modern American far right; a medal; and a signed certificate. (Presumably these will have to make way on the Oval Office mantelpiece next year for whatever Fifa gives Trump for winning the second annual Fifa peace prize.) Amid all this debasement the one redeeming note was that Infantino, rather humiliatingly, made Trump put the medal around his own neck, which the president duly did with all the grace of a tapeworm exiting the cloaca. “This is your prize, this is your peace prize!” Infantino yelped.

The whole thing was so overblown, so grotesquely obsequious, that even Trump seemed to find it a little offputting. Whether any of this – the embarrassment of Infantino's lickspittle performance at the draw, the storm of mockery that greeted the decision to placate America's toddler-in-chief with a made-up peace prize in the first place, the unpardonable tackiness of the entire spectacle – will stop Fifa from making 2026 all about Trump seems unlikely.

On the one hand, Trumpian nativism is an inherently awkward fit for the World Cup, which even in the moral quicksands of Qatar still made a basic effort to advance its boilerplate clichés about openness to the world, inclusivity (“Today I feel, ah… gay”), and global friendship. On the other, next year's tournament won't be the first time that sport and authoritarian theatrics have come together on the global stage; we know from the 1936 Berlin Olympics that international sport and fascism mix easily, that they're a match made in high-camp heaven. Fifa's customary blather about equal rights and an end to racism has been swiftly forgotten amid the urgent task of getting on good terms with America's reigning fascist. The organization that tied itself in ethical knots over recent years to keep politics out of sport – who remembers the debacle over the OneLove armband? – seems determined to remake itself as Maga's external affairs department. Perhaps we can all hope for a resurrection of the Fifa boss who declared, in Qatar, that Europeans should spend 3,000 years apologizing for the suffering they've inflicted on the world, but that seems like a message unlikely to endear him to the white supremacists and Great Replacement freaks who run America today.

So enthusiastic is Infantino's tonguing of the Trumpian boot that it's fair to wonder how much worse things will be once the tournament proper begins, how much tighter Fifa's embrace of Trumpworld will grow. Will we see walk-on roles before the opening match for Stephen Miller, JD Vance, Kristi Noem, and other lackeys of the Nerd Reich? Could the tournament create a special part for Pete Hegseth as a half-time on-field insult comedian? Might there be a special live stream of the Trump administration's latest extrajudicial killing to spice things up during the heat breaks in Côte d'Ivoire v Curaçao? These sound insane but we're already at the point where insanity can't be ruled out. Nothing about Infantino's management of the tricky relationship between his three co-hosts suggests a change in course from the cold-sweated sycophancy we've seen to date. We can and should expect the worst; Fifa is now the Federation Invested in Fascism in America.

But Fifa also wants to squeeze the World Cup for everything it's worth, and so far that's translated into a determination to inject this whole soccer thing with a good old-fashioned dose of American garbage. Fifa trialed US-inspired game “improvements” – NBA-style players' entrances and the like – during last summer's Club World Cup and wants more next summer: recent reports suggest that these will include half-time interviews for head coaches and players and a lavish, Super Bowl-style half-time show during the final. No fans want this – least of all in the US itself, which Fifa continues to misunderstand as a land of footballing neanderthals in need of sugary treats to maintain engagement through the mind-bendingly complicated exercise that is watching a 90-minute sporting contest.

It would be tempting to say that we're witnessing the infantilization of world football, but the goal is open and the pun is right there: the hellish coupling of Magafifa is producing, before our eyes, the full-scale Infantinolization of the World Cup, in which unnecessary in-tournament gimmicks, scheduling “innovations”, and scammy ticketing procedures mix with crass commercialization, a cheap approximation of Hollywood glamor, and the craven coddling of the pea that passes for Trump's heart. The tournament that is taking shape promises to be hostile and patronizing to fans, unaffordable, excessively long and morally repugnant all at once. If that's not worthy of some kind of award, then I guess I'll have to find another use for these special Gianni-engraved commemorative cufflinks I just had made for Fifa's numero uno. A World Cup that, off the field at least, everyone will hate: this is your prize, Mr Infantino!","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The 2026 World Cup draw has concluded at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. The United States will face Paraguay in its World Cup opener; here you can find a guide to all the teams, group by group. For more commentary and analysis, visit our live blog.

The draw will begin soon.

To see the easiest and hardest possible draws for your team, try our interactive draw simulator. It lets you explore all your team's possibilities, ranked by difficulty.

There are 48 teams in next year's World Cup — an expansion from the 32 teams of previous tournaments.

To ensure both geographic and competitive balance, the qualified teams are split up into four “pots” of 12 teams each. The three host countries — the United States, Canada and Mexico — are all in the first pot, and each has already been assigned a group. Mexico is in Group A, Canada in Group B and the United States in Group D.

During the draw, the rest of the teams will be taken out of each pot and put into the remaining groups, ending with 12 groups of four teams each, with one team from each pot.

It's not quite that simple; there are additional rules to make sure no group has more than one team from the same continent (or two, in Europe's case), and to make sure the highest-ranked teams end up on opposite sides of the knockout round bracket if they win their respective groups. If, during the draw, you expect a team to go into one group and it goes into another, one of these rules may be the reason.

Finally, there will still be six open spots remaining even after the draw is complete. These will eventually be filled by teams who win a play-in tournament in March — four from Europe and two from the rest of the world.

From Europe:



European playoff path A: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Wales or Northern Ireland

European playoff path B: Ukraine, Poland, Albania or Sweden

European playoff path C: Slovakia, Kosovo, Turkey or Romania

European playoff path D: Denmark, Ireland, the Czech Republic or North Macedonia

From the rest of the world:

FIFA playoff path 1: Jamaica, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or New Caledonia

FIFA playoff path 2: Bolivia, Iraq or Suriname





Quantifying team strength for international soccer teams is challenging for lots of reasons. There are relatively few international tournaments to choose from. Teams don't always field their best lineups depending on injuries, the match calendar or a host of other factors. And, of course, we don't even know which players will be named to the rosters for next year's tournament.

But some groups really can be much stronger or weaker than others. Our labels here are based on the average FIFA rating of the four teams in a given group, compared to what we'd expect from the average strength of a random group draw.

Groups labeled as “very weak” are in the bottom 5 percent of strength among all possible draws; groups labeled as “weak” are in the bottom 25 percent.

Groups labeled “strong” are in the top 25 percent of strength among all possible draws; groups labeled “very strong” are in the top 5 percent.

FIFA's “World Ranking” measure is something akin to their version of an Elo rating — and the measure they used to arrange the teams into the four pots for the draw. There are other ways of measuring, including World Football Elo ratings, FIFA's ordinal world ranks or even betting odds or prediction markets. These measures differ from country to country, even significantly. But they're all instructive for an exercise like this.

FIFA has said it will release specific game schedule information on Saturday, about 24 hours after the draw is complete. Pick a team below to see the most current information about when and where they will play:

The United States is in Group D with Australia, Paraguay and European playoff path C (one of Slovakia, Kosovo, Turkey or Romania).

With the World Cup Draw complete, the road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup is hitting its final stretch as nations around the globe fight for the last spots in the expanded 48-team field. The playoff brackets are set, the schedule is locked in and every match carries win-or-go-home stakes. Before the action kicks off, here is a look at how the playoff format works, which teams are still alive and what to expect as the final qualifiers punch their tickets.

The remaining six slots in the 2026 World Cup will be decided in two separate tournament styles based on the confederations involved. Every match in the World Cup playoffs is win-or-go-home. This format creates a high-pressure sprint where a single mistake can end a nation's hopes:

Six teams from five different confederations will compete in a mini-tournament that will decide the final two qualifiers. FIFA ranked the teams before the event, and the top two seeds (Iraq and DR Congo) advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining four teams will meet in two opening matches, and the winners move on to face the seeded nations. 

UEFA's qualifying playoffs give 12 teams a second chance to reach the World Cup. Those 12 are split into four separate paths, each with its own mini-bracket. Each path has two semifinal matchups and one final. All games are single elimination, and the winner of each route earns a place in the World Cup.

The winner of FIFA Playoff 1 will join Portugal, Uzbekistan and Colombia in Group K.

The winner of FIFA Playoff 2 will join France, Senegal and Norway in Group I.

The winner of UEFA Playoff A will join Canada, Qatar and Switzerland in Group B.

The winner of UEFA Playoff B will join the Netherlands, Japan and Tunisia in Group F.

The winner of UEFA Playoff C will join the United States, Paraguay and Australia in Group D.

The winner of UEFA Playoff D will join Mexico, South Africa and South Korea in Group A.

Below is a complete list of teams that are still in contention for the last six World Cup 2026 spots:","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

Agent reveals Blues rejected chance to sign CR7 for just €3.5m before Man Utd pounced","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-chelsea-rejected-cr7-before-man-utd/blt7cec33b593c91ae1","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 14:45:16 GMT","

Cristiano Ronaldo's career could have been markedly different, with it being revealed that Chelsea passed on the chance to sign the Portuguese forward for just €3.5 million prior to Manchester United offering him a route to superstardom. Barry Silkman claims to have agreed a deal with Jorge Mendes that would have delivered CR7 to Stamford Bridge rather than Old Trafford.

Near misses on the transfer front are common in modern football, with there no telling what players of obvious potential will go on to become. While they can often illuminate the youth ranks, or enjoy a bright start to their senior careers, longevity can never be guaranteed.

With that in mind, clubs around the world boast tales of near misses and what could have been. Chelsea fall into that camp, with questions probably still being asked in west London of how they allowed Ronaldo to slip the net.

He was a fleet-footed winger on Sporting's books when former player turned agent Silkman attempted to broker a deal with the Blues in 2003. His pleas fell on deaf ears, with Ronaldo - who is now a five-time Ballon d'Or winner and still going strong at 40 years of age - ultimately making his way to Manchester a matter of weeks later.

Silkman - who represented the likes of Wimbledon, Manchester City and Leyton Orient in his playing days - has told The Telegraph of one particular agreement that he failed to get over the line: “I did a deal with [Ronaldo's agent] Jorge Mendes. But Chelsea said no. Cristiano Ronaldo was €3.5m and the deal was everything over that was split 50-50 with the club. He played against Man United pre-season, ruined them and straight after the game they paid €11.5m and Jorge must have stuck four million in his pocket. Good luck to him but I was gutted!”

Silkman went on to say of Ronaldo, who continues to illuminate the global game with Al-Nassr and Portugal: “If Cristiano Ronaldo was coming into the game today, he would do well to get signed by Barnsley because they'd be saying to him ‘what are you doing? All these stepovers and tricks and flicks? Pass the ball!'

“Coaches don't want teams to make a mistake. I've watched a lot of young coaches. To say it's crap is an understatement. What you hear is, ‘pass, pass, pass'. You never hear someone say, ‘Take him on, drop the shoulder, do a trick'.”

United phased tricks out of Ronaldo's game during his time at Old Trafford, with his transformation into a free-scoring, Golden Ball-winning frontman being completed at the so-called ‘Theatre of Dreams'.

Chelsea's loss was most definitely the Red Devils' gain, with Ronaldo going on to make history and rewrite the record books with United, Real Madrid and Juventus. He is expected to grace another World Cup next summer and is giving little thought to retirement.

Discussing some other big names that he almost took down a different path to the one that made them famous, Silkman told The Telegraph: “Thierry Henry. Could have got him for £500,000 when he was a kid at Monaco as it was only compensation. I tried to get Harry [Redknapp] to buy him at West Ham and he scored a hat-trick in the game and Harry was convinced something had to be wrong with him. He stayed, signed a contract, went to Juventus and they messed up and played him on the left wing. And then went to Arsenal.”

He added on another Ballon d'Or winner who did pass through Chelsea and City after becoming a global superstar with AC Milan: “Then there was George Weah. I was bringing him on a free. No one wanted him. Five different clubs. They also said 'he can't be any good if he's free'.”

Chelsea will be cursing their luck at having passed on Ronaldo. He has worked with fellow countryman Jose Mourinho over the course of his remarkable career, during their time together in Madrid, but they could have chased down Premier League titles together from 2004 had the Blues listened to Silkman's advice.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Brazilian cult hero scores Puskas Award contender with absolutely insane long-range free-kick goal for Atletico Mineiro","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/hulk-smash-potential-puskas-winner-long-range-free-kick-goal-atletico-mineiro/bltfe3824579ef79bb9","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 08:31:13 GMT","

Brazilian icon Hulk produced one of the goals of the season as he unleashed an outrageous long-range free-kick for Atletico Mineiro against Vasco da Gama, instantly sparking Puskas Award conversations. The veteran forward launched a trademark rocket from distance to help fire his side towards a dominant 5-0 victory and cap off their Brasileirao campaign in spectacular fashion.

Hulk stunned the Arena MRV with an extraordinary long-range free-kick that flew past the Vasco da Gama goalkeeper and doubled Atletico Mineiro's lead in the 32nd minute. Stepping up from about 35 yards out, he generated immense power and precision, sending a rising missile into the net that left the keeper frozen. It was a vintage strike from the 39-year-old and a crucial early blow as Galo rolled toward a commanding 5-0 victory to secure Copa Sudamericana qualification.

The goal came during a match in which Atletico Mineiro completely dominated a weakened Vasco side, piling on pressure from the opening whistle and showcasing the intensity Jorge Sampaoli demanded to close the season. Hulk himself had already struck the post twice before finally unleashing the unstoppable free-kick that was a reminder of the most iconic strikes of his long career. The moment instantly circulated across Brazilian media and global social platforms, as supporters floated the possibility of a Puskas nomination.

The Galo continued to show their superiority throughout the second half, enjoying over 70% possession and overwhelming Vasco until the final whistle as Dudu added a brace and Victor Luis scored an own goal. Hulk's contribution came as part of a resurgent conclusion to his 2025 campaign, once again reinforcing his role as Atletico's emotional and attacking leader despite his advancing years.

Beyond the immediate impact, the goal also re-energised discussion about Hulk's long-term future, as he enters the final phase of a contract set to expire in 2026. Although he remains central to Atletico's identity, increasing external interest, particularly from MLS, has introduced questions about whether 2026 or 2027 may mark the final chapter of his time in Belo Horizonte. With over 100 goals for the club and legendary status cemented, every performance he delivers now comes with added meaning as fans savour the twilight of a remarkable career.

Atletico Mineiro will now begin preparations for their 2026 Copa Sudamericana campaign, with Hulk expected to play a major role unless his future takes a dramatic turn. The club plan internal discussions early in the year to evaluate whether they will pursue an extension or prepare for a phased transition away from their iconic No.7. For Hulk, the coming months may determine whether he continues writing history at Galo or explores what could be the final move of his storied career.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Next Lionel Messi? Lamine Yamal told Kylian Mbappe is 'closer' to GOAT status after Barcelona wonderkid is likened to Cristiano Ronaldo & Diego Maradona","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/next-lionel-messi-lamine-yamal-kylian-mbappe-goat-barcelona-cristiano-ronaldo-diego-maradona/blt05400974a47e22ae","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 14:09:16 GMT","

Lamine Yamal continues to be billed as the ‘next Lionel Messi', having stepped out of the same La Masia academy system at Barcelona, but the teen sensation has been told that Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe is “closer” to earning GOAT status than he is. That is the opinion of ex-Blancos star Guti, who has seen Yamal likened to Cristiano Ronaldo and Diego Maradona.

Spain boss Luis de la Fuente has given Yamal the biggest of billings. He gets to work with the youngster on an international stage, with European Championship glory being savoured in 2024. Records have been tumbling around the most highly-rated of wonderkids.

Yamal's star continues to rise, with the expectation being that he will soon land a Ballon d'Or to sit alongside the Kopa Trophy and Golden Boy awards that he already boasts. He is treading a path similar to that which Argentine icon Messi headed down.

With that in mind, De la Fuente has said of Yamal: “If in 10 years' time he has no injuries, no setbacks and plays normally, he can become a player of the era like Messi, Maradona or Cristiano.”

Spain's head coach added: “I've known him since he was 16 years old. We've had many conversations, almost like father and son. I always try to help him. He listens a lot when you try to help him. We have a very fluid relationship, with a lot of closeness.”

Yamal has been doing his best to steer clear of the Messi comparisons, with there acknowledgement on his part that the debate does nobody any favours. It would be almost impossible for him to emulate the achievements of the man who previously donned the No.10 shirt at Camp Nou that he now fills with distinction.

He has told CBS: “I think that Lionel Messi is the best footballer of all time, but he also knows that I'm a good player. There will be mutual respect if we play against each other. He knows that I'm not trying to be him, to play like him, or wear the 10 like him. I want to follow my own path.”

While the teenage forward has been trying to quieten a distracting discussion, while stating a desire to build his own legacy, he is finding it difficult to escape the shadow cast by eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi.

He may well go on to become an all-time great in his own right, but such a billing feels slightly fanciful for an 18-year-old who still has much to learn. Ex-Spain international Guti admits as much.

He told AS when asked about De la Fuente's comments regarding Yamal, Messi, Maradona and Ronaldo: “Wow. I see him as a fantastic player and a potential Ballon d'Or winner, but you're talking about three players who are the best in the world. Maradona won the World Cup in Mexico without having a great team, and Messi and Cristiano won by scoring 50 goals over 10 years. That's going to be very difficult for just anyone to achieve. I see Kylian as closer to achieving it than Lamine.”

Madrid talisman Mbappe, at 26 years of age, boasts a more comprehensive portfolio of work than Yamal. He has been competing at the highest level for longer and proved himself over a greater period of time.

Mbappe claimed a global crown with France in 2018 and netted a hat-trick in the 2022 World Cup final - as Les Bleus came unstuck against Messi and Argentina. He is Paris Saint-Germain's all-time leading scorer, with 235 efforts registered for the Ligue 1 giants, and is three strikes away from boasting a similar standing with his country as Olivier Giroud's tally of 57 goals is chased down.

Yamal already has European Championship and La Liga triumphs on his CV, and will grace the World Cup finals with Spain next summer. He is seemingly destined for greatness, but caution continues to be urged by those that have seen hot prospects fizzle out in the past.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd could still profit from Mason Greenwood as Marseille mull over eye-watering €100m transfer offer from Saudi Pro League","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-utd-mason-greenwood-marseille-saudi-pro-league/blt1dfd1c5fb8c2256d","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:16:33 GMT","

Manchester United could be in line for a cash boost courtesy of Mason Greenwood, with it claimed that a €100 million (£87m/$116m) bid from the Saudi Pro League has been tabled for the 24-year-old forward. If Marseille were to accept that offer, and Greenwood agreed personal terms, then the Red Devils would be due 50 per cent of any fee that is generated from a sale.

United allowed Greenwood to leave Old Trafford on a permanent basis in the summer of 2024. He had spent much of the previous season on loan at Getafe in Spain. Another fresh start was embraced when the opportunity to head for France materialised.

A productive debut campaign was enjoyed at Stade Velodrome, with Golden Boot honours shared in Ligue 1 with Ballon d'Or-winning Paris Saint-Germain superstar Ousmane Dembele as both men found the target on 21 occasions.

Greenwood has reached double figures again this term, netting 11 times across all competitions in 2025-26. His performances continue to attract admiring glances from afar, even if Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi is not always entirely happy with what he sees.

Leading clubs from across Europe, including the likes of Barcelona and Juventus, are said to have seen Greenwood register on their recruitment radar. Big-spending teams in the Middle East are also monitoring his progress.

According to Fichajes, that interest has been formalised ahead of the January transfer window. They claim that Neom Sports Club have put a nine-figure offer to Marseille. They want to “finalise his signing as soon as possible”, with the terms tabled considered to highlight how serious they are.

They have seen Greenwood register 10 goals and four assists across his Ligue 1 outings this season, helping Marseille to challenge for the title. He has also impressed in Champions League action, registering one goal and an assist in elite European competition.

Neom are said to be impressed by Greenwood's “consistency in high-pressure situations”. They view him as an ideal candidate to “lead their attack”. They are willing to give the former United winger “a leading role from day one” and are “prepared to compete with any team” that enters the race for a much sought-after signature.

Looking for smarter football bets? Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Join our growing community now!

Neom Sports Club believe that signing a player of Greenwood's ilk would be a “huge step in their quest to gain international prominence”. They are piecing together an ambitious project in a bid to rival the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Al-Nassr.

The terms on offer for Greenwood are also considered to be appealing to Marseille. As they will have to hand over half of any fee to Premier League giants United - due to a clause inserted in his contract - the opportunity to raise 50m (£44m/$58m) is said to be “one of the most attractive offers in the current market”.

They accept that losing Greenwood would be a “sporting blow”, but bringing in big money for him would “allow them to strengthen several positions and plan for a competitive future”. Those at Old Trafford would also welcome a cash injection during the winter window of 2026.

Marseille are reported to have an “open stance” when it comes to talks about Greenwood's future, with progress on that front expected in the coming days. Fichajes claim that discussions are “nearing a decisive point”.

There is, however, acknowledgement that Greenwood has become “one of the major players in the market” and that teams in Europe are likely to join the transfer chase were he to be made available by Marseille. The player himself is said to be “weighing his options”.

Greenwood is working on a five-year contract with Marseille that is due to run until the summer of 2029. That means the French outfit are under no pressure to sell and can demand the highest possible fee. Their resolve is being tested by Neom, with interested observers in Manchester waiting to discover how an intriguing January window plays out in the south of France.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Fiorentina have been forced to implement urgent security measures and involve local authorities after players, staff and their families received threats from sections of their own supporters. The alarming situation erupted in the wake of the club's latest defeat, which leaves them bottom of Serie A and still without a win this season, deepening the crisis in Tuscany.

Fiorentina's 3-1 defeat to Sassuolo has sparked one of the darkest moments of the 2025-26 Serie A campaign, with the Viola bottom of the table after 14 winless matches and tensions boiling over among frustrated supporters. In the hours following the result at Reggio Emilia, several players and staff members reported receiving threats, which escalated concerns within the club and forced officials to take immediate action. With the squad enduring their worst start to a league season in history, the growing anger from certain fans has crossed into alarming territory, prompting Fiorentina to intervene quickly.

The club has responded by stepping up security protocols and contacting local authorities to guarantee the protection of players and their families. The Viola also reached out directly to all individuals impacted, ensuring they received immediate support while investigations began into the threats made. The incident reflects the intense pressure surrounding the team amid a spiralling on-field crisis that has now evolved into a broader institutional emergency.

In an official communication, the club stated: ""ACF Fiorentina expresses its full solidarity and solidarity with the players and their families following the unacceptable and shameful threats received in the hours following the defeat in Reggio Emilia against Sassuolo.

""This type of behaviour has no place in football, nor in any part of our society.

""The Club immediately contacted its members and the relevant authorities to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to ensure the safety and well-being of the players, staff members, their loved ones, and the families affected.

""ACF Fiorentina, while thanking the many supporters who have already expressed their affection and support following these unfortunate events, reiterates that there will never be room for intimidation, hatred, or violence.

""Our commitment to protecting our players and their families remains absolute.""

This crisis comes during a historically disastrous season for Fiorentina, who sit bottom of Serie A with just six points from 14 matches and remain the only winless side in the league. The collapse has been sudden and dramatic, especially following a sixth-place finish the previous year and expectations of a competitive return to European football. Manager Stefano Pioli was dismissed in early November after four draws and six defeats, but his successor, Paolo Vanoli, has also struggled to ignite any meaningful turnaround.

The turmoil extends beyond the pitch as sporting director Daniele Prade resigned shortly after Pioli's dismissal, leaving a leadership vacuum at a time when the club desperately needs stability. Summer signings such as Edin Dzeko and Roberto Piccoli have failed to make an impact, while Vanoli has criticised his squad's mentality, claiming they “don't work for each other” during the recent run of defeats. The lack of cohesion, confidence, and direction has created a volatile environment now spilling into dangerous territory.

Fiorentina now face the complex task of protecting their players while attempting to salvage a season that is rapidly slipping towards disaster. Enhanced security measures will remain in place as authorities investigate the threats, and the club plans to support affected individuals while reinforcing its zero-tolerance stance on violence.

The immediate focus shifts to Thursday's Conference League fixture against Dynamo Kyiv, where a positive result could help ease tension. Attention will then turn to Sunday's crucial Serie A clash against Hellas Verona, a match that could define Fiorentina's trajectory heading into the new year.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Reds chiefs make huge decision on whether to back Mohamed Salah or Arne Slot after Egyptians explosive outburst as poor results continue","https://www.goal.com/en-om/lists/liverpool-board-side-decision-mohamed-salah-arne-slot-outburst/bltb7229daa949aa835","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 10:35:44 GMT","

Liverpool's board have reportedly picked their side in the stunning internal battle at Anfield which has been sparked by Mohamed Salah's explosive outburst. The Egyptian superstar has spoken out against the club, accusing them of throwing him under the bus, while also admitting to having no working relationship with Arne Slot. Reds chiefs now face player versus manager drama on Merseyside.

It has been pointed out, by a number of prominent figures that boast strong professional ties to Liverpool, that nobody will ever be bigger than the club. Salah has been bluntly reminded of that point, with the 33-year-old considered to have allowed ego to get the better of him.

He has, after being named among the substitutes in three successive games, suggested that his past achievements should guarantee a starting berth. Salah is, however, among those to have struggled for form this season.

The two-time Premier League title winner is less than impressed at being forced to fill a supporting role in Slot's current plans, with no explanation being offered as to why he has - in his opinion - become a scapegoat for their struggles.

Salah told reporters after seeing no game time off the bench in a dramatic 3-3 draw at Leeds: “I don't know why I'm sitting on the bench. It feels like the club is throwing me under the bus, that's how I feel. I think it's very clear that someone will blame me.” He went on to say of his dealings with Slot: “I have said many times that I have a good relationship with the manager, but suddenly we don't have a relationship anymore. I don't know why.”

The stunning outburst from Salah has left those behind the scenes at Anfield with some difficult decisions to make. According to talkSPORT, Reds boss Slot “has the full backing of the board” as he retains complete control when it comes to selection calls.

It is being suggested that Salah will be left out of Liverpool's squad for a Champions League clash with Serie A giants Inter on Tuesday. There is also a chance that he will be forced to miss a Premier League meeting with Brighton on Saturday.

That fixture will be Salah's last before heading off on international duty with Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations. He has hinted at that contest being his last for the Reds, with the plan being to make sure that farewells are bid to a loyal fanbase at Anfield.

Salah will be forced to accept whatever fate Slot has in store for him, with talkSPORT reporting on how the Liverpool board believe that their head coach “should be given the freedom when it comes to tactical decisions and that players should react to those decisions in a professional manner”.

Salah has chosen petulance over professionalism, with many questioning his decision to speak out in public. He has every right to feel aggrieved, having also failed to make it off the bench against West Ham on November 30, but could have addressed matters behind closed doors.

He has only registered five goals and three assists through 19 appearances in the 2025-26 campaign, with those numbers well down for a man that has broken the 20-goal barrier in all of his eight full seasons on Merseyside - topping 30 on five occasions.

Salah last found the target in Premier League competition on November 1, against Aston Villa, with a blank being drawn across his last five outings. He is being challenged to work hard in training and play his way back into form and favour.

That may not happen as, despite signing a new two-year contract back in April, transfer talk has been sparked once again. talkSPORT are among those to report on how Saudi Pro League teams are monitoring Salah's situation, with lucrative offers being readied in the Middle East ahead of another window of opportunity swinging open at the start of 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Andrey Rublev has been named the recipient of the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award in the 2025 ATP Awards, a testament to the 28-year-old's impact on and off the court.

The 17-time tour-level titlist launched the Andrey Rublev Foundation in March 2024 with an aim to provide resources and support to children struggling with critical illness. Rublev expanded his efforts throughout the 2025 season.


“I'm really happy to win the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award,” Rublev said in a video, accepting the award. “We're really working hard to improve our Foundation. We're learning, it's something new for us. It's only been two years, so to win this award means a lot. We're going to keep growing the Foundation and do better and more things. Thank you so much.”


Earlier this year, the Andrey Rublev Foundation announced a partnership with Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital in Rome. The World No. 16 in the PIF ATP Rankings visited the hospital ahead of the ATP Masters 1000 tournament, spending time with members of the medical staff and the patients who are undergoing treatment. Rublev also provided presents to the children.


In a statement published on the Andrey Rublev Foundation website, the fan favourite wrote: “I've been so fortunate to play a professional sport for a living and have my health. There are so many children in need of financial support for critical medical needs and being able to help them is a huge privilege for me. I look forward to working with kids, their families and doctors and helping them face a brighter future because of the resources I am fortunate enough to provide.”


Rublev has also spoken candidly about mental health and the importance of seeking help. In June, he was featured in an ATP Originals documentary, ‘Breaking Back', in which Rublev bravely discussed his personal struggles. Rublev and fellow ATP Tour star Casper Ruud participated in Tennis Canada's Mental Health Panel at this season's ATP Masters 1000 event in Toronto.


This marks Rublev's first time winning the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award, an honour that some of the sport's most notable legends, including Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Andre Agassi and John McEnroe, have won. Ashe, the 1992 recipient, was further honoured with the award bearing his name in 1999. 

This is Rublev's third overall ATP Award. He was voted as Fans' Favourite doubles team alongside Karen Khachanov in 2023, and he also took home Most Improved Player of the Year honours in 2020.


Rublev added another title to his trophy cabinet this year with a title run in Doha. He also reached the fourth round of Wimbledon and the US Open. Rublev tallied a 34-25 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

 The donuts on the table may have been light and fluffy, but could the same be said about some of the characters on the ATP Tour? 

 A host of top stars gave a little insight into several of their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivals by taking on our ‘Naughty or Nice' cake game. Eight players, including Top 10 stars Felix Auger-Aliassime, Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton, placed photos on ‘naughty' donuts or ‘nice' donuts to reflect their own judgements on rivals including ATP No. 1 Club members Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic. 

 So did our participants turn harshly on their on-court foes, or does the ATP Tour locker room remain a place of camaraderie and harmony? Watch the video below to find out, but let's just say that several judges seemed to have their own unique definitions of both ‘naughty' and ‘nice'. 

 Watch Tennis Players Place Each Other On The 'Naughty Or Nice' Cake: 

 Take the split opinions on Alcaraz, for example. Gabriel Diallo's decision was swayed by the Spanish star's tattoos, while Auger-Aliassime declared Alcaraz ‘nice' due to him having an almost constant smile on his face. When it came to judging Djokovic, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina played it safe: “I don't want any trouble with him”, laughed the Spaniard, perhaps in fear of some future on-court retribution from the 101-time tour-level champion. 

 Meanwhile the photo of Alexander Bublik, one of the Tour's maverick players and biggest characters, repeatedly appeared on the ‘naughty' donut. Some of the justifications for that, such as the one given by Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, may not surprise you… 

 “He did 20 underarm serves against me in two matches,” said the Frenchman of Bublik. “He's going to be in the naughty side.”

Paul will play his first match since the US Open at the Garden Cup on Monday.ByDavid KanePublished Dec 08, 2025 copy_link

Tommy Paul ended his 2025 season in New York. He packed it in after a third-round exit from the US Open to fully heal a foot injury, one that interrupted what was building towards a breakthrough year.👉 SUBSCRIBE AND STREAM LIVE: The Garden Cup, 7 p.m. ETThree months later, the American is back in the Big Apple this week to kick off 2026 earlier than most, taking the court against Nick Kyrgios for the Garden Cup after what he jokingly called “the longest off-season ever.”“I've been super fired up about it,” Paul told me over the phone, driving back from practice. “I don't usually start playing practice matches or points until about two weeks before I leave for Australia. This year with Garden Cup, I've started playing two weeks ago! So, I've been playing points for a while and I've been really excited about it, you know?“I'll tell you what, I've never prepared for an exhibition this much! I'm treating it like it's two weeks out of Australia right now!”

Where fellow players have carved out lengthy trips to the Maldives, Paul has stayed close to home, taking in the South Florida sun and allowing only a few days in the Bahamas for a proper vacation.“Hey, my life is a vacation, you know?” Paul said with a laugh. “Between training and fishing, I don't need too much.”Beneath the easygoing attitude, Paul burns with purpose, aiming to pick up where he left off from a stellar six-month stretch. He reached back-to-back Grand Slam quarterfinals and earn his Top 10 debut, but was at Roland Garros when Paul heard a pop in his foot. Though he played through it to earn a career-high ranking of No. 8, he competed in just four more tournaments before shutting down his season in Flushing Meadows.Refusing to give into disappointment or FOMO, the 28-year-old followed his friends' results on social media and quietly transitioned from recovery to heavy training—aiming to build muscle and cardio strength for next season and beyond.

You can play matches in practice and say that you're pushing yourself hard, but there's nothing that pushes you the way playing a real match does. You push the boundaries that much more, and push yourself that much harder...I'm excited for those things, where you get to a ball in a match you probably wouldn't get to in practice...In everything I do, I just love competing and it's the whole reason why I started playing the sport. Tommy Paul

“Earlier in my career, I felt like I was struggling with injuries a little bit,” reflected Paul, who still managed a third straight Top 20 finish despite missing the fall swing. ““I like to think where I am now is like a half-way point in my career. So, I looked at this as an opportunity to get a little extra rest and gear up for the second half of my career. I'm more excited to get back into playing than ever. Obviously, it's a little frustrating at the time when you feel like you're playing great, making two Grand Slam quarterfinals and then you feel like you're not able to put your best tennis out there. But that just makes you work that much harder in months like these. These months are so important to getting healthy and playing the whole next year healthy. It's been motivational.”Fueled by his favorite CELSIUS energy drink, Paul has been feeling Peach Vibes in more ways than one this fall.“We as tennis players always complain that the season is too long and the tour should stop after the Open, and that's pretty much what I did. Let me tell you, it's not that bad!” he joked.“Most other sports do a really good job of giving their athletes time to build muscle and prepare for a grueling season. These past couple weeks, couple months have been really good for that. I feel like I've been able to get a good routine going, and I want to be able to go into Australia and feel good about everything throughout the entire year.”

To that end, Paul's season is starting earlier than ever. He entered the Brisbane International in addition to his usual Adelaide appearance, setting up a full calendar before arriving in Melbourne for the Australian Open.“For me, it's not really the travel out there as much as competing,” Paul explained. “I miss competing. I'm jealous of all the people competing more than anything else.”Throughout an intense pre-season, Paul is still making time to get into the holiday spirit—putting up Christmas trees for himself and fiancée Paige Lorenze and planning an annual watch of 1983's A Christmas Story—but has largely left the wedding plans to his better half.

“She's so good at that kind of stuff!” he said. “This is the first wedding that she's planned, but I trust her with my life. She's doing most of it, and likes bringing stuff and asking me questions about it. I would totally trust her regardless. She has the best taste for that kind of stuff. I think it's going to be an absolutely amazing wedding, I'm so excited.”But first, Paul will head back to New York to celebrate a different union, one that promises to reconnect him with his competitive fire.“You can play matches in practice and say that you're pushing yourself hard, but there's nothing that pushes you the way playing a real match does,” Paul told me, his car coming to a stop. “You push the boundaries that much more, and push yourself that much harder. You're more sore after a match than you ever will be after practice. I'm excited for those things, where you get to a ball in a match you probably wouldn't get to in practice. You play a little longer than you would do in practice. I'm just excited to compete. In everything I do, I just love competing and it's the whole reason why I started playing the sport.”

But for now, all eyes are on MSG. And for Paul, this trip to the Garden was a bit surreal.“Today was the first time I ever went (to Madison Square Garden) for any sort of event. I was on the floor for a Knicks game. I feel like that's pretty cool!”He's most excited about the atmosphere.“The thing about New York, I feel like the fans bring a different kind of energy already, so you can just feed off them. Whatever energy they give you, you can just give it right back.”Osaka is embracing that spirit too. “I just hope that everyone will be very entertained! The vibe that I want to bring is just a lot of fun,” she tells Tennis.com.

Players like Kyrgios and Sabalenka are criss-crossing the country for a packed schedule of exhibition events.

For basketball fan Kyrgios, the connection to MSG runs deep—and not always through tennis.“I love every time the Celtics come to Madison Square Garden and beat the Knicks… My favorite MSG moment was when Paul Pierce hit a game winner over Amar'e Stoudemire. Honestly, my favorite moment.”He's competed at the Garden before, back in 2017, and the history still hits him every time.“It's just a powerful arena, you know. You think about all the banners up there and everything historically that's happened in that arena. It's very special.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Lando Norris secured the 2025 world title by coming home third in Sunday night's Abu Dhabi showdown.

Lando Norris soaked up the pressure of a nervy Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to finish on the podium and in turn secure the F1 Drivers' Championship for the first time – following rivals Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri home.

Norris started the title-deciding race from second on the grid, between Red Bull racer Verstappen and McLaren team mate Piastri, knowing that finishing in the top three places would be enough to put the 2025 crown beyond doubt.

A bold Piastri move demoted Norris to third on the opening lap, before attacks from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, a spell in traffic after his first pit stop and a wheel-to-wheel moment with the other Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda put the Briton under pressure.

Norris, though, dealt with everything that was thrown at him to cross the line in third and clinch the title over Verstappen and Piastri, who both delivered flawless races en route to the win and second position respectively.

At the end of it all, just two points separated Norris and Verstappen at the top of the World Championship standings, given the 10-point swing at the Yas Marina Circuit, with Piastri finishing 11 points further back.

A spirited Leclerc wound up fourth, some seven seconds behind Norris, followed by the lead Mercedes of George Russell, the high-flying Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso, and the squabbling Haas and Ferrari cars of Esteban Ocon and Lewis Hamilton.

As well as Hamilton's recovery, Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg made up plenty of ground to end his 250th race in ninth, while Lance Stroll took the final point in 10th, despite a penalty for erratic driving.

Ollie Bearman was another to be hit with a late penalty for more than one change of direction in a battle with Stroll, leaving him 12th behind Gabriel Bortoleto. Carlos Sainz took 13th for Williams, with Tsunoda a penalised 14th after earning a five-second time penalty for his mid-race defence against Norris on an offset tyre strategy.

Next up was Kimi Antonelli in his Mercedes, from Williams' Alex Albon, who took a penalty for speeding in the pit lane, and the Racing Bulls cars of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson – the former losing out with an early stop and the latter penalised for a clash with Bearman.

Alpine brought up their usual 2025 positions at the rear of the field, with Pierre Gasly ending the day a couple of seconds up on Franco Colapinto, despite also being penalised for exceeding track limits.

After 23 action-packed rounds and a host of twists and turns, it all came down to this: three drivers in contention for the 2025 Drivers' Championship, with 58 more laps deciding whether it would go to Norris, Verstappen or Piastri.

While Norris headed into the weekend with the points advantage, sitting 12 clear of Verstappen and a further four ahead of Piastri, it was the Red Bull man who seized the initiative in Qualifying to claim pole position over the McLaren pair.

It set up a tantalising prospect for race day, with the nerves, excitement and anticipation building throughout the afternoon before the sun set over the Yas Marina Circuit, the floodlights switched on, and the all-important start approached.

When the cars lined up on the grid, with a one-stop strategy expected, it was revealed that the majority of drivers would be starting on the medium tyres, with Piastri, Tsunoda, Antonelli and Stroll going for hards, and Hamilton, Albon and Hulkenberg taking softs.

A few anxious moments later, it was time for lights out – Verstappen making a strong enough getaway to keep his pole advantage from Norris and Piastri, with Leclerc and Alonso squabbling in fourth and fifth, and Russell dropping to sixth.

Halfway around the lap, Piastri pulled off one of the moves of the season – and no doubt raised heart rates on the McLaren pit wall – with an audacious move on team mate Norris around the outside of Turn 9, despite him running that harder rubber.

Norris still held the position and points he needed to secure the crown, but with Leclerc and Alonso hovering in his mirrors. On Lap 4, Leclerc piled the pressure on with his own DRS-assisted look into Turn 9, but he could not quite make it stick.

Russell reported a long brake pedal after his tricky start, which included a heap of wheelspin, but that did not stop him from reclaiming fifth by passing Alonso into the Turn 6/7 chicane. Behind them, Bortoleto held seventh over Hadjar and Ocon, with Tsunoda rounding out the top 10.

Elsewhere, Colapinto was noted for a start procedure infringement, as well as Hamilton and Albon and Antonelli and Stroll for midfield battles – the latter two regarding drivers leaving the track and gaining an advantage.

“This is good for now Max. We may wish to go longer, so just keep on top,” was the message to race leader Verstappen at this point. Shortly afterwards, Hulkenberg became the first driver to pit, swapping his softs for a set of hards.

With the race reaching double lap figures, Piastri received a hurry-up from his engineer to go and chase Verstappen, and in turn give Norris a little more clean air to work with. Norris was informed of that message and continued to hover precariously around the one-second DRS window back to Leclerc.

Another incident involving Gasly and Hulkenberg was noted and dismissed at this point, while Lawson and Bearman came under the stewards' microscope for alleged erratic driving – the New Zealander subsequently being given a five-second penalty.

Russell, Hadjar and Bearman were the next drivers to pit, swapping their medium tyres for hards. Would Ferrari and McLaren respond by pitting Leclerc and Norris? McLaren's mechanics initially came out into the pit lane, but then returned to the garage.

“Keep building this gap on Leclerc, it gives us choices,” was the next message to Norris. Then, at the end of Lap 16, the Briton headed for the pits along with Leclerc and Alonso. Crucially, Norris rejoined ahead of Russell, but with a lot of midfield runners to clear.

Verstappen and Piastri (understandably given his more durable tyres) stayed out for the time being, with just under two seconds between the pair. “Oscar, do you think we could do Plan A?” Piastri's engineer enquired. “I think it's doable for now,” came the reply.

While the top two pressed ahead, Norris had his hands full behind yet-to-pit cars, forcing decisive moves on Antonelli, Stroll and Lawson to regain clear air. A little bit further back, Leclerc was noted for moving under braking in a battle with Russell, before both looked to replicate Norris' charge through the traffic.

Next up for Norris? Outgoing Red Bull man Tsunoda. “We expect Norris to be in your DRS within one lap. All you can when he catches,” the Japanese racer was told over the radio. “I know what to do, so leave to me,” he hit back.

On Lap 23, Norris got within that DRS window – Tsunoda almost forcing the championship contender onto the grass as they charged towards the Turn 6/7 chicane, but Norris keeping his cool under braking to make the move stick and edge one step closer to the crown.

However, a couple of messages soon followed from the stewards and added some more jeopardy to the situation. One being for Tsunoda allegedly forcing Norris off the track, and one being for Norris allegedly leaving the track and gaining an advantage.

A lap later, leader Verstappen decided it was the right time to pit and swap his medium tyres for hards, releasing Piastri into the lead. Norris, meanwhile, got his head down to pump in a series of fastest laps and create a two-second buffer over Leclerc.

The wait for the stewards' decisions was a short one, with Tsunoda being given a five-second penalty due to his weaving, and no further action being taken on Norris' overtake, serving as a huge boost for the latter's title aspirations.

“Penalty?! What penalty, bro?!” Tsunoda shouted over the radio when informed of his penalty. At the same time, the stewards confirmed that there would be no further action over Leclerc and Russell's earlier scrap at Turn 9.

After 33 laps, the yet-to-stop Piastri led Verstappen by some 11 seconds, with Norris five seconds further back in third, from Leclerc, Russell, Stroll (also yet to pit), Alonso, Bortoleto, Ocon and Hulkenberg, who had Bearman all over his tail in the fight for the final point.

Williams were having a quiet race, with Sainz and Albon running 12th and 13th, ahead of early-stopper Hadjar, the Alpines of Gasly and Colapinto, Hamilton (who had moved to a two-stop strategy), the penalised Tsunoda, Lawson and Antonelli.

“The rear's starting to get a bit worse now,” reported leader Piastri over the radio as the laps ticked by – the gap back to Verstappen coming down to six seconds, with Norris and Leclerc also closing in rapidly.

On Lap 40, with Piastri still circulating up front, Leclerc headed to the pit lane for a second time to take on fresh medium tyres, prompting Norris to cover that off next time around (fitting hards). At the back, Albon was given a five-second penalty for speeding on his own visit to the pits.

Not long after that, Verstappen got himself into Piastri's DRS window and breezed past the McLaren down the back straight. A few corners later, Piastri made his long-awaited pit stop and moved over to the medium tyres for the final few laps.

Piastri was told to hunt down Verstappen – now 24 seconds clear – on his fresh rubber, but while he would cut that number in half over the remaining laps, the top two positions were essentially locked in, and all the attention turned back to Norris.

After that early pressure from Leclerc, Norris had managed to build a more comfortable margin, with more than five seconds now separating the two drivers, meaning all the champion-elect had to do was keep things under control until the finish.

Keep it under control is exactly what he did and, just over 15 seconds after Verstappen took a deserved final win of the season, Norris secured the third position he required to earn the title and write his name into the F1 history books.

Leclerc took the best of the rest accolade in fourth, from Russell and Alonso, as Ocon pipped Hamilton to seventh after a fierce late-race battle, Hulkenberg came home ninth and the late-stopping Stroll bagged the final point – even with a penalty for erratic driving against Sainz.

Bortoleto just missed out on a point in 11th, with Bearman dropping from ninth to 12th after a penalty for making more than one change of direction in a late fight with Stroll, Sainz winding up 13th and Tsunoda – after his own penalty – having to settle for 14th.

Albon joined Norris, Leclerc, Hamilton and Hulkenberg in making two stops, but could only place 16th, behind Antonelli, with the Racing Bulls featuring down in 17th and 18th after difficult races for 2026 Red Bull driver Hadjar and Lawson.

A five-second penalty for exceeding track limits on multiple occasions did little to impact Gasly's evening, as the Frenchman placed a lapped 19th over team mate Colapinto at the end of a season Alpine will be keen to move on from.

As the drivers returned to the pits for one last time in 2025, one man stood above the rest – Norris completing a series of donuts on the main straight before climbing atop his McLaren, taking in the cheers from the crowd and starting to process what he had just achieved.

“Oh God! I've not cried in a while,” said Norris. “I didn't think I'd cry but I did. It's a long journey. First of all, I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone at McLaren, my parents... I'm not crying! My mum, my dad, they were the ones who supported me since the beginning.

“It feels amazing. Now I know what Max feels like a little bit, and I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors all season. It's been a pleasure to race against both of them, and I've learnt a lot from both of them as well. I've enjoyed it, it's been a long year, but we did it, and I'm so proud of everyone.”

F1 drivers and teams will now take a break over the winter before returning to action ahead of the 2026 season in a private test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya from January 26-30.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Lando Norris' Race Engineer Will Joseph describes the emotions of watching his charge win the World Championship.

Lando Norris' race engineer Will Joseph reflected on how ""proud"" he is to be a part of the Briton's title success, after the McLaren man secured his maiden World Championship in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix finale.

With Norris celebrating with the likes of his family, friends, Team Principal Andrea Stella and McLaren CEO Zak Brown – after his third-placed finish in Sunday's race confirmed the title – the man to talk him across the line was Joseph.

The pair have worked together since the very beginning of Norris' McLaren journey, going from strength to strength across the seasons with plenty of low points and incredible highs. That relationship, and their trust in each other, was crucial in Norris claiming F1's ultimate prize.

With Max Verstappen winning the season finale, Norris took the third place that he needed to guarantee the title, eventually triumphing by two points over the Red Bull man.

Had he dropped behind Charles Leclerc, the Championship would have belonged to his rival and, given how quick the Ferrari driver was at times, it added a stressful element to proceedings – something Joseph acknowledged.

“I think Lando seemed more comfortable than we were!” Joseph explained to F1 TV. ""We sort of knew how much pace Lando thought he had in hand. At one point we just said okay enough is enough [with Leclerc], just use the pace to get away because this is stressing us out too much.

“I think Lando did a great job, he must have felt comfortable until we gave him the hurry up… You know, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. We were going over all the possibilities, the what ifs, the buts, what if [Verstappen] does this, what if he does that.

“I think we came really well prepared, there were a lot of strong discussions last night and this morning, and it has proved us well. McLaren are very good at preparing. Some people judge us for it, some people say we talk too much on the radio.

""But we prepare well, we go well, we discuss things and it's gone well, we won the Constructors' back in Singapore and today we made history again with Lando and I'm very proud to be a part of it.”

Joseph also went on to explain that Norris – who is now the 35th F1 World Champion and the 11th to hail from Britain – has made the team “stronger and stronger” by pushing them, after years of McLaren focusing on the driver's own development.

“Each year you get better and better and we are at the point now where Lando is leading us, and he is more demanding of us and the table has turned,"" Joseph added. ""At the beginning we pushed him and now he pushes us, we go away and we work harder.""

As for one of the flashpoints of a gripping season finale, Norris admitted after the race that Joseph did not tell him he was under investigation for going off track and gaining an advantage when fighting Yuki Tsunoda – a sensible move not to distract Norris at a crucial part of the race, especially since the stewards opted to take no further action.

“I'm good at maths, I did a degree in engineering, said Joseph, when asked about that moment. ""I can set-up a race car, I can work with engineers, that's bread and butter for me, that's easy.

“Psychology is not what an engineer is typically good at, so maintaining that psychology with a driver is the toughest bit of a race engineer's job.

“So that's what I found toughest. But that's what we worked on, we have a very close relationship, it is very trusting. There are a lot of unspoken things, because there is the trust and it works, it really works.""

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

McLaren's Oscar Piastri was making gains during the first lap of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with the Australian making a move on team mate Lando Norris for second place.

Oscar Piastri looked in fighting form during the opening lap of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with the Australian making a bold overtake on team mate Lando Norris to move up into P2.

When the lights went out for the title-deciding event at the Yas Marina Circuit, Norris initially held off the other McLaren to stay in second place behind polesitter Max Verstappen.

However, Piastri – who started on the hard tyres, in contrast to the mediums on Verstappen and Norris' cars – got into Norris' slipstream later in the lap and surged around the outside at Turn 9, putting him up into second ahead of the championship leader.

Hit go on the video player above to watch Piastri's move on Norris, and follow the rest of the action from the season finale live here.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Yuki Tsunoda reflects on his final race for Red Bull where he finished outside the points in Abu Dhabi.

Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull career came to a close with a 14th place finish at Yas Marina in Abu Dhabi, the Japanese racer finishing his first season with the team in 17th place in the standings. But that position does not tell the full story of what happened in a thrilling season finale.

Starting from P10, Tsunoda was put on the hard compound tyre with one aim – to wind up ahead of Championship leader Lando Norris and do his best to disrupt the McLaren man and cost him track time, all in a bid to aid Max Verstappen's Championship challenge.

Tsunoda's game plan worked to the extent that he found Norris behind him midway through the race. But he was unable to keep the freshly-shod McLaren at bay, and in battling hard with Norris, Tsunoda was handed a penalty by the stewards to boot.

He received a five-second time penalty to serve at his own pit stop for “more than one change of direction to defend position” and his defence had even involved pushing Norris as wide as possible when the McLaren drew up alongside, Norris winding up with all four wheels off the track as a result.

“Car 4 was making an overtaking move on Car 22,” read the document from the FIA explaining Tsunoda's penalty. ""Car 22 made a number of changes of direction which ultimately resulted in Car 4 having to go off track to avoid a collision. In doing so, Car 22 also effectively forced Car 4 off the track.""

“I really tried my absolute best to score points today, and I think there could have been potential to do so, but the penalty made it tricky,” explained Tsunoda after the race. “We opted for a different strategy, and we were running well until the battle with Lando. I tried to hold him up, but he was pretty fast, and then I ended up with a frustrating penalty.”

Tsunoda now bows out of a fulltime F1 seat as he sees his cockpit at Red Bull filled by Isack Hadjar for next season, instead becoming the team's reserve driver. But he was quick to thank his mechanics for all their hard work on his car this year – including through various set-up changes.

“I enjoyed a lot with the mechanics especially, the amount of support I had from them was phenomenal,"" Tsunoda added. ""Probably some phases they were hating me because of a lot of overnight changes, a lot of you know massive set-up changes between FP3 and Qualifying.

""I told them yesterday, at least I trained them well, they are very sharp. Yeah, I'm sure they appreciated me.""

“This year, if I look back at just the word called luck – I don't want to say or use the word called luck to be honest. But I felt deeply unlucky… Every race weekend, something went on. This weekend, had to revert back to the old floor without my control you know with that incident in the pit lane [with Antonelli].

“Never had a straightforward race but at least I gave it all, I think I've shown what I can do.”

Tsunoda was on the F1 grid for five straight seasons, joining what was then AlphaTauri in 2021 and racing for the team all the way to the start of this season, when he was promoted to Red Bull after two races in place of Liam Lawson. And while he was disappointed to lose his seat, Tsunoda has at least learned plenty from driving and working alongside Verstappen this season.

”He is the best driver on the grid, seeing him work and extract everything that he does is, just shows how good he is, and he has the mentality to go with it, it's very inspiring to see,” concluded Tsunoda.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix produced not only a memorable race, but also a treasure trove of top trivia to dive into.

Following the closest finish to a title fight in 15 years, McLaren's Lando Norris is our new World Champion after taking the third place he needed in the Abu Dhabi season finale.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The drivers and teams report back on the final race of the season, the 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Verstappen made a clean start and from there looked relatively untroubled as he drove away for an eighth Grand Prix win of the year. He one-stopped to the flag, and had the ability to throw in a free second stop had he wanted to, such was his advantage over the field. That would have enabled Red Bull to enact some gamesmanship to try and swing the title fight his way, but in the end they opted for the victory, knowing the chances of disturbing McLaren's two drivers was remote at best. As for Tsunoda, he played the team game in his final race for Red Bull, attempting to hold up Norris once the McLaren man pitted. But in doing so he forced Norris wide off the track and received a five-second time penalty for his troubles.

Max Verstappen, 1st

“I'm very proud of the whole Team and I'm so proud of the incredible turnaround that we had. We never gave up and always believed we could turn things around and never stopped trying. We could have very easily just have given up, but we kept pushing, looking for improvements and always believed. This season has been a massive rollercoaster, with lots of tough moments and feelings, but I'm so proud of everyone and we have really come together as a Team. The turnaround in the second half of the season was incredible and pretty crazy that we could do that and we kept overcoming a lot of things as a Team. Today has been a lot of fun, especially winning the race in such a dominant way. We had an incredible weekend and did everything as best as we could, so ultimately I feel good today. Although not winning a championship by two points looks painful, going back to Zandvoort we were behind by over 100 points, so am very proud of what we have achieved. Of course, for Lando this is something very special and I hope he enjoys it a lot. The first Championship win is the most emotional one and it is something you dream of since you were a little kid. His family are here and I hope he enjoys tonight with his Team. Finally, I wanted to thank the whole Team in the factory and on track: we never gave up and always believed. I am very proud of the people that I work with, they are my second family.""

Yuki Tsunoda, 14th

""I really tried my absolute best to score points today, and I think there could have been potential to do so, but the penalty made it tricky. We opted for a different strategy, and we were running well until the battle with Lando. I tried to hold him up, but he was pretty fast, and then I ended up with a frustrating penalty. Once I came out for the second stint, it was really challenging to pass. I can look back on this year knowing that I gave it everything until the end. There were lots of times this season where I lacked that bit of luck you sometimes need to make the difference, but that's racing. A big congratulations to Lando—he has been superb all year and drove a solid race tonight to win his first title. Also, congratulations to Max for his victory and an amazing season. Between himself and the Team, they put together a brilliant effort to challenge until the very end and just missed out. He is the best driver on the grid, seeing him work and extract everything that he does is, just shows how good he is, and he has the mentality to go with it, it's very inspiring to see. I'd like to say thank you to the engineers, mechanics, and the entire Team for this season, and I'll still be around next season, so it's not a proper goodbye.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

""Firstly, congratulations to Lando and McLaren. They have been superb all year and have been our fiercest competitors this season, so a huge well-done to their whole team. It was so tight this year, and we put up a really great fight right to the end, finishing with a dominant display today. We didn't expect to put in a performance like that around this track, so a big credit to the Team and to Max for getting the car into a position to do exactly that. Starting from pole, we knew the win could be in our hands, and Max was perfect from start to finish, with excellent tyre management to see us through. I'd also like to thank Yuki, who played the team game today, as he did last night, and we thank him for never giving up this season. We simply could not have done anything more. The dominant feeling is one of pride for this sensational turnaround. The effort that every single person in this Team, in the campus and on the race track, has put in is nothing short of incredible. We showed true racing spirit - the Red Bull spirit - right up to the very last lap.""

Norris sealed his maiden World Championship title in Abu Dhabi, doing exactly what he needed to by finishing on the podium with his team mate just ahead. Neither had the pace to fight with the Red Bull of Verstappen, though, for the win. Piastri on the hard tyres overtook Norris on the opening lap and kept the Dutchman honest, staying out for a long first stint and one-stopping on his way to the flag. Norris had to work harder in the opening stages on the mediums to keep a feisty Leclerc at bay. He mirrored the Ferrari man's two-stop strategy to ensure he stayed in P3, which was all he needed in the end for that coveted Drivers' crown.

Lando Norris, 3rd

""We did it, World Champion! This is for everyone that's been there for me on this journey. For my family, for my team, and for everyone at McLaren.

“It's been a tough season, Oscar and Max are incredible competitors and have done an incredible job all year. It's been a privilege to get to race them this year, congratulations to them on their amazing seasons.

“I'm so proud, not because I'm World Champion, but because of everything those around me have given up to make this possible. Making them happy and rewarding their sacrifices and hard work is what makes me proud.”

Oscar Piastri, 2nd

""Congratulations to Lando on the Championship win, it was great to battle with him all the way to the end, and it's a lovely moment for the team. It was a really strong race to finish out this year, we took a risk on strategy, and it paid off, but we just didn't have an answer to Max.

""It's been an amazing season and one I am very proud of. We'll take everything we've learnt and head into 2026 as the strongest driver I've ever been. I am excited to see what we can achieve next year.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“Today, we celebrate an extraordinary achievement for the entire McLaren Racing family. The main feeling is that we are incredibly proud to take home a maiden 2025 FIA Formula 1 Drivers' Championship for Lando. This is a fantastic end to what has been a hard-fought season, one that has tested and brought out the best in everyone across the team. All the men and women in Woking have responded to the call how we had wished to elevate the game and level of performance following our success last season.

“While only one driver can take the Drivers' Championship title each season, to be in a situation where both Lando and Oscar were challenging at the sharp end against a four-time World Champion in Max Verstappen, was always an ambition and not a problem. The demand of this was huge, but we did it the McLaren way, even when we had our bumps on in the road, everyone stuck to our culture which showed our incredible unity, and I'm so happy that the team have been rewarded with this success.

“Lando and Oscar have been outstanding all year both on and off track, showing the true values of what it means to be a McLaren team member. Together they have secured a combined 14 wins and a total of 34 podiums which also delivered the 2025 FIA Formula 1 Constructors' Championship, our 10th as a team and also our first Championship double since the team's iconic 1998 season.

“None of this would be possible without the unwavering support of our shareholders, partners, people, and fans, as well as our long-standing colleagues at HHP who have contributed to another year of successful collaboration.

“Thank you for being on this journey with us. We'll make sure we celebrate this moment together before getting our heads down and focusing on the upcoming challenge in 2026.”

Leclerc was racy off the line, picking off Russell and giving Norris plenty to think about in the first stint. He ran in DRS range of the McLaren man for lap after lap, but could not find a way through. He was quick in the second and third stints, too, before his charge faded late on and he had to make do with P4. Hamilton started on the softs and climbed right up the order after an early switch to the hard tyre. He was the first to gamble on a two-stop strategy and it paid dividends as he came home in the points despite starting from P16 on the grid.

Charles Leclerc, 4th

""I gave it everything and our team executed the race perfectly. Unfortunately, P4 was all there was in it for us today. I really wanted to finish the season on a high, bringing home a podium for everyone, and I was close to Lando (Norris) in a few moments of the race, but it was not enough to make a pass.

""Congratulations to Lando for his first title. He has been doing an incredible job of driving this year and it's fully deserved.

""A huge thank you to our whole team, both at the track and at home in Italy, for all the hard work put in this year, as well as our Tifosi for their ongoing support. It's been a tough season for us.

""Next season is still a blank slate, and we don't know where the other teams stand, so we don't have any real expectations yet. After this week, we will head back to Maranello to regroup, and our job will be to focus all our efforts on preparing for the season ahead as best as we can.""

Lewis Hamilton, 8th

""I'm pleased with today's drive. We made good progress, overtook a lot of cars, and got ourselves back into the points. The two-stop strategy worked well so thank you to the team.

""It's been a tough season, but the kindness and hard work of everyone at Ferrari means a lot to me. I stand with team and know we have better times ahead. After testing, I'm looking forward to taking some time to switch off, spend time with my family and friends and will come back refreshed and stronger in January.

""Congratulations to Lando. It's great to see a fellow Brit win the championship. I'm proud of the work he's put in over the years and this result is fully deserved.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""First of all congratulations to Lando on winning the title. Ever since his days in karting it was obvious that he has a special talent and this title is well deserved and well done also to McLaren for giving him the equipment to get the job done.

""Overall, this has not been a bad weekend for us in terms of pure performance, but it came a bit too late following a very tough start on Friday after which the team at the track and back in the factory did a very good job to recover for Saturday, by making very big changes to the cars. However, when you have to recover like this, it's all about fine tuning the details and we weren't able to do that. That affected our qualifying as the field was so close and then today our race pace was good and with Charles we were matching Lando's pace, but in the current F1 where the gaps are so small, if you leave anything on the table you pay the price. Lewis also had a good race with very strong pace, he pulled off some nice overtaking moves and the motivation was there. But across the whole team, if we want better results we must work on having better weekends from the start of practice.

""I want to thank everyone in the team at the track and all the people back in Maranello for all their hard work all year and of course thanks also to the Tifosi for their support this season, because even when we were struggling, and we had some very tough weekends, they were always behind us, always supportive and you can't imagine the positive energy this has given us throughout all the year.""

Russell had plenty of wheelspin off the line, and dropped behind Leclerc and Alonso which was far from ideal. He managed to pick off the Aston Martin man, but could not get the Ferrari ahead. As such, he stopped early to try the undercut, which very nearly worked. But he lost pace in the last stint and came home a distant fifth - which was more than enough to secure P2 in the Constructors' for Mercedes. As for Antonelli, he started on the hard tyre but could not quite make that strategy play out after getting stuck in a DRS train for much of the race.

George Russell, 5th

""That was a very tough race for us this evening. We struggled to find the pace that would threaten those ahead throughout the whole Grand Prix. I had a poor start and dropped down to P6; I got back ahead of Alonso to take P5, but it was a lonely night from there. We knew in normal circumstances that we likely didn't have the pace to challenge for the podium, but it was still frustrating.

""Whilst the season didn't end in the way we wanted, we can be pleased that we secured P2 in the Constructors'. It has been a challenging four years in this ground effect era for us as a team and getting P2 was definitely our aim from after the summer break. We've ticked that box but ultimately, we want more than this and that is what we are fully focused on delivering in 2026 with the seismic rules change.

""Finally, I want to wish congratulations to Lando (Norris) as he becomes World Champion. We've raced together for so long and he is more than deserving of the title. Hopefully we can do battle on track next year for the 2026 crown!""

Kimi Antonelli, 15th

""I struggled with the balance of the car this evening and didn't have the pace to get back into the points sadly. It was a tough night and a difficult race and that is unfortunate. We'd enjoyed a good run of Grands Prix up to that point but that's racing sometimes. We've got some work to do with the test on Tuesday and our full focus is already on 2026.

""It's been quite a journey this season. It's not the way we wanted to end the year, but the most important thing is that we brought home P2 in the Constructors' Championship. Happily, we were able to do that. Over the winter, we will look back over the season, see where we could have done better, and come back much stronger.

""Congratulations to Lando (Norris) too. He deserves it but also well done to both Max (Verstappen) and Oscar (Piastri) who have also been brilliant this year. It was a great battle all year.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""Congratulations firstly to Lando Norris on winning the World Championship. He is a worthy winner; I am really happy for him and everyone that is close to him. His parents will be quite rightly proud of his achievement, and I am sure they will enjoy it. Congratulations also to Zak (Brown) and Andrea (Stella); they have done a great job at McLaren to secure both titles this year.

""Our race can be summed up in one word: mediocre. It was a lonely one for George who wasn't threatened from behind but didn't have the pace of the front four cars. He was managing his tyres to bring the car home on the one-stop, and he did that successfully. For Kimi, he tried his best from a difficult starting position, but we just didn't have the speed in the car to enable him to get back into the points. It is not the way we wanted to end the year, but we can be pleased we secured P2 in the Constructors'. Since the midpoint of the season, that has been our aim. It is not what we as Mercedes ultimately want to be fighting for though and hopefully, we can prove ourselves worthy of being in a world title fight next year.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""That was an underwhelming way to end our season. We came into the race hoping to fight for the podium with George and to help Kimi battle back into a solid points scoring position. Unfortunately, we didn't have the pace today to do that and had to bear a frustrating evening. Both drivers lost places at the start and things didn't improve much from there. George was in no man's land between the top four and the rest of the field. He drove sensibly to bring the car home P5. For Kimi, he needed a good start and a strong car to recover from qualifying and unfortunately did not have either.

""We're pleased to have secured second place in the Constructors' Championship in an entertaining, season long battle with Ferrari and Red Bull, we go into the winter very mindful that McLaren won this championship comfortably. We look forward to the immense challenge of the new regulations; we've been working hard on the W17 for a long time and will redouble our efforts across the winter in a bid to get back to winning ways.

""Finally, well done to Lando. He drove brilliantly in the final races and is a worthy champion.""

Alonso was super competitive off the line, forcing his way past Russell and running Leclerc close as well. Although he dropped back, he managed to keep the rest of the midfield at bay. Pitting with the top runners, Alonso remained competitive throughout to secure sixth place and seventh in the championship for Aston Martin. As for Stroll, he ran a very long first stint on the hard tyre. When he eventually pitted, he was quick on the mediums and overtook Bortoleto late on to climb into the points. He finished ninth, was demoted to P11 when a time penalty was applied for changing direction too many times… only for Bearman to receive a time penalty himself, which promoted Stroll back to the points.

Fernando Alonso, 6th

""It is great to finish the season with a strong P6 here in Abu Dhabi. Our race pace hasn't always matched our qualifying recently, so a solid Sunday here feels very good. It's been a challenging year, and I want to thank the whole team for their hard work all season. We'll enjoy a break, then switch our focus to preparing for the big changes next year. And congratulations to Lando on his first World Championship; it is a special moment for any young driver, and he deserves it.""

Lance Stroll, 10th

""It was a fun race, some great overtakes and good strategy by the team today, and nice to pick up a point at the final race at Yas Marina Circuit. In hindsight, we could've maybe pitted a lap or two earlier and finished even further up in the points. This year has been a tough one for the team, we haven't been as competitive as we wanted to be, so finishing this season with a positive result and P7 in the Constructors' Championship is good.""

Mike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer

""Firstly, congratulations to McLaren and Lando for a well-deserved end to their season. For us, it was great to complete the final race of 2025 on a positive note, with a double-points finish.

""Fernando drove a great race, finishing in P6 and bringing home eight valuable points for the team. Lance also had an excellent race, managing the Hard tyre well and pulling off a series of decisive overtakes. He climbed six positions before a post-race time penalty dropped him to P10.

""We finish the season P7 in the Constructors' Championship. Thank you to the team trackside and everyone back at the AMR Technology Campus for your hard work and dedication this season. It hasn't always been easy, but we have never stopped pushing.

""As we now look to the 2026 season, I want to also take the time to say thank you to our friends and colleagues at Mercedes AMG HPP for supplying the team's PU over the past 17 years. Thank you for the collaboration that has shaped this chapter in our history.

""Thank you also to our fans for your unwavering support and passion, it means a lot to us all. We now turn all our focus on 2026, with the test in Barcelona next month.""

Ocon started in the top 10 and always looked on for points in what was one of his most competitive races of the second half of the season. He even kept a charging Hamilton at bay for the last chunk of the race to record his best result since Monaco. As for Bearman, he was on the fringes of the points in the closing stages but received a five-second time penalty for more than one change of direction in a battle with Stroll, which ended any chance of finishing his rookie season in the top 10.

Esteban Ocon, 7th

“I'm very happy to finish the year this way. I think it was a really strong race from our side, and it was the maximum that we could've done. We fought with Fernando Alonso the whole race, it was definitely a big fight as he was matching my middle sector, it was really close, and there was a lot of overtaking all the way to the end. It wasn't quite enough to finish ahead of Aston Martin in the Constructors' Championship. It's a bittersweet taste, but it's definitely a good last race that gives us a solid platform to build on next year.""

Oliver Bearman, 12th

“Overall, it was a good race. We pitted on the early side, but we managed to hold others off. To get penalized for more than one change of direction with Stroll – I broke the tow once, which is allowed by regulation, and then I defended the inside line for the rest of the straight. I'm looking forward to the winter break now, we built really strong foundations for this year, and that's positive, and thanks once again to the whole team for everything this year.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“At the start of the day, we aimed to get both cars into the points. We achieved it until Ollie's penalty – which I thought was really harsh, however – that's the rule. To cross the line in P7 and P10 is a really good job from everyone, as we started from P8 and P11. We raced really hard, really well, and there was huge pressure trying to get P7 in the Constructors' Championship, but everyone stayed calm. The pit stops were good, especially the second one, but I knew we'd bounce back – that team has done a great job this year, ending on a high.

""We couldn't quite reach our target of beating Aston Martin today, but those championship positions don't happen over one race, that happens over the course of 24 races. I'm very happy to say we should be proud of ourselves, how we improved this year and scored 79 points. Last year we finished P7 on 58 points, but this year the competition is so much tighter, and in the last seven races, we scored in six of them. It's amazing that we've improved the cars two years in a row and finished the season on a high, it gives us confidence going into next year. I want to say thank you to everyone in this team, you should be proud of yourselves, and this is an achievement from everyone. I'm very happy to be working with this group of people, I couldn't be prouder.”

Bortoleto started in the top 10 and ran his good friend Alonso close in the first stint. But once he pitted for fresh rubber, the Brazilian got bogged down in the midfield. Hulkenberg was on a different strategy, after starting on the softs and pitting early. Despite some contact with Gasly, he managed to climb up the order and was running close to his team mate late on. Bortoleto lost out to Stroll who was on much fresher tyres and finished out of the points, but Hulkenberg gained a position when the Canadian's penalty was applied, to ensure Kick Sauber earned some points in their last race before becoming Audi.

Nico Hulkenberg, 9th

“Scoring two points, after a disappointing Saturday and coming from P18, is definitely something I am very, very pleased with. It's not easy to move forward through the field here, especially when everyone is roughly on the same race pace. So all things considered, I'm very happy with P9 – it's a good way to end the last race of the season. It's also a nice way to say goodbye to Sauber — Peter has such a legacy, he's been in the industry so long and I have big respect for what he's achieved.

“I think it was definitely a good season — a lot of positive things happened. We developed, evolved and grew as a team, and we put in a couple of really good highlights. The podium was nice to finally tick off my shoulder; I was very happy about that. Barcelona, Budapest, Monza, Austin — many really strong weekends, and of course a few where we didn't maximise everything, but that's the challenge in a long season. All in all, I think we can be relatively satisfied. We'll digest the season now, enjoy the break, and then look ahead to the new chapter that is waiting for us.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 11th

“I'm not going to lie – it's a bit disappointing to have finished just outside of the points today. Unfortunately, we struggled with bouncing from the first lap, and I don't think we maximised our race as we should have. It's a shame, because the car felt amazing yesterday and I really felt we could have scored some points today. Looking back at my first Formula One season, it's been a special year for me with several good results and strong quali sessions, so there's definitely lots to be proud of – I couldn't have done this without the support of the team. It was a good and valuable year. The season is in the books now and I am looking forward to our future.  I'm already keen to start working on next year and hopefully fight for bigger things.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“First, I want to extend my congratulations to Lando on securing his first championship. It was an incredible showdown and a fantastic spectacle to watch from the pit wall.

“Although there is a sense of disappointment today, it comes at the end of what has been an extraordinary season. We have experienced highs and lows, and ultimately scored points well beyond our initial expectations. To finish with 70 points and only place P9 in the Constructors' Championship is unprecedented and shows what a close season this has been.

“Today once again highlighted the unpredictability of our year. We think a car issue resulted in Gabi lacking pace and, in hindsight, an earlier swap to the two-stop strategy with Nico would have been advantageous, especially given his pace in the closing stages. This is something we will review as we continue learning and improving.

“One consistent positive has been the performance and spirit of the pit crew, who, again, delivered solid performance in the pit lane. The progress this team has made this year is significant and provides us with real momentum heading into 2026.

“And finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Peter Sauber for his remarkable legacy and for shaping the team we are so proud to represent. As we move toward becoming the Audi Formula 1 Team in 2026, we do so with optimism, determination, and a clear sense of purpose.”

Williams did not manage to score in the final race of the season, so will have been relieved to have already secured P5 in the championship. Albon started on the soft tyre from towards the back of the grid, two-stopping his way to the flag. But a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pit lane did not help his cause out there. As for Sainz, he manged to one-stop on the medium and hard tyre combination, running out of rubber late on to fight his way any further forward.

Alex Albon, 16th

""Firstly, I'm very happy for Lando and his Championship win. He's taken a big step forward this year, risen to the pressure and his title is well-deserved.

""For us, it was a tricky race today. We had a great start, but we were never in a place where we had the tyre advantage, which meant we were stuck in a bit of a train.

""The last few races have been tough, but overall, it's been a great season for us. I'm proud of the team and proud to finish top of the midfield. There's no big secret behind it; just hard work, good leadership from James, and building some strong foundations. We've come a long way this season, and we're heading into 2026 with a lot of optimism and a great mentality. I'm confident we can do great things next year, so I'm already excited to get back on track in 2026!""

Carlos Sainz, 13th

""We haven't been strong all weekend and today was a normal race with not much going on. We committed to a one-stop strategy and got stuck in a train of DRS, so there was little to do from there with the pace we had.

""More importantly, looking at the season as a whole, it's one to be proud of! I've stuck to my way of doing things, improved progressively throughout the year together with the team and, overall, we finished in good form. Fifth in the Constructors' Championship was an ambitious target, and we got it, so I'm incredibly happy.

""We need to stay hungry and continue to push all together. We have built solid foundations for next year but there is always margin for improvement. Thanks to the entire team for their effort and to every single one of our fans out there, your support means everything to us!

""Last but not least, a massive congratulations to Lando on his first Drivers' Championship! He's an incredible driver and he has proven that you can achieve your highest goals staying true to yourself! Congrats my muppet friend! Well deserved!""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""First and foremost, congratulations to Lando on a well-deserved Championship. For us, this marks the end of a really successful 2025. In a couple of days, we'll be testing here in Abu Dhabi in preparation for 2026 and, in just a few weeks' time, the 2026 car will be a reality and I can't wait. This is a good moment to say thank you to everyone that has been behind us for not just this year but for many years. It's the start of our journey and I can't wait for what's next. Thank you very much.""

Hadjar ran in the points in the early stages, but after pitting and coming back out in traffic, he lacked the pace to climb forwards and wound up finishing just ahead of his team mate. Lawson was penalised for erratic driving and earned himself a five-second time penalty for his troubles. With neither car scoring, Racing Bulls just held onto P6 in the championship by three points.

Isack Hadjar, 17th

""It was a very tough Sunday. We haven't had enough pace the whole weekend to fight for our usual positions, and yesterday it was a surprise for me to put the car in P9. We started in the points, but we knew it would have been difficult for us to maintain that place. Looking at the positives and reflecting on my first F1 season, it's been a great journey and I'm proud of everyone within VCARB for everything we achieved together. It's not the final race we wanted but getting P6 in the Constructors' Championship was our target and a great reward for all of us.”

Liam Lawson, 18th

“Congratulations to the team on P6 in the Constructors'. While we struggled with our strategy and pace today, we've had a strong season and achieved our target this weekend. I'm excited to get back to work after the short winter break. Next year will be a big opportunity with the team which I'm very excited and grateful for.""

Alan Permane, Team Principal

“Today brings an end to a long season, but a really really great season for Racing Bulls. Sixth place in the Championship is amazing; we've only ever reached P6 once before, so it's a huge achievement. It's truly a testament to the commitment, passion and hard work within this team, both at the track and back at the factory. Each and every person can be really proud of themselves. There have been ups and downs all the way through and it really went down to the wire with Aston Martin but I'm incredibly happy.”

Not to be for Alpine in the final race of the season. Starting from the back, both cars two-stopped as they tried to make progress up the field. But they have not had the pace here all weekend, and ultimately propped up the order. Gasly beat his team mate despite receiving a five-second time penalty for track limit infringements and having contact with the Kick Sauber of Hulkenberg, while Colapinto's P20 meant the Argentine did not get a point on the board in 2025.

Pierre Gasly, 19th

“It was not a great race to end the season and there really is not a lot to say other than we tried our best but our pace was just not enough to really challenge. Looking back at the year as a whole, as a team, we can still take a lot from the season. I have been really impressed with how the team has handled a tough year where we have not been competitive. Despite its challenges, everyone has given their all and shown a really great mentality which we can take forwards to next year, so thank you to everyone trackside, at Enstone and at Viry for all their efforts this year. We have a lot of belief in the 2026 project and I am definitely looking forward to a clean slate and a fresh start for everyone. Finally, congratulations to Lando [Norris] on winning the title. It was a close one with Max [Verstappen] and Oscar [Piastri] and any of them could have taken it. For it to be decided by just two points is great for Formula One, so well done to all three, Lando managed to get it done and it's a big moment for him. One day we hope to be in that position and we will continue to work hard to hopefully one day do just that.”

Franco Colapinto, 20th

“It was a long and difficult race and, ultimately, we lacked pace all weekend. It's been a tricky stretch of races, and we haven't had the results we were expecting. It has been a tough end to the year, but everyone has kept pushing to the very end. It's a year we'd like to put behind us but learn and come back stronger from. Thanks to the entire team for their efforts this year in difficult circumstances. There's still a few weeks to push at the factory and wrap things up before the holidays. After that, it will be time to rest and reset for what will be an important year for myself and the team. Finally, congratulations to Lando [Norris]. He's had a great year and is a deserving champion.”

Flavio Briatore, Executive Advisor

“Today's result probably summarises our season where the car has not been competitive enough. It has been a long and often tough season for everyone at the team. I know everyone is eager and motivated to put this campaign behind us and very much ready to push tirelessly to make the next one more of a success. Congratulations to McLaren and Lando Norris on winning both championships. Their level this year has been extraordinary and they have been the benchmark in Formula One this season. For now, the hard work doesn't stop as we look ahead to a better 2026.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“Congratulations to Lando Norris on winning his first drivers' title. The battle went all the way to the final round of the season – which was one of the most closely-fought of the last few years thanks to the similarly competitive pace of the different teams. Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri certainly didn't hold back today, giving us a thrilling final.

In terms of strategy, the majority of the teams opted for a one-stopper using the most consistent two compounds as we expected: in some cases, stretching the hard tyre stint for more than 40 laps.  Even though there was no graining on the hardest compound, there were still inevitably some signs of wear in the final laps.

Among the drivers choosing the alternative strategy, the newly crowned champion Lando Norris stands out. He went for a two-stopper, probably prompted by the extra pit stop for Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, using the two fresh sets of hard tyres that McLaren had saved in their build-up to the race.

Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton also used a fresh set of tyres for his final stint, which in this case was the medium. This excellent choice allowed him to make up several places, underlining how close the two strategic options were, as shown by our simulations.

Pirelli's job does not stop here: we will be back on track on Tuesday together with all the teams for a full test day, A total of 10 mule cars piloted by the race drivers will try out the new 2026 tyre range, while 10 young drivers will take to the track with this year's cars and tyres.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Third-place in Abu Dhabi was enough for Lando Norris to claim his first Formula 1 Drivers' title and McLaren's first since 2008.

McLaren CEO Zak Brown has said ""everything went right"" in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix title-decider, with Lando Norris securing his maiden Formula 1 Drivers' title after an ""unbelievable race"".

Norris finished behind title rivals Max Verstappen and team mate Oscar Piastri on Sunday at the Yas Marina Circuit, but third-place was enough to claim this year's title by two points.

The Briton faced early pressure from Charles Leclerc behind and was investigated for an off-track overtake on Yuki Tsunoda mid-race, but was able to complete the podium via a two-stop strategy.

""Just amazing. That was an unbelievable race, edge of your seat stuff,"" said Brown.

""Charles was in our DRS, close call with Yuki. Oscar drove brilliantly, Max is a machine, so to beat Max and an awesome team like Red Bull is such an accomplishment. Racing with Lando and Oscar, you couldn't ask for a better driver line-up.

""The pit stops and then having to cover Leclerc, there's just so many things that can go wrong and everything went right. It's a long season.""

While McLaren comfortably secured the Teams' Championship with several races remaining, the Drivers' title went down to the final race after a late surge by Verstappen and Red Bull.

This year also marked back-to-back Constructors' titles for McLaren, but the crown for Norris is the first Drivers' title for the team since Lewis Hamilton back in 2008.

""You're always asked what's more important and I can tell you the stress and desire to win the Drivers' Championship was every bit as high [as the Constructors'],"" said Brown.

""So rewarding, so happy for the team and both our drivers. I'm looking forward to coming back and racing next year.""

While Verstappen and Piastri completed just one pit stop in the 58-lap race, Norris pitted twice with the first stop bringing him out in traffic.

Having made his way back through the field and into P3, the McLaren driver made a second stop to cover off Leclerc behind.

Team Principal Andrea Stella admitted it was difficult to know which was the correct strategy, having also put Norris and Piastri on different starting tyres to try and cover off Verstappen.

""The chat at the pit wall was that we just have to cover Leclerc and we kind of go to our defensive, responsive strategy,"" he said.

""With Oscar, we tried to go as long as possible [on the hard], see if we could catch a Safety Car and then see at the end with the medium tyres if we could go and catch Verstappen, but Verstappen was once again too fast and he deserved the victory.""

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

With a P2 finish in at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Oscar Piastri lost out on his maiden championship by 13 points to Lando Norris.

Oscar Piastri appeared cool-headed after missing out on the 2025 Drivers' Championship to his team mate Lando Norris, hailing McLaren for their efforts in turning around his performance over the last two rounds.

The 24-year-old and Norris both achieved seven victories this season, but a downturn in form for Piastri in the latter stage of the year saw him lose his commanding lead in the Standings and drop behind both the Briton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Piastri headed into the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix with mixed emotions, having seen his dominant weekend in Qatar fall away from him due to an unsuccessful team strategy. Nevertheless, he maintained his rediscovered form to qualify third for the finale, behind his fellow title contenders on the front row.

With a 16-point deficit to overcome in order to win the championship, he recognised that a lot had to fall into place for him to have a chance. A strong start saw him pass Norris for P2 on the opening lap, but he couldn't do much to get the better of Verstappen, especially on a 41-lap stint on hard tyres.

Asked how he was feeling about finishing second in the race, he replied: “Honestly, pretty good. I knew that going into today I needed the stars to align to win the championship.

“Ultimately, I tried my best and put myself in the best position I could to try and win the race and give myself the best opportunity, but it wasn't to be. I think we can be very proud of the season we've had.

“On a personal level, it's obviously not quite the ending that I wished for but I think when you look at the season as a whole, I'm very proud of the work that I've been able to put in and my team have been able to put in to make so much progress from last year. I'm looking forward to plenty more fights in the future.”

McLaren elected to split the strategies between their drivers, starting the eventual champion on medium tyres while Piastri was given a set of the hard compound to begin the race. The choice allowed him to extend his first stint, but meant that by the time he finally pitted, he faced Verstappen's unassailable lead of 24 seconds.

Due to the three contenders all finishing on the podium, Piastri lost out on his maiden title by 13 points, with Norris ending the season on 423 to beat their Red Bull rival by just two points.

“It is nice to end the last couple of weekends on a relative high, certainly from a performance point of view,” he summarised. “I guess individually it was nice to find some form again because it would have been pretty painful to end it on the note that Austin, Mexico and Brazil kind of went to.

“Ultimately, there were ups and downs through the year. I'll look back on the ups with a lot of pride and joy, and look on the downs with plenty of lessons learned. There are plenty more years left to go and hopefully plenty more opportunities.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Max Verstappen's win in Abu Dhabi was not enough for him to claim the World Championship, but Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies still hailed the victory as a ""perfect race"".

Laurent Mekies believes that Red Bull could not have “done anything better” at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with the team boss labelling Max Verstappen's victory as a “perfect race” despite the Dutchman missing out on the title by two points.

Arriving into the event 12 points adrift of championship leader Lando Norris, Verstappen kept his hopes of a fifth consecutive crown alive by sealing pole position in Saturday's Qualifying.

However, while the 28-year-old converted that grid slot into a win, the result was not enough for him to become World Champion again, with a P3 for Norris giving the title to the Briton by a two-point margin.

Verstappen might not have taken the crown, but his second place was one that would perhaps not have been expected earlier in the season, given that he at one stage found himself more than 100 points away from the top of the standings.

When asked for his feelings following the end of an intense battle, Mekies – who joined Red Bull as Team Principal and CEO in July following the exit of Christian Horner – told F1 TV: “Extremely proud of the team. It's an amazing comeback, an amazing win.

“A dominant win today in a clean race. It's not a track where we were expecting to dominate, but that's what the guys with Max have been able to do, to come up with a super-fast car here. Very, very proud of the amazing job everyone in Milton Keynes has done to give us not only that race but a sensational comeback in the second part of the year.

“Well done to Lando, it was a tough but a great fight. I hope it was great as well for the fans to have this championship still open up until the end of the year, the very last lap of the last race. And that's it, we'll try harder next.”

Pushed on whether he felt that more could have been done in the Grand Prix to secure the championship for Verstappen, Mekies responded: “No, really I don't think so.

“It was the most perfect race in terms of how the team and Max have managed it from the start – from the pole of yesterday, starting from a difficult Friday to a dominant pole yesterday, leading pretty much from the beginning to the end, super good tyre management.

“I don't think there is anything better than that. We cannot control what's happening behind. We just look at ourselves, and I don't think we could have done anything better today.”

On the other side of the garage, Yuki Tsunoda – in his last race for Red Bull before becoming a reserve driver for the team in 2026 – received a five-second time penalty for making more than one change of direction whilst defending against Norris during a scrap with the McLaren.

“It was a surprise,” Mekies said of the penalty. “But it's always the hardest job in the world for the stewards to come up with something in some situations. It was a surprise, but ultimately it did not affect the result of the championship, so we just keep the win and well done to Lando for the title.”

With the race at the Yas Marina Circuit bringing the curtain down on an eventful 24-race campaign, Mekies expressed his pride at what Red Bull have been able to achieve during the season.

“It's always full of emotion,” the Frenchman conceded. “I think the first dominant feeling is that we got a sensational turnaround, something that you don't see every year, probably you don't see every decade, and that's what the girls and the guys have done.

“So that's the main feeling – very, very proud, very impressed by this team that never ever gave up on this season, and it was pure racing spirit up until the last lap. We are missing two points, but it doesn't change how extraordinary this turnaround has been.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

As the curtain came down on the 2025 season, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix delivered a title-deciding finale – with Lando Norris ultimately crowned the sport's 35th World Champion.

The anticipation could not have been higher ahead of the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with three drivers still in contention to clinch the World Championship at the final race for the first time in 15 years.

Max Verstappen scored an eighth victory of the campaign at the Yas Marina Circuit – but it was Lando Norris who secured his maiden Drivers' Championship title, while McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri had to settle for third in the standings despite a memorable overtake on Norris during Lap 1.

For all that and more, here are the key moments from Abu Dhabi…

Despite leading the Drivers' Championship standings since Round 20 in Mexico, Lando Norris' journey towards a potential first title did not exactly run smoothly during the final rounds of the campaign.

While victory in Sao Paulo strengthened his hold on the crown, a double disqualification for McLaren in Las Vegas followed by a strategy misfire from the squad in Qatar – coupled with a run of wins for Max Verstappen – had seen his advantage cut down to only 12 points arriving into the finale.

Admittedly the odds remained in his favour, with a podium being enough to take the crown – but that top-three spot occasionally looked under threat during the race in Abu Dhabi, with Norris being chased by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc as he ran in third following a first-lap overtake by Oscar Piastri (more on which below).

However, as that charge from Leclerc fell away in the latter stages, Norris was able to breathe a little more easily before crossing the line in third place, and the 26-year-old became emotional as the news sunk in that he had earned a maiden F1 World Championship.

After paying tribute to the support of his team and family, as well as his title rivals Verstappen and Piastri, Norris – who is now the 35th driver in F1 history to win the title – reflected: “It's incredible. Pretty surreal.

“I've dreamed of this for a long time, everyone does. A lot goes into a season like this, lot of ups, lot of downs, but none of that matters as long as you try and come out on top, and that's what we managed to do with an incredible team.”

As touched on above, Verstappen did not make things easy for Norris in a closely-fought battle for the championship that went right down to the wire.

Off the back of his triumphs in Las Vegas and Qatar, the Red Bull man knew he had to win again – and hope for some drama behind him – in order to take a fifth consecutive World Championship. As such, he put himself in the best possible position to do so by grabbing an impressive pole in Qualifying at the Yas Marina Circuit.

From there Verstappen enjoyed a dominant drive to his eighth win of the season, the 28-year-old not putting a foot wrong as he did all he could to keep his title hopes alive. But with Norris sealing that essential third place, the #1 will ultimately move over to the Briton's car in 2026 should he wish to have it.

The final result meant that Verstappen missed out on the Drivers' Championship by a mere two points – and despite admitting that this might look “painful”, the four-time World Champion spoke of his pride at how he and Red Bull had managed to get themselves back into the fight, having been more than 100 points behind after Round 15 at Zandvoort.

“The turnaround has been fun, and today has been fun,” Verstappen explained after the race. “We didn't win the championship, okay, that happens, that's life, and it's not something that I'll be too sad about. I mean, life goes on.

“I'm just very proud of the people I work with, they are my second family, and we will enjoy this moment. We will enjoy the second half of the season, be proud of that, and next year is going to be a big question mark for everyone anyway.”

With a 16-point margin to make up on team mate Norris, Piastri needed to do something special in Abu Dhabi and hope for misfortune to befall his team mate.

While the latter didn't occur as Norris secured a maiden F1 title with P3, the Australian produced some magic and pulled off one of the overtakes of the season, going around the outside of his team mate at the banked Turn 9 on the opening lap.

Having shadowed race leader Verstappen, Piastri took the lead when the Red Bull driver pitted and held the position until the latter stages of the race after starting on the hard Pirelli rubber, in comparison to Verstappen and Norris on the medium.

Having rejoined on the medium tyre in second, Piastri was unable to close the gap to Verstappen and was left short of a maiden world title by 13 points.

""I tried my best and put myself in the best position I could to try and win the race and give myself the best opportunity, but it wasn't to be,"" the 24-year-old said.

""I think we can be very proud of the season we've had. On a personal level, it's obviously not quite the ending that I wished for but I think when you look at the season as a whole, I'm very proud of the work that I've been able to put in.""

Away from the Drivers' title battle, the final placings in the Teams' Championship were up for grabs and, with it, millions in prize money.

With George Russell P5 in the race, Mercedes claimed second in the standings by 18 points from Red Bull, with Ferrari a further 53 points back in fourth.

Neither Carlos Sainz or Alex Albon finished in the points, though Williams had already secured P5 in Qatar, as Racing Bulls took sixth with Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson also not finishing inside the top-10 in Abu Dhabi.

A P6 and P10 finish for Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll ensured Aston Martin finished P7, just three points behind Racing Bulls, while they were 10 points clear of Haas, the American outfit taking seventh in the race at the Yas Marina Circuit with Esteban Ocon.

In Kick Sauber's final race before becoming Audi, the Swiss-based team finished ninth in the Teams' Championship as Nico Hulkenberg reached the points in P9, with Alpine failing to score and 48 points adrift in last.

The great and the good from the world of showbusiness and sport attended the final race of the season to see who would claim this year's Drivers' Championship.

Actress Ana de Armas was on hand to wave the chequered flag for race winner Verstappen on Sunday, having been shown around the Ferrari garage by seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton.

Ahead of Norris' first Drivers' title, the McLaren garage was also graced by the presence of singer/songwriter Katy Perry, with fellow American musician Benson Boone also making an appearance.

From the sporting world, tennis star Jannik Sinner made the trip, as did footballing legends Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Lando Norris came out on top in a tense three-way fight for the 2025 Drivers' Championship in Abu Dhabi.

Lando Norris has admitted that the long journey to his maiden championship was far from straightforward as he faced his “fair share of tough moments”, especially in the earlier part of the 24-race season.

The McLaren driver was crowned the 11th British World Champion at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as he crossed the line in third place, which was enough for him to beat race winner Max Verstappen to the title by just two points.

With his team mate Oscar Piastri also in the mix, there were three contenders in the season finale after the Dutchman battled against McLaren's initial dominance to mount a remarkable comeback and challenge Norris' lead.

The trio took one win apiece in the opening three rounds, but it was clear that the Woking outfit had the upper hand as Piastri achieved a strong run of victories, with Norris finishing in second place more often than not.

It wasn't all smooth sailing, with a low point coming in Saudi Arabia – Norris crashed out of Qualifying and went on to finish the race fourth while his team mate inherited the lead in the Standings – while Canada also proved difficult as Norris ran into his team mate, his resulting DNF seeing him lose a large amount of points.

Speaking after he became champion at the Yas Marina Circuit, Norris said: “I found a good rhythm with the car halfway through the season and I feel like I've been able to find confidence in myself, in my ability not just to win races but to go and fight for a world championship.

“I've certainly had some fortune this year but I've certainly had a fair share of tough moments – especially at the beginning, [there was] a lot I struggled with and lost a little bit of belief early in the season.

“More for myself at that point, it was nice to prove myself wrong in a way at times, starting off in Monaco Qualifying and a few moments after that. The second half of the season I've really been able to show to myself what I could do, what I was capable of doing.”

His turnaround at the Monaco Grand Prix saw him take a spectacular last-gasp pole position, putting him on track to finish the year with seven poles, seven race wins and 423 points to become McLaren's first drivers' champion since Lewis Hamilton back in 2008.

He couldn't afford to let up at any stage, especially after he reclaimed a narrow championship lead at the Mexico City Grand Prix in commanding fashion, giving him the most to lose in the final rounds.

Norris handled the pressure of having two extremely close rivals who he admitted were “pretty freaking fast and certainly made my life tough”, and he did exactly what was necessary in Abu Dhabi to secure the minimum result for him to take the title.

“Oscar the whole way since Round 1, I knew he was probably going to be the toughest guy to beat and then you can never count out Max – he's Max,” he explained. “We certainly never counted him out – for anyone who might have done, he proved you wrong.

“I'm glad we kept ourselves on our toes and we were ready for such a thing. It was a pleasure to fight Max, four-time World Champion, so for me to have those fights against him and enjoy those moments, maybe not always enjoy them but some of them.

“But just to share the track and fight against another World Champion like him and certainly Oscar as well, who will be a World Champion. I really enjoyed this season because of that. As much as they made my life hell a lot of the time, those moments I almost enjoyed the most.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Lando Norris' parents, Adam Norris and Cisca Wauman, have been reflecting on their son's maiden World Championship victory at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Lando Norris' parents have been sharing their emotions after their son claimed his debut World Championship in Abu Dhabi, with the victory coming as a “relief” following an eventful season and a “long journey” to this point.

After taking third place in Sunday's season finale – a result that was enough to seal the title for Norris with a margin of two points from race winner Max Verstappen – the Briton was seen emotionally celebrating his achievement with his loved ones, including dad Adam Norris and mum Cisca Wauman.

Having watched their son climb the motorsport ranks before reaching F1 with McLaren in 2019, Adam Norris reflected on the pathway to the 26-year-old's success when chatting to F1 TV after the event at the Yas Marina Circuit.

Asked to sum up his emotions, Norris senior said: “Relief, probably. It's been a long time and a difficult season, and in the middle when we dipped below.

“But it's a long journey, it's a difficult journey. There's a lot of pain involved in getting there – painful days and long days and sacrifices, and now we're there. Champion of the world, it's cool.”

While finishing in the top three was enough to guarantee Norris the title, that result did not always look certain at stages of the Grand Prix, with Norris having to overtake cars following his pit stop which included a close battle with Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda.

When quizzed on how his heart rate was as he watched on through all of that, Adam Norris smiled: “It was actually really good. For the first time all year, I locked myself in a room, I watched it without commentary, and I just sat there with the headphones on and very quietly watched the whole thing.

“The commentary gets you excited, so when I'm at home I get really excited! My heart rate's going through the roof, so my thing was, ‘Can I listen to some classical music?'. And you know, if he'd had a puncture he wouldn't have got there.”

The elder Norris paid tribute to the “good team” around his son, before conceding that the achievement might take some time to sink in.

“I think it will do,” he admitted. “But I love the journey, and I really loved those places you go to that no tourist would go to. You go to remote little tracks, and I love the journey – I really enjoyed every part of that journey, but it was hard, really difficult.

“Some of the other parents packed up because they didn't want to do that, but I was there and the team was there the whole way through to keep going.”

And when asked what he said to Lando as they embraced following his triumph, Norris senior said: “I can't swear, but just 'champion of the world'. You can never take it away – if someone's won that, you can never take it away. It's a big day.”

It was also a momentous occasion for Norris' mum, Cisca Wauman, who summed up her feelings to Sky Sports F1 as: “Emotionally drained, but very happy. Very happy for the family, for the team, McLaren, the fans, because they've been always there.”

Wauman echoed Adam Norris' comments about the journey up until this moment, explaining that there have been “a lot of sacrifices” along the way.

“When Lando was seven, he started karting; by the time he was eight he was competing together with his brother Ollie, and it took the two boys one direction and the two girls I have the other direction,” she reflected.

“So I missed Lando and Ollie, seeing them growing up as kids. Suddenly playing with a tractor naked in the garden was done, and I missed that! But this is amazing, this is fantastic.”

As the race moved closer to its finish, Wauman spoke of the tension that she felt, adding: “Those last laps, they took ages! You never know [what can happen], until the race is done.

“They were calling us down because me and Adam were sitting in a room separately, and they were calling us down with 10 laps to go – the race is not over, how can they call us down getting ready for this! But here we are.”

David Ellison calls Netflix's $82.7 billion deal value an ""inferior proposal"" and tells Warners shareholders that his coalition (which includes Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds) promises $18 billion more in cash. 



		By Alex Weprin, Erik Hayden 

	December 8, 2025 6:08am	




	It's a bidding war. David Ellison says his Paramount is going on the offensive, launching a $108.4 billion hostile offer “backed by my family” along with RedBird Capital and multiple wealth funds to take over all of Warner Bros. Discovery, go directly to its shareholders and appeal to Hollywood that its ownership will be better for the entertainment industry.


	The mogul, the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison (net worth: $277 billion), is fresh off attending the President Trump-hosted Kennedy Center honors in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 7. He described Netflix's $82.7 billion deal as an “inferior proposal” and said that Warners' decision to split the company is an unsound move. In the deal agreed to with Netflix co-chiefs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, Warner Bros., HBO and HBO Max will go to the streaming giant while WBD's embattled cable networks division (TNT, CNN, HGTV, the Food Network and Discovery) will be spun out as a separately traded company.

	“The Paramount offer for the entirety of WBD provides shareholders $18 billion more in cash than the Netflix consideration,” the Ellison-owned company stated. “WBD's Board of Directors recommendation of the Netflix transaction over Paramount's offer is based on an illusory prospective valuation of Global Networks that is unsupported by the business fundamentals and encumbered by high levels of financial leverage assigned to the entity.”

	Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors replied that it “will carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer” and will advise shareholders within ten days of any decisions.


	Paramount's team expressed frustration multiple times in an investor call on Monday, saying that they felt they had been frozen out of the conversation with Zaslav's Warner Bros. crew as the deal talks went in to its final days in early December. “Throughout the totality of the process we never received a single markup of the documents,” COO Andy Gordon griped.


	The Paramount tender offer is for $30 per share, all in cash, a contrast to Netflix's offer, which is a $27.75 mix of cash and some stock, with shareholders also getting a stake in the linear TV spinout. Netflix is also only buying WBD's streaming and studios business, while Paramount is pursuing the whole company, making for a complicated comparison, depending on how you value the linear TV business.


	A filing confirms that Paramount's tender offer is also supported by $24 billion in debt financing from sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, as well as from Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. The tender includes a copy of the Dec. 4 offer, which did include that financing. Abu Dhabi, the Saudis, Qatar and Kushner are forgoing governance in the company if a deal goes through.


	(China-based entertainment giant Tencent was also a part of an earlier Paramount offer for Warners, but the company made changes in response to concerns from the WBD board, including removing Tencent from the consortium, and with Affinity and the sovereign wealth funds agreeing “to forgo any governance rights – including board representation – associated with their non-voting equity investments.”)

	











	Because it is a tender offer, Paramount will need to persuade shareholders to sell their stock to it, rather than sign off on the Netflix deal. The result will likely be a public, extended campaign from Paramount, Warner Bros. and Netflix to make their case.


	“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,” Ellison said. “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process.”


	To that end, Paramount launched a website called “StrongerHollywood,” which outlines the company's offer and throws shade on Netflix's deal, with Ellison arguing that a takeover by his company will be better for the industry. The Ellison team also sees $6 billion in cost-saving synergies between a combined Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount, given duplicative operations on back office, finance, technology and infrastructure, while keeping creative teams intact. The Oracle heir, who's produced Mission: Impossible entries and blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick, is only months removed from closing an $8 billion deal in August to merge his Skydance Media with the owner of Paramount Pictures, CBS, MTV and Paramount+.

	











	“We believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood,” Ellison wrote. “It is in the best interests of the creative community, consumers and the movie theater industry. We believe they will benefit from the enhanced competition, higher content spend and theatrical release output, and a greater number of movies in theaters as a result of our proposed transaction.” 


	Up next may be a war of words to convince shareholders, Wall Street, Hollywood stakeholders and government regulators who may be the best suitor for Warner Bros. Upon inking a deal on Dec. 5, Warners chief David Zaslav, in line to receive hundreds of millions of dollars if the deal closes, called the choice based on “the realities of an industry undergoing generational change – in how stories are financed, produced, distributed, and discovered.”


	And in opening remarks to Street analysts the same day, both Sarandos and Peters stressed the deal would benefit the industry at large. “This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it's pro-creator, it's pro-growth,” said Sarandos, with counterpart Peters adding that there'll be “more jobs created across the entire entertainment industry.” Netflix, in an effort it code named “Project Noble,” secured $59 billion in financing from a consortium of banks to assemble the deal.Those may be the revealing quotes as Netflix girds for what may be emerging opposition research-style lines — Paramount already has a dossier with a long list of them — that it's taking out a major studio buyer, possibly decimating the theatrical window over time and becoming a subscription streaming monopoly with massive market share. Sarandos has attempted to allay those concerns, saying, “We'll continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros,” a line that didn't rule out changes to WB's business model in the future. Similarly, Netflix's co-chief Peters heaped praise on the HBO brand but didn't say outright that HBO Max will continue on as a stand-alone service.


	In contrast, Paramount and Warner Bros.' movie studios would collectively release 30 or more movies a year in cinemas. “We're going to satisfy the needs of the moviegoing public,” Ellison pledged. 

	











	On the lobbying front, Sarandos has met with Trump in his effort to win over the White House on the deal, and the President, in a perhaps telling all-caps Truth Social tirade about CBS News' 60 Minutes on Monday, deemed Ellison's Paramount “no better than the old ownership.” And that social post came hours after Trump emceed the Kennedy Center honors, which will be broadcast on CBS on Dec. 23. 


	Hollywood labor, too, has come out against the Netflix deal, although that's not to say that the guilds would be for a Paramount offer either. The Writers Guild of America went scorched earth on the deal (“must be blocked“) and the chief of the Teamsters' motion picture division called for it to be blocked. Theater owners group Cinema United called it “an unprecedented threat” and its European equivalent UNIC says it “fails in every regard.” But SAG-AFTRA, which also has a Netflix deal to air the Actor Awards, appeared to withhold judgment, saying the buy “must result in more creation and more production, not less.” And the Christopher Nolan-led Directors Guild just said the deal raises “significant concerns.”


	Netflix expects its deal to close in 12 to 18 months if it clears regulatory review. The Ellison-led Paramount, in its argument, says it can get a deal done in a year.

The Netflix co-CEOs were interviewed hours after a hostile offer for Warner Bros. from Paramount. ""We didn't buy this company to destroy that value,"" Sarandos adds. 


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters aren't worried about Paramount‘s hostile bid for Warner Bros.


	The Netflix co-CEOs addressed the elephant in the room right at the beginning of a session at a UBS conference in New York Monday afternoon.




	“Today's move was entirely expected,” Sarandos said. “We have a deal done, and we are really happy with the deal for shareholders, for consumers, it's a great way to create and protect jobs in the entertainment industry. We're super confident we are going to get it across.”

	“I think we want to start by saying it's not our position to tell the regulators how to think about this,” Peters said about regulatory scrutiny. “They have to do their work and define the market the way that they do it. Clearly, they'll do their analysis, and we'll support them with whatever they need in that regard. But if we go back to the fundamentals of this deal, we are very confident that regulators should and will approve it. At the end of the day, it's pro consumer.”

	The executives were the main event of an otherwise typical Wall Street confab. Ten minutes before they were set to go on stage, every seat in the conference center inside UBS' New York headquarters was taken, as the back of the room filled up with people wanting to listen to what they had to say.


	In the conversation with UBS analyst John Hudlick, Sarandos and Peters emphasized that they do not intend to shut down parts of the company, and will operate the studios and HBO as they are currently. In fact, Sarandos reaffirmed that Netflix will be committed to theatrical releases.

	











	“In this transaction, we pick up three businesses basically that we're not currently in, meaning we have no redundancies currently, but one of them is a motion picture studio with a theatrical distribution machine,” Sarandos said. “There's been a lot of speculation what we would do with this. I think it's important to note that all we are going to do with this is staying deeply committed to releasing those movies exactly the way they've released the movies today, all three of these new businesses we want to keep operating largely as they are, the theatrical business we have not talked a lot about in the past, about wanting to do it, because we've never been in that business. When this deal closes, we are in that business, and we're going to do it.”


	“We didn't buy this company to destroy that value,” he continued.


	As for HBO, “this is a prestige television brand that people really love, and I would say that they have been doing gymnastics to make themselves into a general entertainment brand,” Sarandos said. “I think under this transaction, they don't have to do that anymore. We're already a very well established general entertainment brand. We want HBO to double down on the things that people have loved for 50 years.”


	The pair said that unlike Paramount, they are not planning to consolidate studios, and pointed out the billions in efficiencies that Paramount is pursuing. They framed the deal as saving jobs, not cutting jobs, and that leadership at the division level at WBD would be tapped to keep doing their jobs.

	











	And they made the argument that Netflix does not dominate the streaming business at all, bringing along a graphic that was displayed on screens beside the stage, with Nielsen Gauge data that showed Netflix behind YouTube an Disney in terms of total TV time spent. If Paramount acquired Warner Bros., they would also be above Netflix, the executives argued,


	Their interview came just hours after Paramount, led by David Ellison, launched a hostile tender offer for Warner Bros., seeking to peel off the company from Netflix's grasp.


	“The Paramount offer for the entirety of WBD provides shareholders $18 billion more in cash than the Netflix consideration,” Paramount said in its bid. “WBD's Board of Directors recommendation of the Netflix transaction over Paramount's offer is based on an illusory prospective valuation of Global Networks that is unsupported by the business fundamentals and encumbered by high levels of financial leverage assigned to the entity.”


	Netflix has been strategic in its pursuit of Warner Bros., including a secret meeting between Sarandos and President Trump last month, which the deal came up. Trump subsequently called Sarandos “fantastic” but nonetheless said the deal could be “problematic.”


	Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is among the backers of Paramount's bid for Warners.


	Sarandos addressd the Trump factor at the UBS conference, saying that “the President cares deeply about American industry, and he loves the entertainment industry. 

	











	“I've talked to him many times since the election about the different challenges facing the entertainment industry,” he continued. “He definitely understands the dynamics of what we were just talking about … what the President has been interested in this deal has been to what extent does it create jobs in America. And he understands what we do, which is that we drive a ton of work in America.”


	As the allotted time wound down, Sarandos turned to those in the crowd, spanning the finance and investing world.


	“I just want to say something to the folks in this room, the folks on the stream, many of whom have been owners of Netflix for the long haul, where we've navigated some really complicated things, is that we are going into a deal that we are really excited about,” Sarandos said, looking around the room in the basement of the UBD building. “We think this deal for Warner Bros, is good for shareholders. We think it's good for consumers. We think it's good for creators. We think it's great for the entertainment industry as a whole, because we're creating and protecting jobs and production and we can continue to grow the business. 


	“We're really excited about it, and we just wanted to say to all of you that we appreciated you sticking with us through these things and this is in many ways, not as complicated as many of the things we've already done,” he added. “So we look forward to the next phase of this, getting this deal approved and moving forward.”

Paul Thomas Anderson won best director for the film, while Ethan Hawke and Rose Byrne won best lead performance for 'Blue Moon' and 'If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.'


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


One Battle After Another was named best picture by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, which voted Sunday this year's best films, performances and technical achievements.


The Secret Agent was the runner-up, and also nabbed the award for best film not in the English language.




	In addition, Paul Thomas Anderson won best director for One Battle After Another, with Ryan Coogler as the runner-up for Sinners.


	For best lead performance, Ethan Hawke and Rose Byrne won for Blue Moon and If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, respectively, and for best supporting performance, Stellan Skarsgard and Teyana Taylor won for Sentimental Value and One Battle After Another, respectively.

	Best cinematography was the first award revealed Sunday, with Adolpho Veloso for Train Dreams named the winner. Hannah Beachler later won best production design for Sinners, and Ronald Bronstein and Josh Safdie won best editing for Marty Supreme.

	As for best animation, Little Amélie or the Character of Rain took home the award, while KPop Demon Hunters was the runner-up.


	In addition, the critics group said it will give a Special Citation to Judy Kim of Gardena Cinema, “a historic 800-seat, single-screen movie palace that has operated as an independent cinema and beacon of community since the Kim family took ownership in 1976.” 


	The association previously announced in October that filmmaker and screenwriter Philip Kaufman as the recipient of this year's Career Achievement Award. “Intrepid doesn't even begin to describe a director who, among his many considerable achievements, gave Indiana Jones his first assignment and inspired the NC-17 rating,” said LAFCA president Robert Abele of Kaufman.

	











	“A criminally underappreciated director, Philip Kaufman could never be pigeonholed, from his early days absorbing the independent spirit of homegrown DIY-ers and the European New Wave, to his cool, vivid command of genre in the '70s, followed by a handful of uncompromising historical epics, including The Right Stuff and The Unbearable Lightness of Being, that belied anybody's notion that American filmmakers couldn't be versatile, intelligent and entertaining about big ideas,” Abele continued. “The L.A. Film Critics Association is immensely proud to be honoring this dyed-in-the-wool iconoclast.”


	Last year, Anora was voted best picture by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.


	Most years, the organization's choice for best picture garners an Oscar nomination for the night's top prize. This was true last year, when Anora earned the LAFCA trophy for best picture and then went on to receive an Oscar nod for best picture and ultimately took home the Academy Award. For the fourth year in a row, the L.A. Film Critics Association Awards will feature gender-neutral acting categories.

The posts on Truth Social come just as Paramount hopes to gain traction with its hostile offer for Warner Bros. Discovery. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	President Donald Trump railed against Paramount leadership Monday after the airing of an interview with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) on 60 Minutes. 


	“My real problem with the show, however, wasn't the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME! Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE,” Trump posted on Truth social.

	The comments come just as Paramount launched a hostile offer for Warner Bros. Discovery Monday, which may spell trouble for the company should Warner Bros. take up the offer. Netflix had been announced as the winning bidder for the company's studio assets Friday.

	Netflix reportedly shored up support from Trump ahead of the bid, with co-CEO Ted Sarandos meeting with the President. On Sunday, Trump called Sarandos “fantastic” and said Netflix is a “great company,” but he also said the merger would create “very big market share” and “could be a problem.” 


	In the post on Truth Social, Trump attacked both Green, who said “reminds me of a Rotten Apple! Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA” and 60 Minutes Correspondent Lesley Stahl who she said owes him an apology for their reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop. Stahl had initially said that she wouldn't cover the laptop story because it couldn't be verified and then later covered the story. 

	











	“The only reason Marjorie ‘Traitor' Brown (Green turns Brown under stress!) went BAD is that she was JILTED by the President of the United States (Certainly not the first time she has been jilted!). Too much work, not enough time, and her ideas are, NOW, really BAD – She sort of reminds me of a Rotten Apple! Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA, because nobody could have changed her views so fast, and her new views are those of a very dumb person,” the post reads.


	“That was proven last night when washed up, Trump hating, 60 Minutes “correspondent,” Lesley Stahl, who still owes me an apology from when she attacked me on the show (with serious conviction!), that Hunter Biden's LAPTOP FROM HELL was produced by Russia, not Hunter himself (TOTALLY PROVEN WRONG!), interviewed a very poorly prepared Traitor, who in her confusion made many really stupid statements,” the post continues.

	Two Australian Metallica fans have been hit with lifetime bans from Perth's Optus Stadium after climbing a speaker tower during the band's Nov. 1 show on the M72 World Tour.

	According to local outlet PerthNow, 20-year-old Beau William Loch Rollings and 23-year-old Rory Hugh Culbert jumped a safety barrier and scaled the central tower inside the stadium bowl, clinging to the structure at heights reportedly between 10 and 50 meters for around 20 minutes while the concert continued.

	The stunt triggered a major security response as venue staff and police moved in, with thousands of fans watching the incident unfold mid-show. Police later seized the pair's phones, which contained footage of the climb, as part of the trespass investigation.


	Magistrate Ruth Dineen was blunt in her assessment, describing the tower climb as “an incredibly stupid thing to do and a good way to ruin your night out,” noting that what “seemed funny at the time” had escalated into a serious safety issue. 


	Defence lawyer Rachael Gemmell characterized it as “just stupid behavior,” arguing the experience had been sobering for the young fans.


	Both Rollings and Culbert entered guilty pleas to trespassing charges, acknowledging the gravity of the situation without offering a motive. Rollings was fined $1,000 and ordered to pay $308.80 in court costs. Culbert received a similar penalty.

	











	Throughout their Aussie tour, Metallica have delighted fans with surprise covers of local hits, such as “Zebra” by John Butler Trio during their signature “doodle” segment. 


	Butler, who is currently touring across Europe and the U.K., shared his bluesy interpretation via Instagram, using a custom-made Indian slide guitar known as a Chaturangui. “@metallica ‘Enter Sandman,' but make it John Butlery,” he captioned the clip.


	“It's taken me a minute to pull my sh*t together after Metallica covered my song ‘Zebra' last weekend in Perth/Boorloo… I thought I'd tackle one of their lesser-known tracks. I hope you like it.” 


	In Adelaide on Nov. 5, Hammett and Trujillo mashed up INXS' “Need You Tonight” with the Angels' “Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again,” blending two Australian staples into a blistering live medley.

Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said Paramount‘s hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery was “entirely expected,” but the exec said he remains “super-confident” in the streaming giant's plan to close the deal.


	“Today's move was entirely expected,” Sarandos said at a conference in New York hosted by Wall Street bank UBS. “We have a deal done, and we are incredibly happy with the deal. It's great for shareholders, great for consumers. We think it's a great way to create and protect jobs in the entertainment industry.  We're super confident we're going to get it across the line. So we're set.

	Sarandos opened the planned 35-minute session with the comments, which came in response to UBS media analyst John Hodulik's straightforward question about the Paramount news. “What are your thoughts?” Hodulik asked, and the room broke out in laughter as the buzzed-about topic surfaced.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix last Friday announced a $82.7 billion deal (including debt) to acquire the studios and streaming division of Warner Bros. Discovery. Paramount then came back Monday morning with a hostile offer of $30 per share for the entire company, higher than the Netflix proposal's $27.75 a share.


	In a conference call with analysts Monday to discuss the bid, as well as during a somewhat contentious interview on CNBC, Paramount CEO David Ellison strove to depict his bid as pro-consumer and pro-competition. Letting Netflix and Warner Bros. merge, he argued, would be a negative outcome for streaming subscribers and the industry alike. He also argued that “cash is king,” with Paramount's new bid (its sixth in the past 12 weeks) entirely cash, and said it provides more certainty to WBD shareholders in terms of the financials as well as on the regulatory front.

Netflix is the next owner of Warner Brothers.

The bid from Paramount is not higher. You have to factor in that the cable channels will be sold for $3-5 a share, not the $1 that Ellison is claiming in his tantrums.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Should Paramount succeed in acquiring Warner Bros, the combined studio will release more than 30 theatrical titles a year. This was Paramount CEO David Ellison's promise during a phone presser following news of the conglom's hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros Discovery. 


	Such words mean a tremendous amount to exhibition and some content creators in the industry who have been fearful about a Netflix-Warner Bros. marriage. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos spoke about his commitment to theatrical if the streamer acquires Warner Bros, but he hopes to “evolve” the window to meet consumer's demand for content. Netflix recently dropped the ball on the theatrical release for Rian Johnson's threequel Wake Up Dead Man: Knives Out Mystery, failing to book the top three theater chains due to a lack of a 30 day window. The movie did substantially less in its limited release with over $4M in its 5-day Thanksgiving launch versus when Netflix had the chains on board for the franchise's previous chapter, Glass Onion, in 2022 which grossed $13M+.

	Said Ellison on the phoner this AM, “Including the Writer's Guild of America have already issued a statement that a deal must be blocked. Hollywood legends, like James Cameron and Jane Fondant have spoken out, describing the (Netflix) deal as a disaster for theatrical films. Paramount's proposal provides vastly superior certainty and projections for WBD's shareholders and the Hollywood community.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Paramount is committed to growing the film and TV output of both businesses, including a theatrical slate of 30 plus theatrical releases per year. We're going to satisfy the needs of the moviegoing public,” he added. 

	











	While Sarandos didn't specify the length of the window that Netflix would strive for in a post Netflix-Warner Bros world, sources with knowledge of the situation say that the streaming boss has been pushing a 17-day exclusive theatrical window versus the 45-day window which the top three circuits crave. Netflix has been essentially stunting with theatrical of late. They were able to get No. 2 and No. 3 circuits Regal and Cinemark onboard for their theatrical release of KPop Demon Hunters Singalong in late August, which delivered their first No. 1 at the box office with $19M. The movie dropped weeks after debuting on Netflix where it had already racked up record views. Netflix is teaming with exhibition for the Stranger Things series finale which will play movie theaters Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 (the two-hour episode drops on New Year's Eve). Due to talent residual rights issues, a movie ticket price can't be charged. Exhibitors are reserving seats by charging moviegoers a $20 concession voucher (all that money, they can keep). For exhibition, Strangers Things and KPop Demon Hunters qualify as alternative programming in their chains; they're the exception to a full-bodied theatrical release (hence the reason why such content isn't beholden to windows standards). 


	“We've released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it's not like we have this opposition to movies in theaters,” said Sarandos on a Friday call with Wall Street fresh off clinching a mega deal to acquire Warner Bros. However, none of these movies, except for KPop Demon Hunters Singalong, have been wide releases. Netflix movie titles are limited releases and typically serve the purpose of qualifying for Oscars. 


	“My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long, exclusive windows, which we don't really think are that consumer friendly,” Sarandos added. 


	“The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” exclaimed Cinema United President and CEO Michael O'Leary on Friday in response to a potential Netflix-Warner Bros merger.


	He expounded, “Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre. But Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry. This mega-deal between Netflix and Warner Bros. would risk removing 25% of the annual domestic box office if films that are traditionally given a robust theatrical release by Warner Bros. disappear from theatres. Netflix currently grants only a handful of their films a token theatrical release and the overwhelming.”


Paramount today announced it has begun an all-cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery for $30 per share, an operation it says equates to an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. Their play calls for the entire Warner Bros Discovery, linear networks et al, versus Netflix's eye for Warner Bros Studio (theatrical and TV production) and HBO Max streaming service. 


	The Netflix deal for Warners is worth $72 billion in equity value (enterprise value $82.7 billion enterprise value) with Warner Bros. selling assets to Netflix for $27.75 a share in cash and stock. The Warner Bros-Netflix union is pending regulatory approval, with the transaction happening post WBD's break-up between motion picture/streaming studio and a linear network operation (that expected to occur in 2026 Q3). The process is expected to take 12 to 18 months to close.

It's not about quantity, it's about quality.

With the $2.8 billion that Netflix will get from WBD, they can go out and buy Lionsgate.

Neither of them should get WB. Both are horrible choices.

30 releases a year? Remember when Netflix said almost the same thing with 52 releases a year? And no one cared bc they were all shit. Quality over quantity. I'd also love these guys to stop pretending like they actually want to do the audience/moviegoers any favors. We all know you dont actually care about us.

“My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long, exclusive windows, which we don't really think are that consumer friendly,” Sarandos added

This is such an asinine statement. This dude just lacks complete self-awareness?  Or does he really think we're all (the industry, consumers, creatives, etc) just that stupid that we would believe this statement? 

This statement is frankly, insulting.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	There can be no doubt about it. The internationally named Golden Globes can finally safely say they are indeed global.  


	The big takeaway from Monday morning's nominations for the 83rd annual Golden Globe Awards is the presence of an unprecedented number of subtitled films in the marquee Best Motion Picture -Drama and Best Motion Picture –  Comedy or Musical categories, with five of the 12 nominees foreign-language films: Iran's It Was Just An Accident, Brazil's The Secret Agent, and Norway's Sentimental Value (with a WOW eight nominations alone) are competing in Drama, while France's Nouvelle Vague and South Korea's No Other Choice are up for Comedy/Musical. Viewers of the broadcast on CBS this year better be able to read.












	All of these are what are generally termed as arthouse movies, and a whopping four of them come from indie upstart Neon, which led all studios and distributors with an overall 22 nominations — clear payoff from CEO Tom Quinn's practice of going to the Cannes Film Festival and buying as many as he can. It was a very big Globes showing for Cannes because all the aforementioned films but No Other Choice (which premiered in Venice) were main Cannes competition entries, the Drama nominees all major prize winners at Cannes as well.




			Watch on Deadline		







	All of this international action, in these and other categories (even Animated Feature had three subtitled entries) can be attributed to the truly “international” makeover of the much maligned and scandal-ridden history of the former Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which consisted of about 85 Hollywood-based members identifying as journalists who wrote for foreign publications, and many of them that I know actually do that, some didn't.

	











	After the whole enterprise was exposed in a Los Angeles Times article, the Globes were in serious trouble until new ownership, Penske Media Eldridge (a joint venture that includes Penske Media Corporation, which is parent company of Deadline) bought Dick Clark Productions, which who have annually produced the Golden Globes broadcast, abolished the HFPA, absorbed many of its members and augmented with an estimated 300 or so new voters largely plucked from FIPRESCI, an international group of film critics and writers. The influence of this new voting bloc is unmistakable — genuine journalists from around the world who regularly attend major film festivals. It should be said the movies chosen are really good. 


	As one prominent Hollywood studio awards strategist who has campaigned for Globes votes for decades texted me this morning, “well you add 350 int'l journalists you get a lot of foreign films I guess … same thing happened with AMPAS … if you want to be the European Film Awards go ahead but ratings will plummet.” We will see if this person is right about that, but the actual ratings on CBS were quite good last year and the network has a multi-year deal to air the Globes after NBC dropped them.


	Another major player in the awards game who had a number of films nominated today also noted the heavy international influence and told me, “the era of Globes influence on the Oscars looks over.” That is to be determined since the Motion Picture Academy has also notably beefed up its global footprint in terms of recruiting members from around the world in recent years. Can this Globes list be a sign of things to come Oscar nomination morning?


	It was only recently in terms of Globes history that a foreign-language film nominated in the Best Motion Picture – Non-English Language category could even be eligible to also compete in Drama or Comedy/Musical categories. Now they dominate (four of the six nominees in the Non-English Language category are also up in the marquee categories).


	As for the rest of the major nominees this morning, the biggest surprise to me was Wicked: For Good being left out of Comedy/Musical, a category that seems designed for that film, and for which Wicked was nominated last year. Now it is dominated by movies that are very hard to define as comedy or musical, with Bugonia, Marty Supreme, One Battle After Another and Blue Moon joining the two aforementioned foreign-language entries.


Blue Moon with a truly great Ethan Hawke (also nominated) is a terrific movie, but this film is not a comedy, and not a musical. It is about the breakup of the songwriting team Rodgers & Hart and set at a Sardi's opening-night party of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical Oklahoma. Maybe voters got confused, but studios are the ones who enter the movies in the categories they want, usually ones where they suspect they will have the best chance. Labeling movies these days as strictly comedy or drama is an outdated concept considering the gray area of so many films now. It Was Just an Accident, which Neon put in Drama, is largely a comedy with serious undertones. Wicked: For Good is unmistakably a musical, but it will have to settle for its acting and song nominations in addition to a nom in the Cinematic and Box Office Achievement category, which is basically designed for movies that make money.

	











	Regarding the latter one of the nominees, Avatar: Fire And Ash hasn't made a dime yet since it doesn't open until next week, but I guess voters are predicting it will be a box office hit. At any rate, with this heavy arty lineup of movies, the relatively new box office category looks like an idea of genius by the show's producers in order to guarantee at least some films viewers have heard of, much less seen. As for another new category, Best Podcast, I have nothing to say. Does that really belong on a show dedicated to movies and TV?


RELATED: Comedy Stars Triumph Over Right-Wing Firebrands In First Golden Globes Podcast Nominations


	Even the star power the Globes have always been known for seems muted among this year's nominees. Yes there are favorites like Julia Roberts (After the Hunt), Jennifer Lawrence (Die My Love), and Dwayne Johnson (The Smashing Machine) in the lead Drama acting categories, but they were all in movies that were box office bombs. Still they will be front and center you can bet where cameras can catch them along with other starry nominees in Comedy like George Clooney (nominated for Jay Kelly, which also should have been a Best Picture Comedy nominee), Timothée Chalamet and Leonardo DiCaprio. Rest assured, “Hollywood's Party of the Year” will still have plenty of recognizable faces in the crowd on the movie side of the aisle, if not for movies a lot of people have seen. Maybe this will encourage them to check these films out.


	Of course, the Golden Globes is not just about the movies, but also gives out numerous statuettes for television, and unlike many of the artier nominees for film, viewers will instantly recognize the majority of this year's TV contenders as they basically were all just at the Emmys in September. This is a bit of a switch for Globes, which in its HFPA heyday championed, and often were the first, to nominate new shows. But not so much anymore, which could also be indicative of the more international membership not as familiar with the likes of acclaimed freshman shows like The Paper, The Lowdown, I Love LA, Landman, Task, etc. A whopping 11 of the 12 nominees in Best Television Series Drama and Musical or Comedy categories were all in those related Emmy categories. The only newbie to break in was Vince Gilligan's recently debuted Pluribus on Apple TV. Netflix‘s Adolescence leads the Limited Series category, as it did at the Emmys, but at least there was some fresh blood there with Prime Video's The Girlfriend, Netflix's The Beast In Me, and Peacock's All Her Fault, so conversely this Globes recognition could help those shows solidify strong Emmy-season campaigns.


	There is also very little variation from Emmys in the TV acting categories, with only Glen Powell in Chad Powers, Rhea Seehorn in Pluribus (believe it or not her first Globes nomination) and Mark Ruffalo for the otherwise underrepresented Task breaking through from what Emmys have done in the past year or two. Jacob Elordi was one of just a few who broke through in both movies and TV with his supporting nomination for Frankenstein and the little-known Australian TV film The Narrow Road to the Deep North. 


	When all is said and done about the Golden Globes lineup this year, it did solidify what we have been seeing this first week in December of awards giving and nominating. Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, which leads all Globe nominations with nine (tying Cabaret and Barbie for third most all-time at a single Globes), after wins at Gothams, NYFCC, National Board of Review and major recognition from AFI, as well as 14 nominations at Critics Choice, is your current front-runner for Oscars, folks. The one to beat.

	











	That's certainly good news for Warner Bros, which had a very good day at the Globes with 18 nominations (including seven for Sinners), as well as Netflix with 13 (including three films with Best Picture nominations). Add in TV totals for Netflix leading with 22 nominations to HBO Max's 15, and you have a really good day for the prospective merger of Netflix and Warner Bros. continuing the collective rout they had with Critics Choice, too.


RELATED: NetBros Gonna Eat: Netflix & WB Dominance Of Golden Globes Nominations Offers Glimpse At Potential Hollywood Monopoly


	Of course, David Ellison tried to spoil the show, revealing Paramount's hostile takeover attempt of WBD just as we were getting Globes nominations announced. It is ironic since Ellison's CBS and Paramount+ are the network and streamer carrying the Golden Globes on January 11, and yet Paramount, CBS and Paramount+ were dead last on the Globes' studio charts, managing only a combined three nominations (one each between them, and that includes Par's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning nom in the box office category). Perhaps instead, David, you should be considering a hostile takeover of the Golden Globes voters instead of WBD shareholders. Just sayin'.

Awards Writer


	During Monday morning's Golden Globe nominations, Wicked: For Good star Cynthia Erivo was out for blood. While in the middle of rehearsals for the upcoming production of Kip Williams' Dracula on London's West End, where Erivo plays all 23 roles, she was informed about her historic nomination. 


	Alongside her co-star Ariana Grande, Erivo has made history as the first two actors from the same film to be consecutively nominated for their roles as Elphaba and Glinda. However, in addition to that, Erivo also makes Golden Globes history as the first Black woman to be nominated twice in the Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy category. “It's amazing, but also let's make sure that it doesn't stay that way,” the actor said to Deadline on nominations morning. “Let's make sure that more Black women are nominated in this category. Being the first is always wonderful, but let's make sure I'm not the last.” 

	











	At the nomination's ceremony, Wicked: For Good did ride the broom to success with five total nominations, including Best Original Song in a Motion Picture for Stephen Schwartz's “No Place Like Home” and “The Girl in the Bubble” and Best Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Below, Erivo speaks to Deadline about her performance in Wicked: For Good, “No Place Like Home” and making history at the Golden Globes.


DEADLINE: This is the end of the cinematic journey of one of the most defining roles in pop-culture history. You've talked in interviews about how this project has brought you incredible friendships and challenged you as a singer and actor. How are you processing this? 












CYNTHIA ERIVO: I just take things day by day, and I try not to take any of it for granted. This is all a privilege, and being able to make a piece like this that connects with people this way is something you can never guarantee. I'm acutely aware that this has done something we were all wholly unprepared for. We knew it would be special on the set, but we couldn't have imagined the response of what came after. 


DEADLINE: According to the Hollywood Foreign Press, you're the first Black woman to be nominated for lead actress twice. What does that responsibility mean to you? 


ERIVO: It's amazing, but also let's make sure that it doesn't stay that way. Let's make sure that more Black women are nominated in this category. Being the first is always wonderful, but let's make sure I'm not the last. I don't want to be the last person to have this happen to. I hope there are more of me.


DEADLINE: “No Place Like Home” also got a nomination. Talk a bit about the importance of that song for Elphaba's character journey. Do you remember when you first received it? 


ERIVO: When I first got it, I thought it was beautiful, but I felt like it wasn't connected as much to Elphaba. And then we did some work on it, and I really wanted to make sure that we made the connection between how she was feeling and how everyone else could feel too. So, there was a through line of understanding that Elphaba understood what it felt like to feel like she didn't belong in a place, which is what we've been telling people this entire time. And so, I felt like it was important for that to still be in this song. And so, when we finally found what it was meant to be, I was really pleased with it because it felt connected and, in a way, heartbreaking.


	And I think what has amazed me is how many people are seeing the connection between where we are now and who we are now and this particular song and how it makes people feel and how people feel in the world and how the home is still home even when it doesn't treat you the way it should. I think there's something very special about the song. And when we take time to listen to music, that connection is what we want. We want the songs we listen to, yes, sometimes help us escape, but also to remind us to connect to those deeper feelings.


DEADLINE: Elphaba gets to show a deeper pain and frustration this time around in Wicked: For Good. What is a scene that still resonates or haunts you—in a good way—that highlights the best of that performance?  


ERIVO: “For Good” is one of those scenes, but I think it might be “No Good Deed” really. The response to that has shocked even me a little bit. I was always really looking forward to it, but it scared the shit out of me because it was such a big undertaking, I was on my own, and it's such a big number. So, there was a part of me that was like, “Am I really going to be able to pull this off? Is this going to feel as connected as I want it to be?” Not to mention all the technical things that have to go into it that are really complicated. There's memory flashbacks, stunt work, and a massive emotional arc within the song, and to top it off, I'm singing in wires. “No Good Deed” feels like a culmination of everything I have learned across the two movies in one space. 


	That's definitely a scene, to use your word, that haunts me. I knew that singing “For Good” would work because, even when we weren't ready for it, we were. You know what I mean? However, I didn't know how “No Good Deed” would be because there was no feedback; all I had was Jon [M. Chu], but no one was performing with me to gauge the temperature.

	











	Also, performing intimately with Ariana [Grande] and Jonny [Bailey] is something that will stick with me, and it was beautiful to be part of. Because when you have those close connections, you know certain scenes will work. So, I was never worried about scenes with them, but I was definitely worried about “No Good Deed,” so to hear people cheer in the theater once the scene was done was really mind-blowing. 


DEADLINE: I simply have to mention that people online are absolutely raving over your composition of that song, but more specifically, on the way you riff, “Maybe that's the reason why.” 


ERIVO: I know. I'm trying to think about how that even came about. I feel like I remember working with Stephen Schwartz, and I was just like, “I think I have an idea for something in this line.” Because I didn't want to break up the emotional tension of that moment, I wanted it to feel like a fall into a yell, and the only way to do that was to slide up the scale and into the next note and as you mentioned, it pulls and lengthens until you land on the note. 


DEADLINE: Metaphorically and probably spiritually, you put people in the hospital with that note. 


ERIVO: Oh, my goodness, that's hilarious. Listen, it was a lot of breathwork. I put myself through it that day. 


	The 83rd annual Golden Globes ceremony will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+ on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026, at 5:00 p.m. PT/8:00 p.m. ET

KISS frontman Gene Simmons blamed “bad decisions” for his friend and fellow bandmate Ace Frehley's death. 

The band's co-founder condemned Frehley's substance abuse, suggesting it was to blame for the guitarist's fatal fall down the stairs in his Morristown, NJ, home studio.

“He refused [advice] from people that cared about him – including yours truly – to try to change his lifestyle. In and out of bad decisions. Falling down the stairs — I'm not a doctor — doesn't kill you. There may have been other issues, and it breaks my heart,” Simmons told The Post on Saturday.

“The saddest thing – you reap what you shall sow unfortunately,” the singer, 76, added, also referencing Frehley's struggles with alcoholism. However, Frehley had been sober for 20 years before his death.

Simmons also opened up about the guitarist's private funeral service on Oct. 22.

“It breaks my heart. Peter Criss, our founding drummer, Paul [Stanley] and myself went to the funeral, open casket,” he said, calling it “heartbreaking” and “sad.”

“Saddest of all perhaps is that Ace just couldn't stay alive long enough to sit there proudly at the Kennedy Center and listen to – I can't even tell you who's going to come out… really impressive people, just to say how much KISS meant to them. What can you say – sad.”

The surviving KISS members — Simmons, Criss and Stanley — had a brief reunion as they went to Washington, DC, on Saturday to collect a Kennedy Center Honor.

Frehley died Oct. 16 at the age of 74 as a result of a blunt force head injury sustained in a fall.

His autopsy revealed that the musician suffered a skull fracture, a brain bleed and a stroke. He was placed on life support and underwent an unsuccessful medical procedure before his family decided to withdraw life-sustaining treatment.

His death was ultimately ruled an accident. 

After the family confirmed his death, his former KISS bandmates Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons told Page Six in a statement. “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley. 

“He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,” they said.

“He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with [his estranged wife] Jeanette, [daughter] Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.” 

Following the funeral, Simmons spoke to People about some of his “regrets,” which include being “smarter and better at trying to help Ace and Peter have better lives.”

He noted that the band members were “guilty” of not addressing issues to avoid any arguments, saying, “Let's just continue doing the tour because you want to get through it for selfish reasons because it's working, and the chicks, and the money, and you don't want to ruin anything.”

“Meantime, somebody who might be your brother is ruining their life by bad decisions.”

Frehley played with KISS from its inception in 1973 until he left the band in 1982. He later rejoined the group in 1996 until his final departure in 2002.

Sarah Sherman dressed up as the viral drunk raccoon who broke into a Virginia liquor store in a “Saturday Night Live” skit.

“Here to explain their actions is that drunk raccoon,” comedian Colin Jost said during the “Weekend Update” segment.

Immediately, Sherman slid onto the table in front of her co-star while acting intoxicated and carrying a bottle of booze.

“What happened last night? Did we hook up?” Sherman, 32, asked Jost, 43.

“No, we didn't hook up,” he responded, as Sherman then suggested they could get handsy on the table.

Jost quipped that the raccoon had a “serious drinking problem,” to which Sherman responded, “problem being I can't get drunk in a bathroom without people taking pictures of me face down, ass up!”

Sherman then joked about being hungry and wanting to eat her own poop.

“That's disgusting,” Jost replied. 

“Quiet piggy,” Sherman snapped back, referring to President Trump's remarks to a reporter last month.

Elsewhere in the skit, Sherman shared stereotypical thoughts about raccoons, saying, “We hear what you call us. Trash pandas. Dumpster dogs. The Sarah Shermans of the forest.”

“You're not nearly as hairy as Sarah Sherman,” Jost jokingly countered

Earlier this month, a worker at an Ashland-based liquor store in Virginia found a raccoon knocked out on the bathroom floor after going on a rampage throughout the shop, per AP News.

The raccoon had smashed several bottles, creating a pool of alcohol.

Local animal protection services shared that the raccoon wasn't injured.

The animal was later returned to the wild after a few hours of sleep.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","IT: Welcome To Derry burns down its last chance to be a smarter show","https://www.avclub.com/it-welcome-to-derry-recap-season-1-episode-7","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 04:03:00 GMT","

Can anything really matter in a prequel? It's a question I've wrestled with in TV pieces for The A.V. Club before. (I am, after all, the guy who wrote something like 15,000 words about the second season of Andor, one of the most interesting sci-fi TV shows ever made that also had to somehow work to set up a pretty good Star Wars movie featuring an above-average funny robot.) We already knew, going into the first season of IT: Welcome To Derry, that a sequence of pretty fundamental things were guaranteed to happen. The Black Spot was going to burn. Will Hanlon would get out of this all alive, so as to father future Loser Mike. And, most especially: Nothing in 1962 could majorly screw with the status quo of either Derry, Maine, or its favorite monster, because IT has to be in place to wake up and kill again for Andy Muschietti's cameras in 1989. 

“The Black Spot,” the penultimate installment of Welcome To Derry, plays around with some of these core assumptions. It flirts especially hard with the idea that, now that “the augury has passed”—i.e., that a whole bunch of Black airmen, their dates, and one almost messianically perfect little kid have all been murdered in cold blood in a big, head-explosion-heavy burst of violence—it's time for Pennywise to take a nap and chill until Sophia Lillis and Finn Wolfhard are free to pop up, in about three decades, to go another five rounds. The fact that the series tries to sell us on this obvious fiction, when we all damn well know that this is an eight-episode season of television, is the TV equivalent of getting two-thirds through a thriller novel and being told the killer is supposedly dead. This just isn't the kind of show that has the patience to handle a long, slow denouement following a penultimate, violent climax, so some other shoe obviously has to drop.

It is, in hindsight, pretty clear that the only place Welcome To Derry was going to be able to carve out some breathing room for itself, to try to tell a story more complicated than what has mostly been a straight-line roadmap from “here” to “there,” is in those elements that it brought to the party personally. And that is, indeed, where the show's attempts to be about something, despite its prequel status, ultimately take root at the end of this hour: in Operation Pennywise The Dancing Clown Bomb, now revealed to be a ruse by General Shaw, whose latest delusion of grandeur is that he can impose a late-season dose of political relevance onto a simple carb like Welcome To Derry.

Bless James Remar. He sure tries to bring conviction to Shaw's final sales pitch to Leroy Hanlon, as he has while being handed silly speech after silly speech throughout this entire season. See, General Shaw doesn't actually want to drop IT on the commies: He wants to inflict it on the American people, as a way to scare the national populace into giving up all our 1960s factionalization in favor of nice, safe, shit-the-bed-scared order. (I get the metaphor, and its clankingly obvious parallels to modern politics, but the plan itself is just laughable, given how IT seems to be limited by physical proximity. The idea of Pennywise hitching from town to town, slowly trying to pull IT's schtick on a nation of millions, is very funny to contemplate.) I've complained, a lot, this season about how Welcome To Derry seemed bizarrely disinterested in saying anything interesting about the nature of fear or the way it impacts a society, so I have to give the show credit for at least feinting toward a bigger idea as it heads into the homestretch. Talking about fear as a tool of political manipulation by the established order is at least an idea, even if the show doesn't have much to say about it besides having Leroy point out what a stupidly high bodycount Shaw's dumb plan already has. (“Fewer than die in car accidents every single year,” Remar yells, reaching the full limits of his ability to coat this stuff in gravitas.)

But that intent also runs straight into what I can now say, with some confidence as we near the end of our time here, is the show's single biggest storytelling flaw: its inability to make Derry feel like any kind of place at all. We have no sense of the unrest Shaw is hoping to quell with his supervillain master scheme, just as we had only the merest glimpses of the town's cruelty before it exploded into one singular incident of horrifying violence. Earlier in this episode, Charlotte Hanlon goes full thesis statement when she chides that “This town is the monster!” But Welcome To Derry has been so focused on the cheap scares of the actual creature in its midst that it's done almost nothing to bolster the metaphorical one. With its characters so isolated into sequestered scenes, and its supporting cast a loose assemblage of mean girls, bad husbands, and drunk-hick cops all pulled directly from central casting, the show has failed to make Derry feel like anywhere—let alone cultivate the vibe of fearful cruelty Shaw is trying to invoke here. There's a version of this idea that works, where we've spent seven episodes watching dread narcotize a town's population into fitful order, only to reveal that it's been the master plan all along. But it's simply not what this team has been able to put up on the screen.

Apologies are in order, though: I've put the reviewing of this whole episode back-to-front, as I often do when something big and structural and irritating is gnawing at me. Let's double back: We open on what is, inarguably, the best sequence of the night: an extended glimpse at the act and ambitions of Pennywise The Dancing Clown. The real one, that is: traveling circus performer Bob Gray, who is—once you get over Bill Skarsgård doing some kind of weird British Tom Waits impression for his voice—both a pretty good dad and a shockingly effective clown. (For a minute there, I thought Bob was going to take the act too dark for his audience of 1908 fair kids, but Skarsgård does a genuinely great job of getting their, and our, sympathy on his side. Seeing his real eyes, instead of the CGI glow, is surprisingly affecting.) This sequence doesn't move the needle in terms of either plot or character development—we already knew young Ingrid Gray loved her dad enough to gloss over watching “him” eat a child in front of her, so getting confirmation they were close isn't exactly a revelation. But there are worse things a prequel can do than give a little-glimpsed character like Bob a chance to shine.

After the credits, we're right back to where we left off last week, with Clint Bowers and his crew going from being, seemingly, the world's most reasonable mob to its most psychotic with a shocking quickness. At first, it really does seem like the masked killers invading The Black Spot just want Hank Grogan, who volunteers to get himself killed to spare everybody else. But as soon as the assembled airmen pull their own weapons to force Bowers et al. back out, the group switches to “lock the doors, burn the building, and kill every single man, woman, and child inside” without a second's hesitation. As far as escalations go, it's cartoonishly evil—something that isn't helped once Muschietti (stepping in to direct tonight) fills the ensuing shoot-out with twanging bullet noises and gorily popping craniums. With extremely polite flames that wouldn't dream of making more work for the show's makeup team, and faceless extras dropping like flies, it's far more weightless than a history-making incident of violence should be. The whole show has been building to this orgy of horror, and when it finally arrives, the performance anxiety is palpable.

The best bits, per usual, come from Chris Chalk, as Dick Hallorann taps into his Shine to find a way the fuck out of the burning death house without really worrying about anybody else following him out. Watching Dick seriously consider leaving the kids to die to save his own ass is the kind of thing that makes this character compelling. Chalk makes it palpable that this guy's every instinct leans toward self–preservation—except for the one that kicks in at the very last minute and drags him back into the fray. Escaping a confrontation with a barbecue-snacking Pennywise, Dick manages to get Will and Ronnie to safety, making them three of the very few survivors of the Black Spot fire. As for the other two kids…

Look, I don't want to make fun of the cinematic spectacle of a heroic child dying of smoke inhalation in a house full of burning corpses set alight by a bunch of psychopathic, subtextually racist adults. But if I'm being honest, there was very little about the death of Rich Santos tonight that did not strike me as ridiculous at best and laughable at worst—from his plan to Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull Margie to safety to his surprisingly composed (for a kid dying of smoke inhalation) farewell monologue to the dying declarations of love to the final sight of Rich's perfectly preserved, totally unburnt body once the flames died down. (Seriously: most polite fire ever.) I mostly liked Rich and thought Arian S. Cartaya acquitted himself relatively well as the season went on. But as far as big, motivating character deaths go, this felt way more “script says we have to bump off a kid to make the ending land” than genuinely moving.

Speaking of dead/Deadlighted characters, “The Black Spot” also brings to an end the incredibly frustrating, go-nowhere story of Ingrid Kersh. (And there's also Stan Kersh, but at least The Butcher gets a cool-looking death. That little flapping tongue!) Having successfully lured IT out by calling in the mob on Hank, Ingrid/Periwinkle is unflappable when the creature chops off half of her abusive husband's head right in front of her. But when he mentions that this is a one-hug-per-massacre deal, and that it's time for him to ditch her again for his big nap, that's when she apparently realizes that the brain-eating monster with like 90 teeth jammed into its maw isn't somehow her dead daddy returned to her and gets a big dose of the Deadlights for her trouble (presumably to be seen again as one of IT's guises in IT: Chapter Two, although maybe she'll surprise me and show up in the finale next week). I will confess to being utterly flummoxed by this character: Beyond a vague message that holding on to dead relatives will drive you crazy—and a little bit of extra “never trust a goddamn adult” for Lilly, who didn't really need it—I don't really understand what she was meant to be or do, beyond tying up a loose end from Muschietti's movie. This is getting to be a common refrain with this show, but there's an interesting story to be told about someone attaching themselves to IT's “abusive family member” routine in a way that even the creature itself finds kind of creepy. Here's hoping someone puts it into a TV show someday.

All of which brings us back to the military's response to the Black Spot fire, which is light on caring about a shit-ton of U.S. soldiers being murdered and heavy on using Hallorann's latest tip to finally find one of the Pillars. (Dick! I love you, but buddy, you gotta stop being so helpful.) Having dug up what I take no pleasure in reporting looks like a shiny magical turd rock, we then build back up to that big reveal: Shaw intends to melt the Pillars, releasing IT from its cage, and not even Leroy impotently pointing his pistol at a bunch of people multiple times in the span of a single scene is enough to stop it. This apparently excites a drowsy IT enough to give the creature one of those classic “three a.m. and I'm feeling pumped” second winds, which it immediately uses to go attack Will. Credits!

Not to get all “Fool me seven times, shame on you; fool me eight times, shame on me”—because that's not a real expression— but at this point I have basically no faith left that Welcome To Derry is saving up energy to surprise us all by suddenly getting really smart right before it ends. I think this show has turned out to be largely what detractors feared it would be when it was first announced: a chance to do a bunch of Pennywise scare scenes with kids dressed up in 1960s costumes and not much else. This episode, especially, is hurt because all of the real estate devoted to its big, flashy set piece means it has little time for the things the series is good at, i.e., grounded character work from its gifted adult cast. Instead, we're sprinting toward an ending that, as far as I can tell, has no choice but to put the show right back where we found it, leaving the whole series as not much more than an exercise in extremely IP-friendly, and ultimately hollow, horror.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The surreal Skate Story shreds skating game convention","https://www.avclub.com/skate-story-game-review","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

Skate Story recasts the score-focused, competitive nature of most skating games into a surreal, metaphysical adventure through Hell, sending players in search of a glassy skater's soul. Along the way they'll beat several moons into submission through kickflips and grinds, eating them all en route to an anticipated showdown with the devil, and also watch their skater explode into a million pieces whenever they seriously mess up a landing. Anybody disappointed that the Tony Hawk games stuck so close to reality and never fully explored the narrative possibilities afforded them by the video game medium should skate on in to Sam Eng's new game; it's the first skating game where the skater is a demon made, as Skate Story often reminds the player, of “glass and pain.”

Eng constructs a Hell that's part urban nightscape, part solar system, and conversant with Dante, with the skater descending through city-like levels that are each home to a different moon (or, in one case, two moons). Despite their infernal aesthetic, these levels are instantly familiar to the skating game veteran; they act as a kind of corrupted version of the standard downtown level of a Tony Hawk game, complete with various goals that need to be accomplished before pushing on (in this case, into boss battles against those moons). Move through these levels by tapping one button to build up speed and another to do an ollie, and then reel off more complicated tricks by tapping one (or more) shoulder buttons before ollieing. Grinding's as simple as ollieing onto rails or the edge of any raised surface, although it's far more difficult in practice than that sounds, and the skater can also do manuals, reverts, and nollies. Every trick is scored, scores get higher when tricks are chained together into combos, and damage equal to the combo's current score is inflicted upon enemies by hitting another button while performing a trick to slam the skater's board down hard on the ground. It's a different system than the Skate or Tony Hawk series, but anybody who's ever grinded out hours in a skateboarding game should understand it immediately.

With the basic thrust of skating thus accounted for, Skate Story can direct the rest of its efforts towards its story, which makes the typical skating game look lazy, uninspired, and insufferably literal. 

The story in most skating games is pretty simple: the player is skating. That's it. Do tricks, earn points, win medals: keep moving forward. Constant forward motion is what skating's about, after all. Even when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater would task players with the kind of business only possible in a video game—nobody's grabbing giant glowing letters in the real world—it was still firmly set within the safe, comfortable expectations of competitive skating. Individual missions could veer into the absurd or fantastical, but those were momentary asides. 

If it's not clear yet, Skate Story is all fantasy. Very little of its absurd, dreamlike, frequently psychedelic journey is set in anything recognizable as the “real” world. It's still about moving forward (or, perhaps, downward); as the game says after the player first learns to ollie, “the skater's soul turned into pure momentum,” because, again, that is the true nature of skating. But by almost completely divorcing it from reality Eng obscures how similar Skate Story is, mechanically and structurally, to most skating games. By telling a story primarily interested in matters of the soul, even in a way that's rarely all that serious, Skate Story is at least nominally weightier than a Tony Hawk game. And its gang of demons, surly skeletons, and deceptive moons (who, understandably, don't want to be eaten), along with the skater's ghost rabbit companion, are a memorable bunch.

It ultimately feels a bit hollow, though—driven at least as much by “wouldn't it be cool if…” brainstorming than by the desire to make any kind of statement. Which is fine—skating games don't need to say something. It's all about the aesthetic, and that aesthetic is rad. Seriously: try to find a better vibe than blasting through quick burst cosmic corridors while chasing a ghostly moon to the restlessly distinctive music of Blood Cultures (who does much of the score, along with John Fio, and it sounds like listening to a shift by a college radio DJ with particularly wide-ranging and exquisite taste). Skate Story is a game about a glass demon eating moons in hell because the idea of a glass demon eating moons in hell is cool and sick and weird. Eng and Skate Story perfectly understand that skateboarding exists and will always be popular because it, too, is cool and sick. And although the sheer number of “cool” ideas stacked on top of each other threatens to collapse Skate Story in on itself, Eng is able to keep it all together—to keep it all moving forward, deeper into Hell, towards a date with the devil, always in tune with the true story of skating.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Bryan Fuller on his film debut Dust Bunny : ""We've lost our appetite for bite""","https://www.avclub.com/bryan-fuller-interview-dust-bunny","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

After nearly three decades making television shows whose fantastical charm and lush design won him a devoted following, Bryan Fuller has written and directed his first feature film. Dust Bunny is immediately recognizable as a story springing from the mind behind Hannibal and Pushing Daisies—Mads Mikkelsen stars as a professional killer living down the hall from a precocious little girl with a big problem she needs taken care of. It's a fable with a Fullerverse spin, quirky, silly, morbid, and endearing. Their world of monsters real, imagined, and in-between is both ornate and mysterious; a bit like John Wick for the Roald Dahl crowd.

Yes, Dust Bunny, despite its R rating, is a film for the brave kids; referencing gory PG-13 studio releases like M3GAN, Fuller told The A.V. Club that the MPA applies a stricter hand to independent films. But that doesn't mean that enterprising young cinephiles shouldn't stay up late sneaking this one in once it hits streaming. In our chat with the filmmaker, Fuller discusses his intended audience, the film's origins as a TV project, and all the problems one needs to solve as an indie filmmaker.

The A.V. Club: Dust Bunny began as an Amazing Stories idea. What didn't work at Apple TV+?

Bryan Fuller: One of the things about Amazing Stories is that it was Apple's first television. There was a sensitivity, a feeling of “we've gotta get this right.” And also at that time, so much of Apple's brand was for families. These are going to be stories that are going to be playing in Apple stores, so there was a fear of anything that might have too much of a bite to it. 

A bite was always inherent to the Amblin brand though, looking at movies like Poltergeist, or E.T., or Gremlins, or Goonies, or Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom. All of these were gateway horror stories. There was a preciousness about how to bring that into the Apple brand that has certainly become more lax over the years now that Apple has found its identity as a platform. We were the first child. Parents aren't always their best selves with the first child.

I'm surprised someone thought that Dust Bunny had too much bite.

BF: There's something very Looney Tunes about the violence in Dust Bunny and there's not a lot of blood. Any blood you see, you'd have to really squint. There's no nudity, there's no foul language. It's about a 10-year-old girl who hires a hitman to kill the monster under her bed, and the story is from her point of view for most of the narrative. 

We've gotten into a situation with parenting and how we treat children in our modern context that has forgotten that the parents of these kids are often products of '80s storytelling that didn't coddle or prevent children from having a little friction in their lives—having a little opportunity to be scared, which could be armor-building for real-life terrors. Those of us who built up that armor through our moviegoing experience have an easier time navigating adult thematics. If we remove those resistors and all of the things that provide friction, you're holding off the inevitable. Then you have adults who are easily traumatized.

Now you have a generation where a vocal percentage are scandalized by everything they see in TV and movies.

BF: We've lost our appetite for bite.

You want media that trusts young people, and Dust Bunny does that really well with, like you said, a very subjective story centered around a little girl played by Sophie Sloan. Where did you find her?

BF: Scotland! We had a wonderful casting director named Margery Simkin, and she cast a very wide net with this film. We had something like 9,000 submissions for this role. Of those 9,000 submissions, we had 900 to 1000 auditions, and that was narrowed down to 20, which was narrowed down to 12, which was narrowed down to three. 

And Sophie has a very thick Scottish brogue. Mads Mikkelsen also has a very thick accent. Our fear was that if we cast both of them, nobody would be able to understand anything anyone was saying. I had shared auditions with Mads very early on and he was immediately smitten with Sophie. He said, “Don't mess with her accent, it's so charming and she's so authentic.” His worry was that if you give her the additional challenge of doing an accent on top of a performance, we'd lose some of that authenticity. He just wanted to move the film to Scotland. But Sophie, on her own accord, watched TikTok videos for two weeks and taught herself a perfect flat American accent, and handily won the role.

I want to see all those instructional TikToks and the version of this movie where it's two people totally unable to understand each other.

BF: We get a taste of that with [Mads'] “Aurora” pronunciation.

Did you have that gag written before he got involved?

BF: No, when Mads first read the script, he was like, “I love the script, but you'll have to change her name. I can't pronounce it.” And I was like, “No, no, we'll make it a bit!” But then, as we were making the movie, he was pronouncing it fine. We had to loop mispronunciations to sell the joke!

Mads is so funny in this movie. Even if people are sort of familiar with his work, if they're not watching stuff like Riders Of Justice, they might not realize that he's hilarious.

BF: Not only Riders Of Justice, but so many of his collaborations with Anders Thomas Jensen, whether it's The Green Butchers or Men & Chicken, there are these fantastic movies for Mads—who is usually, in films for American audiences, the heavy; Le Chiffre in Casino Royale, villains in Indiana Jones [And The Dial Of Destiny] and the Marvel universe. But some of his best work is playing the fool in these fantastic Jensen movies. Men & Chicken has one of my favorite performances of his, so much so that that's why there are so many chicken references with his character in Dust Bunny.

I was wondering about the chicken lamp. It could've easily just been a part of the overall aesthetic.

BF: It started with one of the first meetings with Sigourney Weaver. She was talking about the scene where Mads and Sophie are wrapping up a dead body, and she was like, “I don't know about this scene, it's so dark. Maybe you should do something cute with the suitcases, like make them into pandas or something that takes the edge off a bit.” And I said, “That's a great idea.” When we got to designing the props, I said, “We need panda-shaped suitcases.” 

That created an animal farm aspect to the show, where we have the hippopotamus ottoman and the panda suitcases and the chicken-butt lamp. These things that harken to French Maximalism and the movies of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, whether that's Delicatessen or The City Of Lost Children or one of my favorites, Amélie. It was all about yes-anding my production designer.

I love the aesthetic ideas in here, but it's not just the vibrant costumes and decor. You also get a hint of '70s-like maximalism in the needledrops of ABBA and Sister Janet Meade. What were you saturating yourself with before making this movie?

BF: Had you heard that song before? I remember that as a kid. I was raised Catholic, and one of the coolest things about being raised Catholic was Sister Janet Meade and “The Lord's Prayer” à la rock ‘n' roll.

For the aesthetic, we talked a lot about the Jean-Pierre Jeunet/Marc Caro collaborations, and even something like John Boorman's Point Blank. That film had such aggressive stylization to it and was a Crayola-box film noir that had such wonderful use of color that never really interfered with what Lee Marvin was doing, but gave us a heightened sense of a world that was allowed to have a click in its heel. It had the feeling of a romp that allowed you to not take everything so seriously, and have fun first.

The Lee Marvin pull makes me realize how close he and Mads' performance styles can be. Two actors who can be hulking and physical but so quiet that they can get under your skin. Speaking of, I read about how you and Mads collaborated on fight choreography for the scene with the guy dressed in the wallpaper outfit. Typically, people fixing production problems on the day aren't the stars, but the department heads. I know Sigourney Weaver pitched in in similar ways. Were they your safety nets on this film?

BF: Mads and Sigourney were both so producorial with this film and cared so much, and performed above and beyond their tasks as actors. It was incredible to be a first-time director and to have that level of championing from such experienced actors who'd worked with a wide variety of directors.

The hallway fight scene, Mads and I choreographed in an afternoon. There was a bit of a language barrier at times with certain departments in Hungary. Sometimes when you wanted less of something you got more of it, because there was just a disconnect. So we were looking at how do we do this action sequence, how do we do it efficiently, how do we do it in the amount of time we have? Mads came over one Sunday afternoon, and we sat there with Bruce Lee action figures and a model of the hallway set and walked through it. Mads is very humble about so many things, but he had more stunt experience than anyone on that set, with everything that he's done in his career—including cock-and-ball-torturing Daniel Craig in Casino Royale. Anyway we just had a blast, just little boys playing with action figures. We filmed it and showed it to the stunt team and said, “This is what we're doing.” It was magical.

And it still feels of a piece with the other action, like the grand shootout where they're sliding back and forth in the hallway. It's got such fun, cartoonish blocking and choreography that you just don't see in modern action.

BF: The hardest thing about some of these moments is where you're putting the camera, what are your setups, and how many you get. Blocking and choreography are lifesavers, because it takes less time than re-lighting and tearing things down and building them up and putting more track down. Hallways limit the directions that you can shoot in, and the camera angles you're afforded, so it's up to the choreography. I knew it had to be light on its feet and have a little whimsy. I remember telling the stunt guys we needed sliders on ropes, and that they'd be kicking themselves out and pulling themselves back in. And everybody just stepped up! 

That was a wonderful thing about the movie: So much of the crew stepped up. We had a wonderful gaffer and grip department. We only had a technocrane a couple of days—and most of my shots needed a crane—so every morning [our key grip] would come up to me when he arrived and he'd ask, “How long do you need the crane today?” And I'd say, “60 feet?” Which he'd convert into meters, of course, and then built it by strapping scaffolding together with belts. Then I'd have a 60-foot crane that day that the budget otherwise wouldn't allow but the ingenuity of the crew would. Things like that consistently elevated the experience.

Taking it back to Amblin films, Dust Bunny is absolutely a film that kids should go see with their cool parents, so I imagine the R-rating was a blow.

BF: We all set out to make a children's movie, one with an object lesson about listening to children and believing their experience even if the facts may seem outrageous or unreal. You still have to listen, to build a bridge of belief to that child that allows them to feel seen and heard and validated in their experience instead of minimized and rejected. So it was a surprise to all of us that we got an R-rating.

A lot of folks were like, “This is fine, we'll be fine” because it makes it cooler for a lot of the audience members. But I want kids to see this. I want kids to have the experience of going to this movie and seeing something I would've seen as a kid in the '80s that blew my mind with the danger that it represented—something outside the norm of children's fare that we see so much of now, that is a little toothless and defanged. 

Sigourney was really annoyed by it, and Mads was really annoyed by it. But sitting next to them during different screenings, both of them turned to me at points in the film and whispered, “This is why we got the R-rating.” So, parental discretion is advised, but I want kids to see this movie. I want kids to have the experience of being their own champions and being their own heroes. That's what we get to see [in Dust Bunny]. If only the adults would listen.

If only the adults, and the MPA, would listen.

BF: Yeah!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Christian Slater Opens Up About His Family in Rare Comments","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/christian-slater-family-comments/","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 16:46:15 GMT","

Christian Slater, known for his role in “Mr Robot,” focused on family during a recent red-carpet appearance, reminding fans that even Hollywood veterans value life beyond the spotlight.

The actor, 56, attended the 35th Gotham Film Awards on Dec. 1, 2025, wearing a navy patterned suit and black turtleneck. While photographers snapped photos, Slater spoke to reporters about how he handles Hollywood's ups and downs. He said he relies on friends and family. “I definitely love focusing on my family,” Slater told Page Six.

Slater shares two adult children, Jaden, 26, and Eliana, 24, with his former wife, journalist Ryan Haddon. He also has two young children with his current wife, talent agent Brittany Lopez: daughter Lena, born in 2019, and a son born in 2024.

He told Page Six that his perspective on career and life has changed over time. “When I'm at the end of this journey, I'll be like, ‘I'm so glad I spent all this time with my kids,'” he said. Slater added that parenting now takes priority over professional pressures.

The actor first gained fame in the late 1980s with the cult classic “Heathers.” Since then, he has played a variety of roles, from romantic leads to complex antiheroes. He recently appeared in the drama “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You,” where he reunited with other high-profile actors.

Slater has previously described his younger self as “a frighteningly different person” in an interview with Bang Premier. He said he barely recognizes who he was during his early career. Today, he appreciates stability and time with his family, which contrasts with his previous desire for freedom and adventure.

He also told WWBL that life in the spotlight can feel strange and unpredictable. Despite the challenges of fame, Slater appears to have found balance. Family provides him with the grounding and purpose that no award or role can replace.

In Hollywood, where success often equals attention and acclaim, Slater's comments underscore a simple truth. Real achievement comes from personal connections. He told Page Six that memories with his children outweigh any recognition from the industry.

Even as Slater continues to take on new acting projects, he emphasizes that he is first a father. His reflections highlight a side of the actor rarely seen by the public: a man committed to family, growth, and the quiet moments that define life away from cameras.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Maureen McCormick Makes Rare Appearance With ‘Brady Bunch' Co-Star for Charity Event—See the Sweet Photos","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/maureen-mccormick-brady-bunch-rare-reunion/","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 11:59:56 GMT","

Maureen McCormick reunited with one of her “Brady Bunch” brothers for a special reason. On Dec. 7, The beloved actress and “Dancing with the Stars” Season 23 alum attended the 2025 Best Buddies Celebrity Bowling Event, where she was supported by her “Brady Bunch” co-star Christopher Knight.

McCormick and Knight played siblings Marcia and Peter Brady on the classic sitcom, which aired from 1969 to 1974 on ABC. They've reunited with fellow castmates Barry Williams (Greg), Eve Plumb (Jan), Mike Lookinland (Bobby) and Susan Olsen (Cindy) in the past, but this mini reunion was for a cause close to McCormick's heart.

McCormick has a brother named Denny who was born with intellectual disabilities. In support of her brother, the actress is heavily involved with the Social Olympics and the non-profit Best Buddies. The latter organization is “dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, inclusive living, and family support for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities,” per the Best Buddies website.

On Dec. 7, McCormick, 69, shared a series of Instagram photos from the 2025 Best Buddies Celebrity Bowling Event at Pinz Bowling Center in Studio City, California. In the photos. McCormick posed with Knight, supermodel Cindy Crawford, and several of their best buddies.

“What a sweet day today!” the “Brady Bunch” star captioned the post. “I am so thankful for all the best buddies in my life! Thank you Chris and Cara @therealchristopherknight for coming and spreading your joy and hanging out at the @bestbuddies annual Christmas bowling party! And thank you @markjwylie for making it happen❤️ Love you all❤️ #friendship #friends And Happy Birthday @madisontevlin 🎂❌⭕️.”

In 2019, McCormick reunited with all of her “Brady Bunch” siblings for a renovation of the original “Brady Bunch” house. The cast members worked with HGTV stars, including Jonathan and Drew Scott (“Property Brothers”), to renovate the inside of the original house used for the exterior shots on “The Brady Bunch” to make it match the house that appeared on television.

In September 2025, McCormick returned to the famous house with a special group of friends. “I was back for a charity event,” McCormick told People magazine earlier this year. “I love Best Buddies [and] Special Olympics, and they're kind of connected. So I took a group of Best Buddies there, and they toured the house, and they loved it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Cynthia Erivo Shares the Emotional Message Behind ‘Wicked: For Good' Final Scenes","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/cynthia-erivo-wicked-for-good-ending/","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:45:01 GMT","

Cynthia Erivo is looking back on her time as Elphaba in “Wicked: For Good” with gratitude, insight, and emotion. The Oscar-nominated actress recently opened up about the final scene in the highly anticipated sequel and how portraying the iconic character left a lasting impact on her.

Spoiler Alert: This article contains spoilers for “Wicked: For Good.”

Speaking at the Elphaba's Wicked Retreat Airbnb Originals Experience on Dec. 3, Erivo, 38, shared her thoughts on the touching final moments of the film, which serve as the conclusion to the two-part adaptation of the Broadway musical “Wicked.”

In the emotional ending, Elphaba fakes her own death by vanishing through a trap door. She later reappears, walking into the sunset with her love interest, Fiyero (played by Jonathan Bailey), who had been transformed into a straw figure as part of a protective spell. Before leaving Oz, Elphaba entrusts her magical book, the Grimmerie, to Glinda (Ariana Grande), who steps fully into her role as a leader. The two friends reconcile with a final reprise of “For Good.”

Elphaba's poignant farewell is underscored by the lyric, “Just look at me / Not with your eyes, with theirs.”

Reflecting on the line, Erivo explained why the moment resonated so deeply with her. “Two things are happening in that line. It's both trying to help Glinda see what's actually happening, but it's also a comfort,” she said.

“I think she sees that her friend sees her one way,” she continued. “And I love between the lines when you can say something in a phrase, but so much more is going on.”

Erivo elaborated on the depth behind Elphaba's request. “Look at me, look at me. Not with your eyes. Because she knows that Glinda will see something very different to what other people see,” she said. “And she has to remind her that what you see is not what everyone else sees. And you have to be okay with that as well because that's the only way we can move forward.”

In addition to discussing the finale, Erivo shared a personal takeaway from her time as Elphaba during an interview with USA Today.“That things aren't always as they seem, that what you see isn't always what you get, and that you can expect people to grow and change for better or for worse. And both are okay,” she said.

She described the experience of filming back-to-back movies as “a long ride” and said she has been deeply moved by the audience response.“I've been really overwhelmed by just how supportive people have been and the dialogues that have been started because of it and conversations that have come up and how passionate everyone's been and the difference in all of that,” she added.

Remember, the Golden Globes are not predictive. They are a journalist-leaning group; if anything. the recently announced Critics Choice Awards get it right more often than not. But the expanded 399 Globes voters across the globe, who attend film festivals like Cannes and Venice, are more truly international than the former coterie in Los Angeles once called The Hollywood Foreign Press Association. About 50 of those HFPA cohorts remain, forming an easy-to-lobby L.A. bloc.

The Globes nominations provide a PR push for the nominees, but a huge boost for the winners who command the TV spotlight on the Golden Globes telecast, which airs Sunday, January 11, 2026 on the CBS Television Network.

Again, it's about getting the Oscar voters to watch these titles, such as Sundance flick “If I Had Legs I Could Kick You,” which landed Rose Byrne a nomination in the Comedy category. (Category fraud!) Given that she took home wins from the New York Film Critics and the National Board of Review, she's in the running for Oscar.

 










The snubs are significant, because there are so many categories that not making into one of them is a striking omission. For example, while awards pundits already knew that Sydney Sweeney wasn't happening for box office flop “Christy,” and Kathryn Bigelow's respectably reviewed “A House of Dynamite” was not an awards play for Netflix, “Wicked: for Good,” a Globes favorite last year, not landing a Musical/Comedy slot is a glaring sign of weakness. 

The sequel had to settle for acting nods for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the Box Office performance category, and two Song nominations. It should still factor at SAG's renamed The Actor Awards, but do not look for Best Picture Oscar love. It's already softening at the box office.

While George Clooney landed a Comedy slot for Netflix's “Jay Kelly,” the movie surprisingly did not wind up on the Best Musical/Comedy list. Not good. 

For the rest of the lucky nominees, it's a matter of paring down the massive number of names to the ones who can realistically make it to Oscar nominations morning on January 22, 2026. 

Among the six Motion Picture Dramas, all six could make the top ten at the Oscars. “The Secret Agent” is less surefire, but it is building momentum with its recent release and scored $30,000 at the AMC in Century City its opening weekend. Three international Best Picture nominations would set a new record. 

 










Neon lead the Globes field with 21 nominations and could score all five Best International Feature Film Oscar slots with its Cannes prize-winners: “Sentimental Value,” which earned eight Globe nominations, “It was Just an Accident,” “The Secret Agent,” and “Sirāt.” The fifth could be Venice entry “No Other Choice.” 

All five nabbed Non-English-Language Globes nominations: the sixth slot went to Tunisian Oscar entry “The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa), which could grab one of the Neon Oscar slots. The surprise is how many nominations these films picked up in other categories — even “Sirāt.”

Among the studios, of course current Oscar frontrunner Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another” lead the field with nine nominations, following a week of wins at the Gothams, NYFCC, and LAFCA. “One Battle After Another” competed in Comedy to allow WB entry “Sinners” to contend in Drama. Also in Comedy are likely Oscar BP contenders “Bugonia” and “Marty Supreme.”

That would leave out “Blue Moon,” which could land a Best Actor Oscar slot for popular veteran Ethan Hawke; Korean Oscar submission “No Other Choice,” which could wind up an international nomination; and Cannes hit “Nouvelle Vague.” Congrats to auteur Richard Linklater for scoring two Globes nominations in one day. 

 










As for the six Animated nominees, the likely five Oscar nominees are all listed but one won't make it. That's probably “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” (Aniplex, Crunchyroll, Sony Pictures Entertainment).

James Cameron's Oscar hopes for “Avatar: Fire and Ash” are narrowing fast: the CCAs only gave the third “Avatar” installment a VFX nomination, and the Globes stuck it in the Cinematic and Box Office Achievement category along with “F1” and “Wicked: for Good,” and gave it a Song nomination for Miley Cyrus. 

At first glance, the Female Actor in a Motion Picture Drama category is a strange list: only Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) and Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”) are likely to make it to the Oscars. Their likely competitors are in Comedy this year: Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I'd Kick You”), Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”), and Emma Stone (“Bugonia”).

Among the Drama actors, Joel Edgerton (“Train Dreams”), Michael B. Jordan (“Sinners”), and Wagner Moura (“The Secret Agent”) should land Oscar nominations, along with Comedy contenders Timothée Chalamet (“Marty Supreme”), Leonardo DiCaprio (“One Battle After Another”), andEthan Hawke (“Blue Moon”). 

That's six, so one won't make it. Given that Comedy Globe nominee George Clooney (“Jay Kelly”) did not land a CCA nomination, it's unlikely that he will prevail at the Oscars. On the Supporting Actress side, both Elle Fanning (“Sentimental Value”) and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas (“Sentimental Value”) landed slots, along with Amy Madigan (“Weapons”), Teyana Taylor (“One Battle After Another”), and Ariana Grande (“Wicked: For Good”). These five could land Oscar nominations, but the sixth nominee, Emily Blunt (“The Smashing Machine”) might not make it.

 










Among the Male Supporting Actors, Benicio Del Toro (“One Battle After Another”), Adam Sandler (“Jay Kelly”), and Stellan Skarsgård (“Sentimental Value”) are solid Oscar contenders, while Jacob Elordi (“Frankenstein”), Paul Mescal (“Hamnet”), and Sean Penn (“One Battle After Another”) will be duking it out for the remaining two slots. The Best Director Oscar five should include Globe nominees Paul Thomas Anderson (“One Battle After Another”), Ryan Coogler (“Sinners”), Joachim Trier (“Sentimental Value”), and Chloé Zhao (“Hamnet”) with Guillermo del Toro (“Frankenstein”) and Jafar Panahi (“It Was Just an Accident”) duking it out for the fifth slot. Del Toro is beloved. A wider mass of voters adore “Frankenstein” than “It Was Just an Accident,” but Iranian filmmaker Panahi has a narrative — he has been sentenced to prison again, in absentia — that cannot be denied.Given that the Globes squeeze Adapted and Original Screenplays into one category, all six should land nominations: Paul Thomas Anderson (“One Battle After Another”), Ronald Bronstein & Josh Safdie (“Marty Supreme”), Ryan Coogler (“Sinners”), Jafar Panahi (“It Was Just an Accident”), Eskil Vogt & Joachim Trier (“Sentimental Value”), and Chloé Zhao & Maggie O'Farrell (“Hamnet”).

Among the Score contenders, the surprising nomination is Kangding Ray (“Sirāt”), which shows how sophisticated this voting group is. This will push more Oscar voters to see the film — and think about the Score. The rest of the more predictable contenders will be competing for five slots: Alexandre Desplat (“Frankenstein”), Ludwig Göransson (“Sinners”), Jonny Greenwood (“One Battle After Another”), Max Richter (“Hamnet”), and Hans Zimmer (“F1”).

Best Original Song Oscar contenders will include Globe nominees “Dream as One” – “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” “Golden” – “KPOP Demon Hunters,” “I Lied to You” – “Sinners,” “No Place Like Home” – “Wicked: For Good,” “The Girl in the Bubble” – “Wicked: For Good,” and “Train Dreams” – “Train Dreams.” One will miss out. 

 










There will always be surprises on the road to Oscar. We will know more as the Guilds — from SAG and DGA to WGA and PGA — start to weigh in.

After years of documenting the viewing habits of cinephiles everywhere, Letterboxd is entering the exhibition world. On December 10, the site will launch Video Store, a new VOD platform that allows users to rent a curated selection of movies curated by the Letterboxd team.

With Video Store debuting on Wednesday, Letterboxd has answered some of our questions about the previously announced platform. Video Store will use a transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) model, in which users pay to watch individual movies without any subscription fee. The product will launch in 23 countries, and the app will be available on iOS, Android, web browsers, and a variety of smart TVs.

In what will go down as the “hold my beer” moment of the entertainment industry's very bad 2025, this morning Paramount made a hostile takeover bid for WBD directly to shareholders. Paramount is offering around $108.4 billion for the full company, or $30 a share, in an all-cash offer. The Netflix deal is $72 billion for only the WBD studios; shareholders get $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock per share, valuing it at $27.75. Both deals include absorbing the WBD debt.  

 










A hostile takeover happens when a target company (WBD) rejects the offer of a buyer (Paramount) and the would-be buyer goes directly to shareholders with its offer (or, buys up shares on the open market to gain control). Total “Wall Street” flashbacks here, but here's a breakdown of what all this means. 

Related Stories Kristen Stewart Called Out Hollywood. Minutes Later, Netflix Announced a Deal to Buy It. Trump Reportedly Lobbies Paramount to Distribute ‘Rush Hour 4': A Glimpse of the Studio's Ellison-Led Future? 

Paramount going hostile doesn't simply “compete” with the Netflix-WBD deal. It breaks the timeline and throws the whole process into limbo. The practical fallout:

 










With Netflix and Paramount in hand-to-hand combat over WBD, it suggests that they all see acquisition as essential to survival and that they anticipate hard(er) times coming.  

We've seen this movie before: Disney bought Marvel in 2009, AOL (cringe) bought Time Warner in 2000. In this respect, it doesn't matter who wins WBD; either way it's a tornado siren to the rest of the industry.  

Everyone knows they need to send their own preparations into overdrive, which is a massive distraction from the actual work of making film and TV. We should expect all studios to become even more cautious on discretionary spending, greenlights, hiring, and long-term commitments. Also vulnerable: creative risk-taking. 

We don't need a WBD winner to be declared to know this: The legacy studio system, as we knew it, is no more and there's a lot more to come. I'll have a rundown on what this means for indie film – and indie filmmakers – in my In Development newsletter later today. (You can subscribe here.)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Dijon Had a Miraculous Year. He's Not Finished Yet.","https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/dijon-artist-of-the-year/","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

It was in the middle of March 2020—the day stay-at-home orders were issued in California—Dijon was drifting through Perfect Circuit, the music-equipment store in Burbank. He hadn't yet made his debut album, Absolutely, but he did have his first label-advance check, “like, five dollars,” he remembers, burning a very small hole in his slacks. While he was fiddling with a mixer and waiting for a lone employee to find his order in the back, the shop's only other customer, Jay Electronica, approached him. “You seem like you know what you're doing with that thing,” Dijon recalls him saying. “Is that worth getting?”

“I've never seen anybody drop dough like that,” says Dijon, who, even among 33-year-old rap obsessives, is an all-world Jay Electronica scholar. “It was like a Louis-store vibe: ‘I'll just take one of those, one of those, one of those, one of those, one of those.” The legendarily elusive New Orleans rapper explained that, since he was going to be stuck in LA for the foreseeable future, he was trying to re-create his Eurorack setup from back home in his hotel room here. “There's a warmth to that dude in a real way,” Dijon says. “Gold fronts, the most beautiful and inviting smile I'd ever seen in my life.” Perhaps appreciative of the advice on hardware, Jay gave Dijon his number, which Dijon promptly lost.

Dijon Duenas is the rarest sort of popular artist: one committed to pushing formal boundaries in a way that makes him and his audience sincerely uncomfortable but who seems to get more famous the less he compromises. His second album, Baby—a meditation on heredity, shredded and reconstituted in a $10 DJ program—was released to rapturous acclaim in August. The record happened to come out squarely between a pair of LPs from megastar Justin Bieber that are composed largely of sessions with Dijon and four months after he appeared on Bon Iver's SABLE, fABLE.

Actually, I was on the phone with Justin Vernon as I drove past a giant billboard for One Battle After Another, Dijon's first film appearance; a pair of smaller billboards for his upcoming shows at the Greek Theatre floated by later. “I was like, ‘Look, dude, I know I just met you,' ” Vernon recalled of his first time in the studio with Dijon, who had just listened to some works in progress. “ ‘But can you please play that whole thing for me again?' ”

As little as 12 months ago, all of this seemed impossible—not just the leaps in public stature but the existence of a second album at all. Baby followed a protracted period of writer's block and was unmistakably shaped by it. Dijon made a whole other album, which sat languishing on a hard drive, where it still lives today. And even after his creative process transformed, and a personal crisis begot a tantalizing concept, he found himself more discouraged than ever about the way his art might be metabolized by robots and suits and narcotized listeners.

“I'm a little bit embarrassed that some of my iconography is deconstruction,” he says, sitting on a curb in Burbank, gesturing vaguely toward an unseen freeway on-ramp we'll be taking. “It sucks that that's where I'm at: My influence is the rawness of a thing. I wish I had a more definitive—” At this point he imitates one of the 4-counts that became a signature of Neptunes beats: dunnnnnnn--dunnnnnnn-dunnnnnnn-dunnnnnnn. “I wish I had more of a thing. But I guess my thing is mistakes.”

Five years after that trip to Perfect Circuit—and still no Jay Electronica music made with the particular synthesizers Dijon saw him purchase—we're tucked into a booth at a dimly lit but perfectly tidy bar in Eagle Rock, northeast of downtown LA, and Dijon is telling me things I probably could have inferred. “My manager says I try to make everything extremely difficult,” he says. He's exhausted by the state of contemporary popular music and angry at the economy that leeches off of it; he's dreading the tour insofar as it will take him away from his almost two-year-old son and pregnant wife, the stylist Joanie Del Santo. He yada-yadas the milestones. “Life happened, we toured a little bit, I had a baby,” he says. “I woke up one day and was like, ‘I should probably do an album now.' That was maybe six months, seven months ago?”

Wait. What? This is early October, which places the beginning of the sessions that would yield Baby well into 2025. That's the point at which, in a “fit of frustration,” Dijon sent to the Grammy-nominated producer Andrew Sarlo the title track, a contorted and manipulated pass at an idea that had been gestating for much longer. Sarlo wrote back: This is the album. The mutes, the dropouts, the sense that an idea had sprung from the artist's chest, been scrambled into code, then reassembled in a fugue. The nagging feeling that someone is behind the scenes pulling the levers—but only because they can't help themselves.

Over the next six weeks, working almost entirely from shards of songs that Dijon had started but never quite finished over the past several years (“Yamaha” would be the only newly written track), he, Sarlo, and his other close collaborators holed up in his Glendale garage and finished the LP, mixing it well into the week of its release. Some of the time crunch was industrial—“they sort of suggested there was a tour,” Dijon says, “they” presumably being his booking agent but just as plausibly referring to some unseen hand of the market—and some more metaphysical. “My body is like, This is the music,” he remembers thinking, at the point when no new sounds were coming. “It's almost as complete as it could possibly be.”

Baby's 12 songs run comfortably under 40 minutes. Played in the background, at a distance—as Dijon laments it might be—the record could pass for gentle. Heard from one room over, “Higher!” or “Automatic” would seem uncomplicatedly delightful. But Baby is a thorny and at times harrowing reflection on what it means to be one link in a chain of frustration, compromise, and neurosis. The artist's father and grandfather hang over it like a fog; that title track, which opens the album, seems less like an introduction than an endpoint, the making good from a misspent youth. But where are you supposed to go from there?

Dijon hoped Baby would be radical and doubts whether it is in all the ways he set out for it to be. “I wanted my music to be positively embarrassing to play in public,” he says. “There's a passivity that's built into music right now. I was like, ‘I refuse for my music to be viable as a background thing.' I want it to be embarrassing. I wanted, initially, for the volumes to fluctuate pretty intensely, so that you would have to constantly turn it up or turn it down.”

That last idea was scuttled only because he ended up running the entire album through that DJ app, which processed the music so much that it couldn't be conventionally mastered since it was already so compressed. This is a case of the macro imitating the micro. “So many of these songs are scraps,” Dijon explains, that retrieval from the ether became the project itself. He didn't privilege his new ideas over ones that he'd previously abandoned; this suggests some amount of resignation but ends up being wildly freeing. He could finally write about his Chamorro grandfather's experience during World War II, then mute, process, and trigger it just like it was RZA's voice.

So while the jagged shifts in volume were abandoned, Baby still pursues a disorienting effect on the listener. The blurring of the borders between one song and another, between Dijon's new vocals, old takes he found buried in his computer, and samples only enhances that effect, allowing him to (at times) depersonalize things in service of isolating an emotion, or (at others) to hop and skip over decades of masculine repression. “I don't even know what a song is anymore,” he says now. “I was so obsessed with this idea of trying to make a new kind of thing, new kind of record.”

Baby is original, despite being pretty ambivalent about the definition of “new.” At one point during our time together, Dijon offhandedly says, of his creative philosophy, that “everything is data.” It seems a funny word choice, given how averse he is to making things measurable. But he's exactly right. Dijon's work is based on the notion that once he's articulated an idea, be it in his Notes app or an orphaned Pro Tools session, it can be treated the same as a snare sound he finds particularly crisp. So the failures become stutter-steps toward something else.

But it was terribly difficult for him to arrive at that premise. “I was having a really hard time with the rec-ord,” Dijon says. “Like, psychosis-level shit.” A friend even staged a mini-intervention to get him to stop reading Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. (“You shouldn't do that, it's so paranoid,” he remembers this friend saying. “And he wasn't wrong.”) He describes driving home from studio sessions sobbing, listening to Anita Baker's “Caught Up in the Rapture,” full of sorrow that he was so far from those heights. Music is so fucked, he thought to himself, and my music is so bad.

“I was having mania,” Dijon says. “I was having all sorts of ups and downs and a true disbelief that I was supposed to continue to be making music. That maybe I'd contributed all I could contribute with the last record and the video and, like, there was a part of me that, having a kid, panic was setting in that I'd chosen a really volatile profession and brought a child into this world and I've only made one album and What have I done?”

At some point, he, his close friend Mk.gee, Andrew Sarlo, and the Detroit producer Black Noi$e convened to make a record. This was before he and Sarlo had formalized the thesis behind Baby's songs, but the quartet was inching toward it. There would be “drum stems from a jam a year before that Andrew pulls up on Pro Tools, and [Black Noi$e] puts in a 404 that he just had—it's pitched up to shit, it's got artifacts of somebody else playing the keys in it, and it's just this new rhythm that's completely maligned and bastardized. But it's all source material from our own archives.” It sounded, Dijon says repeatedly, like the future.

There was one problem: He couldn't write lyrics for it. At first, he thought that he just needed to figure out a new way to write for this new kind of music. A year went by. Nothing. From the outside, this appeared at first like a normal bump in the road. Black Noi$e, zen-like, said it was simply “like watching a piece of the human experience.” Eventually, though, Dijon encouraged Mk.gee to take the instrumentals and use them for an album of his own. What am I gonna do with it? his friend said. You were supposed to write these songs. So it was out of sheer necessity that the palette for Baby became discarded songs. The writer's block didn't end, it just gave Dijon constraints within which he could work.

When I ask Justin Vernon about what it was like to see his friend go through this struggle, he insists he never had a doubt that Dijon would persevere. “There's no way this guy's going to fail,” he remembers thinking. “He cares too much and it has too much swagger.” But Vernon concedes that Dijon's mission was difficult. “What he's doing is truly trying to reorganize the world in his vision,” Vernon says. “You could tell that he was struggling with trying to find what it was, and it's serious. When you're working your whole life on something, it gets pretty scary. Also, it's like, he's got the kid on the way, he's got this pressure. But it was never pressure to succeed. It was pressure to make something good.”

Despite creative paralysis, the machinery that would eventually put him on those billboards kept churning. Dijon speaks warmly about Bieber, first telling a story about listening to him wearing headphones on a ferry to see the Microphones play in Seattle. Dijon's contributions to SWAG and SWAG II are the product of only a handful of sessions, which he remembers as refreshingly loose and collaborative. (Dijon is the sort of guy who, even at his most morose, is irrepressibly funny; he twice says to me that the Bieber experience wasn't as “Machiavellian” as he wished it was.)

Speaking of funny, Dijon's brief but notable turn in One Battle After Another (an adaptation of another Pynchon novel, Vineland) was the product of one of those arachnid LA social webs. He speculates that Paul Thomas Anderson saw the 25-minute film he made for Absolutely, but it wasn't until a friend of a friend saw the writer-director at a Dodgers game that any contact was established. What came first was an invitation for Dijon and his wife to have dinner with Anderson and his partner, Maya Rudolph. Months later, a script arrived in the mail.

“Paul is so loose, truly on some musician shit,” Dijon says. “There would be days—everything was on location—he would pivot shit around and be like, ‘Eh, I don't like the way this looks, do we have that parking garage?' And he'd move the entire set.” Anderson decided Dijon looked too young to die during the film's extended prologue and changed his part so that he could reappear later.

Not all of this mass exposure has gone so smoothly, including in Dijon's personal life. “I got into a lot of shit socially because of my song getting sampled by Kanye,” he says. (“Stars,” the opening track from last year's Vultures 1, samples “Good Luck.”) “People were just like, ‘He's going through a fucking psychosis, why did you approve that?' And I was like, ‘One, I didn't.' ” (After the song debuted at a live listening session, Dijon's management got in touch with Kanye's camp and worked out a solution.) “But two, I believe in sampling. I just love sampling so much.”

That can certainly be gleaned from Dijon's music, or from hearing him talk about how Funcrusher Plus rewired his brain. He can wax poetic about sampling as a workaround for the constraints imposed on hip-hop's early iterations, or as a way to draw out tension between two seemingly disparate ideas. But it's also a convenient vehicle for his instinct to self-immolate on the business side. “There was a little bit of being a fucking asshole,” he concedes about the way he stuffed even more samples onto Baby at the 11th hour. The attitude became: “ ‘Fuck it—there's no money in this shit anyway. There's no money here. Give the whole song away to 500 different people. I don't care.' Which seems, like, insane when you have a kid.”

While he's never before been this visible, Dijon's contempt for the commercial market is still razor-toothed. “I'm totally aware of the naivety of even trying to resist it,” he says, also acknowledging that the ease of uploading and distributing songs is what made his career possible in the first place. But, he asks, when streaming services often seem like a “testing grounds for machine learning,” why not try to fuck things up a bit? “I don't have much to say in terms of macro assessments of the universe,” he says, “but it's like, if I'm going to do the fucking thing, if I can be a sore thumb within the thing, just by making the music a little bit more difficult to just sit there…. Why not do that?”

Imagine: It's the middle of the night in the early 2010s, and you're pulling into the 24-hour Walmart in Lansdowne, Maryland, just south of Baltimore. Going the opposite way is a striking young man, on foot, carrying a massive box—the new TV he's just purchased with the tips he's saved from waiting tables, now on its way to the renovated Victorian house where he was living then. He thought to himself, They got me. “I remember being like, ‘This is fucked,' ” Dijon says. “I'm so broke, but now I can watch Archer.” Instead of chipping away at the impossible goal, he was streaming, streaming, streaming.

Dijon is the son of two career-military enlistees. His father is from Guam and his mother from a small tobacco farm in Maryland. They were never really together. This, and the reality of military life, led Dijon to grow up all across the United States—on both coasts and throughout the Midwest—as well as in Hawaii and Germany. When he was with his dad, he often lived alongside various members of his extended family. He mentions the feeling of horror he had when he learned of his classmates' more conventional family structures, which to him seemed suffocating.

That distaste for supposed normalcy continued into adulthood; unsurprisingly, it catalyzed a love for routine. Yet for as much as he says he likes doing simple, repeatable things—not just going to the gym but making an unnecessarily long drive to one—music is not part of that regimen. Even outside that period of writer's block, Dijon writes relatively little. “I don't shed that much,” he says. “I don't practice. I don't tinker.” So as technically adept as he's become, he is operating, first, from a place of instinct.

“I love first-take shit,” he says. Much of the mixing and reverb throwing on Baby was done live by him, Sarlo, and Mk.gee. “You take all these sources and try one pass of just muting shit, and then it's like: ‘That sounds good.' Then we don't touch it anymore. Once there was some sort of inspired thesis behind what was happening and I knew it didn't sound like much else, it was really more about completing the arc.”

The arc Dijon's talking about is thematic, one that was already unspooling from his subconscious. A huge percentage of his songs begin as freestyles; he likens his process to the one that The-Dream has revealed through leaked demos, where you mumble to find cadence and vowel shape first, maybe with some anchor phrases or first passes at full lyrics. “I'm not guided by a force,” Dijon says, before lapsing into a loving but ridiculous impression of one of his idols. “Prince was like, ‘I'm like a lightning rod,' ” he croons. “And I'm not like that.” It's an intuitive process meant to give way to a more deliberate one.

Yet anyone who has tried this, or really done any sort of serious creative work, knows that your central concerns will slip to the surface while your conscious mind is preoccupied with form. Baby has been described, very understandably, as a response to Dijon and his wife having their first child. And it is, though “response” is sort of incomplete. The title track, which opens with Dijon singing, “Yes, I did dance with your mother before I knew her name,” was in fact written before Joanie was even pregnant, the lyric an unexpected intrusion into a session of “fucking around.”

“I was always dealing with very similar themes,” Dijon says. “I was always really meditating on eventually having a kid, and the guilt and shame that exists.” So when it came time to arrange and augment Baby in a way that gave it a legible through line, there wasn't much work to be done. The ecstasy of love and the fear of passing poison through one's blood are, for Dijon, building blocks as elemental as drums. “Violence has been a subject of all of my music, secretly,” he says, when explaining how he channeled stories about his grandfather in Guam into “Rewind,” adding,“and thinking about internal anger and rage—which I have quite a bit—thinking about passing that down to your kid if it's genealogical.”

The only real debate he had while finalizing the album was whether to keep or cut “my man,” a brutal bit of emotional excavation for his father. (“Would it shock you if I've given up?” he asks, pleading, his voice frayed. “Would it ease your little mind?”) In that moment, it was Andrew Sarlo who clarified the album's sweep: You should put it on because it's about your dad, Dijon remembers him saying, and you're a dad.

Earlier in our conversation, Dijon had breezed through major life events: Life happened, we toured a little bit, I had a baby. Now, with the arrival of his second kid nearly aligned on the calendar with the end of a marathon tour, it's perhaps inevitable that the collision fills him with dread. “I'm obsessed with my kid,” he explains. Joanie will remind him how much he loves—or loved—seeing new cities, meeting people, playing pool in dive bars before and after gigs. But all Dijon can think about now is what gets ingrained. During one car ride, we talked almost entirely about our kids, who are pretty close in age; even among new fathers, he is particularly glowing when he describes things his son's learned, ways he's figured out the world, traits of his mother's that he mirrors back. He also sounds particularly pained when he notes that his son has already learned that you say goodbye when Dad goes to work. “He's not going to remember any of this,” Dijon says. “But I can feel the imprint. I can feel what's happening.”

The rehearsal room is one in a complex of many, the complex itself a mirror image of the competing one across the street. There's a tennis court in the middle of the parking lot, for some reason, and the Verdugo Mountains off on the horizon. Inside, Dijon and most of the band members he's assembled for his upcoming tour are in the early stages of mapping out a version of Baby's halting “(Freak It).” Sarlo is here; so are Henry Kwapis, Mike Haldeman, and Jack Karaszew​ski. Sometimes, rooms like this seem to have been tailored to the fussiest, most unpleasable celebrities—mood lighting, custom stationery, a dozen types of candles. But this one is oddly bright and almost comically bestrewn with computers, Taiwanese food, American Spirits, 12-channel mixers, cardboard boxes, and LaCroix. Less Zyn than you might think, which is not to say no Zyn.

Later, Dijon will rave about Mike's intuitive grasp of rhythm, and will tell me something unexpectedly heartbreaking about Jack and Henry, calling them the “first people I met here, likely the last people I'll meet here.” Dijon loves LA in his way, but the combination of its sprawl and our age—the trade-off of the joyful domesticity he details on Baby is a constriction of one's social circle—brings with it a bit of melancholy. For now, he's trying to bury himself within this closed ecosystem. “Can you send a little bit less of me through that stuff?” he asks, as Sarlo, seated at a desktop 10 feet away, nods without looking back.

Over the next hour or so, the quintet works through exploratory, sometimes still skeletal versions of a handful of songs, all from Baby. Dijon, in a navy blue toque and a matching shirt with cartoon hands making the “hang loose” sign, darts from table to cheap folding table, singing and twisting nobs and manipulating BPMs in a way that sometimes unsettles but eventually, invariably, excites everyone else.

The idea, Dijon says, is to keep the show interesting for those on and off the stage. He says he'd like to randomize the sounds in a sampler each night of tour; the people he'll be playing with laugh, then realize he means it. But he's done this before. “Sometimes in the live show I'll take an Aretha Franklin chord progression and just play it, and then that's our beat,” he says. The only time over our many hours together that he asks to go off the record is when he names a song by a famous singer-songwriter whose drums he intends to lift as scaffolding for his band, “taking a loop from one second, and doing it live—and everybody having to find it, to find where our song lives on there.”

Propped portrait-style on a black chair is a whiteboard with the tour set list written in green dry-erase marker. During one lull, a debate springs up about whether a red X next to a song title could scan as “good to go,” or would instead connote the need for triage. I take the opportunity to ask what the blue dots, currently only affixed to “Baby!” and “Automatic,” signify. Does that mean they're finished? Not exactly.

A month after that rehearsal, Dijon played the Greek Theatre, a 6,000-capacity outdoor venue on the southern edge of Griffith Park. This was the second of two nights; fans were packed shoulder to shoulder from the stage until the point where the risers terminated in the clear black night sky. Between songs, Dijon wondered aloud what phase the moon was in. The production team aimed one of its cameras upward, but the image didn't come through clearly.

Wearing a red-orange hat with the Toyota logo and the phrase “Made for War,” he stood downstage, in front of the band members and a rotating array of guest vocalists, including Amber Coffman and Mk.gee. (The latter joined for “Higher!” and an extended encore rendition of “Big Mike's.” “That's my best friend,” Dijon told the crowd.) Sometimes, Dijon's vocals were buried the way he'd asked them to be during rehearsal. But the set was punctuated by instances of nakedness that were nearly shocking: the spare intro to “(Referee),” the stretch during “my man” when everything but his wailing voice simply disappeared.

Just as the abandoned demos had been recovered, reconfigured, and turned into songs that felt inevitable, many of these arrangements did not match what I'd heard weeks ago. But that, of course, was the idea; after the show, I learned just how much they'd evolved from night one to night two. And it was easy—or maybe impossible—to imagine how they might molt next.

In his short career, jackzebra has seemed dead set on releasing as much music as possible, producing a captivatingly uneven body of work. In the past six years, the 23-year-old Chengdu MC born Zhang Zhengkai has issued roughly 20 solo rap projects, half a dozen collabs, and two albums (Apple and People) under his jackapplepeople alias that show a softer, poppier side. This desire has driven him to excess of late: Fall 2024's 王中王 (King of Kings) and winter 2025's Above & Beyond both had hour-plus runtimes across 30-plus tracks. And while there is magnificent foliage to be found in these forests of distorted plugg beats and warped vocals, there's also overgrowth. On his latest endeavor, Hunched Jack Mixtape, he prunes back the deadwood to reveal something more like a traditional album.

Raised in Xujing, a Shanghai suburb with a small-town vibe, Zhang started making music in his mid-teens. The quality of his work has improved rapidly since his earliest projects, on which he rapped in an ironically detached English. This music was aesthetically interesting but devoid of substance. His trajectory changed when Chinese cloud rap progenitor Bloodz Boi became his mentor, encouraging him to rap in Mandarin and upgrade his home recording setup. Watching him blossom, Bloodz Boi has referred to Zhang as “China's Lil B,” noting that he's the first Chinese rapper with a larger following outside the Great Firewall than within its confines.

Hunched Jack Mixtape, his first official release for evilgiane's iconoclastic New York label Surf Gang, boasts a cast of producers fit for a rising star. Starting strong, Zhang enlists vaporwave veteran James Ferraro and hyperpop shapeshifter Glasear to produce five of the first seven tracks. These beats contain only hints of Ferraro's ghostly presence, but they're some of the tape's best. “Leon,” a particularly ferocious cut, features merciless production: Nearly subsonic kicks and slashing snares that conspire with doomsday bass to evoke the experience of watching from a ship's deck as the storm approaches. Zhang's delivery is no less vicious, his voice hovering just above the bass, stretched almost to a breaking point and punctuated by screams. A few minutes later, on “Run,” he drops into an even lower register over a vintage trap beat from Glasear and Swedish cloud rap vet Woesum. “What did you do wrong?/Why are you hiding?” he growls tunelessly in Mandarin, as if he's spitting on the song's cowardly subject.

Zhang is most potent on Hunched Jack's early tracks. By the end of the first bar, he's already stepped into his persona—the damaged, reclusive anti-hero. “Snuggled in my bedroom counting money until my hands are sore,” he sings like a twee Future on “Parrot,” the tape's soft-edged opener. “Going to the corner store together to buy snacks/You'd borrow change from me when you didn't have enough,” he warbles on “Brother,” lamenting long-severed family ties. “We used to have a warm home, but now, like a tree falling and the monkeys scattering/When disaster strikes, even the slowest bird flies.” On “Human,” he's self-deprecating and disaffected like Bladee, but his moaning delivery sounds more like Carti over Ferraro and Glasear's rage beat. Young rappers around the world share these MCs' styles in their DNA, but few have Zhang's ability to recombine their influence in new ways. Zhang's vocals tend to be so slurred and laden with effects that his lyrics are hard to parse, even for native Mandarin speakers. But if you read his lyrics, you will find intense imagery and startling turns of phrase to reveal cracked pieces of his inner world.

Hunched Jack Mixtape loses some steam on the home stretch, but there are heavy hitters on its pluggy, low-key back half, too. “Avatar,” featuring Surf Gang MC Harto Falion and produced by evilgiane, cements Zhang's place as an agile insider in an insular group half a world away. As he and his guest go bar for bar, their stoned, behind-the-beat flows sync up seamlessly across the language barrier. And “Givenchy” sets Zhang's staccato quarter-note monotone against the tactile machine-gun hi-hats of another giane beat, this one built in collaboration with NYC plugg producer Elipropper. In fact, the majority of the tape's instrumentals come from sets of two producers who, in most cases, balance each other out and push each other further. Along with his swooping vocal inflections and gleeful tag, this stylistic solidity allows Zhang to pick up the thread that's run from his trollish early work and pull it forward. Backed by these major-league beats, he sounds more assured of his charmingly anti-social aura than ever.

Shirley Manson has not shifted in her stance on beach balls, even after she went viral for cursing at an audience member for relentlessly volleying them toward the stage during Garbage's recent appearance at Good Things Festival in Melbourne. She hasn't changed her stance on the humanitarian crisis in Palestine, either, and she's using the viral spotlight to draw attention to that instead.


	“The only thing that kind of shocks me a little is there's been more fuss made about me offending beach balls than there has about 20,000 Palestinian kids who are now fucking under the dirt,” Manson said during a headlining performance in Brisbane. “So whilst the Brits are busy cooking up some kind of crazy, like, antichrist rhetoric, I would just like to remind you all what's actually important in this life.”


	“Maybe a beach ball brings you joy, and for that I apologize,” Manson continued. This apology followed the audience member who was on the receiving end of her criticism, where she sounded off with, “You're a fucking middle-aged man in a fucking ridiculous hat … I want, literally, to ask people to fucking punch you in the fucking face. But you know what? I'm a lady, so I won't.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Beach balls have a certain prevalence in some live music spaces, and Manson simply isn't a fan of the beach. In her initial response to the controversy, she doubled down. “I joined a band because I HATED THE FUCKING BEACH,” she wrote on Threads. “I joined a band because I wanted to listen to Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Cure and be dark and beautiful… I am so tired of folks taking music for free and treating us all like circus performers.”  

	











	“If I upset you about your blessed beach balls, I humbly apologize,” Manson continued onstage to a sea of even more beach balls. “However, I would really like it if the governments of the day apologized for what the fuck is happening in Palestine.”

	Last week, the President of the United Nations General Assembly Annalena Baerbock emphasized the need for “decisive action” to end the conflict between Israel and Palestine. “All that has happened in the last two years has all underlined what we have known since decades. The Israeli–Palestinian conflict cannot be resolved through illegal occupation, de jure or de facto annexation, forced displacement, recurrent terror or permanent war,” she said. “We need to ensure that the ceasefire is consolidated and becomes a permanent end to hostilities.”


	Baerbock also noted that at least 67 children have been killed since the ceasefire began in October. In November, Gaza's Health Ministry reported that the Palestinian death toll has reached 70,000 since 2023, per The Associated Press. Of those deaths, 352 were counted after the ceasefire was enacted.

	2025 has been a phenomenal year for Korean music, with idols challenging their artistic boundaries, transcending genres, crossing over into films and K-dramas, and making bold personal decisions. Kpop Demon Hunters introduced K-pop to millions of film viewers, many of whom went down rabbit holes of music discovery and became passionate fans of Korean music. Female artists like Hwasa, Blackpink, and TWICE had career-defining years. As for the men? Stray Kids broke records and Bain inspired fans with his courage. Here's a rundown of the moments that defined K-pop's history-making 2025.


Kpop Demon Hunters, the biggest pop success story of the yearThe animated film Kpop Demon Hunters – Netflix's most-watched film ever — is a Korean American success story, helmed by director Maggie Kang and boasting a cast of predominantly American voice actors of Korean ethnicity (including Arden Cho and Daniel Dae Kim). The soundtrack for KPop Demon Hunters is Spotify's second-most-streamed album of 2025, and it earned five Grammy Award nominations, including Song of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group performance, for the single “Golden.” The phenomenal success of the film made its imprint on pop culture. Children dressed up as HUNTR/X's Rumi, Mira, and Zoey for Halloween. The singing vocalists for HUNTR/X — former K-pop trainee EJae, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami – sang at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. And a military band performed “Golden” at Buckingham Palace's changing of the guard.

	











Stray Kids keep breaking recordsAnother year, another set of records broken by K-pop mega-group Stray Kids, whose dominATE World Tour was the second-most-successful global tour of 2025 (behind Beyoncé), according to Pollstar. Stray Kids also continued to break their own records with each new album. With their November mixtape Do It, the boy band became the only act in history to debut at Number One with eight consecutive album releases on the Billboard 200, a streak that started with 2022's Oddinary.

Hwasa's “Good Goodbye” goes viralA breakout star from the group Mamamoo, singer Hwasa made her debut on the Billboard Global 200 at Number 43 this year, thanks to her bittersweet “Good Goodbye.” The song chronicles her real-life breakup, which she hopes will remain a good goodbye. Wanting peace and happiness for herself and her ex, she conveys optimism in the song's catchy chorus. The music video is enhanced by the inclusion of her longtime crush (actor Park Jeong-min) playing the role of the ex. Driven by their sizzling-hot chemistry during a performance at a Korean awards show, the song went viral. Back home, it debuted at Number One on the Billboard Korea Hot 100. Hwasa became the lone solo female artist of 2025 to achieve what's called a Perfect All-Kill in the Korean music business when “Good Goodbye” ranked Number One simultaneously on all of South Korea's major daily, weekly and real-time music charts.


Bain courageously comes outIn an unexpected move, Just B member Bain came out during a concert performance in Los Angeles. “Tonight I'm going to share something with you guys,” he told the audience. “I'm fucking proud to be a part of the LGBTQ community as a gay person. To anyone out there who's part of the LGBTQ community, or still figuring it out, this is for you guys. You are seen. You are loved. You are born this way.” With that he launched into a cover of Lady Gaga's “Born This Way,” making a powerful statement about who he is. Bain is one of the few Korean celebrities to publicly announce that he is gay.


TWICE make historyLollapalooza. Kpop Demon Hunters. Victoria's Secret — TWICE did it all in 2025. The nine-member girl group made history as the first female K-pop act to headline at Lollapalooza — or Twicepalooza, as their fans dubbed the event — this summer in Chicago. Backed by a live band, TWICE performed a set that spanned their decade-long career. Additionally, Jihyo, Chaeyoung, and Jeongyeon recorded “Takedown” for the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack. Notably, the members appear in human form singing the track at the end of the film. “We didn't accept this because we knew it would be a huge success,” Chaeyoung told Rolling Stone.  “It just sounded like fun. The soundtrack itself is very different from our style, so it was an opportunity to challenge ourselves.” In October, TWICE became the first K-pop group to perform at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. (Blackpink's Lisa performed as a solo artist in 2024.) Jihyo, Nayeon, Momo, and Tzuyu performed wearing lingerie from the brand's Pink line. The push-up bra worn by Tzuyu sold out shortly after their appearance.

K-pop Idols become breakout actorsK-pop idols are trained to be all-around entertainers who excel at singing, dancing, hosting, and often acting. This year, some of the most memorable acting roles went to idols. Big Bang's T.O.P. played the love-to-hate-him rapper Thanos in the second and third seasons of Squid Game. D.O of EXO took on the role of a chilling villain in the K-drama The Manipulated. Kim Yo-han (Wei) tackled the rugby underdog series The Winning Try. Yook Sung-jae (BtoB) starred in the historical drama The Haunted Palace. And Omega X's Kevin had lead billing in the Boys' Love romance series My Bias Is Showing. Meanwhile, Korean American solo singer-songwriter Eric Nam and Kpop Demon Hunters voice actress Ji-Young Yoo were cast this summer in an as-yet-titled K-pop musical film from Paramount Pictures and Hybe America — the first major American movie to be filmed entirely in South Korea — which is due out on Feb. 12, 2027.


Blackpink are … everywhereAs if performing worldwide on their Deadline World Tour wasn't enough, the individual members of Blackpink achieved notable accomplishments as solo artists in 2025. In September, “APT.,” by Rosé and Bruno Mars, became the fastest K-pop video to reach 2 billion YouTube views, besting the previous record held by PSY's “Gangnam Style.” Based on a Korean drinking game, the global hit single has been nominated for Grammys, including Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Lisa released her solo album, Alter Ego, and made her acting debut in the Emmy Award-winning series The White Lotus. And Netflix just announced that the Thai rapper-singer has signed on for her first feature-film role, opposite Korean superstar Don Lee, in the action film Tygo, which is part of the Extraction universe. Meanwhile, Jisoo starred in the film Omniscient Reader: The Prophecy and the K-drama Newtopia. She is the female lead in the K-drama Boyfriend on Demand, which is  scheduled for release next year. And Jennie followed up her debut solo album, Ruby, which ranked Number 29 on Rolling Stone's 100 Best Albums of 2025 list, with the solo tour The Ruby Experience.


Cortis, KiiiKiii, and Allday Project take risks and win bigK-pop groups generally make their debuts polished and polite, with cute concepts and pleasant songs. But groups like Cortis and KiiiKiii have embraced an adventurous sense of musical weirdness, opting for raw energy and slightly messy concepts meant to entice potential fans by giving them something different. Allday Project also debuted this year as the first co-ed K-pop group since KARD, almost a decade ago. The group got its name from will.i.am of Black Eyed Peas, who is a major fan. But he's not even the group's most influential connection. Rapper Annie is the first chaebol heiress K-pop idol. Her family founded and runs Shinsegae, a powerful South Korean retail conglomerate.

Waterbomb Festival, the world's wettest music festThe annual Waterbomb Festival is part music event and part wet T-shirt contest — and it's always a huge success. Both male and female idols (and the crowds) are drenched by water canons throughout the festival. Monsta X's Shownu — who's never been shy about ripping off his shirt — was a fan favorite this year at Waterbombs in South Korea and Vietnam. Female idols are generally not as overt about their sexuality on stage, so a huge hell yeah to Kwon Eun-bi, who embraced the fun by wearing bikini tops at Waterbomb. Known as the Waterbomb Goddess, Kwon goes viral every year with her fun and sexy performances. This year, JYPE founder Park Jin-young dressed up in hot pink to dazzle the crowd. While he doesn't share the idol looks of the groups on his label, he has idol energy to spare.


The long-awaited return of BTSIn 2021, RM of BTS told Rolling Stone, “We don't actually really care about whether people see us as inside or outside K-pop. The important fact is that we're all Koreans, and we're singing a pop song.” BTS' loyal fandom, ARMY, will passionately debate whether or not BTS is K-pop. But it's undeniable that the septet are the biggest, most influential global pop act in the history of South Korean music. 2025 marked the year that all seven members returned from military duty, which is mandatory for all able-bodied South Korean men. Jin released the album Echo and went on an international tour. Jung Kook became the first Asian solo artist to garner 100 million streams on every original track on Spotify. Jimin released his 2024 solo album, Muse, on vinyl and won the best K-pop Song of the Year award, for “Who,” at this year's iHeartRadio Music Awards. RM and Epik High's Tablo delivered the introspective “Stop the Rain.” J-hope released the singles “Sweet Dreams,” “Mona Lisa,” and “Killin' It Girl,” headlined a solo tour, and then collaborated with Le Sserafim on “Spaghetti.” V's “Winter Ahead” (with Park Hyo-shin) became the fastest jazz song to surpass 500 million streams on Spotify. He also released his artistic photo book, Rêvé. And Suga founded a treatment center in South Korea to support children with autism spectrum disorder. Then on July 1, BTS gave ARMY the news fans had waited too long to hear. In a joint live broadcast on Weverse, the members confirmed that they would release a brand-new studio album in the upcoming spring. An extensive world tour is also in the works, with at least 30 concerts expected in North America. This as-yet-named tour will be the first since BTS' Permission to Dance on Stage in 2022, which was followed later that year with the free one-off concert Yet to Come, in Busan, South Korea.

Donald Trump reignited his ongoing feud with Jimmy Kimmel on Saturday night, proclaiming ahead of the Kennedy Center Honors that he is a better host than the late-night comedian. 


	Speaking from the Oval Office, where the president presented this year's Kennedy Center honorees with their medals ahead of Sunday's ceremony, Trump said he would do better than Kimmel, who has hosted the Oscars multiple times. Trump notably decided to host the annual awards, which will air on Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, himself. 


	“I believe — and I'm gonna make a prediction — this will be the highest-rated show that they've ever done, and they've gotten some pretty good ratings, but there's nothing like what's gonna happen tomorrow night,” Trump said. 


	He continued, “We have never had a president hosting the awards before. This is the first. I'm sure they'll give me great reviews, right? You know, they'll say, ‘He was horrible. He was terrible. It was a horrible situation.' No, we'll do fine. I've watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible, and some of these people, if I can't beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don't think I should be president.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The Kennedy Center Honors celebrated Sylvester Stallone, George Strait, Gloria Gaynor, KISS, and Michael Crawford, who appear to be some of the only performers who agreed to accept the awards from Trump. However, in August, Trump said that he “turned down plenty” of possible honorees. “They were too woke,” he said. “I had a couple of wokesters.”

	











	Although Kimmel has never hosted the Kennedy Center Honors, the event has historically been helmed by a comedian, an actor or a journalist. Stephen Colbert has hosted several times, as have Queen Latifah and David Letterman. When Trump announced that he had decided to play host himself he claimed it was because he would improve the show's ratings. 


	“I've been asked to host,” he said. “I said, ‘I'm the president of the United States. Are you folks asking me to do that?' ‘Sir, you'll get much higher ratings.' I said, ‘I don't care. I'm the president of the United States. I won't do it.' They said, ‘Please.' And then [chief of staff] Susie Wiles said, ‘Sir. I would like you to host.' I said, ‘OK, I'll do it.'”

	During his first administration, Trump broke longtime tradition and didn't attend the yearly Kennedy Center Honors. The move came after Norman Lear and other honorees said they wouldn't attend if he was in the house. “As an artist and a human being, I cannot celebrate this incredible honor at a White House that has no interest in supporting the arts and humanities,” Lear told NPR.


	In February, Trump announced his plans to gut the board of trustees of the Kennedy Center, along with his intention to boot its chairman, billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein. The president declared he would reinstate himself as head of the revered cultural center.


	“I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “We will soon announce a new Board, with an amazing Chairman, DONALD J. TRUMP!”


	Trump also took aim at the center's past events. “Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP,” said Trump. “The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation. For the Kennedy Center, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” Following the announcement, Ben Folds resigned as artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra, a position he had held since 2017.

	Although Trump's stint as host has yet to air, reports from the evening suggest that Trump had trouble restraining himself from criticizing some of the attendees. Speaking about the honorees, Trump noted, “Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame. But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.”

	He added (via The Hollywood Reporter), “I know so many of you are persistent. Many of you are miserable, horrible people. You are persistent. You never give up. Sometimes I wish you'd give up, but you don't.”


	Kimmel has yet to respond to Trump's claim, but a new episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live airs Monday night on ABC.

A fantastic video from Mexico provides a remarkably clear glimpse of a triangular UFO that appeared in the night sky. According to a local media report, witness Ikal Cuauhtli Iktan filmed the strange scene on November 29th in the city of Orizaba. In the video, the witness zooms in on what initially appears to be a particularly bright object overhead. A closer look at the oddity subsequently reveals that it is a set of five lights forming a triangle with a larger illumination at the center of the craft.

A recent tweet by Polymarket - declaring a 12 per cent chance that ""aliens being confirmed"" could be officially acknowledged in 2025 - has stirred fresh debate around UFO disclosures. The moment gained traction as traders piled into a parallel contract: whether the Trump administration would declassify previously classified UFO/UAP files before the end of this year. 



BREAKING: The odds of aliens being confirmed are soaring, amid reportedly imminent UFO disclosures.12% chance.https://t.co/cE1FTgiXtR



In a dramatic pivot for the contract, odds soared from single digits on December 7 to as high as the mid-70s within hours - briefly touching 81 per cent, according to platform data. Market watchers say aggressive purchases by a single trader triggered a cascade of confidence, hinting at possible 'smart-money' placing their bets. 

Under the rules, the contract resolves only if the US government officially releases previously classified documents, videos or reports relating to UFOs, or credible mainstream reporting provides equivalent disclosure - vague hints or leaks do not qualify. That rigour has not dissuaded traders: more than US $233,000 has reportedly flowed into the contract at share prices of around 76 to 77 cents. 

This flurry of activity has revived global conversation about what the government might disclose - and why. Though the Trump administration has not issued any formal statement confirming plans to declassify UFO files, speculation is rising rapidly that something significant may be on the horizon. 

The developments are a curious echo of growing worldwide demand for transparency in unexplained aerial phenomena (UAPs), and the enduring fascination with ""are we alone?"" A contract with almost 80 per cent odds is being treated by some as a wild bet; by others, as a discreet barometre of insider confidence.

Observers warn - especially given the history of betting markets driven by large players - that these odds may reflect strong conviction or simply heavy capital flow, not a guarantee of disclosure. 

Until there is official confirmation, what we have is a market mood - and a viral tweet - not a confirmed announcement. But the speed and size of the surge on Polymarket suggest one thing: for many, the possibility of a UFO files dump - and perhaps something more - now seems real.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}","other"

The trailer for the investigative supernatural thriller, Bhay - The Gaurav Tiwari Mystery, has officially released, and it looks like it's set to be the next must-watch show for anyone who loves a good scare and a deep mystery. Inspired by the incredible, true story of Gaurav Tiwari, India's very first paranormal investigator, the series stars Karan Tacker in the lead role and the versatile Kalki Koechlin as the author determined to uncover the truth behind his death.

 

The show takes us straight into the terrifying world that Gaurav Tiwari navigated. The trailer opens with intense field investigations, showing unexplained activities, spirits lurking, and a desperate struggle to capture evidence. Gaurav, who started his career as a pilot before a life-changing experience led him to the paranormal world, spent his life chasing things most people considered as fantasy. The series promises to showcase his actual case files and field notes, putting his personal battles and the emotional toll of confronting the paranormal activities.

The story also moves forward after Gaurav's sudden and tragic death at the age of 32. This is where Kalki Koechlin's character, author and journalist Irene Venkat, takes over. Initially a practical person, Irene is pulled into Gaurav's legacy as she begins to retrace his final steps for a book. The trailer hints that her investigation will uncover a larger, darker truth about the man and the mystery that now defines him.

 

​Karan Tacker, who steps into the demanding role of Gaurav Tiwari, admitted that the experience was one of the toughest of his career. He shared that portraying a real-life figure who genuinely believed in the forces he dealt with, and who met such an unsettling end, was incredibly intense. “Filming his story shook me in ways I didn't expect; he was someone who wanted to be understood and acknowledged,"" Tacker said. ""To understand Gaurav, I had to recognise the courage it takes to follow a calling most people question. His life was filled with doubt, pressure, and real danger, yet he never stopped chasing the truth.”

 

​Kalki Koechlin was equally drawn to the emotional depth of her character. Speaking about playing Irene Venkat, she noted that the journey is one of seeing past assumptions. ""She begins with skepticism, but as she learns about Gaurav after his passing, she realizes the numerous layers that were a part of his life and work. That emotional shift was one major factor that drew me to the role,"" she explained.

FEEDBACK

The actor opens up about abandoning logic, embracing instinct, and stepping into the world of unexplained phenomena for his most haunting role yet.



The trailer of Bhay: The Gaurav Tiwari Mystery is out, offering a chilling first look at Karan Tacker's latest and most challenging transformation. Known for immersing himself into characters rooted in real-life events — from Khakee: The Bihar Chapter to Special Ops — Tacker now takes on the role of India's first certified paranormal investigator, Gaurav Tiwari. The trailer sets an ominous tone from the outset, presenting a man consumed by the pursuit of truth in places where logic begins to collapse.



Stepping into Gaurav Tiwari's world meant recreating the life of a figure who cracked several of India's most unnerving paranormal cases — from haunted properties to inexplicable disturbances that even experts struggled to decode. Yet, the most lingering mystery remains Tiwari's own death at 29, a case that continues to spark speculation and unanswered questions.

For Tacker, portraying Tiwari wasn't just about mimicking mannerisms; it required understanding the emotional and psychological toll of investigating the incomprehensible. He reportedly spent months studying archived footage, interviews, case reports, and recordings from Tiwari's expeditions — ranging from abandoned hotels to alleged possession sites — to capture the essence of a man driven by both curiosity and compassion.

Reflecting on the experience, Tacker shared, “When I watched the trailer for the first time, I was thinking of the reaction it would get from the viewers. It's mainly because this paranormal genre doesn't allow you to lean on the comfort of logic. I had to abandon my rational grain. I'm a sceptic by nature, but this role demanded that I move beyond intellect and trust something far more primal. Instinct over reasoning, feeling over analysis—because the truth is, some things that happen in this world simply cannot be explained. Here I am playing a man who was trying to help people who were trapped in fear. So this role made me confront my own ideas of fear, conviction, and vulnerability. I hope the trailer has that effect on people and leaves them intrigued for what's to come.”

Former Israeli space security chief Haim Eshed has reaffirmed his startling claim that US President Donald Trump was aware of a secret 'galactic federation' of extraterrestrials—and reportedly came close to disclosing the truth.

In an interview with Hebrew-language daily Yediot Aharonot, Eshed said that governments of the United States and Israel have, for years, maintained contact with alien life.

According to him, the two countries signed a 'contract' with a so-called Galactic Federation, granting extraterrestrials permission to conduct experiments on Earth, ndtv.com reported.

Eshed claimed the cooperation even extends to an alleged joint base—hidden deep beneath the surface of Mars—where American astronauts and alien representatives supposedly meet.

He added that President Trump was 'on the verge' of unveiling this secret to the world—until the Galactic Federation stepped in.

According to Eshed, the aliens cautioned against disclosure, arguing that humanity was not yet ready.

A highly decorated former general and respected academic, Eshed ran Israel's national space security programme for nearly 30 years.

He said he chose to speak out at this time because he felt the world had changed—with growing public interest in extraterrestrial phenomena and a shifting academic climate.

He insisted that had he made these claims even five years prior, as he put it, 'I would have been hospitalised,' The Independent said in a report.

Eshed's latest statements align with a growing wave of public fascination with UFOs, a renewed scientific interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), and official declassifications of UAP-related documents in several countries. In this context, he said, it gave him confidence to go public.

Unsurprisingly, reactions to Eshed's claims have ranged from bemusement to outright dismissal. Some analysts argue the story reflects more science fiction than credible evidence.

For example, one critique highlights the practical difficulties in concealing a secret base on Mars or in ensuring a former president would remain silent—particularly someone like Trump, who is known for his extensive use of social media, according to IFLScience.

Others in the scientific community warn that extraordinary conclusions require extraordinary evidence, which Eshed has so far not provided.

Even within Israel's space establishment, voices of caution were raised. According to one senior figure, Eshed's public disclosure may have 'gone too far,' though his previous service and reputation mean he cannot be automatically dismissed as a crank.

What appears undisputed is this: in December 2020, the interview published in Yediot Aharonot revived long-standing speculation about extraterrestrial contact.

Other media, including The Jerusalem Post, subsequently translated the claims.

Yet, key elements remain unverified—including any physical evidence of alien contact, details of the supposed Mars base, or documents confirming a pact between the Galactic Federation and national governments.

Neither the US government nor Israeli authorities has issued any confirmation or detailed rebuttal. Requests for comment reportedly went unanswered.

If Eshed's account is valid, the implications would be profound—rewriting man's understanding of humanity's place in the cosmos and of decades-long government secrecy. But without verifiable evidence, the story remains in the realm of extraordinary anecdote.

For now, the world watches and speculates. As societies become more open to considering the possibility of alien life and UAPs, figures like Eshed may gain attention even without hard proof—though they may also find themselves on the fringes of mainstream science.

A man claims he was abducted by aliens who harvested his sperm in a series of “mind boggling” encounters.

Julius Shields, from Missouri in the US, believes the extraterrestrials' planned to use his sperm to breed hybrid beings, adding that he'd be ""curious to see what happens"" – hoping his offspring would seek him out at some point in the future.

He made the wild claims in an interview on the YouTube channel, Soft White Underbelly. He said extraterrestrials first made contact when he was 17, telling how he had spotted glowing orbs floating outside his family home.

A being “with three tentacles” started tapping on his window, leaving him frozen in shock, he said. Unsettled, he began sleeping in a different room. Soon after, though, he started having disturbing, vivid dreams.

He believes the aliens performed sexual experiments on him. He said: “It got more sexual because there was a full week straight where I was having wet dreams every night. I was having sex with different creatures, women and just different stuff

“I would wake up, and I would look at my pants and sometimes there'd be nothing and sometimes it would just be wet – there would be no actual sperm in there.”

Julius believes the extraterrestrials were taking his sperm and using it to breed hybrid human-alien babies.

Years later, he started speaking with his uncle who also claimed to have had similar dreams. Julius claims the aliens in question were a type known as The Grays. They are between 3ft and 4ft tall and have flying saucers and a mothership in their fleet.

He went on: “It's almost astonishing but it just makes you realise that there's just more to life than just what we have here on Earth.”

Julius believes he may now have half-alien children somewhere out there. He went on: “Give it maybe another 10 years or so and then I'm curious to see what happens.

""Because if it is real and I do have extraterrestrial children, and they used my sperm to recreate life and do whatever. I would really hope those individuals wouldn't be brainwashed enough to be able to come back and try to figure out where it all started.”

British clairvoyant Philip Kinsella famously said he was probed by reptilian aliens in 1989. He was levitating and moving through the rooms of his home, before being strapped naked to a board and probed by the extra-terrestrials, he claimed.

""The image that was the most raw, that I will never forget, was their faces,"" he told The Sun. ""They looked like dinosaurs, but they were reptilian, about seven to eight feet tall.""

Earlier this year, scientists revealed they are incredibly close to discovering the existence of life outside our solar system. They found two specific chemicals in a distant planet's atmosphere that can only be manufactured by actual life.

""Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,"" said Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy's Professor Nikku Madhusudhan.

""This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.""

The Boys are back in town in the disturbing trailer for the show's final season.

The Boys creator Eric Kripke is fond of bringing back actors from his other hit show, Supernatural. In previous seasons of Prime Video's violent superhero series, we've seen appearances from Supernatural alums Jim Beaver, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and even Jensen Ackles, but Kripke has saved the biggest Supernatural reunion of all for the final season of The Boys by adding Ackles' co-star and fellow Winchester brother, Jared Padalecki, into the mix.

Ackles and Padalecki haven't acted alongside each other since Supernatural wrapped in 2020 after 15(!) seasons. In the season 5 trailer for The Boys, we get a little tease of Ackles' revived Soldier Boy and Padalecki's secret character, who may play a key role or be killed hilariously within minutes. You just never know with The Boys!

When we last left Billy Butcher and the gang in season 4, Homelander had been trying to consolidate control and grasp political power with the help of Sister Sage. This plan inevitably worked, and presidential candidate Robert Singer was framed for Victoria Neuman's death. Singer wasn't responsible, of course. Butcher was the one who took her out after being shot full of supe-enhancing drugs.

Martial law was then declared, and everyone started to fall into Homelander's homicidal grasp. The Boys' morale was already dire when Butcher revealed he was dying, but it got worse when they were either scattered or captured under Homelander's new regime.

All this sets up a bloody endgame in Season 5, where The Boys feel they have nothing to lose by trying one last time to rid the world of Homelander and Vought once and for all.

Check out the Season 5 trailer below…

Here's an official The Boys Season 5 synopsis from Prime Video:

“It's Homelander's world, completely subject to his erratic, egomaniacal whims. Hughie, Mother's Milk, and Frenchie are imprisoned in a ‘Freedom Camp.' Annie struggles to mount a resistance against the overwhelming Supe force. Kimiko is nowhere to be found. But when Butcher reappears, ready and willing to use a virus that will wipe all Supes off the map, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change the world and everyone in it. It's the climax, people. Big stuff's gonna happen.”

The Boys season 5 will begin streaming on Prime Video on April 8.

The Pure Heart Collective sits on a busy stretch of Ventura Boulevard, the facade painted in a soothing shade of lavender, with a sign advertising “psychic and astrology readings,” as well as yoga, healing classes and meditation. Once home to the Liberate Emporium, a metaphysical supply store, this building was already a hub of spiritual activity when Wendy L'Belle-Tividad took it over 10 months ago.

L'Belle-Tividad is pale, almost luminescent, an effect enhanced by her bright blond hair and her wardrobe of flowing, white and pale pink garments. Long, black spidery lashes and black eyeliner frame her pale blue eyes, intensifying their iciness. Her movements are swan-like. Any skeptic would find themselves disarmed by her soft smile and twinkling voice, and her tendency to address everyone as “angel.” With a list of clients that includes both A-list celebrities and struggling artists, L'Belle-Tividad not only helps people sort out their emotional lives but also offers what she calls “creative sessions” — readings to help people work through their ideas and projects.

But I didn't come for a creative session. Not sure where I fell on the spectrum between “cynic” and “believer” myself, I found myself anxious as L'Belle-Tividad sat me down for a reading. My eyes watered as I fixed them to her forehead. She told me I may see her third eye throbbing there when she entered her trance.

“You have a lot of light around you,” she said, her eyes seeming unfocused as she rested her vision on a candle flickering to the left of me. The first person she saw as she entered my “field” was my sister. And then my mother. And then my grandmother. Finally, she started talking about me.

“You're at odds with some things in your life and you're trying to figure out which direction to go,” she said. “You sometimes start things and then don't finish all the way because you're not sure which direction to go. Did someone offer you a job?”

“Yes,” I said, trying to remember if I'd mentioned it already. Someone had offered me a job, in an industry I was conflicted about.

“There could be money there,” she said. There was. “I think you might do it, my angel. I think it makes sense for you right now, because you need a stable placement.” I did. “Your energy goes in a very interesting angle to that space. It's almost like ‘don't notice me and just let me do my work.' There's a lot of male-dominating energy there. Do you know what I mean?”

I did know what she meant. Because the job was at a tech company. I took the job.

L'Belle-Tividad doesn't refer to herself as a psychic. Rather, she prefers to be called a “ball of light” or “God's helper,” mystifying phrases unburdened by the conventional stigmas. In 2023, I listened to an interview L'Belle-Tividad gave on “Otherworld,” a podcast about supernatural encounters hosted by Jack Wagner. In the two-episode series, one of her clients tells a convincing story about how L'Belle-Tividad helped her discover that her father's girlfriend was slowly poisoning him to death.

It turned out many of my friends, and friends of friends, knew who L'Belle-Tividad was and recognized her from the podcast. Many of them were her clients. Her daughter, Harmony Tividad, formerly one-half of the band Girlpool, had drawn many of the young creatives in her orbit into the yurt in L'Belle-Tividad's backyard in Sherman Oaks, where she once regularly held group readings. For years, I'd been hearing tidbits from these readings, predictions she made for friends and friends of friends. But I was just now putting the pieces together — and trying to book my own appointment. Except I couldn't. She was booked out for years.

When you quite literally accept the cards that life has already dealt you, the story of what may lay ahead practically tells itself.

“We ended up closing my books for a year and a half because it felt too overwhelming,” L'Belle-Tividad says. “It was, like, 2024 and they were booking me for 2027.”

Since Wagner's podcast, the mysterious “clairvoyant” has been repeatedly sought after. She's been featured in Nylon, Interview and Office magazines. This year, Lizzo, one of her several celebrity clients, invited a New York Magazine journalist to sit in on one of their readings for a profile of the pop artist.

L'Belle-Tividad has blown up. So much so that she was able to move her spiritual practice out of the yurt in her backyard and into the building on Ventura last January. “When L.A. was burning, on January 10, that's when I signed the lease,” says L'Belle-Tividad. “It was such an act of faith, because, you know, we're in the middle of this incredible disaster.”

 L'Belle-Tividad wears a vintage cape and vintage La Perla dress. 

She was also able to move out of her old home in Sherman Oaks, the one with the yurt in the backyard, and into a new light-filled ranch-style house up in the hills. The furnishings are as eclectic as the woman herself: A pink couch in one corner has four bowing swans affixed to each corner. Two gold swans provide the base of a glass coffee table right in front of it. A ceramic red-haired mermaid sits in the corner of her spacious bathtub. And then there are the closets. She has two of them, with lacy white- and pink-colored garments bursting out the sliding doors. She wears only white to work.

“When I first started reading, I just knew I was meant to do that,” she says. “I don't know how else to explain it. I just thought I was gonna wear white because it will move everything through me. Nothing will stick. It's almost like you want to be a vessel and you want everything to move through you.”

When I visit, she and her husband, Vince Tividad, have just moved in with their two dogs, Heaven and Dove. On this day, they're also watching Harmony's dog, Dragon, a mouthy attention-seeker who interrupts our conversation multiple times.

“Do I need to go into your field and see what's going on?” L'Belle-Tividad asks Dragon when the dog starts barking again. “Do I need to find out what's happening with you? Do we need to do a little deep dive?”

Yes, she can read animals too. L'Belle-Tividad has been reading people and animals now for nine years, but what she calls her “Kundalini awakening” happened in 2013. “It wasn't pretty. It wasn't fun. It wasn't easy,” she says. “It's like having a lot of electricity move through your body. And it's very activating. When it opens the heart field, you feel tremendous, tremendous compassion for everyone. You have a deep understanding of everyone, even people who have been hurtful to you.”

The electricity was so intense, she says, she often had to sleep in epsom salt to soothe her body.

“She had always had incredible intuition when I was younger, and we'd always make jokes about her being psychic,” says Harmony. “That was something that was common in the discourse of our household: ‘She's doing her psychic thing, you know.'”

But it wasn't normal for her mom to be “channeling metaphysical data,” says Harmony. She remembers her mom suddenly acquiring a “strange breadth of knowledge” on subjects she had no expertise in. She remembers out-of-the-ordinary electrical occurrences happening in her mother's wake, like lights suddenly going out. Her mom was, they say, deep-trance channeling. Vince recognized it right away.

“I was a philosophy minor in college, and I'd researched a lot of different philosophical leanings and things. And [I knew] she was channeling. There was no doubt about it,” he says.

L.A.-based artist Amanda Maciel Antunes opens up another realm to talk to the famed erotics writer and diarist — 45 years after her death.

“I remember her being like, ‘in a trance, I saw you in a magazine, there was a write-up about you,'” says Harmony. It was before Girlpool had taken off. “And within like a month, we were in NME for the first time ever and that was our first write-up.”

The first reading L'Belle-Tividad gave was to a group of three of her friends, more than three years after her awakening. “Within time, I found out I did not have to go into this deeper trance state to get information, that I could use a lot less energy, and just touch people's hands, and get information, and go into their field,” she says. “I call it perceiving.”

For my own reading, L'Belle-Tividad walked me into her office, a small space in the back of the Pure Heart Collective that is decorated excessively in soft pinks. She dabbed some oil on the inside of my wrists — a special concoction her mother Diane makes called Wolf Oil, which you can buy at the collective for $45. She closed her eyes and held my hands, and then she focused her gaze on a flickering candle. “I'm formless,” she said. “I'm you now.”

At the risk of perpetuating a silly cliche, it's not uncommon to hear people in Los Angeles refer to their psychics or mediums as casually as they refer to their therapists or masseuses. On every main street you can find a neon sign advertising psychic services. “No other community on the face of the globe has given rise to half as many mystic, philosophical, psychological, occult, consciousness-raising, therapeutic and alternative creeds as 20th century L.A.,” The Times wrote in 1988.

This “customary affinity for the socially bizarre” — as the New York Times put it in a 1976 article on SoCal's “flourishing” psychics — has been a curiosity for those who come from colder coasts. Is there something about the sun that makes you more susceptible to supernatural influence? The reporter of this article notes the rise of psychic readings among the middle class and quotes Marsha Miller, the wife of an Exxon executive: “All my friends are going to psychics; they spend their food money on it … They ask about their husbands, their husband's jobs, their health, their marriages, what they should do with their lives — everything.”

The article reports psychic fees as high as $250/hour in 1976. Back then, it was against the law to charge for “psychic readings.” That is no longer the case. Today, L'Belle-Tividad suggests a donation in the range of $400 to $1,000.

L'Belle-Tividad was born in Mission Hills, at least 50 years ago, although she won't disclose her exact age. (“Can you just say I'm ageless?” she asks.) Her mom was born in Hermosa Beach. “My mom's always been very spiritual. But when I say ‘spiritual,' I mean she's loving. She's connected to love,” says L'Belle-Tividad. Her grandparents were very religious Christians. She doesn't remember any preoccupation with psychics or mediums growing up.

In her 20s, she worked as an artist. She made her own greeting cards, which she sold to Fred Segal, and then worked in TV commercials as a creative assistant for some time. She met Vince, a bass player, about 31 years ago, at the House of Blues.

“When I first started reading, I just knew I was meant to do that,” she says. “I don't know how else to explain it. I just thought I was gonna wear white because it will move everything through me. Nothing will stick. It's almost like you want to be a vessel and you want everything to move through you.”

“I was sitting at a table, and I turned around, there was this beautiful girl sitting behind me, and I said, ‘Do you always sneak up on people?'” remembers Vince. “And she goes, ‘No, I just felt safe here,' or something like that.”

Harmony was born a couple years later. It was Harmony who encouraged her mom to start doing readings. She would bring her friends over and L'Belle-Tividad would read for them. Over time, the yurt gatherings grew larger and larger. Word spread. People started sending L'Belle-Tividad celebrity clients, most of whom prefer to remain anonymous. They do include A-list actors and musicians. In 2019, Lizzo booked an appointment.

“I was not, like, always super into psychics,” Lizzo tells me over the phone. “I didn't want them to tell me anything negative…. [But with Wendy] it's not just somebody looking in a crystal ball being like ‘and then this is gonna happen to you.' It's more like she is formless, and she is speaking as essentially your highest self. You're essentially having a chat with yourself, like the ‘you' who knows better, you know what I mean?”

Lizzo says that in their first session, L'Belle-Tividad appeared to know things about her that no one could have known — information about herself that was not on the internet. In the years since, Lizzo has booked countless appointments. They text each other regularly. Lizzo refers to herself as L'Belle-Tividad's “client-friend.”

“My music video for ‘Still Bad' that I released earlier this year was in the woods,” says Lizzo. “Before it came out, she was like, ‘I see you in the woods. It's so beautiful'. And I was like, ‘Yeah, girl, how did you know that?'”

 L'Belle-Tividad wears a Marc Jacobs top, Dior corset and skirt, and her own jewelry. 

Vienna Pouliot, a “helper” and apprentice at the Pure Heart Collective, describes L'Belle-Tividad as a “beautiful bubbly fairy” whose secondary power is in cultivating long-lasting relationships with her clients. Pouliot has seen cynics walk into L'Belle-Tividad's readings or classes and walk away as believers. “[A nonbeliever] came into the intuition class, and the person that they were paired with was actually able to completely see what their partner had done the day before,” she says. “They thought they were just kind of being imaginative, and then they ended up describing to a T what this person, who they never met, did the day before.” L'Belle-Tividad believes everyone has innate intuitive ability, but that the realities of contemporary life — a 9-to-5 job, screen addictions, long commutes — have dulled our senses.

Tommy Bruce, a music manager at Full Stop Management, which manages top talent like Harry Styles, Tate McRae, John Mayer and U2, has been a client of L'Belle-Tividad for five years.

“I send anybody that I can to Wendy, if I can get them in. Wendy's currency [among] people of note is … it wouldn't work if she ever shared anything with anyone. And — I'm sure she's told you this in her readings — when she's in her [trance] state, she doesn't even remember [what was discussed].” 

 Image 

The controversial healer was seen, in so many communities in L.A., as an underdog hero; the mythic figure The Man didn't want you to know about. People saw him as a champion of the truth, or a truth.

I don't know if I believed that or not — still, the promise made me comfortable enough to ask L'Belle-Tividad about an extremely painful and private event in my life that happened many years ago, the details of which I cannot remember, in my own reading.

I can't tell you what happened, or what she said. What I can tell you is that she seemed to know details about what happened that no one else could have known. While I answered her questions and listened to her answer mine, I started sobbing. I don't know if what she said was true. I don't know if it matters. What I do know is that it felt true. I allowed myself, in that moment, to let go of the shame and guilt I felt over this painful event in my life. I hardly think about it anymore.

The skeptics in my life believe L'Belle-Tividad may just be really good at collecting information about people, gleaning details from other readings and our demographic data. Creatives tend to be very chatty and have a hard time keeping secrets. And, the truth is, we're all a little bit more predictable than we like to think we are. When L'Belle-Tividad first entered my field, she asked, “Have you finished your book yet?” I hadn't told her about the book I was writing, but it was an easy guess to make: I am a 30-something writer in Los Angeles.

There are also some things in my reading that she got wrong. She told me I had a knack for languages. I do not. She told me I would find myself living in France some day; I had actually been thinking about moving to Spain. And she described my maternal grandmother as “chatty.” This simply was never the case with my late grandmother, a stoic woman who preferred silent company. But perhaps it's a quality she's acquired in the afterlife.

No matter how Sunday's bracket reveal went, a few fan bases were going to have gripes. Dylan Buell / Getty Images

Whether it's Zapruder film of a missed holding call or a conspicuous communications system error, college football fans love a good conspiracy.

And despite their best (or as Notre Dame fans might argue, worst) efforts, this year's version of the College Football Playoff committee fueled plenty of them.

Advertisement

ESPN is in an uncomfortable spot full of conflicts of interest: It owns the rights to the College Football Playoff. It can sell advertising on the rankings shows each Tuesday night. The event benefits from good matchups and big-market teams but must be fair and operate with integrity. The network is also a business partner of the SEC, Big 12, ACC and every other FBS league other than the Big Ten. (It's also not a partner with Notre Dame, it should be noted. But that's a whole other conspiracy theory.)

The likelihood of a grand conspiracy might be unlikely. The evidence might be circumstantial, the motivations curious. But it's going to be easy for fans to connect the dots of this year's Playoff field to larger storylines swirling around the sport.

Let's have some fun with the best ones:

The SEC and Big Ten Championship Games were built for a postseason that no longer exists. Having your two best teams — well, usually — crash into each other for 60 minutes while other Playoff contenders sit at home makes no sense.

Alabama looked awful against Georgia. It rushed for minus-3 yards. It didn't score until the third quarter, when Georgia already led 21-0.

And the Tide stayed put at No. 9.

That's fine. The committee has talked about not penalizing teams for playing games that others didn't have to play. But Alabama lost to the No. 3 team in the rankings by 21 points and stayed put, while BYU played the No. 4 team, lost by 27 and dropped below Notre Dame, who didn't play?

That's a pretty powerful 6 points.

Therein lies the theory: If playing in the game cost Alabama a spot in the bracket and cost the SEC a fifth team in the event, there would be lots of momentum to end or drastically reshape conference championship weekend. But it's a game built into the SEC's 10-year, $3 billion television rights agreement with ESPN, and it makes well into the eight digits for the conference.

Killing the game would be messy. It would affect that deal, possibly stripping ESPN of the most valuable individual game in its SEC television deal.

But Alabama wasn't touched. And though there might be complaining, it's unlikely there will be lots of momentum to change the event.

Duke upsetting Virginia in the ACC Championship Game put the committee in a bind. But it very conspicuously placed James Madison at No. 25 in last week's rankings, setting up a clear scenario for the game: Virginia would be in if it won. Duke almost certainly would be out if it won.

Keeping Miami out of the field would have meant zero bids for the ACC, while the Sun Belt and American Conferences both put teams into the field. The ACC has already had a brutal few years. The Florida State snub in 2023 ignited debate about the viability of the league in the new world of college football. Florida State and Clemson have been loudly saber-rattling about leaving the league and in March, settled litigation against the league with lowered exit fees and a changed revenue distribution model that benefited teams who win on the field.

When the 12-team Playoff was designed, it seemed almost impossible for a major conference to be left out. But it could have happened this year, and it took a late reversal from the committee on how it viewed idle Miami and Notre Dame.

Every power conference would struggle with an existential crisis if it missed the field in the four-team era. The ACC would have endured the longest offseason ever.

And having a Playoff without one of the major conferences represented would reflect poorly on the sport.

Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said it would be a “disservice to the sport” to leave out Texas because it played Ohio State and lost. He also said any future nonconference matchups would be “up for discussion.”

It was a fair point, even if there's another side to the coin: There's a huge upside to winning big nonconference matchups. They usually go a long way with the committee, which traditionally looks down on teams that schedule a plate of cupcakes in nonconference play.

That was the other layer to the Miami-Notre Dame debate. It's one thing for Texas to be left out of the Playoff because it lost on the road to Ohio State. But Miami played Notre Dame, won, and could be left out of the Playoff in favor of the Irish anyway?

Cue an offseason of “why play the games” debate.

The committee seemed poised to make that a reality until switching the two teams in the final rankings. It got it right in the end, but inflicted the most pain possible on Notre Dame in the process.

Duke's players and coaches were adamant after beating Virginia on Saturday night: They deserved to make the field. Manny Diaz ripped the quality of the Sun Belt compared to the ACC. He's not wrong. But the ACC putting forth a five-loss champion with losses to Illinois (by 26 points), Tulane, Georgia Tech, UConn, and Virginia put the committee in an impossible position.

The committee seemed to make its choice last week, placing James Madison at No. 25 in the penultimate ranking to set the table for the Dukes to be placed in the field ahead of Duke.

Whether James Madison belonged in the Top 25 is more questionable. There will be detractors who look at the lopsided betting lines for Tulane (+17.5) at Ole Miss and James Madison (+21.5) at Oregon and argue they don't belong. But the committee clearly felt more comfortable choosing a one-loss Group of 6 champion (whose only loss was close to eight-win Louisville) over a five-loss ACC champion that reached the title game by winning a five-way tiebreaker.

M. Night Shamalayan would be proud.

The weekly Playoff rankings reveal doesn't need to exist. I'm glad it does. It provides entertaining fodder for discussion. But it exists for no other reason than to provide ESPN with a compelling piece of content on Tuesday nights in the fall when there's little alternative.

It's a television show. And every show needs a compelling season finale, right?

In 2023, there was the Florida State plot twist.

This year, the committee told us week after week it believed Notre Dame was better than Miami. It was somewhat defensible in the first rankings. Notre Dame looked like a wrecking ball. Miami had just lost to SMU. There were eight spots between them.

Week by week, Miami crept closer. Last month, the committee finally compared them in the same pod. If there was a convenient, understandable time to flip them, that was it. Instead, it kept Notre Dame ahead, separated by just one team: BYU.

Then, with Notre Dame feeling confident and safely in the vast majority of mock brackets, the committee pulled a switcheroo. Notre Dame AD Pete Bevacqua told ESPN it felt like they had the rug pulled out from under them.

It's hard to disagree. But it was great TV. And if you choose to believe in this theory, how could anyone argue?

A Yale senior was brutally stabbed to death 27 years ago today, and the crime remains unsolved. On the anniversary of Suzanne Jovin's death, advocates continue to keep the cold case at the forefront.

Right by the corner of Edgehill and East Rock roads is where Suzanne Jovin's body was found. The murder remains unsolved and is one of Connecticut's most well-known cold cases.

Nancy Dennett has lived on East Rock Road for more than 40 years, recalling the murder case that's mystified the neighborhood for the last 27.

“I was here, in that room. I didn't see anything, didn't hear anything,” Dennett said. “I think there is a lot to it that we don't know. Someone knows it and isn't saying, so what can we do? We've got to find that person.”

Scientists hunted dark matter and solar neutrinos with one of the largest experiments yet. While the neutrinos likely appeared, dark matter results couldn't be confirmed.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A record-breaking investigation, using a particle detector a mile underground in South Dakota, may have revealed new insights about dark matter, the mysterious substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe.

Using the largest dataset of its kind, the experiment — called LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) — constrained the potential properties of one of the leading candidates for dark matter with unprecedented sensitivity. The research did not uncover any evidence of the mysterious substance, but will help future studies avoid false detections and better hone in on this poorly understood piece of the universe.

""This quest is to try to solve this huge problem, this huge missing piece that we have in terms of understanding our universe,"" Rick Gaitskell, head of the particle astrophysics group at Brown University and part of the LZ research team, told Live Science.

The results, released Monday (Dec. 8), have been submitted to the journal Physical Review Letters and are available as a preprint via arXiv. The results were also presented at a scientific talk at the Sanford Underground Research Facility, where LZ's detector is hosted.

The team had two goals for the new study: to elucidate the properties of a low-mass ""flavor"" of proposed dark-matter particles called weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), and to see if the detector could view solar neutrinos — nearly mass-less subatomic particles produced by nuclear reactions inside the sun. The team suspected that the detection signature of these particles could be similar to that predicted by certain models of dark matter, but needed to spot the solar neutrinos to know for sure.

 




Before the experiment, which took 417 days to perform between March 2023 and April 2025, the detector's sensitivity was upgraded to search for rare interactions with fundamental particles. A cylindrical chamber filled with liquid xenon was the theater for action. Researchers could watch for either WIMPs or neutrinos colliding with the xenon, either of which produces flashes of photons, along with positively charged electrons.

The experiment pushed forward the science for both the WIMP and neutrino questions. For the neutrinos, researchers improved their confidence that a type of solar neutrino, known as boron-8, is actually interacting with the xenon. This knowledge will help future studies avoid false detections of dark matter.

Physics discoveries typically must reach a confidence level called ""5 sigma"" to be considered valid. The new work achieved 4.5 sigma — a considerable improvement over sub-3-sigma results reported in two detectors last year. And that was especially notable given that boron-8 detections happen only about once a month in the detector, even when monitoring 10 tons of xenon, Gaitskell said.

As for the dark matter question, however, the researchers didn't find anything definitive for the low-mass types of WIMPs they were seeking. Scientists would have known it if they saw it, the team said; if a WIMP hits the heart of a xenon molecule, the energy of the collision creates a distinctive signature, as best as models predict.

""If you take a nucleus, it is possible for dark matter to come in and actually simultaneously scatter from the entire nucleus and cause it to recoil,"" Gaitskell explained. ""It's known as a coherent scatter. It has a particular signature in the xenon. So it's those coherent, nuclear recoils that we're looking for.""

The team did not detect this signature in their experiment.

Another, longer run will begin in 2028, when the detector is expected to collect results for a record-breaking 1,000 days. Longer runs give researchers a better chance of catching rare events.

The detector will hunt not only for more solar neutrino or WIMP interactions but also other physics that may fall outside the Standard Model of particle physics said to describe most of the environment around us.

—Ghostly galaxy without dark matter baffles astronomers

—Mysterious glow at the Milky Way's center could reshape a major cosmic theory

Gaitskell emphasized that the role of science is to keep pushing forward even when ""negative"" results arise.

""One thing I've learned is, don't ever assume that nature does things in the way that you think it should, exactly,"" said Gaitskell, who has been studying dark matter for more than four decades.

""There are plenty of elegant [solutions] that you would say, 'That's so beautiful. It has to be true.' And we tested them … and it turned out, nature ignored it and nature did not want to go down that particular route.""

President Donald Trump announced Monday that his administration is doling out a $12 billion aid package to farmers who have been squeezed by a trade war between the U.S. and its top economic partners.

The funds will come from U.S. tariff revenues, Trump said during a roundtable event at the White House.

Most of that money — up to $11 billion — will go to the U.S. Agriculture Department's new Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which will provide one-time payments to row crop farmers, a White House official told CNBC earlier Monday.

The remaining $1 billion will be reserved as the USDA evaluates changing market conditions, according to the official.

The president was joined at the event by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, as well as members of Congress and farmers who raise cattle and grow corn, cotton, sorghum, soybean, rice, wheat and potatoes.

Democratic lawmakers slammed the administration ahead of the announcement.

""Trump wants credit for trying to fix a mess of his making,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in an X post.

""Trump's tariffs are hammering our farmers, making it more expensive to grow food and pushing farmers into bankruptcy,"" he wrote. ""Farmers need markets to sell to—not a consolation prize for the ones he wrecked.""

""Trump's plan to bail out farmers won't even get agriculture communities back to even,"" Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the Senate Finance Committee's top-ranking Democrat, said in a statement. ""They're still paying more for fertilizer, equipment and seeds, while grown-in-the-USA farm goods are facing more obstacles than ever in foreign markets.""

The administration is framing the money as ""bridge payments"" that will help farmers weather the period between the U.S. abandoning former President Joe Biden's economic policies and Trump's current agenda kicking in.

But some in America's agriculture industry say they are suffering as a result of the wide-ranging trade war — especially due to conflicts with China, a major U.S. customer.

China stopped buying U.S. soybeans for several months, most notably during the key harvest season beginning in the fall.

Beijing resumed purchasing some soybeans in late October as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping neared a tentative trade truce. But China's imports of the crop do not appear to be rebounding to their current levels, and Beijing's stockpiles have swelled to recent highs.

Bessent has maintained that China is on track to meet its projected purchase of 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of February. The administration has previously said that Beijing would hit the 12 million ton mark during the last two months of the year, and that it would buy at least 25 million tons of soybeans in each of the next three years. 

China bought nearly 27 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in 2024.

""Farmers suffered for years under Joe Biden, who increased the United States' trade deficit to over $1.2 trillion, raised input costs, pushed woke DEI agricultural policies, and more,"" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told CNBC in a statement ahead of Monday's aid announcement.

""In contrast, President Trump is helping our agriculture industry by negotiating new trade deals to open new export markets for our farmers and boosting the farm safety net for the first time in a decade,"" Kelly said.

""Today's announcement reflects the President's commitment to helping our farmers, who will have the support they need to bridge the gap between Biden's failures and the President's successful policies taking effect.""

            • Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has emphasized the importance of “unity” after arriving in London for a meeting with European leaders at Downing Street in a show of solidarity. He is expected in Brussels and Rome later today.
    


            •  The summit comes after US President Donald Trump claimed Zelensky had not yet read the latest US proposal to end the war, adding he was a “little disappointed” in the Ukrainian leader. Talks in Miami between US and Ukrainian negotiators came to a halt Saturday with no breakthrough, according to Ukrainian officials.
    


            • Meanwhile, Russia has praised the US' new national security strategy, released last week. It took an confrontational posture toward Europe, blaming officials on the continent for blocking US-backed efforts to end the conflict.
    


At this point, our live coverage of today's talks, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine has finished. You can read the latest here. 



            Here's what we know about today's talks between the leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine and the United Kingdom now they've ended for the day.
    


            During the gathering, the leaders worked on “complementing” the US' plan for an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, according to a statement published by the French Presidency.
    


            It comes after a weekend of diplomacy between Europe, Kyiv, and Washington, DC, which itself ended without any significant breakthroughs.
    


            Yesterday, Donald Trump Jr. suggested that US President Donald Trump “may” walk away from Ukraine peace efforts, while Trump himself said he was “a little bit disappointed” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing him of not having read the latest US peace proposal.
    


            As we end today's coverage, here are some key quotes from the opening remarks of the meeting in London earlier:
    


                    “I think there are a lot of what we have to discuss… things which are very important for today. I think unity between Europe and Ukraine and also unity between Europe, Ukraine and the United States. There are some things which we can't manage without Americans, things which we can't manage without Europe, and that's why we need to make some important decisions.”
                





                    “We are still and remain strongly behind Ukraine and giving support to your country because we all know that the destiny of this country is the destiny of Europe.”
                





                    “We stand here to support you in the conflict and support you in the negotiations and make sure that this is a just and lasting settlement, if we can get that far.”
                





                    “I think the main issue is the convergence between our common positions - Europeans and Ukrainians, and the US - to finalize these peace negotiations and engage a new phase in the best possible conditions for Ukraine, for the Europeans, and for our collective security.”
                





CNN's Joseph Ataman contributed to this reporting.



            French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz departed 10 Downing Street in London, just a short while ago.
    


            As the leaders left after today's talks, Macron embraced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with handshakes and a hug.
    


            Zelensky then joined British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in returning to Downing Street.
    


            You can scroll below to see remarks the leaders made earlier today.
    


            Europe has “a lot of cards in (its) hands” when it comes to negotiations for an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron said a little while ago, during the opening remarks of a meeting with the leaders of the United Kingdom, Germany and Ukraine.
    


            “We all support Ukraine. And we all support peace and peace negotiations to have a sustainable, robust peace,” Macron said.
    


            He said cards in Europe's favor included the impact of European and US sanctions on Russia's economy, which was “starting to suffer” and the “fact that Ukraine is resisting in this war.”
    


            The European Union, US and UK established extensive sanctions regimes  against Russia in response to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Britain's foreign office has estimated that these sanctions have “deprived the Russian state of at least $450 billion in war funds between February 2022 and June 2025.”
    


                    Going forward, Macron said earlier, “I think the main issue is the convergence between our common positions - Europeans and Ukrainians, and the US - to finalize these peace negotiations and engage a new phase in the best possible conditions for Ukraine, for the Europeans, and for our collective security.”
                





            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has also just spoken in London. He said he was “skeptical” about some of the details he has seen in the US' proposal for an end to Russia's war in Ukraine.
    


            Speaking during the opening remarks of a meeting with the leaders of France, the United Kingdom and Ukraine in Downing Street, Merz said that the upcoming days “could be a decisive time for all of us.”
    


            While Europe is “trying to continue (its) support for Ukraine… on the other hand, we are seeing these talks and negotiations in Moscow and in the US,” Merz said, referencing recent discussions between US and Kremlin officials in the Russian capital last week, as well as talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators in Miami this weekend.
    


            Merz said he was looking forward to hearing about the outcome of these talks, stressing that Germany remains “strongly behind Ukraine… because we all know that the destiny of this country is the destiny of Europe.”
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also said his country stands with Ukraine, but struck a wary tone when mentioning a potential end to the war.
    


            “If there's to be a ceasefire, it needs to be a just and lasting ceasefire,” he said, reiterating that “matters about Ukraine are for Ukraine.”
    


                    Addressing Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, Starmer added: “We stand here to support you in the conflict and support you in the negotiations and make sure that this is a just and lasting settlement if we can get that far.”
                





            We can bring you remarks now from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who's currently in London.
    


            He emphasized the importance of unity between Ukraine, Europe and the United States when he joined British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz while speaking in Downing Street.
    


            Sitting alongside some of Ukraine's allies, Zelensky said the leaders intend to discuss “very important” things, namely the relationship between their nations and the US.
    


            Zelensky said that “unity between Europe and Ukraine, and also between Europe, Ukraine and the United States,” is of key importance to the ongoing negotiations.
    


            “We can't manage without the US … We can't manage without Europe,” he added.
    


            “That's why we need to make some important decisions,” the Ukrainian leader said, before thanking Starmer for organizing the meeting, and expressing gratitude to Macron and Merz for their attendance.
    


            Russian forces continue to edge forward in several parts of the frontline in Ukraine — but have failed to complete the capture of several towns they have been attacking for months.
    


            Russian troops have expanded the buffer zone they occupy around Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region, according to the head of the Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, quoted by the official Russian news agency TASS.
    


            On Sunday, the Russian Defense ministry said its troops had captured the settlement of Rivne, immediately east of Pokrovsk.
    


            One Ukrainian commander, Brigadier General Yevhen Lasiychu, ackowledged at the weekend that the situation in Pokrovsk was difficult. “Enemy units are constantly carrying out offensive actions,” he said.
    


            Ukrainian troops were though “in complete control of the northern part. Our units are in the central part of the city, preventing the enemy from advancing,” he added.
    


            In the north, Russia is conducting air strikes against Ukrainian supply lines some 40 kilometers (25 miles) behind the frontlines in Kharkiv region “likely to disrupt Ukrainian logistics to eventually facilitate battlefield gains,” according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
    


            But they are yet to capture the town of Kupiansk, according to ISW, even though they claim to hold it.
    


            In the south, the Russian Defense ministry said it had taken another village close to the town of Orikhiv in Zaporizhzhia region.
    


            Russian forces also intensified strikes against bridges in the region, where they have advanced towards the town of Huliaipole, some 80 kilometers from the regional capital, according to ISW.
    


            Russia needs to gain an understanding of the latest round of negotiations between the US and Ukraine on ending the war, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.
    


            Speaking to journalists today, Peskov said it was also “clear that the parties now understand better that the work must be done in silence. Such work absolutely cannot be conducted publicly. It's unconstructive and doesn't produce results.”
    


            “We don't know exactly what the differences of opinion are,” Peskov added, after US President Donald Trump claimed his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky has yet to read the US peace plan.
    


            Peskov also welcomed the new US national security strategy laid out by the White House last week.
    


            The strategy was deeply critical of Europe, saying that the US wealthy allies “must assume primary responsibility for their regions and contribute far more to our collective defense.”
    


            It also prioritized “re-establishing conditions of stability within Europe and strategic stability with Russia.”
    


            “The nuance we see in the new concept certainly appeals to us. It speaks of the need for dialogue and building constructive, good relations,” Peskov said.
    


                    “We understand that by eliminating these current bilateral irritants, we could have the opportunity to restore our relations and bring them out of their rather deep crisis,” he added.
                


                    Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov
                


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said territorial issues are among those yet to be resolved in talks between Ukrainian and US officials over the Trump administration's peace plan.
    


            Speaking today before his arrival at Downing Street in the last 30 minutes, Zelensky told Bloomberg News that elements of the US plan required further discussion, including “sensitive issues” such as security guarantees for Ukraine and control over its eastern regions.
    


            His remarks followed a claim by President Donald Trump yesterday that he was “a little bit disappointed that President Zelensky hasn't yet read the proposal — that was as of a few hours ago.”
    


            Zelensky said the talks with the US had yet to reach agreement on the future of Ukraine's Donbas, which includes the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
    


                    “There are visions of the US, Russia and Ukraine — and we don't have a unified view on Donbas,” he said.
                





            He said that Kyiv also wanted a separate agreement on security guarantees from Western allies, above all the US.
    


            “There is one question I — and all Ukrainians — want to get an answer to: if Russia again starts a war, what will our partners do,” Zelenskiy said.
    


                    “There are questions that concern Europe — and we cannot decide for Europe. We need to discuss with Europe Ukraine's membership in the EU, which is also part of security guarantees,” the Ukrainian leader added.
                





            Zelensky added that he was ready to fly to the US “if the president is ready for such a meeting.”
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has now arrived at 10 Downing Street, the official residence of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, following the arrivals of the leaders of France and Germany.
    


As we've reported, Zelensky is expected to talk with Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz about the current status of negotiations to end Russia's war in Ukraine.
    


            Zelensky posed for photographs and shook hands with Starmer before entering the building.
    


            In a post to Telegram after his arrival in the United Kingdom, Zelensky said that he will be participating in “scheduled meetings and coordination talks with our European partners.”
    


                    “We are joining forces to end this war with a dignified peace for Ukraine. Security must be guaranteed,” Zelensky said.
                





            French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have now greeted each other at the entrance of Downing Street, after the French leader arrived for talks with fellow European leaders today over steps towards ending the war in Ukraine.
    


            Like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who arrived a few minutes earlier, Macron did not respond to several questions shouted at him by a reporter.
    


Some context: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to join the leaders in Downing Street today, after talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Miami to end the war ended with unresolved questions over security guarantees, territorial issues and continued concern that the US proposal tilts in Russia's favor.
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has just arrived at 10 Downing Street, the official residence of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, where European leaders are set to discuss the status of negotiations to end to Russia's war in Ukraine.
    


            He was greeted by Starmer at the entrance to the building, where the pair shook hands. Merz did not respond to a question shouted at him by a reporter.
    


            It's set to be a busy day of diplomacy for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is due to be meeting with European leaders in London soon, as we've reported.
    


            On top of that visit, separate statements from NATO and the Municipality of Rome also say that they are expecting him to be in both Belgium and Italy later today.
    


            NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, President of the European Council, António Costa and President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, are set to meet with Zelensky at Rutte's official residence in Brussels, NATO said.
    


            Then this evening local time, Zelensky is expected in Rome, according to the city's municipality.
    


            He will meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni tomorrow afternoon, the country's government said.
    


            Turning now to the battlefield in Ukraine, where at least ten civilians were killed and 38 people injured in Russian attacks over the past 24 hours, according to authorities.
    


            The region with the most victims was Kharkiv in the northeast, where five people were killed and 11 people were injured, according to Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region military administration.
    


            Here's what we know about the number of victims in each region:
    


Today's meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders is due to take place in the next few hours in London.
    


            In the meantime, let's take a look at the key diplomatic developments we've been reporting in the last 24 hours, following talks between Ukrainian and US officials over the weekend.
    


            • Three days of talks between Ukraine and the US came to an end on Saturday, with Ukrainian Ambassador to the US, Olga Stefanishyna, saying the main challenges remain “questions of territory and guarantees.”
    


            • US President Donald Trump said he was “a little bit disappointed” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after the talks, accusing the Ukrainian leader of not having read the latest US peace proposal.
    


            • Speaking separately in Doha, Donald Trump Jr. hinted his father could walk away from the talks, adding that “what's unique about my father is, you don't know what he's going to do.”
    


            •  Meanwhile, the Kremlin welcomed the Trump administration's new national security strategy, which adopts an unprecedentedly hardened posture towards Europe. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov applauded the “adjustments” as “consistent with [Russia's] vision.”
    


            The Netherlands will provide Ukraine with a further $815 million (€700 million) in military assistance in the first three months of next year, the Dutch government said today.
    


            The Dutch had pledged €3.5 billion euros in support for next year, but part of that money has already been spent this year.
    


            Last week, the Netherlands said it would contribute another €250 million euros to Ukraine's air-defense capabilities.
    


            Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said the funds would be used to purchase American-made weapons and F-16 munitions through the US Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), a program that allows countries to supply urgently needed military equipment directly from U.S. stockpiles.
    


            For context: The Netherlands announcement of further support comes as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as we've reported.
    


            People in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv face 16 hours without power today due to scheduled power cuts caused by major Russian attacks on the nation's energy infrastructure.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has scheduled the outages across the country. A feature of Ukrainian life since October, they are scheduled at varying intensities and were introduced into all regions yesterday.
    


            Russia has launched more than 1,600 attack drones, around 1,200 guided aerial bombs and nearly 70 missiles against Ukraine in the first week of December, Zelensky said yesterday, adding that Russia's primary objective is to target the infrastructure “that keeps everyday life going.”
    


            One schedule for a Kyiv apartment block seen by CNN advises residents that electricity will be available for less than four hours in the morning, between 8 am and 11.30 a.m. local time (1 am - 4.30 a.m. ET)  before switching off for most of the day and returning for less than four hours in the evening between 6.30 pm and 10 p.m. local time (11.30 a.m. - 3 p.m. ET.)
    


            As we await today's meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a number of European leaders in London, here's what we can tell you about who is expected to be in attendance.
    


            Zelensky is set to meet with the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany - known collectively as the E3 - in the next couple of hours. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will be at Downing Street for the talks.
    


            The gathering is a show of solidarity following the release of the US' new national security strategy, which blames European officials for blocking American-backed efforts to end Russia's war in Ukraine and assumes a more confrontational posture towards Europe as a whole.
    


            Macron said over the weekend that the leaders will “take stock of the situation and the ongoing negotiations within the framework of the US mediation.”
    


                    “France is determined to work with all partners to secure de-escalation measures and to impose a ceasefire,” he posted on X, referencing “the recent discussions between the Ukrainians and the Americans.”
                





            “Europeans will necessarily be a key pillar of the just and lasting solution we are collectively building,” he said.
    


CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this reporting.



            Donald Trump Jr. suggested that President Donald Trump “may” walk away from Ukraine peace efforts over repeated allegations of corruption against several close allies of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    


            Giving his reaction to CNN's Fredricka Whitfield yesterday, Rep. Seth Moulton, a Democrat on the Ukrainian Caucus, said doing so would “be a gift to our adversaries.”
    


            More now from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who has praised US President Donald Trump's new national security strategy - as we've reported - for aligning with some of Moscow's own views.
    


                    “The current administration is fundamentally different from previous ones, and of course President Trump is strong now. Strong in terms of his domestic political position, and this gives him the opportunity to make adjustments in accordance with his own vision,” Peskov told pool reporter Pavel Zarubin yesterday.
                





            “The adjustments we are seeing, I would say, are, in many ways, consistent with our vision,” he said.
    


For context: In the 33-page document outlining the national security vision, the Trump administration sharply criticized Europe's approach to handling security, the economy, and migration.
    


            The change in the US's stance could be a “modest guarantee” that the administration will continue working with Russia to resolve the war in Ukraine, Peskov said.
    


            He also suggested that the so-called “deep state” could prevent Trump's plans from taking shape.
    


            “Therefore, of course, one needs to monitor very closely how this concept will be implemented,” Peskov said.

Bruna Ferreira, who was released from ICE custody Monday on bond, denies claims that she's an absentee parent

The Brazilian-born mother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's nephew – who was recently detained by US immigration authorities – has rejected the Trump administration's characterizations of her as an absentee parent.

Bruna Ferreira, who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in November during a traffic stop in Massachusetts and was being held at a Louisiana detention center, said in an interview with the Washington Post that the White House's statements that she had never lived with her son or spoken with Leavitt “in many years” were incorrect.

Ferreira, 33, had a relationship with Leavitt's brother, 35-year-old Michael Leavitt. They had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, now aged 11.

She said she was offended by the White House's characterizations, calling them “disgusting”. She said she takes her son to Dave & Buster's, a food and video games chain; ferries him to school, cheers at sports games; and fills his bedroom with “everything a young boy needs”.

Ferreira told the Post that she also “moved mountains” to ensure her son could attend Karoline Leavitt's wedding to real estate developer Nicholas Riccio in early January. Ferreira also said she approved her son to attend the White House Easter egg hunt in the spring.

“I asked Karoline to be godmother [to Michael Jr] over my only sister,” she told the Post. “I made a mistake there, in trusting.

“Why they're creating this narrative is beyond my wildest imagination.”

The differentiated accounts came as Ferreira was released on a $1,500 bond on Monday after immigration judge Cynthia Goodman ordered that she be freed on the lowest-dollar bail possible, according to her lawyers. Attorney Jason Thomas told the judge that the government's characterization of his client was “both unfair and untrue”.

A lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not object to Ferreira's release and said he agreed with her lawyers that she was not a danger to society or a flight risk, the Washington Post reported.

A DHS spokesperson confirmed Ferreira's detention in November followed a prior arrest for battery. The DHS spokesperson said the tourist visa with which Ferreira gained entry into the US required her to leave on 6 June 1999.

Ferreira came to the US from Brazil with her family when she was six years old. DHS officials have not produced records relating to her alleged arrest for battery.

Ferreira's lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, told the Post his client had no criminal record, with immigration authorities possibly alluding to an incident when she was summoned to juvenile court after a fight outside a Dunkin' Donuts over $8 in 2008. Pomerleau said the case was dismissed and did not amount to criminality because Ferreira, then 16, was a juvenile.

She told the outlet that she had met the elder Michael Leavitt at a nightclub. They fell in love, got engaged, had a child, and lived together – but instead of marrying they broke up in 2015 and have since shared parenting responsibilities.

Ferreira has alleged in court documents that her son's father had threatened in the past to try to get her deported. Leavitt, in a text exchange with the Post, denied seeking to have her deported.

“I had no involvement in her being picked up by ice,” he reportedly wrote on Wednesday to the outlet. “I have no control over that and had no involvement in that whatsoever.” He also said that he wanted their son “to have a relationship with his mother as I always have shown that”.

Ferreira told the Post that other potential deportees in the detention center had questioned her about her relationship with the White House press secretary, including asking: “Did she not like you?”

“Your guess is as good as mine,” Ferreira said she responded.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russia's Investigative Committee issued an international arrest warrant on Dec. 5 for Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, according to his Dec. 7 statement on Facebook.

Russia has accused Brovdi in absentia of organizing an alleged terrorist attack in Russia's Kursk Oblast that killed Anna Prokofieva, a military correspondent for the pro-Kremlin Channel One, on March 26.

""But remember, worms, in your own swampy language: 'Annushka has already spilled the oil,'"" Brovdi wrote on Facebook, referencing a work by Kyiv-born Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov.

Drawn from Bulgakov's ""The Master and Margarita,"" the phrase ""Annushka has already spilled the oil"" evokes the sense that fate is sealed and its consequences inevitable.

Russia regularly issues arrest warrants for citizens of countries it labels ""unfriendly,"" including last year's warrants for President Volodymyr Zelensky and former President Petro Poroshenko. Both Ukrainian officials were later removed from the Russian Interior Ministry's wanted list.

This is not the first time other countries have imposed restrictions on the Ukrainian commander. Hungary, whose government remains one of the few in Europe to preserve close relations with Russia, banned Brovdi from entering the country in August.

The ban came after Brovdi, who has Hungarian roots, confirmed that the Unmanned Systems Forces had struck the Druzhba oil pipeline, a key route supplying Russian oil to Europe, including Hungary.

Within this program, 300 million euros ($350 million) will fund a dedicated Ukraine Support Instrument that focuses on modernizing Ukraine's defense industry and integrating it into the EU's broader defense-manufacturing network.

The Air Force did not specify what mission the pilot was carrying out when the death occurred. The circumstances of the pilot's death are being investigated.

The Dec. 5 attack sparked a large fire at the Temryuk Seaport, a facility that handles various types of cargo, including liquefied natural gas used to supply the Russian military. 

The leaders of Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden said that they ""strongly support"" the so-called reparations loan.

The move follows an appeal from the parliament to release an additional 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in support for Kyiv for next year. The first sum of 700 million euros (almost $820 million) was described as the ""first step.""

Four Russian soldiers were given sentences in the range of 1.5 to 12 years for their involvement in the murder of Russell ""Texas"" Bentley and an attempt to conceal the crime.

Russia has accused Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi in absentia of organizing an alleged terrorist attack in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Congress is also calling for more frequent reporting of aid provided to Kyiv by its European allies, reflecting Washington's push for Europe to take on a greater share of responsibility for supporting Ukraine.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Dec. 7 he was ""disappointed"" that President Volodymyr Zelensky allegedly had not yet reviewed a U.S. peace proposal to end the war in Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Federal officers from ICE and other agencies stand guard during an immigration raid of a home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Nov. 25.Tim Evans/Reuters

A sweeping immigration crackdown in the United States is increasingly ensnaring Canadians who don't have criminal records – including at least six children – new U.S. government data show. 

An estimated 207 Canadians have now been held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody at some point since January, when President Donald Trump took office. The total number of Canadians held in 2024 was 130.

Earlier this year, an initial Globe and Mail analysis revealed that ICE had detained two Canadian toddlers in May at a remote facility in Texas. The analysis also showed that Canadians held by ICE were more likely to have criminal records than many other nationalities swept up in the White House's mass deportation campaign, which has primarily targeted immigrants from Latin America. 

In the first half of 2025, almost 70 per cent of Canadians placed in immigration detention had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. 

Now, a growing number of Canadian detainees are being held on immigration violations alone, updated enforcement data covering late July to mid-October show.

Canadians say they are struggling to get information on relatives in ICE detention

Of the Canadians detained during this period, some 44 per cent had no criminal records or pending charges against them, The Globe has found. The detainees include four children ranging in age from under two years old to about 16 years old.

“It's very emblematic of how arbitrary the system in the United States has become,” said Sharry Aiken, a professor at Queen's University Faculty of Law.

“It should give all Canadians pause about travelling to the United States right now, because it basically tells us that there's a real risk.”

In a statement to The Globe, Charlotte MacLeod, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, said the department is “aware of multiple cases of Canadians currently in immigration-related detention in the U.S. and has received requests for information and assistance from individuals and their family members.”

Ms. MacLeod said Canadian officials “maintain frequent and ongoing engagement with U.S. counterparts related to Canadians in immigration-related detention, including at detention centres related to individual cases” and offer consular assistance to detainees.

However, the Canadian government “cannot intervene on behalf of Canadians who do not meet entry or exit requirements for the United States,” Ms. MacLeod said.

Canadian refugee applicant held by ICE says he crossed border by accident – now Canada won't take him back

The anonymized ICE data disclose details about thousands of detention cases dating back to 2023, including detainees' nationality, year of birth, time in custody and the reason for the detention. The information was obtained through a federal district-court lawsuit against ICE brought by the Deportation Data Project, which is run by a group of academics and lawyers in the U.S.

As previously reported by The Globe, two Canadian toddlers were detained by ICE in May at the South Texas Family Residential Center, which featured in a legal complaint alleging inadequate drinking water, medical care and legal assistance at the facility earlier this year. 

One of the children was detained for 51 days, more than double the 20-day limit imposed by a court-ordered legal agreement governing the protection of migrant children in detention in the U.S. Both of those children, who appear to have been accompanied by adults of other nationalities, have since been released under supervision.

Four additional Canadian children have been detained since late July. The data do not indicate when detainees are being held with other family members. But the Canadian children all showed matching book-in, transfer and release times with adults, suggesting they were accompanied by guardians. 

The accompanying adults were arrested on immigration offences only, and the data do not show a criminal history for them. 

Nearly 150 Canadians held in ICE custody this year, including two toddlers, data show

One of the Canadian children, a boy born in 2019, was detained in late September at a temporary hold room near the Quebec border before being transferred to the South Texas Family Residential Center. 

He was booked in at the same time as two adults from India and was still in detention as of mid-October, the data show. The trio were placed in expedited removal proceedings but were granted a credible-fear referral. This indicates a fear of persecution if they are deported and provides them with an additional screening process before removal. 

A Canadian girl, aged about 16, was held in detention at the same facility with an adult man from Mexico for around three weeks before being released on supervision. 

Two other Canadian children, arrested in late July and mid-September, have since been removed from the U.S. One child, who is around five years old, is described as having voluntarily departed to Romania with an adult in her 20s a week after being arrested in New Jersey. 

A toddler, born in 2024, was held for a day in a Memphis hold room with a Venezuelan woman before being deported. While the data do not disclose where the child was sent, the accompanying woman was removed to Venezuela.

Canadian company's armoured-vehicle production for ICE taking place in U.S.

Rights groups in the U.S. have raised significant concerns about due process for immigration detainees, particularly those who may have valid asylum claims, as Mr. Trump expands the use of expedited removals.

“People are being held in seriously egregious conditions with minors, who should never be in detention,” Prof. Aiken said. “They are being fast-tracked out of the country in a context that is not permitting them to obtain legal representation.”

ICE did not respond to questions from The Globe. 

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin previously told The Globe in a statement that the department takes its responsibility to protect children in immigration detention seriously and that “allegations of subprime conditions at these facilities are FALSE.”

Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise of mass deportation, and his administration has said its goal is to arrest 3,000 immigrants a day. Ms. McLaughlin has described the country's immigration crackdown as focusing on “worst of the worst – including gang members, pedophiles and rapists.” 

However, as of mid-November, almost three quarters of the country's 65,000 immigration detainees had no criminal convictions, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. That is a slight increase from earlier this year, when around 71 per cent had no criminal convictions.

Of Canadians held by ICE this year on immigration violations alone, most were detained for not having the required visa.

Non-citizens who have criminal records are more vulnerable to deportation, although there are some legal avenues for relief – for example, for those who are married to U.S. citizens. 

Around 56 per cent of Canadians detained by ICE since late July have pending criminal charges against them or have been convicted of a crime. Most are not accused of aggravated felonies, which typically bring the harshest repercussions under immigration law, such as being banned from re-entering the U.S. 

The detained Canadians had convictions for crimes ranging from wire fraud to sex assault, while others were convicted of shoplifting or drunk driving. At least two of those detained entered the U.S. as legal permanent residents, according to the data.

There were 56 Canadians actively in detention as of mid-October, including four at ICE's Krome facility in Florida. In June, a 49-year-old Canadian man, Johnny Noviello, died in ICE custody while being held at another complex in the state, the Federal Detention Center Miami.

A report published last week by Amnesty International on the Krome facility said its research team has identified issues with overcrowding, inadequate medical care, poor access to legal representation and “alarming disciplinary practices, including the use of prolonged solitary confinement.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","'America First' ― Donald Trump's new security strategy","https://www.dw.com/en/america-first-donald-trumps-new-security-strategy/a-75066190","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 17:10:57 GMT","

Donald Trump wants the US to increasingly prioritize itself over global conflicts in a stark change from recent decades. Though this is a reflection of his 'America First' mandate, it's not quite as simple as that.

It's long been a key slogan for Donald Trump, but 'America First' appears closer to reality than ever, after the release of a key US strategy document outlining the administration's foreign policy.

""In everything we do, we are putting America first,"" reads an introductory letter signed by the president in a recently-released 29-page document, titled 'National Security Strategy of the United States of America.'  

It sets out the US strategy as being ""pragmatic without being 'pragmatist,' realistic without being 'realist,' principled without being 'idealistic,' muscular without being 'hawkish,”'and restrained without being 'dovish.'”

The National Security Strategy (NSS) does not determine policy but rather sets out the government's foreign policy vision. It can, of course, be overtaken by world events. For example, as US foreign policy expert Andrew Payne points out, the 2022 version released during Joe Biden's tenure made no significant mention of the Middle East.

But the NSS has a clear impact on how government resources are allocated and gives foreign governments a steer on US intentions.

""Whether or not the administration itself follows the principles and priorities laid out here, it is about the best source available to policymakers overseas seeking clarity on the direction of travel of an administration that has so far been inconsistent and unpredictable,"" Payne, a research director at the international affairs think tank Chatham House told DW.

As well as plenty of self-congratulation and a rejection of traditional US foreign policy, Trump lays out a much stronger 'America First' blueprint than he did in his first NSS in 2017.

""After the end of the Cold War, American foreign policy elites convinced themselves that permanent American domination of the entire world was in the best interests of our country,"" the introduction states. ""Yet the affairs of other countries are our concern only if their activities directly threaten our interests.""

As such, the broad strokes of the strategy are a move away from American intervention abroad, multilateralism and international bodies, and towards national self-determination, at least where that suits the US.

The NSS calls for the US to have full control of its borders, the ""world's most powerful, lethal, and technologically advanced military"" and ""the most dynamic, most innovative, and most advanced economy"" as well as keeping a ""soft power"" grip across the world for its own gain.

In global terms, it calls for a ""Trump Corollary"" to the Monroe Doctrine, established in 1823 and concerned with self-determination for the US amid European intervention. It references preventing ""an adversarial power from dominating the Middle East"" and notes that ending the Russia-Ukraine war is a key goal, along with fighting drug trafficking in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, while calling for other nations to take on more of the burden in global matters.

The document also says Europe faces the ""prospect of civilizational erasure,"" that some European countries will be ""unrecognizable in 20 years or less"" and questions whether they are ""strong enough to remain reliable allies."" 

The overall message of American isolationism is not always consistently applied. The NSS calls for US ""preeminence"" in the Western Hemisphere, and Latin America in particular, stating that: ""We will reward and encourage the region's governments, political parties, and movements broadly aligned with our principles and strategy.""

While these strategic goals will not necessarily become policy, the explicit stating of them marks a sea change from the NSS released by Biden in 2022. Payne said it ""represents a fundamental and explicit rejection of the national security strategies that have been developed since at least the end of the Cold War,"" before adding that: ""It is clearest in what it is not: the traditional liberal internationalist orthodoxy that has sustained US grand strategy for decades.""

It is, naturally, closer to Trump's last attempt in 2017. But for Dr. Rubrick Biegon, an international relations lecturer at the Universtiy of Kent in England, that's consistent with the broader changes in his second term.

""It does seem in keeping with the kind of shifts from Trump to Trump 2.0. I think that the strategy document is closer to Trump's idiosyncratic worldview than the 2017 one,"" he told DW, adding that this was partly because ""Trump is more comfortable in his position this time around and has more of his own team around him, rather than establishment figures.""

In Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov welcomed the document as ""largely consistent with our vision"" and a ""positive step.""

Others in Europe were considerably more troubled. Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said the document ""places itself to the right of the extreme right"".

To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

The reaction from active European politicians has generally been to downplay the document. This is despite it doubling down on Trump's attacks on Europe at his UN speech earlier this year when he said: ""Europe is in serious trouble. They have been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody has ever seen before.""

Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said his country does not need ""outside advice"" after the NSS was released but that the US remained ""our most important ally in the [NATO] alliance"" before adding that: ""I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organization of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany.""

EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, struck a similar tone.

""I think we haven't always seen eye to eye on different topics, but I think the overall principle is still there,"" Kallas said. ""We are the biggest allies, and we should stick together.""

Corporations far beyond Starbucks want to keep baristas out of unions.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

Thousands of Starbucks workers across a hundred cities are nearly one month into an expanding, nationwide unfair labor practice strike in protest of the coffee giant's “historic union busting and failure to finalize a fair union contract,” according to Starbucks Workers United, the barista union that has spread to over 650 stores since its birth in Buffalo four years ago.

The strike comes after years of illegal anti-union antics by Starbucks and follows a historic $39 million settlement announced on December 1 for more than 500,000 labor violations committed by Starbucks management in New York City since 2021.

The rise of Starbucks Workers United has energized the U.S. labor movement, as the struggle to unionize the mega-chain represents far more than baristas pitted against managers: Starbucks is a trend-setting global powerhouse and one of the top U.S. employers. Current fights at places like Starbucks and Amazon will shape the labor movement for decades to come.

This is well understood by industry leaders, in no small part because of Starbucks's deep interlocks with major corporations across numerous sectors. At its highest levels of governance and management, Starbucks's closest industry ally may be Walmart, the top U.S. corporate employer and a long-time anti-union stalwart. Starbucks and Walmart, along with other corporations represented on Starbucks's board of directors, also support major industry groups that carry out the retail and service sectors' wider agenda of weakening unions.

Moreover, while Starbucks positions itself as a leader on climate and sustainability, it recently brought a longtime board director of oil giant Chevron onto its board, a move that lends legitimacy to accusations of hypocrisy leveled by baristas against the company. 

All told, striking baristas are not merely up against the executives of a coffee store behemoth, but a broader constellation of corporate power fully networked into Starbucks's top leadership. 

In September 2024, Starbucks hired Brian Niccol as its new CEO — its fourth since 2022. Starbucks sales were stagnant, and Niccol, who had been Chipotle's CEO since 2018, had a reputation as a successful food service executive. Starbucks's stock shot up a record 24 percent with the news of Niccol's hiring.

Under his watch at Chipotle, the company paid $240,000 to workers who sought to unionize a shop in Augusta, Maine, that the company shuttered, and Chipotle was accused of withholding raises from unionizing workers in Lansing, Michigan.

Nearly 500 Starbucks stores had unionized by the time Niccol took over. The new Starbucks's CEO emphasized boosting sales at stores and promised “high-quality handcrafted beverage[s] to our cafe customers in four minutes or less” — experienced by baristas as speed-ups and surveillance.

Niccol's total compensation package last year as Starbucks CEO was an astounding $95.8 million. The AFL-CIO ranked Niccol as the fifth-highest paid CEO of 2024, and Starbucks's 2024 CEO-to-worker pay ratio was an astronomical 6,666-to-1.

Niccol's also garnered controversy — and the ire of baristas — for accepting a company-paid remote office in Newport Beach, California, and commuting 1,000 miles on Starbucks's corporate jet to its Seattle headquarters.

The highest governing body over Starbucks — which hired Niccol and can fire him — is the company's board of directors. Mirroring the CEO turnover, the majority of Starbucks's board is today composed of new faces compared to just a few years ago. 

For the prior 20 years, the Starbucks board had been anchored by Mellody Hobson, who also sits on the board of JPMorgan Chase, the U.S.'s top bank, and is married to billionaire filmmaker George Lucas.

Today, the major corporate ties represented on Starbucks's board through current or recent past executive or director positions cut across industries, from telecoms (T-Mobile and AT&T) to tech (YouTube and Yahoo), agriculture (Land O' Lakes) to apparel (Nike), hotels (Hilton) to finance (BlackRock), and much more. The board also reflects Starbuck's global scope, with representatives from prominent companies in China (Alibaba), Latin America (Grupo Bimbo), and Europe (LEGO). 

Starbucks's leadership has a close alliance with another anti-union retail powerhouse: Walmart.

Most notably, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is simultaneously a board director of Walmart. Niccol joined Walmart's board in June 2024, replacing Rob Walton, the son of Walmart founder Sam Walton who had served on the company's board for over three decades, mostly as its chairman.

But that's not the only Walmart connection: Starbucks board director Marissa A. Mayer, who became a Starbucks board director in June 2025, has sat on the retail giant's board since 2012. Niccol was compensated with $274,973 by Walmart in 2025, and Mayer made $299,973. Mayer currently owns 129,642 shares of Starbucks stock, worth around $11 million.

As Walmart directors, Niccol and Mayer are swimming among the heights of billionaire power. The Walton family — who effectively owns Walmart with a 45 percent company stake — is worth $267 billion, and two Walton family members sit on Walmart's board, including its chairman Greg Penner, who is married to Carrie Walton Penner, the daughter of Rob Walton.

Additionally, Mellody Hobson — again, who left the Starbucks board just a few months ago after a 20 year stint — is also part of the Walton-Penner Family Ownership Group that purchased the National Football League's Denver Broncos in 2022.

Like Starbucks, Walmart is notorious for its union busting and ability to hold down the wage floor, though its wages have risen in recent years as it was “in the crosshairs of labor activists” and trying to reduce employee turnover, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

Just recently, in 2024, the National Labor Relations Board alleged that the retail giant interrogated and threatened pro-union workers at a store in Eureka, California.

As the biggest employers in their respective industries, corporations like Walmart and Starbucks, as well as other top non-union employers like Amazon and Home Depot, understand unions as existential threats, and they've historically aimed to crush emerging beachheads through illegal firings, store closures, and endless bargaining delays.

Starbucks and Walmart's united front against workers is also reflected in their joint dedication to lobbying and policy groups that carry out the industry's wider anti-union agenda.

A compelling example of this is the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), one of the leading industry groups for major corporate retailers. While companies carry out their own individual lobbying efforts, they pool their resources into groups like RILA to advance their general interests as an industry.

RILA is dedicated to weakening labor unions and supporting anti-labor campaigns. It spends millions on federal lobbying annually to defend corporate interests around taxation and regulation and to fight pro-labor measures like the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.

RILA's 2025 policy agenda advocates “redesign[ing] and purs[uing] workforce policies and practices to reimagine outdated labor laws.” In 2024, it warned of workers at Amazon and Starbucks winning their first contracts, which “are the holy grail because unions, once embedded, rarely relinquish their hold.”

Both Walmart and Starbucks are RILA members, and Starbucks current and historic ties to RILA run deep. Former Starbucks board director Mary Dillon is the former chair of RILA. Additional companies represented through Starbucks board, like Nike and Williams-Sonoma, are also RILA members.

Starbucks, Walmart, and other corporations represented on Starbucks's board are also tied to other major anti-union industry groups, such as the National Retail Federation (NRF) and National Restaurant Association (NRA).

While the membership rolls of these groups are not disclosed, corporations like Walmart and Starbucks feature prominently in their leadership and activity. For example, Walmart sits on the anti-union NRF's board, and the group has supported litigation aimed at combating Starbucks Workers United.

Unionizing baristas have long criticized Starbucks for describing its employees as “partners” and adopting a “progressive” veneer while overseeing a fierce anti-union campaign. But the company's hypocrisy arguably stretches to another area where it claims moral high ground: climate and sustainability.

In June 2025, Starbucks brought in Dambisa Moyo, a longtime board director of Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, as a board member. Moyo has served on Chevron's board since 2016. In 2024 alone, she took in $457,604 in compensation from Chevron for her board role. According to her most recent disclosure, she owns more than $2.1 million in Chevron stock.

In a 2020 interview, Moyo said it was “very shortsighted” and “naive” for “people to be campaigning for defunding” fossil fuel companies like Chevron that she said “can potentially find solutions to the climate change crisis.”

Since then, Chevron and other Big Oil majors have doubled down on fossil fuel extraction and slashed their low carbon investments, while their climate pledges have garnered criticism. Chevron ranks at the 21st top U.S. greenhouse gas polluter, according to the UMass Political Economy Research Institute's most recent “Polluters Index.” A 2019 investigation found that Chevron was the world's second-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide equivalent since 1965.

Moyo has also held board roles at corporations like 3M, which has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements tied to its production of cancer-causing PFAS “forever chemicals,” and Barrick Gold Corporation, which engages in gold and copper extraction and has faced accusations of human rights violations.

While Starbucks has won industry praise for its sustainability gestures, the decision to bring on Moyo, a clear defender of fossil fuel companies who has millions personally invested in Big Oil stock, raises alarm about the coffee giant's climate commitments.

Other ongoing labor struggles share common opponents with Starbucks Workers United. 

For example, labor unions and community groups in Los Angeles are organizing against displacement and heightened policing, and for living wages, housing protections, and immigrant rights. Their organizing efforts are framed around the 2028 Summer Olympics, which will be held in LA. 

Some of the same corporate actors driving Starbucks are overseeing the LA 2028 games. Longtime Starbuck director and former top Nike executive Andy Campion is a board director of the committee organizing LA's hosting of the 2028 Olympics, while former Starbucks director Hobson is also a LA2028 board member. Starbucks is a “Founding Partner” of the LA2028 games.

Starbucks also historically has strong interlocks with Big Tech, and some Starbucks directors — such as Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube, which is owned by Google and its parent company Alphabet — are powerful figures in Silicon Valley. Recent former Starbucks directors also include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Clara Shih, head of Meta's business AI division.

In recent years, tech workers have been facing off against some of these Starbucks-linked tech CEOs by organizing through unions like Alphabet Workers Union and campaigns like No Tech for Apartheid.

All told, while the ongoing barista strike is part of the larger struggle to unionize Starbucks, it also represents something much broader: a pitched battle against an executive and governance regime interlocked with a wider network of corporate power whose tentacles stretch far behind a chain of coffee shops.

            US Rep. Jasmine Crockett filed Monday to run for US Senate from Texas in 2026, according to a list posted by the state Democratic Party, entering the race on the same day that a potential rival, Colin Allred, ended his bid.
    


            The shakeup follows several developments that have changed the political calculus heading into next year's midterm elections. State Republicans' unprecedented mid-decade redistricting this summer upended the House map, while a contentious GOP Senate primary has emboldened Democrats in the 2026 race for Republican Sen. John Cornyn's seat.
    


            Earlier Monday, Allred, a former Texas Democratic representative, announced that he was ending his Senate campaign and would instead run to once again represent the Lone Star State in Congress. CNN previously reported that Crockett asked Allred to drop out of the race, and has cited a poll in some conversations that shows her in strong shape.
    


            Allred launched his Senate campaign in July after running unsuccessfully in 2024 against the state's other Republican senator, Ted Cruz. Allred will now run for Texas' redrawn 33rd Congressional District.
    


            Allred acknowledged that he had spoken with Crockett, whom he called “a friend,” about the race, saying it was “a professional, friendly conversation.”
    


            “I needed to try and decide what I thought would be best for the state, for the party in a time and in a year where there is so much at stake,” he told CNN.
    


            Texas State Sen. James Talarico, who elevated his profile during clashes over the Republican redistricting effort this summer, will also run in the Democratic Senate primary. He joined the race in September and has quickly topped Allred's fundraising numbers.
    


            “We're building a movement in Texas — fueled by record-breaking grassroots fundraising and 10,000 volunteers who are putting in the work to defeat the billionaire mega-donors and puppet politicians who have taken over our state,” Talarico said in a statement. “Our movement is rooted in unity over division — so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.”
    


            Crockett, meanwhile, has spent weeks floating a potential Senate bid, making calls and sounding out potential supporters, as Democrats game out a reshuffled slate for 2026. Crockett and Rep. Marc Veasey, a fellow Dallas Democrat dealing with the gerrymandered breakup of his current seat, discussed sequencing on Monday for him to file in her district shortly after she submits her Senate paperwork.
    


            Monday's shake-up injects fresh intrigue to a Texas Senate race that has already been marked by high drama.
    


            Cornyn, a two-decade Republican veteran of the Senate who has held office in Texas since the 1990s, is facing multiple primary challengers, including the state's controversial Attorney General Ken Paxton, and US Rep. Wesley Hunt from the 38th District.
    


            President Donald Trump has so far refrained from endorsing in the race, prompting a fierce fight over his supporters among the GOP contenders.
    


            Democrats are hoping to take advantage of the Republican infighting and put Cornyn's seat in play after repeated frustrations at the statewide level in Texas over the years. It's an open question, though, which contender gives the party its best shot.
    


            If Crockett were to join the Senate race and Allred stayed in it, that would have left three viable contenders in the Democratic primary, increasing the likelihood that no candidate would win a majority in March and a runoff in May would be required.
    


            “To me, going through a bruising primary, and in Texas, we have a runoff – and we would certainly have a runoff in this case – was not in the best interest of the state or the party,” Allred told CNN on Monday.
    


            Allred will now run for Texas' redrawn 33rd Congressional District, setting up a competitive primary against Rep. Julie Johnson, who plans to move from the 32nd District.
    


            “This new district deserves representation that has been present in the tough moments, including throughout the redistricting fight, instead of parachuting back when another campaign doesn't work out,” Johnson said in a statement. “Families here are dealing with rising costs, housing pressures, and real economic strain. They deserve someone with a strong record in Democratic collaboration and support.”
    


            Rep. Joaquin Castro, who was involved in discussions about running for Texas attorney general but chose to seek reelection, said Crockett should run for Senate “if that's where her heart is and that's where her mind is.”
    


            “Jasmine is a fighter, she's an incredibly dynamic person,” Castro told CNN's “The Situation Room.” “She's got a message that's resonating, not only with the Democratic base, but I think with Americans across the country.”

            US citizens born between 2025 and 2028 will soon be eligible to receive $1,000 from the government in a “Trump Account,” a new tax-deferred investment vehicle whose funds become available once the child turns 18.
    


            Although some critics say the accounts are flawed since they don't help parents in need of immediate financial support for their child, I believe the long-term benefits for children of all incomes far outweigh such concerns. That's because I have my own “Trump Account” — or, rather, a much earlier version of one.
    


            At the age of 12, when my grandfather asked me what I wanted as a bat mitzvah present, I had an unusual request: shares of General Electric.
    


Michael and Susan Dell donate $6.25 billion to fund ‘Trump Accounts' for millions of American kids



            On my bus rides all throughout middle school I was reading rating reports and checking the stock's price like a hawk — far more than any investment adviser would probably recommend. Before long, I came to recognize that it was too risky to only invest in one company. So I made the case for why I should buy different companies' stocks with bat mitzvah money I received. My father encouraged me to present him with my rationale for companies I'd want to invest in.
    


            By high school, I had a side hustle helping friends and family members clean out their closets and then listing their goods on eBay. I put the proceeds straight into my investment account. When my siblings and I fought, they'd often joke that my parents should just drop me off at the local branch of the brokerage company I used. (In their eyes, a mutually beneficial move: I would be among fellow investment-minded people and they wouldn't have to put up with whatever annoyance I — allegedly — had caused.)
    


            But the joke's on them: That small but mighty portfolio of $1,300 worth of stocks has grown to around $3,300, a nearly 150% jump over the 15 years that followed since I made my first purchase.
    


            Funds in “Trump Accounts” can only be invested in low-cost, diversified US stock index funds, like ones that track the S&P 500, based on a law passed earlier this year.
    


            But that's not exactly a bad thing. For instance, if you today were to cash out on a $1,000 investment you made 18 years ago in a fund tracking the S&P 500, you'd record a gain of over 200%, or around $4,000, based on how the index performed from 2007 to 2025. (Uncle Sam would have to get a cut of that too, though.)
    


            While there's no guarantee any investment made today would have the same returns after 18 years, it's not out of the question either. That's thanks to a concept in finance known as compound interest.
    


            It works like this: If you invest, for example, in the S&P 500, which on average has gone up 10% annually, or in any other asset that goes up over time, you end up earning interest not just on your initial investment but also on gains your investment accumulates along the way.
    


            The best part: It doesn't take a huge amount of money to grow a lot. It's more about how long you stay invested, giving your money more time to collect gains that continue to stack on top of prior gains.
    


            While I considered myself pretty advanced for a 12-year-old, that concept wasn't one I could wrap my head around at the time — I wanted instant gratification and bragging rights about how much money I made.
    


            But I'm thankful I somehow managed to have the intuition to stay put and hold on to almost all the stocks I purchased in middle school and high school so I can continue to observe the power of compound interest.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Takeaways: Supreme Court's conservatives ready to back Trump on firings","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/08/politics/supreme-court-to-hear-separation-of-powers-dispute-over-fired-ftc-commissioner","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 09:00:58 GMT","


            The Supreme Court's conservative majority signaled Monday it is ready to back President Donald Trump's push to effectively take over independent agencies within the federal government and possibly overturn a 1935 precedent that has for decades insulated those entities from White House control.
    


            At the center of the case is Trump's decision in March to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from the Federal Trade Commission, despite a federal law that requires presidents to show cause — such as malfeasance — before booting the leaders of agencies run by multi-member boards. The court's decision could have sweeping implications beyond the FTC.
    


            After two-and-a-half hours of argument, the court's six-justice conservative bloc appeared to be aligned with Trump while the court's three-justice liberal wing was staunchly opposed. A decision in the major separation of powers case is expected before the end of June.
    


            Here are the key takeaways from Monday's arguments:
    


            Liberal and conservative justices both spent considerable time weighing what they viewed as the potential practical implications of siding with Trump – or ruling against him.
    


            Led by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's three-justice liberal wing peppered Solicitor General D. John Sauer with questions about which agencies would be affected if Trump could fire the members – and therefore have greater control – over the Federal Trade Commission.
    


            “You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,” Sotomayor told Sauer at one point early in the discussion.
    


            But several of the court's conservatives flipped that idea around, and pressed Slaughter's attorney on whether Congress could just restructure Cabinet-level agencies like the Department of Interior in a way that would bar a president from firing the secretary. That, they suggested, would also upend the federal government. And why, several justices asked, couldn't that happen under Slaughter's theory?
    


            “They're not elected — as Congress and the president are — and are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the court's conservative wing, said of the independent agencies at issue in the case.
    


            “The sky will not fall,” said Sauer, the administration's top appellate attorney. “The entire government will move toward accountability to the people.”
    


            Trump is asking the justices to overturn a decades-old decision in which the court ruled that Congress does have the power to require a president to show cause before firing independent agency leaders.
    


            The modern court has repeatedly chipped away at the 1935 ruling, known as Humphrey's Executor v. US, and the dispute before the justices Monday gives them a chance to bury it. But whether they choose to do that or simply further erode it is something the conservative majority will grapple with in coming months.
    


            Justice Neil Gorsuch at one point described the precedent as “poorly reasoned.”
    


            Sauer got right to his request for the justices to finally kill the 90-year-old precedent as he began making his pitch to the justices, describing the case as a “decaying husk with bold and particularly dangerous pretensions” that was wreaking havoc in lower courts.
    


            Roberts at one point also described the decision as a “dried husk.”
    


            Indeed, lower courts have recently scrutinized the decision in different ways. Trial-level judges reviewing Trump's firing of leaders of independent agencies this year have applied the decision in the officials' favor. But just last week, a federal appeals court in Washington, DC, reversed two of those rulings, holding that Humphrey's Executor didn't shield the officials from being removed from their posts.
    


            “It has a powerful hold on the minds of some people within our constitutional system. It certainly seems to have a powerful hold on the minds of lower courts and their decisions,” Sauer said. “The court should overrule Humphrey's Executor explicitly.”
    


            The Humphrey's Executor case dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt's time in the White House. He fired a commissioner of the FTC in 1933. The commissioner, William Humphrey, was appointed by President Herbert Hoover. He continued to argue he was a member of the commission until his death in 1934. His estate sought to recover his salary during the period after his firing and the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that his dismissal was improper.
    


            The precedent, and subsequent decisions, have shielded some two dozen independent agencies from presidential interference, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the National Transportation Safety Board, among others.
    


            The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision last year granting the president immunity from criminal prosecution increasingly became a focus of the case – and was repeatedly raised during the arguments Monday. In that decision, the court was weighing whether Trump's interaction with Justice Department officials fell within the kind of presidential actions that would be covered by immunity.
    


            “The president's power to remove ‘executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed' may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts,” Roberts wrote in that decision. It was a point Sauer focused on almost immediately during a back-and-forth with conservative Justice Clarence Thomas.
    


            At one point, Justice Neil Gorsuch leaned into Slaughter's lawyer, Amit Agarwal, on the issue. Agarwal argued the court's language in the immunity decision doesn't cover agencies like the FTC, which is pursuing civil matters — compared to the Justice Department, which is pursuing criminal cases.
    


            “So that means if the government wants to bring a misdemeanor, that person has to be reportable to the president, but if the government wants to bring ruinous fines and penalties and injunctions that person doesn't?” an incredulous Gorsuch asked.
    


            “You're building off of two words from Trump v. United States and putting a gloss on it that I'm not familiar with,” he said.
    


            Looming large over Monday's arguments is Trump's attempt to exert more control over the Federal Reserve.
    


            Earlier this year, the president fired Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, leading her to sue. The high court allowed her to stay in the job for now and the justices have set arguments next month in that case. 



            In separate cases concerning independent agencies the court went out of its way to distinguish the central bank from those agencies, signaling that a majority of justices aren't ready to sign on to any attempt by Trump to meddle with the Fed.
    


            And at least one member of the court's conservative wing made clear on Monday that he was sympathetic to arguments pushed by Slaughter that Trump's position in her case would undermine the Fed's independence.
    


            “They have concerns about that and I share those concerns,” said Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee.



            In response, Sauer tried to steer the court away from the notion that the administration was taking aim at the legal guardrails around the Fed, but liberal Justice Elena Kagan swiftly pushed back, saying his “logic” would sweep in “a great many things.”
    


            “So once you're down this road, it's a little bit hard to see how you stop,” Kagan said. “It does not seem as though there's a stopping point.”
    


            Much of the debate was about the interplay between two branches of the federal government — the executive and the legislative. But lurking in the case is a question about the power of the judicial branch to engage in legal disputes when a government official is fired, and to reinstate them. The Trump administration argues courts do not have the authority to bring those officials back from exile.
    


            One of the questions the court was asked to answer is whether that broad position is true. If it is, it would have sweeping practical implications, allowing a president to fire officials and keep them removed from power, even if a court later decides that the firing was illegal.
    


            Humphrey's Executor, after all, was about a fired official's estate being able to collect back wages, not to be reinstated.
    


            But there seemed to be limited appetite for that broader position on Monday. Kavanaugh, in particular, seemed dismissive.
    


            “I have some real doubts about that argument,” Kavanaugh said, who then added it would amount to an “end run” around the government's position that some independent agencies — like the Federal Reserve — could remain protected from presidential control.
    


            “That strikes me as really destroying the categories that you had identified as potential exceptions,” he said.

ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Republicans in key battleground U.S. House districts are working to contain the political fallout that may come when thousands of their constituents face higher bills for health insurance coverage obtained through the Affordable Care Act.

For a critical sliver of the Republican majority, the impending expiration of what are called enhanced premium tax credits after Dec. 31 is a pressing concern as they potentially face headwinds in a 2026 midterm election that will be critical to President Donald Trump's agenda.

One of those is first-term U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Pa., whose victory for the Allentown-area seat last year was among the narrowest in the nation.

Mackenzie is part of a bipartisan group that has been pressing for an eleventh-hour compromise, advocating for an extension of the tax credits that tries to fix perceived flaws and bring down health care costs. But the push is a long shot due to entrenched GOP opposition to the health overhaul known as “Obamacare.”

“I think that we need to deal with the reality of where we are now and even if you have a broken system, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't provide or offer relief to individuals who are dealing with those high costs right now,” Mackenzie said in an interview with The Associated Press.

Democrats have been laying the groundwork, starting with this fall's shutdown fight, to make the health care issue a focus of next year's campaigns.

The party's strategy for capturing the House majority centers on pinning higher bills for groceries, health insurance and utilities on the policies of Trump and Republicans.

In Washington, Republicans from competitive House districts have authored or signed onto bills that would temporarily extend the tax credits. A new bipartisan proposal unveiled Thursday has drawn support from roughly 15 Republicans and 20 Democrats so far.

“I have 40,000 people in my district who rely on this health care and doing nothing to prevent a spike in their premiums is wrong,” said U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., a sponsor of the plan.

Thirteen Republicans — including Mackenzie — signed a letter in late October to the House speaker, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., encouraging the temporary extension of the tax credits, saying letting them “lapse without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent.”

Johnson hasn't committed to a short-term extension vote before Jan. 1 and has dismissed the looming premium increases as affecting a small percentage of Americans.

More than 24 million people have ACA health insurance, including farmers, business owners and other self-employed people who don't have other health insurance options through their work.

Many benefit from subsidies that lower their out-of-pocket cost. Those subsidies include the enhanced premium tax credits, which were added and then extended under Democratic President Joe Biden when his party was the majority in Congress.

Some Republicans — including Mackenzie — couch their support for an extension with the caveat that changes must be made. One is rooting out insurance broker fraud. Another is backing off subsidies for higher earners.

U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley, one of the California Republicans whose districts have been redrawn to favor a Democrat, sponsored a bill to extend the tax credits for two years. His bill would also impose an income eligibility cap to exclude higher earners.

Kiley said the current system isn't working, but there's not enough time to make systematic reforms before millions of Americans “just suddenly pay double on their premiums.”

U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., also has a bill to temporarily extend the credit, and said letting the subsidy lapse will make it harder for Republicans to retain the majority next year.

“People say, ‘well, it's not that many people,'” Van Drew said. “The kind of election we're going to have in the midterms in multiple districts is going to be decided by one or two points. It's going to be close. It's going to be tight, and it does matter. It absolutely matters politically.”

U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, chair of the House Republicans' campaign arm, said the tax credits won't be “decisive” in next year's election when other things are likely to be on voters' minds.

But U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state, who chairs the House Democrats' campaign arm, said swing-district Republicans won't be able to distance themselves from the expiration of the tax credits. 

“The number one issue across the country is affordability and health care is a key part of that,” DelBene said. 

The Congressional Budget Office projects that 3.8 million more people will be uninsured in 2035 if the tax credits aren't extended. But the tax credits also come with a cost: Extending them would increase the deficit by $350 billion over the next decade.

The expiration of the tax credits means enrollees will see annual premiums more than double — from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to health care research nonprofit KFF. That's an increase of 114%. 

The size of the increases varies by state, age and income and will be more extreme in Mackenzie's district, according to state data, which puts the average premium increase at 178%.

A primary field of Democrats is shaping up for the nomination to challenge Mackenzie. They say they're hearing from people who are struggling to afford rising premiums.

One of those Democrats, Ryan Crosswell, said rising insurance costs are a “breaking of promises” by Trump, Republicans and Mackenzie. Another Democrat, Carol Obando-Derstine, called the impending expiration a “crisis of (Mackenzie's) own making.”

Mackenzie says he's made it clear repeatedly that he supports an extension, but that “I am not the speaker, I don't set the calendar or the agenda. I'm not the leader, I can't call up bills.”

In Mackenzie's district, more than 20,000 people received the enhanced tax credits in 2025, according to state data. He won his race last year by 1 percentage point, or about 4,000 votes. 

One of those 20,000 people in Mackenzie's district is Patrick Visconti, who switched to a low-premium, high-deductible plan because he couldn't afford to keep his plan with a premium that is more than doubling from under $200 to over $500 a month.

Visconti, 59, who works as a self-employed landscaper and a bus driver, said the plan he picked is “crappy coverage.” 

“I'd rather pay the $200 a month. But I can't get anything for $200,” Visconti said.

Lynn Weidner, a home care worker in Mackenzie's district who works nearly 80 hours a week, said her $400 premium will increase to $680. But, she said, she's leaning toward selecting the plan because she has various conditions — including an iron deficiency — that require regular medical care.

“So I'm trying to find places where I can cut money so that I can afford my insurance come January, which is stressful,” Weidner said.

BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union official on Monday warned the United States against interfering in Europe's affairs and said only European citizens can decide which parties should govern them.

European Council President António Costa's remarks came in reaction to the Trump administration's new national security strategy, which was published on Friday and paints European allies as weak, while offering tacit support to far-right political parties.

The document, which was praised by Russia, formalizes in writing months of Trump administration criticism of EU policy and perceived restrictions on free speech that started with a lecture to European allies in Germany in February by U.S. Vice President JD Vance.

It's “good” that the strategy depicts European countries as an ally, but “allies don't threaten to interfere in the domestic political choices of their allies,” Costa said.

“What we can't accept is the threat of interference in European political life. The United States cannot replace European citizens in choosing what the good or the bad parties are,” he said in Paris at the Jacques Delors Institute, a think tank.




Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive at the European Policy Centre think tank, said that stridently nationalist parties in Europe will be emboldened by the strategy document and “will intensify efforts to hollow out the EU from within.”

“Pro-European liberal forces need to finally wake up: Trump's America is not an ally, but an adversary to Europe's freedoms and fundamental values. His objective is to replace our democratic system with the illiberal populism now entrenched in the U.S.,” Zuleeg said.

The strategy was also critical of European free speech and migration policy. U.S. allies in Europe face the “prospect of civilizational erasure,” the document said, raising doubts about their long-term reliability as American partners.

But Costa, who chairs summits of the EU's 27 national leaders, said that Europe's “history has taught us that you can't have freedom of speech without freedom of information.”

The former Portuguese prime minister also warned “there will never be free speech, if the freedom of information of citizens is sacrificed for the aims of the tech oligarchs in the United States.”

Speaking to reporters in Berlin, German government spokesperson Sebastian Hille underlined that “Europe and the U.S. are historically, economically and culturally linked, and remain close partners.”

“But we reject the partly critical tones against the EU,” he said. “Political freedoms, including the right to freedom of expression, belong to the fundamental values of the European Union. We view accusations regarding this more as ideology than strategy.”

The security strategy is the administration's first since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office in January. It breaks starkly from the course set by U.S. President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, which sought to reinvigorate Washington's alliances.

It comes as the U.S. seeks an end to Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine, a goal that the national security strategy says is in Washington's vital interests.

But the text makes clear that the U.S. wants to improve its relationship with Russia after years of Moscow being treated as a global pariah, and ending the war is a core U.S. interest to “reestablish strategic stability with Russia.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said the document “absolutely corresponds to our vision.” Over the course of the war, Russia has worked to drive a wedge between NATO allies, particularly between the U.S. and Ukraine's main backers in Europe.

“If we read closely the part about Ukraine, we can understand why Moscow shares this vision,” Costa said. “The objective in this strategy is not a fair and durable peace. It's only (about) the end of hostilities, and the stability of relations with Russia.”

“Everyone wants stable relations with Russia,” he added, but “we can't have stable relations with Russia when Russia remains a threat to our security.” 

Top EU officials and intelligence officers have warned that Russia could be in a position to launch an attack elsewhere in Europe in three to five years should it defeat Ukraine.

Hille noted that “the strategy doesn't classify Russia as a threat; we don't share this assessment. We are sticking with NATO's joint analysis.” Trump and his NATO counterparts noted, in a summit statement in June, “the long-term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security.”

However, Hille insisted that “in view of the great security policy challenges, trans-Atlantic cooperation is now and will be in the future of central significance for our common security.”

U.S. President Donald Trump has unleashed the most extensive diplomatic effort to end the fighting in Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion nearly four years ago, but Washington's efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Monday with European allies as he faces U.S. pressure to accept a plan to end the war at a time when Russian forces are making slow but steady gains.

Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner visited Moscow last week for five-hour talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Witkoff and Kushner then held several meetings with senior Ukrainian officials in Florida in an attempt to iron out the differences over a plan that has been criticized for heavily favoring Moscow.

It's not clear where the proposal stands after those negotiations. But, in public, Russian and Ukrainian leaders have laid out some of their demands.

Putin wants all the areas in four key regions that his forces have seized and Crimea, which was illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian. He has also demanded that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in the east that have not been captured.

Moscow has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO, limit the size of its army, grant official status to the Russian language, and recognize the Russian Orthodox Church. 

Russia has refused to halt the fighting until a comprehensive peace deal is reached.




Kyiv has said it's ready to halt the fighting along the existing front line — though it would not officially cede territory currently under Russian control. It has also rejected Moscow's demands that it surrender other land Russia has not been able to take by force and drop its bid for NATO membership.

As part of a prospective peace agreement, Ukraine has demanded solid security guarantees both from Europe and the U.S. to deter Russia from attacking again.

Zelenskyy and his European allies have repeatedly accused Putin of slow-walking the talks to allow his forces more time to press ahead with the invasion.

Trump on Sunday appeared to voice exasperation with Zelenskyy, as he has before.

“Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I'm not sure that Zelenskyy's fine with it,” Trump said. “His people love it, but he hasn't read it.”

It's not clear why Trump thought Zelenskyy hadn't read the plan or who he was saying loved it. Ukrainian officials have made sparing comments about it and very few details of the negotiations have been made public.

Putin also hasn't fully backed the White House plan. While the Russian leader last week hailed Trump's peace efforts, he also noted that some parts of the plan were unacceptable for Moscow and needed more work.

(AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)






























WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors and praised Sylvester Stallone, Kiss, Gloria Gaynor, Michael Crawford and George Strait, the slate of honorees he helped choose, as being “legendary in so many ways.” 

“Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,” Trump, the first president to command the stage, said to open the show. 

The Republican president said the artists, recognized with tribute performances during the show, are “among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.”

Since returning to office in January, Trump has made the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is named after a Democratic predecessor, a touchstone in a broader attack against what he has lambasted as “woke” anti-American culture. 

Trump said Saturday that he was hosting “at the request of a certain television network.” He predicted the broadcast scheduled for Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.

Before Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees. Trump skipped the honors altogether during his first term.

Asked how he got ready for the gig, Trump said as he moved along the red carpet with his wife, first lady Melania Trump, that he “didn't really prepare very much.”

“I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,” the president said. “But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself.”




Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said his boss “is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight.” Lutnick arrived with his wife, a member of the Kennedy Center's board. 

Trump appeared on stage three times to open and close the show, and after intermission. He also talked up each artist in prerecorded videos that played before their tributes. 

Trump was both gracious and critical in the comments he delivered from the stage, lavishing the honorees with effusive praise but at times showing a mean streak. After returning from intermission, he said he'd toured some of the construction projects he has launched to renovate the performing arts center. And he said it was a “fantastic” night.

“Well, we're really having a good time tonight,” Trump said. “So many people I know in this audience. Some good. Some bad. Some I truly love and respect. Some I just hate.”

Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his “Rocky” and “Rambo” movies, Gaynor for her “I Will Survive” feminist anthem and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. 

Strait is a leader in the world of country music and Crawford, a Tony Award-winning actor, is best known for starring in “Phantom of the Opera,” the longest-running show in Broadway history. 

Trump said persistence is a trait shared by the honorees, several of whom had humble beginnings. 

“Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,” he said from the stage. “But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.”

He said many of the politicians, celebrities and others in the audience shared the trait, too.

“I know so many of you are persistent,” Trump said in his opening. “Many of you are miserable, horrible people. You are persistent. You never give up. Sometimes I wish you'd give up, but you don't.”

The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. During the tribute to Kiss, a lone red guitar that emitted smoke was placed on stage in remembrance of Frehley, who was known for having a smoke bomb in his instrument. 

The program closed with a rousing performance by Cheap Trick of Kiss' “Rock and Roll All Nite” that brought the audience to its feet.

Stallone said receiving the honor was like being in the “eye of a hurricane.”

“This is an amazing event,” he said on the red carpet. “But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ..: but I'm incredibly humbled by it.”

Crawford also said it was “humbling, especially at the end of a career.”

Gaynor said it “feels like a dream” to be honored. “To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,” she said after arriving.

Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who performed for Gaynor, called her a dear friend. “She truly did survive,” Farris said. “What an iconic song.” 

Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance — and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the “Trump Kennedy Center.” He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.

Asked Sunday night about a possible renaming, Trump said it would be up to the board. Still, he joked at one point about the “Trump Kennedy Center.”

Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face to face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate. 

During Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump stayed away during that entire term. 

Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were “too woke.” He said Sunday that about 50 names were whittled down to five. While Stallone is one of Trump's Hollywood ”special ambassadors” and has likened Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear. 

Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years. 

Simmons spoke favorably of Trump when Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Trump was “out for himself” and criticized Trump for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism. 

Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were “terrorists.” But after Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.

“If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,” Stanley wrote on X. “If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.”

BENGALURU, India (AP) — Climate change is battering Asia's water and power systems and putting millions in harm's way, forcing countries to pour billions into shoring up basic services, according to two recent reports.

Water-related disasters are rising across the region even as spending to protect communities falls short. Asian nations will need $4 trillion for water and sanitation between 2025 and 2040 — about $250 billion a year, the Asian Development Bank said in a report released Monday.

Governments are under growing pressure to protect power systems people rely on every day. By 2050, extreme weather could leave listed power companies in Asia-Pacific with about $8.4 billion a year in damage and lost revenue, a third higher than now, according to recent research by the Hong Kong-based non-profit Asia Investor Group on Climate Change and the New York-based MSCI Institute, a sustainability think tank.

Those risks have been playing out this year across Asia as it was pummeled by late-arriving storms, relentless rains and severe floods.

In central Vietnam's Quy Nhon, power lines snapped when Typhoon Kalmaegi blasted the coastal city with heavy rain and strong winds. Floods from the relentless downpours left streets submerged under chest-high water days later, turning entire neighborhoods into islands. The day after the storm made landfall, Hai Duong, 29, rushed to a mall that still had power to charge her phone.

“I can't go back because my home is underwater. I just want to see if my relatives are safe,” she said.

The ADB report says 2.7 billion people, about 60% of the Asia-Pacific population, have access to water for most of their basic needs but more than 4 billion still remain exposed to unsafe water, degraded ecosystems and escalating climate hazards.

Much of the progress since 2013 comes from major gains in rural water access, it says. About 800 million more people in rural areas now have piped water, helping many countries move out of the lowest level of water security. India played a big part in this shift.

But Asia faces a triple threat: environmental pressures, low investment and climate change, said Vivek Raman, principal urban development specialist at the ADB and a lead author of the report. 

“It's a tale of two realities,” Raman said.

The report says water ecosystems were rapidly deteriorating or stagnating in 30 of the 50 Asian countries that were studied, plagued by unchecked development, pollution and land being converted to other uses. Asia also accounts for 41% of global flooding and its coastal megacities and Pacific islands face mounting threats from storm surges, rising sea levels and salty water pushing inland. From 2013 to 2023, Asia and the Pacific experienced 244 major floods, 104 droughts, and 101 severe storms — events that undermined development gains and caused widespread damage.

Governments currently meet only 40% of the estimated $4 trillion in investment, or roughly $250 billion annually, in funding needed for water and sanitation from 2025-2040. That leaves an annual shortfall of over $150 billion. 

Asia's rapid growth is both an opportunity and a challenge said Amit Prothi, director general of New Delhi-based Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, who was not involved with the report. “The amount of infrastructure we'll build in Asia in the next three decades will be as much as what was built in the last two centuries. So, this is an opportunity to rethink and build in a new way,” he said. 

The coalition found that $800 billion in infrastructure, about a third of it in Asia, is exposed to disasters each year globally. 

Extreme heat, floods and water shortages are already costing Asia's power utilities $6.3 billion annually, a figure projected to exceed $8.4 billion by 2050 if companies fail to strengthen climate adaptation measures, research by the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change and the MSCI Institute shows.

Asia accounts for 60% of the world's power generation capacity and remains deeply reliant on coal. The report warns that climate changes threatens both energy security and economic growth across a region where over 4 billion people need reliable electricity.

“Overall, if you were looking at the types of impacts and the preparedness of companies, most companies are at very early stages,” said Anjali Viswamohanan, director of policy at the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change.

Its study of 2,422 power plants across China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea found extreme heat to be the costliest hazard, responsible for over half of all losses by 2050. Heatwaves reduce power plant efficiency and strain transmission networks. India's main power utility NTPC, Indonesia's PLN, and Malaysia's Tenaga Nasional all face a high risk of disruptions caused by rising heat.

Another major threat comes from declining river flows in Asia's major basins, which supply the water needed by coal and gas plants and fuel hydropower dams. 

At the same time, heavy rainfall and flooding also pose risks, especially in coastal and riverine regions. Malaysia's Tenaga Nasional faces some of the highest coastal flood exposure due to power plants built in low-lying areas, the report said.

Despite mounting hazards, most utilities lacked detailed, funded plans for adapting to climate impacts. The report found that while nine companies of the 11 studied assessed how climate change impacts them, only seven examined risks at individual plants. Just five calculated and disclosed how future climate impacts could raise costs or hurt their earnings.

Rapidly shifting climate risks make it hard to predict the costs and insurance needed to protect energy infrastructure, said Jakob Steiner, a geoscientist affiliated with the University of Graz, who wasn't involved in either report.

Financing gaps in the power sector may be easier to close than those in water and sanitation, since energy projects can attract strong industry interest and investment, he said. But some countries daunted by demands from international investors for environmental safeguards might turn to regional financiers that are less scrupulous about such concerns. 

“For energy infrastructure, I see more hope that the financing gap can be closed,” he said. “But that can also come at a cost.”

Olivia Dunne had one of the biggest social media followings of any collegiate athlete during her time as a star gymnast for the LSU Tigers, which won a national championship during her tenure.

As Dunne has moved on from her days as a top-flight athlete, she has more than 7.9 million followers on TikTok and another 5.3 million on Instagram. She's no longer an LSU gymnast at this stage of her life, but there is one thing she doesn't want to be known as.

Dunne bristled at the term during an interview with Maxim. She was then asked what she wanted to be referred to as.

""A former athlete, and honestly, right now: model,"" she said.

Dunne has appeared on the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit runway, going viral for a jaw-dropping split during the show.

She was recently featured on the cover of the magazine and posed for photos for a spread.

Dunne talked to Maxim about the business ventures she's undertaken during college and post leaving LSU once her collegiate career was finished – particularly on her fight on the behalf of others to fair compensation for athletes' name, image and likeness.

""A recruit that hasn't even touched foot on a campus yet gets paid $12 million by a booster. That's not an NIL deal, that's being paid to play,"" she told Maxim, adding ""that would never happen with any women's sport.""

Dunne established the Livvy Fund in 2023 to help female student-athletes at LSU get the most out of NIL endorsements.

""The brands I work with put money into a fund, and my sister will pair them up with a female student athlete who goes to LSU who wants to work,"" she said.

Club for Growth president David McIntosh says deep-pocketed conservative political group ‘will be there to back up' President Donald Trump's push for red states to redraw congressional maps to create more GOP-leaning districts.

President Donald Trump and allied groups are turning up the heat on Indiana Republican state senators who are resisting the president's push for the red state to pass congressional redistricting.

The Indiana Senate reconvened on Monday, three days after the state House approved a new map championed by Trump that would create two more right-leaning congressional districts in the solidly red Midwestern state, where the GOP currently controls seven of Indiana's nine U.S. House seats.

The action in Indiana comes after the Supreme Court last week cleared the way for GOP-dominated Texas to use its newly redrawn map, which creates five more right-leaning House seats.

And it marks the latest front in Trump's aggressive national campaign to reshape congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms, when Republicans will likely face traditional political headwinds as they defend their razor-thin House majority.

While the super majority in the Indiana House passed redistricting 57-41, with a dozen GOP lawmakers voting against the measure, the stakes are much higher this week, as the Republican-dominated state Senate, which has resisted Trump's efforts to draw new congressional maps, meets to vote later in the week on the redistricting bill passed by the state House.

Indiana Senate Republican leader Rodric Bray has repeatedly said there wasn't enough support in the chamber to move forward with redistricting. The state Senate split 19-19 last month in a proxy vote.

RED STATE MOVES FORWARD ON TRUMP CHAMPIONED CONGRESSIONAL MAPS

""A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn't care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity,"" Trump warned in a recent social media post.

Bray, in announcing that the state Senate would reconvene to take action on redistricting, said ""the issue of redrawing Indiana's congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state.""

A final vote by the state Senate is likely on Thursday.

Trump has been twisting elbows in his attempt to make Indiana the latest Republican-controlled state to change their congressional maps. The president has called state lawmakers and Vice President JD Vance visited the state twice earlier this autumn to discuss redistricting.

Trump this weekend took to social media twice to keep up the pressure.

TRUMP TARGETS RED STATE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS IN PUSH FOR CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING

""Why would a REAL Republican vote against this when the Dems have been doing it for years??? If they stupidly say no, vote them out of office — They are not worthy — And I will be there to help! Thank you Indiana!"" he warned.

And in a separate post, Trump highlighted nine state Senate Republicans who have yet to announce their position on the new map, saying they ""need encouragement to make the right decision."" The president added, ""The Indiana Senate must now pass this Map, AS IS, and get it to Governor Mike Braun's desk, ASAP, to deliver a gigantic Victory for Republicans in the ""Hoosier State,"" and across the Country.""

Trump has also taken some jabs at Braun, arguing that the governor ""perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes.""

HOUSE GOP CAMPAIGN CHAIR WANTS TRUMP 'OUT THERE ON THE TRAIL' IN MIDTERM BATTLE FOR MAJORITY

While Trump recently called Braun ""a good man,"" he has warned he ""must produce on this, or he will be the only Governor, Republican or Democrat, who didn't.""

But Braun, pointing to the president, has touted that he is ""committed to standing with him on the critical issue of passing fair maps in Indiana to ensure the MAGA agenda is successful in Congress.""

Meanwhile, the Trump-aligned conservative outside political group the Club for Growth Action and other groups have dished out big bucks to run ads in Indiana supporting redistricting, and along with Turning Point Action, will target Republican state lawmakers opposed to the new map.

Club for Growth President David McIntosh sent out a ""FINAL WARNING"" to Bray, warning that ""failure to get this done means you and any other opposition will be defeated and removed from office in your next election.""

And Turning Point Action on Friday held a rally at the state Capitol, where Braun spoke, to put pressure on Indiana Senate Republicans to support redistricting.

The push by the president in Indiana is part of a broad effort by Trump's political team and the GOP to pad the party's razor-thin House majority ahead of the midterms, when the party in power traditionally loses seats.

TRUMP-BACKED NORTH CAROLINA HOUSE MAP APPROVED BY LAWMAKERS AS REPUBLICANS AIM TO PICK UP SEAT

""We must keep the Majority at all costs,"" the president wrote recently.

Trump, by championing rare but not unheard of mid-decade redistricting, is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.

Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. State lawmakers in GOP-dominated Florida this week took the first steps towards passing a redistricting measure, and right-leaning Kansas is also mulling redrawing its map.

Two federal judges in Texas last month delivered a blow to Trump and Republicans, by ruling that the state couldn't use the newly drawn map in next year's elections. But the Supreme Court on Thursday gave a big thumbs up to the Lone Star State's new congressional map.

Democrats are fighting back.

California voters a month ago overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.

That is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.

Illinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting.

And in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge last month rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

A man claiming to be an Iranian intelligence officer promised me he would reveal his country's secrets. Then he disappeared.

Listen to more stories on hark

In December 2011, the CIA lost control of a stealth drone near the Iranian city of Kashmar, about 140 miles from the Afghanistan border, and it wound up in the regime's possession. On state television, the Iranian military displayed the boomerang-shaped craft like a trophy. Triumphant banners beneath its 30-foot wings said, in Farsi, THE US CAN'T MESS WITH US and WE'LL CRUSH AMERICA UNDERFOOT.

The cause of the crash was a mystery. Had the Lockheed Martin drone—a multimillion-dollar RQ-170 Sentinel—simply gone off course? Or had Iranian hackers commandeered the aircraft, demonstrating the prowess of a growing cyberarmy that had already alarmed U.S. officials?

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Just over four years later, in April 2016, a known Iranian hacker group named Parastoo—the Farsi word for “swallow,” the small bird—posted its email address to a cybersecurity message board, inviting journalists to ask it about what had happened to the drone. In my experience covering national security, people who claim to have “the real story” are usually quacks or kooks. Still, I figured it was worth an email.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

“I understand you want to discuss the CIA's RQ-170 drone,” I wrote to [email protected] on April 12, 2016. “Want to talk?”

Thirty-six hours later, someone calling himself “P” responded, in clumsy but mostly legible English. “Yes, i want my identity protected and in series of either live interviews or chat-based conversations i would like to reveal all behind that story.”

Reveal all. Sounded kooky.

P said he was part of Parastoo, which had once broken into a server of the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency and claimed to have hacked the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration. The group had also bragged that it could take over U.S. military drones, even once suggesting that it could send one to attack then–Vice President Joe Biden.

P said he would communicate initially via an encrypted text-messaging app called Cryptocat, but coordinating our schedules wasn't easy. P said he was in Tehran, which was seven and a half hours ahead of Washington, D.C. We settled on Monday, May 2, 2016, for our first conversation.

P asked me questions designed to confirm that I was the person he had corresponded with over email. Where did I work? (The Daily Beast, at the time.) Did I have a phone number tied to a specific location? He also asked me a series of biographical questions, such as where I went to college, that he could easily corroborate online. My answers, P said, “helped my investigations on you.”

No source had ever interrogated me like this before. P didn't talk like a hacker. He was acting like a spy.

P said he was an officer in the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, Iran's CIA. And not just any officer. He said he was in charge of an elite cyber-warfare unit—the kind of group that might have been tasked with taking down an American drone.

P described how his colleagues had captured the Sentinel. His unit obtained satellite and radio information about how the drone communicated with its base, as well as technical information about its stealth capabilities, which he claimed Iran had received from the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Iran then located the drone mid-flight and prevented it from returning to Afghanistan. The drone wandered aimlessly until gravity took over.

“She ran outa gas and had to emergency landing by parachute,” P typed.

By May 11, he trusted me enough to identify himself. “My name is Mohammad Hossein Tajik,” he wrote. “I am 35 but very older like 999 years older in the heart and in the ass!” I didn't quite get the joke, but it seemed that life had taken a toll on him.

A “huge number” of Iranian cyber operations “had my signature on the paperwork or I designed it altogether,” Mohammad claimed. At the time, Iran had been credibly linked to disruptions of the global financial system and to the penetration of computers that run crucial infrastructure, such as electrical grids and dams, including one in New York State. Was I now talking to the guy who oversaw those covert operations? And if so, why was he talking to me?

The more we communicated, the less kooky he sounded. Mohammad didn't try to confuse me with technical jargon or wow me with heroics—which made him more credible. Then he said that he didn't actually want to talk about the drone. The Sentinel had been a lure to get my attention.

Mohammad said he wanted my help with a plan. Part one of it: revenge. He wanted to leak information about Iranian intelligence operations in order to hurt and humiliate Iran's leaders, who had profoundly upset him, though he didn't tell me how. In his plan, I would vet Mohammad's claims with my intelligence sources and publish the information if it checked out.

This idea suited me fine. An aggrieved government employee is often a journalist's best source.

Part two of Mohammad's plan was, frankly, insane. He told me he was once an asset for the CIA, and had worked on “big ops.” He wanted to rekindle his relationship with the agency. He was hoping I would connect with his former CIA handler using my contacts within the agency, and convey that Mohammad was still a valuable asset, as evidenced by my eventual news articles sourced to him. If the CIA didn't welcome Mohammad back in from the cold, he would expose how the CIA operated inside Iran.

“Using this model,” he texted, “i can work with you and get what i want in return.”

In blunt fashion, he was expressing how both our businesses work. Mine eschews deception, but journalists collect sources, then assess and second-guess them, just as spies do. A journalist and an intelligence officer are both trying to piece together a coherent story from confusing fragments of reality. And very few journalists, if any, could count a senior Iranian intelligence officer turned American spy as a source.

“Are you in?” Mohammad asked me.

I did not commit to part two of the plan—journalists don't negotiate on our sources' behalf, or involve ourselves in intelligence operations—but was happy to proceed with part one: leaking secrets to me.

“I'm in,” I typed.

“Alright—let the game begin.”

I had never spoken with an Iranian intelligence officer before, so I had no baseline to assess whether Mohammad fit the profile. I pictured some version of Shaun Toub, the actor who had played an Iranian spy chief turned CIA asset in the third season of Homeland. Restrained. Unhurried. Elegant.

That was not Mohammad. His patience was short. He tried a little too hard to be funny. He was cocky but vulnerable, and sometimes goofy. I remember thinking, He's a nerd.

He had never married, which was unusual for someone in his position of responsibility, he told me. For several years he'd had an online relationship with a woman, but they had not met in person. He never mentioned friends in Tehran.

“I got not much social life outside work,” he said.

He loved Western culture, especially American movies. He quoted a scene from The Shawshank Redemption in which Morgan Freeman's character, released from prison into an unfriendly world, narrates: “No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.” We discovered that we were both fans of All the President's Men. Perhaps Mohammad fancied himself as Deep Throat, meeting me in a virtual parking garage and hinting at greater revelations to come. Our weekly encrypted conversations—over Cryptocat, Skype, and Proton Mail—had a cinematic thrill. But unlike in All the President's Men, I was learning as much about the source himself as the regime he claimed to be undermining.

Mohammad told me he was born into a religious and politically active family. In 1979, his father joined fellow revolutionaries in storming the headquarters of the Shah's secret police force, and interrogating and torturing officers; then he helped found Iran's intelligence service. “I hate this whole SHIT immeasurably,” Mohammad told me about the family business. But he was a math prodigy and computer whiz, and at age 18, he started working for the intelligence ministry. Within a decade, he said, he was playing a central role in Iran's aggressive expansion into cyber warfare.

From the December 2004 issue: Mark Bowden on the Iranian hostage-takers

Over several conversations, Mohammad gave me a detailed overview of Iran's cyber battlefield: the countries it was targeting in the Middle East, particularly Israel and Saudi Arabia, and the alliances it had formed with Russia and China. He explained how the intelligence ministry concealed its hand by hiring contractors—specifically tech companies run by young men who, like Mohammad, had graduated from computer-science and engineering programs at Iranian universities. Two of Mohammad's contractor friends were indicted in a U.S. district court in March 2016 for cyberattacks against dozens of U.S. financial institutions. Like Mohammad, his friends were the children of military or political officials “who got into business based on their fathers reputation,” he said. One of their fellow hackers was also indicted for breaking into the control systems of the dam in New York.

If he was telling the truth, Mohammad was taking me deeper into the regime's cyberworld than any of my sources had ever done. He said he'd been involved in an audacious 2012 attack on Saudi Aramco, the kingdom's oil company, that wiped out information on three-quarters of its office computers. In 2015, Mohammad claimed, his team penetrated a commercial satellite network called iDirect to take control of U.S. drones. I've seen no evidence that Iran was able to use a drone in an attack, though Mohammad described to me how Iran could commandeer one. (“There is no record, evidence, or indication of any such incident” like what Mohammad described, an iDirect spokesperson told me, noting that the company doesn't own or operate drones, nor does it operate any satellite networks.)

Mohammad said his colleagues shared techniques with Russia's military-intelligence service, the GRU, and were behind the 2015 attacks on the electrical system in Turkey, a NATO member.

In his most astonishing claim, Mohammad told me that Iran was responsible for a major cyberattack on the central bank of Bangladesh, from which hackers stole $81 million in February 2016, sowing panic throughout the global financial system. The U.S. Justice Department indicted three hackers from North Korea. Mohammad said that Iran had played a secret role. It had given technical instructions to Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based militia, about how to manipulate a communications network known as SWIFT, which connects financial institutions. The group then traded the information, for missiles, to North Korea.

Mohammad said Iran gave permission for Hezbollah to attack. “Our assumption was they'd do the hack,” he said. “But they did something smarter.”

If it was revealed that Iran and North Korea were covertly collaborating, the United States' retaliation would presumably be severe. To test Mohammad's claims, I spoke with half a dozen researchers who'd studied the Bangladesh Bank robbery. None had found any indication that Iran had participated. But they thought Mohammad's description of events sounded plausible.

From the October 2025 issue: Graeme Wood on Iran, the neighbor from hell

My notebook was filling up with plausibilities. Was Mohammad giving me major scoops, or tall tales? If he was being honest, then he was putting his life at great risk. How badly had the regime wronged him that he would tell these secrets to a journalist? And, before that, to the CIA?

Mohammad said he had been an American intelligence asset for about five years, but indicated that the relationship had ended on bad terms. He told me that the CIA would now engage with him for only one reason: to exfiltrate him from Iran. All he had to do was get to a U.S. consulate or embassy in another country and say an agreed-upon passcode at the front desk. Then he would be protected and free. If that was true, why hadn't he accepted the offer?

There's an old saw in the intelligence profession about what motivates someone to betray their country and spy for another: MICE.

Money: They need it, and will sell information for it.

Ideology: They want to help a cause, or tear one down.

Coercion: They're being blackmailed.

Ego: They have a big one, and it needs feeding.

Mohammad lightly checked the “I” box. Service to the Islamic Republic was Mohammad's “family legacy,” he told me, but he'd begun to view the regime as corrupt, hypocritical, and out of touch. The intelligence ministry spied on Iranians with professional ties overseas and accused some of plotting revolution. Iran was cutting itself off from the rest of the world and dismantling recent reforms just as Mohammad was going online and imagining a life beyond the one he knew.

“Through the years specially after internet i get to read and see very much, previously hidden from me and i started to change,” Mohammad told me in May 2016, adding: “Eventually i turned into a TRUE ENEMY of this whole shitty regime and all that relates to it from every aspect.”

But what really motivated Mohammad was the “E” box: ego. He believed he was smarter than most people, including his contacts at the CIA. He relished playing two roles—trusted by Iran, engaged by the United States. But that took a toll.

Mohammad worked hard to keep up his outward persona of a fervent supporter of the regime and the Islamic Revolution. A member of “God's party/army in all aspects,” as he put it. “I live a complicated double life, and it's hurting me as a human inside,” he told me. At one point, he described his life as a CIA asset: “Being still a double—turning into a triple and later to a nothing/everything/ticking-bomb.” I didn't understand what he meant, but I had the sense that I didn't know the real Mohammad.

As he rose in the intelligence ministry's ranks, he told me, he took several trips to Lebanon and grew close to top Hezbollah leaders, including Imad Mughniyeh, who'd plotted the 1983 bombings of the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut. Mohammad's friendships with some of the world's most notorious terrorists—who had American blood on their hands—would have made him a prized CIA asset. He told me that he'd shared information about Hezbollah's organizational structure with the CIA, and told the agency how Hezbollah units interacted with the Iranian intelligence ministry.

The CIA had hunted Mughniyeh for decades and finally killed him in a joint operation with Israel in February 2008, the same year that Mohammad said he began working for the agency. In our conversations, Mohammad never claimed direct credit for American operations—that was another sign of his credibility, in my book—but his time with the CIA coincides with other notable U.S.-intelligence successes in Iran. In September 2009, for example, Western leaders announced the discovery of Fordow, an underground uranium-enrichment plant (which the Trump administration would bomb in 2025). Given his position, Mohammad could have known about the site. If he had wanted to “hurt the regime,” as he said, he was well placed to do so.

For two months in the late spring and early summer of 2016, Mohammad told me stories about his family, his cyber exploits, his work with the Americans, his plans to settle scores with the regime. I liked him. He made me laugh. I wouldn't call him a friend, but we were friendly.

Vetting Mohammad's more sensational claims took a back seat as I tried to keep pace with a furious news cycle. In one week during July 2016, I juggled stories about the FBI's decision not to recommend prosecution of Hillary Clinton for using a private email server, the Russian government's hacking of the Democratic National Committee's computer network, and the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

When Mohammad and I spoke on July 2, 2016, he was anticipating a new round of cyberattacks, this time on Saudi Arabian banks. He told me more about how Hezbollah had assisted North Korea with cyber tactics, and I wanted to devote our next conversation to the subject. We agreed to speak three days later.

Mohammad didn't show up online at our designated time. He had never missed an appointment, though he was often preoccupied with work. A few days later, I got a text from a well-known journalist named Ruhollah Zam, an Iranian dissident living in exile in Paris. Mohammad had been sharing information with him, too, and had introduced us weeks earlier. Zam sounded panicked.

“Have you heard what happened?” he asked.

Mohammad was dead.

I felt sick—not just at the news, but out of fear that I might have done something to get Mohammad killed. Had Iranian counterintelligence officers been monitoring us? I spent the next two weeks reviewing our security protocols, agonizing over whether we could have been safer.

Zam forwarded me a text exchange with a member of Mohammad's family that suggested that Mohammad had been murdered by the regime. Zam also sent me Mohammad's death certificate, showing that he had died on July 5, the day we were supposed to speak. His body had since been buried in Behesht-e Zahra, Tehran's main cemetery.

Using Google Translate, I made sense of Zam's subsequent messages. Amir, Mohammad's youngest brother, had found the body. There had been no autopsy. Zam alleged that Mohammad's father, who was known by the honorific Hajji Vali, had killed his own son in an act of loyalty to country over family.

Then, on July 18, I got a call from the FBI. An agent from the Washington field office said he needed to discuss something sensitive.

The agent came to my house two days later. We sat in the living room. He told me that he specialized in notifying victims of computer hacking. People—presumably unfriendly ones—were chattering about me overseas, and the FBI wasn't sure why. The agent asked: Had anyone sent me strange messages recently?

You don't know the half of it, I thought. “It's Iran, isn't it?” I asked.

The agent nodded. He asked why I thought so.

Without revealing Mohammad's name or that he'd claimed to work for the CIA, I told the agent that I had developed an Iranian source and that we had communicated over the previous two months.

The agent asked for his whereabouts.

He was killed two weeks ago, I said.

The agent sat in silence for a moment. He appeared to choose his next words carefully. A group of Iranians—he didn't say whom they worked for—was discussing me by name, and clearly wanted to know more about me. Now he understood why.

Were my husband and I in danger? The agent said he didn't think so. One of our cats strolled into the living room and sniffed at the agent's pants. “My security detail,” I said.

The agent doubted that I was to blame for the killing. Mohammad had indeed been playing a game. And now I was left with a puzzle.

First, I wanted to finally answer the big question: Was Mohammad really a spy for the CIA?

One of my intelligence sources gasped when I mentioned Mohammad's name over lunch, and described him as “a brilliant hacker.” Another smiled nervously and called him “the person you're talking about,” as if saying Mohammad's name would reveal classified information. Yet another confirmed that, earlier in the Obama administration, a prized Iranian asset had made it possible for the United States to confidently and publicly blame Iran for the cyberattack on Saudi Aramco. Mohammad had told me that he participated in that operation; apparently, he also told the CIA about it.

Mohammad was indeed among the CIA's most well-placed assets, as he had claimed.

The other pieces of the puzzle—who had killed Mohammad, and what had led him to that fate—were harder to assemble.

When Mohammad and the CIA parted ways, in 2013, it was a bad time for spies. Iran had breached the CIA's internet-based system for covertly communicating with its agents in the field. Mohammad told me that he'd never trusted Langley's communications procedures. When he communicated with his handlers, he said, he used his own private network to connect with the Sony laptop the agency had given him.

The laptop prevented Mohammad from taking screenshots, so he used his personal phone to photograph his communications and made copies of information he gave the CIA. “For insurance,” he told me. He had broken protocol because he thought he was smarter than the Americans. This was a profound mistake.

After Mohammad's death, I tracked down people who knew him, including friends and Iranian activists living abroad. I learned that he had been arrested by Iran a few months after the CIA cut ties with him, three years before he connected with me. Those phone photos easily could have tipped off the regime. In August 2013, he was taken to a detention center on the eastern outskirts of Tehran. A month later, Mohammad was transferred to Evin Prison, a notorious facility designed to isolate detainees and break them.

Mohammad endured months of torture, he would later tell friends. Interrogators poured boiling water on his penis. They forced him to curl up in a pit shaped like a grave, with a light shining on him at all hours. Mohammad was charged with spying for Iran's adversaries.

All the President's Men had been a touchstone for our relationship. But, with the revelation of his imprisonment, I thought about that other favorite movie of ours. Mohammad had ended up in Shawshank—a prisoner in the torture chambers at Evin, but also a lifelong captive of the regime itself.

After spending half a year in jail, Mohammad was released to await trial. This is highly unusual in Iran. But Mohammad was bailed out, according to his friend, by a powerful ally in the security establishment: his father, Hajji Vali.

Mohammad spent six months in a hospital recovering from his injuries. His dark beard turned white. For a year, he couldn't sit straight. Then, in January 2015, Mohammad sent an email to Zam, who had also been tortured in Evin, after he participated in the political protests in 2009. Mohammad told Zam that he had spied for the CIA and that he didn't trust his father. He couldn't talk to his brothers; two also worked for the intelligence service, and the other, Amir, was too young to comprehend the mess Mohammad had made. But he could talk to journalists and dissidents.

Zam told me that he and Mohammad spoke nearly every night for a year. Zam wanted political change. Mohammad wanted payback through political change. He became a valuable anonymous source within the regime for Zam's independent news organization, which had a following in the Iranian diaspora and among foreign journalists. If he ever did leave the country, Mohammad said, he wanted to be known as “Iran's Snowden”: a former insider who became a symbol of resistance.

Ego, indeed. Mohammad was engaged in the very behavior for which he was awaiting trial. As if that wasn't crazy enough, he soon started talking to me.

Mohammad never told me about his time in prison, or that he had been charged with espionage. Now I understood why he wanted to hurt the regime: It had hurt him.

But I also questioned how truthful Mohammad had been with me. In 2011, The Christian Science Monitor had published some of the details of the Sentinel-drone takedown, though not nearly as precise as Mohammad's version. Perhaps he was just parroting that report back to me, with his own embellishments. Mohammad also had been in custody during some of the exploits that he'd claimed his team carried out. How did he know about them? And had he gone back to work for the regime after he was released and was awaiting trial? That seems implausible. More likely, I have concluded, is that Mohammad remained in touch with colleagues and was aware of what they were up to. In hindsight, he was more reckless than I knew.

Even as he stared down a court date, he was trying to use me to rekindle his relationship with the CIA. And the whole time, he was leaking to me and Zam. He took yet another risk introducing the two of us, a month before he died, because the Iranians were almost certainly trying to penetrate Zam's communications, given his prominence in the dissident community. Zam urged Mohammad to leave Iran. Mohammad said he wasn't ready. He worried about leaving behind Amir.

And, of course, Mohammad had unfinished business with the regime. That's where I came in, as his desired broker with the CIA.

But here's what Mohammad probably never knew, or didn't want to admit: The CIA had cut ties because the risk of working with him became greater than the value of his information. My sources told me he didn't follow instructions. One day he'd be clearheaded; the next he'd be acting paranoid, imagining conspiracies. Some officers wondered if he was taking drugs that impaired his judgment. It's a handler's job to manage sources. And Mohammad, one U.S. official told me, had become “unmanageable.”

Something else gave CIA officers pause. No one had ever met Mohammad in the flesh. He was a “walk-in”: a volunteer spy rather than a recruit. Mohammad's handlers knew he was special—a senior intelligence officer from a prominent family with access to extraordinary information—but the CIA never seemed fully comfortable with him.

And the CIA had good reasons to suspect that Mohammad may have been compromised. He had been thrown in prison for espionage shortly after the agency cut ties. Then, months after his arrest, he was suddenly set free and wanted to reestablish his relationship with the agency. Perhaps the Iranians had coerced him into working against the Americans, in exchange for his freedom.

I thought about the cryptic message he'd sent me about his life at that time: “Being still a double—turning into a triple and later to a nothing/everything/ticking-bomb.”

When Mohammad was trying to reconnect with the Americans, was he actually working for Iran? And by asking for my help, had Mohammad been using me to entrap the CIA?

A nothing/everything/ticking-bomb. That's a man who had come to the end of his rope. Who thought he was dangerous, to others and maybe himself. Now I know that while he was talking with me, Mohammad was about to take the biggest—and final—risk of his life.

In July 2016, two months into our communications, Mohammad planned to fly to Turkey and give regime documents to Zam. He spent days scanning them. He converted Iranian currency into U.S. dollars. His suitcase was packed.

According to Zam, Mohammad's next leak was supposed to involve Iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon from another country. I have only Zam's word on this. Mohammad never told me about any such operation; my other sources have never even suggested that Iran attempted to procure a nuke. I can't say if Zam was exaggerating, or if Mohammad had led him on.

Amir, who was perhaps the main reason his brother had stayed in Iran, saw the suitcase and asked where Mohammad was going.

To Turkey to meet a friend, Mohammad replied. You should come with me.

Amir refused. He left the house and told their father that Mohammad was leaving, according to information Zam pieced together from conversations with his own sources and text messages with Amir.

At 3 p.m. on July 5, the day Mohammad and I were supposed to next meet online, his father, Hajji Vali, and another official from the intelligence ministry came to his house, Zam told me. Amir returned home that evening and found his brother's body. A few days later, the home was raided. The authorities took Mohammad's possessions, including his computer.

Rumors have circulated for years in the diaspora about how Mohammad died. His burial certificate lists no cause of death. I've read claims on Iranian blogs that he had a heart attack, but friends told me he was in relatively good health, save for a reliance on painkillers (torture has a long tail).

The most widely shared story among regime critics in exile is that Hajji Vali killed him—if not with his own hands, then by his orders. Zam was certain of this, but he, too, had come from a prominent family that he left behind in Iran. Maybe Mohammad's father was merely a convenient villain for the story Zam was trying to tell.

Hajji Vali kept away from his son's grave at the burial service and watched from under the shade of a nearby tree, Zam later recounted in a lengthy interview with Voice of America's Persian News Network. Mohammad's death was an assassination, Zam said, “one of those ideological murders, where a father, in order to stick to his beliefs, is content with the death of his son.” Avoiding a trial would also have saved the Iranian intelligence service and his father from significant embarrassment.

Could Hajji Vali have murdered his own son? In our many conversations, Mohammad neither excoriated nor extolled his father. He understood Hajji Vali as a product of revolutionary circumstances. Men like him probably wanted Mohammad dead. I can't speak for Hajji Vali, and I couldn't locate him for comment. (Iran's mission to the United Nations declined to comment.)

Iranian intelligence surely found my conversations with Mohammad in his computer hardware. I think what sent the FBI to my door was U.S. surveillance of Mohammad's colleagues as they discussed whether to hack me.

In 2021, five years after Mohammad died, I wanted to check in with Zam to compare notes, to finally start putting together the puzzle after years of professional distraction. I discovered that a year earlier, Zam had been lured to Iraq with the promise of interviewing a prominent cleric—and then apprehended, taken to Iran, and hanged.

You can find only traces of Mohammad today. Search his name online, and you'll see some court documents, a few blog posts about his death, and a short Wikipedia entry. Activist bloggers briefly celebrated Mohammad as a martyr, but he was not, in the end, “Iran's Snowden.”

I won't pretend that I really knew Mohammad. Maybe I knew one version of him—the version in a selfie I obtained. With his thick black glasses and rumpled shirt, he looked like the intense nerd I'd always envisioned. I suspect he never told me about his prison time and torture because he considered them detours from his objectives.

Sometimes I think about how Mohammad first introduced himself to me: “I am 35 but very older.” I understand now. He was traumatized. He was tired. And he was trapped in a fantasy of revenge. “But there is another thing named life,” Mohammad told me, “and i strongly miss it.”

Sunday's awards exemplify MAGA's politics of resentment.

On Sunday night, President Donald Trump took to the stage in Washington, DC to host the annual Kennedy Center Honors. Presidents traditionally attend the awards, although Trump declined to do so in his first term. Now, after purging the Center's traditionally bipartisan board of ideological rivals and installing himself as chair, Trump has become the first president to emcee the night. For Trump, the event seems to have been an opportunity not just for vengeance against “woke” Hollywood but for vindication of his own cachet as a TV host.

“I've watched some of the people that host,” remarked Trump, former Apprentice host, on the Saturday before the event. “Jimmy Kimmel was horrible. If I can't beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don't think I should be president.”

Kimmel has never hosted the Kennedy Center Honors, although he appeared onstage in 2014 as part of a tribute to David Letterman. Kimmel has, however, hosted the Oscars, and Trump appears to have decided that the Kennedy Center Honors are his equivalent. More importantly, Kimmel has been a vocal Trump critic, and Trump, in his turn, has been vocal in his hatred of Kimmel. In September, their feud climaxed when Kimmel was briefly suspended from his ABC talk show, in an apparent bid for Trump's favor by Disney-ABC, after the comedian falsely suggested that Charlie Kirk's assassin was associated with MAGA.

Trump, with his characteristic thin-skinned narcissism, seems to have taken the Kennedy Center Honors as a chance for him to one-up Kimmel, to be funnier and more attention-grabbing and to host a more prestigious event. (In fairness to Trump, his line “many of you are miserable, horrible people,” delivered directly to the audience in apparent earnest, was genuinely quite funny.)

The power of sitting in the Oval Office, now redesigned to his liking as he reshapes the White House and flirts with declaring foreign wars, is not quite enough for Trump. He cannot just be president. He also has to be a good TV star. He has to win the approval of the culturati, which is the one thing he will never quite get.

It is this clumsy muscling for approval, in many ways, that characterizes this phase of MAGA: the sense that since the right cannot naturally command the cultural cachet that the left has won, they will have to take it for themselves, with political might or with cold hard cash. Elon Musk's transformation of Twitter into X is one version of this strategy. Right-wing social media networks have never gone mainstream among elite audiences the way Twitter did at its peak, so instead of building a new one, Musk simply bought it. Then he remade it as a place where racial slurs are acceptable, but use of the word “cis” is grounds for banning.

Kimmel's brief ousting shows another version of this strategy. As the conservative essayist Tanner Greer explained to Vox's Zack Beauchamp in September, right-wing figures thought Kimmel's false claims about Kirk's assassin were just as offensive as an anti-Black Lives Matter statement would have been during the George Floyd protests of 2020. They also knew they didn't have the public support it would take to create an outcry against Kimmel from the ground up. What they had, instead, was the president.

“They remember 2020, and they feel like if Jimmy Kimmel had gone against Black Lives Matter, he would've been taken off the air without the state,” Greer told Vox. “And we don't have that same activist network [as the left], but we do have the state. And so we should try to create the same sort of structural cultural change that was imposed upon us in the Great Awokening.”

The idea here is to replace the soft power of persuasion and earned popular support with the hard power of government. After spending a decade decrying the left as a bunch of social media bullies ruling by public shaming and cancellation, the right is attempting to match the left's cultural power through the objectively much harsher mechanisms of threatening heavy fines and jail time.

This is not to say that the right is fundamentally unpopular. It takes fervent supporters to win over every branch of government, as the right has. Trump's core supporters are famously committed, and he won the popular vote in 2024. Their movement has real adherents, and it has made real inroads among the edgy-hip hugely popular outsiders of popular culture, where the Joe Rogans and the Theo Vons live.

But they still don't have the thing Trump craves most of all, which is mainstream, middle-of-the-culture approval. Acceptance among widely beloved cultural elites. The sheen of movie star cool. Finding themselves unable to earn it, they are attempting to bully their way toward it instead.

Trump was a TV star, but he was never popular enough to get a job hosting the Oscars: too weird, too mean and racist, too liable to go off script and say something that made bad headlines. So instead he became president, fired the board of the government's central cultural institution, and installed himself as head and de facto host instead.

Will that ever be enough for him?

Palantir is launching a fellowship for neurodivergent individuals after a video of its CEO struggling to sit still went viral.

In an X post on Sunday night, the software company said it's encouraging applications from those who relate to CEO Alex Karp in being ""unable to sit still, or thinking faster than you can speak.""

""The neurally divergent (like myself) will disproportionately shape America's future,"" Karp said in a statement posted on X by Palantir.

In the job description, Palantir said the ""Neurodivergent Fellowship"" is a ""recruitment pathway for exceptional neurodivergent talent.""

""This is not a diversity initiative,"" the job description states, referencing a hot-button topic among company leaders.

The final round of interviews for the fellowship will be conducted by Karp, Palantir said. The role is based in New York or Washington, DC, and it pays between $110,000 and $200,000 a year.

While cross-country skiing this morning, Dr. Karp decided to launch a new program: The Neurodivergent Fellowship.If you find yourself relating to him in this video — unable to sit still, or thinking faster than you can speak — we encourage you to apply.The final round of… pic.twitter.com/2Xdrc13uj5

The announcement of the fellowship comes days after Karp drew attention online for his body language during an onstage interview with The New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Summit.

""Every pre-school teacher in America should be required to watch this video of Alex Karp being completely unable to sit still in his chair,"" wrote Katherine Boyle, a general partner at A16z, in a Wednesday X post.

During the interview, Karp defended the notoriously secretive company's ethics and praised Donald Trump's immigration policies.

In his statement, Karp did not mention any specific form of neurodiversity, but he has previously said he has dyslexia.

Neurodiversity is a broad umbrella, including ADHD, autism, Tourette's syndrome, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and others.

""Doing what everybody else wants me to do is much harder for a dyslexic like me than a non dyslexic,"" he said in an interview with Wired published last month.

He added: ""Maybe I'm not everyone's cup of tea, but I kind of like being me on most days.""

If you own a Tesla, your next road trip could be planned by Grok.

Tesla unveiled its 2025 holiday update over the weekend, and the company said Elon Musk's AI chatbot can now add and edit navigation destinations. 

A video demonstration uploaded by Tesla showed the AI assistant, which was built by Musk's AI startup xAI, responding to a voice command and adding multiple destinations around San Francisco to the car's infotainment screen. Grok was first integrated into Tesla vehicles in July.

The new feature, which the automaker said would turn Grok into ""your personal guide,"" is the latest sign of the increasingly close integration between Tesla's vehicles and Musk's AI chatbot.

Musk announced that Grok would be coming to Tesla EVs in July, shortly after the AI model went on an antisemitic rant on X in which it praised Adolf Hitler.

Since then, Grok has attracted headlines for insisting that Musk is in better shape than LeBron James and reportedly revealing the home addresses of everyday people.

Tesla and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. 

Grok is only available on certain Tesla vehicles with sufficiently powerful processors. The chatbot can be set to a range of different personalities, including storyteller, assistant, and ""unhinged.""

The feature update comes as Tesla looks to turn around its sales slump, with the EV maker likely to post declining annual sales for the second year in a row.

It also comes after investors voted on whether Tesla should invest an undisclosed sum in xAI at the company's annual shareholder meeting last month.

While more shareholders voted in favor than against, a large number abstained. Tesla's board said it would, for now, just examine the ""next steps"" in light of the abstentions.

Alina Habba, who had previously served as President Donald Trump's defense lawyer, said Monday that she was stepping down as U.S. attorney for New Jersey after judges disqualified her from that position.

Habba's resignation came a week after the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a district court judge's ruling that found her ineligible for the top prosecutor's job because of the circumstances of her appointment as the interim holder of that post.

Habba and Attorney General Pam Bondi said Habba would remain at the Department of Justice as senior advisor to the attorney general for U.S. attorneys.

Bondi also said the DOJ would appeal the 3rd Circuit's ruling and that the department is confident it would be reversed.

""As a result of the Third Circuit's ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down in my role as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey,"" Habba said in a statement on X.

""But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me,"" Habba said.

""Make no mistake, you can take the girl out of New Jersey, but you cannot take the New Jersey out of the girl.""

Bondi said on X, ""I am saddened to accept Alina's resignation.""

""The court's ruling has made it untenable for her to effectively run her office, with politicized judges pausing trials designed to bring violent criminals to justice,"" Bondi said. 

""These judges should not be able to countermand the President's choice of attorneys entrusted with carrying out the executive branch's core responsibility of prosecuting crime.""

Trump called the reasons for Habba's resignation ""a shame.""

""She's not disqualified,"" Trump said.

""You got a blue slip thing that's horrible,"" Trump said, referring to the practice of the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow effective vetoes of nominations  of U.S. attorneys unless the senators from the state housing that office agree on the person nominated.

""It's a shame ... Republicans should be ashamed of themselves"" for allowing it to go on, Trump said.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche appointed three people to supervise the criminal, civil and appellate, and administrative functions of the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office in light of Habba's departure.

Lindsey Halligan, another former lawyer for Trump, was recently disqualified by a judge from serving as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia because of the circumstances of her appointment.

Because of Halligan's disqualification, the grand jury indictments she obtained against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James were dismissed last month.

Bondi appointed Habba as interim U.S. attorney in March after her predecessor resigned.

Trump later nominated her to hold the post permanently, but her nomination was never considered by the Senate, as is required. 

The DOJ engaged in a byzantine series of maneuvers that it argued enabled Habba to automatically become the acting U.S. attorney, but a federal judge and then the 3rd Circuit rejected that effort, saying they failed to comply with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

In this article

Several big shots in Cupertino are getting a career change for the holidays.

In the last seven days, there has been extraordinary turnover among Apple's top ranks, from its head of artificial intelligence to its top lawyer.

CEO Tim Cook now has two fewer direct reports than he did before Thanksgiving.

The executive who designed the software for the Apple Vision Pro also bounced and is heading to Meta to do the same thing for AI glasses in Menlo Park.

As if last week's departures weren't enough, there was another potential exit over the weekend. Senior vice president of hardware technologies Johny Srouji told Cook he wanted out soon, according to Bloomberg. 

But any drama seems to have passed, with Srouji telling his staff Monday morning in a memo seen by CNBC that he isn't planning to leave Apple any time soon.

Srouji is the chip design guru who kicked Intel while it was down and made in-house chips for Mac that performed a lot better, leading to a healthy surge in sales. Srouji is essentially the Jony Ive of chip design, a singular talent, and it is tough to imagine him leaving Apple.

An Apple spokesperson provided no comment on Srouji or any of the recently departed executives.

There are multiple ways to read into all the changes at the top of a company known for keeping a steady leadership team while producing innovative and industry-leading products.

Apple stayed the course while the tech world changed around it in just three short years, as the entire industry has made a massive pivot to AI.

So it was no surprise AI chief John Giannandrea was out last week. It was on him to deliver an innovative AI experience on the iPhone. Instead, Apple had to admit it couldn't launch the supercharged version of Siri it had been advertising for months.

Perhaps the new strategy of partnering with an established AI leader such as Google or Anthropic will make up for all of it, but the pressure is enormous for Apple to get it right after the flop this year.

Getting the AI launch right is important for other products as well.

If Apple isn't going to charge for its AI system, then using it as a selling point for new hardware is its best bet to show it can make some cash.

There are already hints that 2026 is going to be a monumental year.

Some new, rumored AI product categories are expected, such as AI glasses similar to what Meta sells and a tablet for controlling all your smart home appliances.

Apple will also turn 50 on April 1 next year, and it's expected to launch its first-ever foldable iPhone. Plus, there are more challenges ahead with a looming antitrust trial and whether Apple can maintain its truce with President Donald Trump.

Taken together, perhaps the shake-ups were necessary, especially regarding AI.

It looks like next year will show if Apple got it right.

NextEra Energy plans to build 15 gigawatts of new power generation for data center hubs by 2035, CEO John Ketchum told investors on Monday. 

NextEra is the largest renewable energy developer in the U.S. through NextEra Energy Resources, and also owns Florida Power & Light. The utility also operates a fleet of nuclear- and natural gas-powered plants. 

The power company also announced a partnership with Alphabet's Google unit on Monday to develop three gigawatt scale data center campuses in the U.S. with plans to expand to additional locations. 

NextEra shares closed about 3% lower on Monday. 

A gigawatt is roughly equivalent to more than 800,000 homes based on average household electricity consumption in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. 

Ketchum said the 15 gigawatts of power for data center hubs is a ""fairly conservative"" target. 

""Quite frankly, based on what we're seeing today, we'll be disappointed if we don't do more,"" Ketchum said at NextEra's investor conference. There is potential upside to build 30 gigawatts of new generation by 2035, he said. 

The data center hubs will use all forms of energy, Ketchum said. NextEra announced a deal with Google in October to restart the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa through a power purchase agreement. 

The data center hubs will help NextEra meet its target of building four to eight gigawatts of new gas generation by 2032 and considerably more by 2035, Ketchum said. NextEra is developing a pipeline of 20 gigawats of gas generation. 

Ketchum acknowledged that the huge power demand from AI data centers is raising affordability concerns. He said the solution is for the big tech companies to bring their own power generation with them when they commit to build a data center. 

""Hyperscalers can solve that problem by bringing and paying for their own power generation and infrastructure,"" the CEO said.

iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF gained over 46% per year since inception, but the average dollar made only 11% annually.

If you'd made a lump-sum investment in iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF IBIT at the time of its Jan. 5, 2024, inception, you'd be sitting pretty. Even after the recent selloff, the exchange-traded fund earned nearly 46% per year through Nov. 26, 2025, tracking the cryptocurrency's ascent.

Of course, investors didn't all pile in on day one and double their money. Rather, they came on their own timetable, investing varying amounts, in the months that followed: All told, investors pumped around $63 billion into the ETF through Nov. 26, 2025.

Given that, the question becomes how those investors fared as a group once we account for the timing and magnitude of the purchases and sales they made over that period.

To address that, I compiled the ETF's daily assets and net flows from its inception through Nov. 26, 2025. Using that data, I estimated that investors' average dollar gained about 11.2% per year. While that's good in absolute terms, it's a fraction of the ETF's 46% total return over that period, the shortfall owing to mistimed purchases and sales.

(See the “Appendix” for further detail on the net asset and estimated daily net flow data that I incorporated to derive the dollar-weighted return estimate above.)

To put that 11.2% annual dollar-weighted return in perspective: Cash earned 4.7% per year over this span; investment-grade US bonds 5.3% annually; US stocks 23.3% a year; and the US 60% stocks/40% bonds portfolio 15.7% per year.

What explains the large gap between the ETF's total return and its dollar-weighted return? The ETF bagged its biggest gains before the bulk of investors' assets flowed in. You can see that in the following table, in which I estimate the ETF's aggregate return in dollars by its asset size at the relevant times.

(See the “Appendix” section for further details on how I derived the estimated gain (loss) figures above.)

The ETF made nearly 60% of its dollar gains (around $4.2 billion) in the first 66 days of its life, during which it gained more than 65%. Its daily net assets averaged around $4.8 billion during this period. It's made around $3 billion in the days since, but that was spread across a much larger asset base ($49.2 billion in average daily net assets), reflecting the ETF's less meteoric return over that span (around 24% cumulatively, or 13.2% per year).

To further illustrate how timing affected the return of the average dollar, I also estimated the ETF's dollar-weighted returns from its Jan. 5, 2024, inception through Jan. 5, 2025, and at one-month intervals thereafter (that is, from inception through Feb. 5, 2025, inception through March 5, 2025, and so forth). You can find those estimated dollar-weighted returns for each period, and the corresponding total return, in the chart below.

Even from the earliest period—inception through Jan. 5, 2025--there was a nearly 21-percentage-point shortfall between the ETF's total return and the average dollar's return. This reflects the early burst in returns in its first few months of existence, before flows surged. The gap stayed wide over the forward-extended periods (longest being inception through Nov. 26, 2025), during which total returns moderated while assets kept flooding in.

We spoke to representatives of the iShares ETF's manager, BlackRock, about the apparent gap between the ETF's estimated dollar-weighted and total returns. They cited three factors that in their view could either explain, or mitigate, that difference.

The first is access: At the ETF's inception, it wasn't approved for use on some of the major direct brokerage or financial advisor platforms. Thus, while the ETF quickly grew out of the gates, there remained pent-up demand that drove a continued influx over the last two years as the ETF gained additional approvals, making it more accessible to a wider audience.

Second is the growth of derivatives and multiple-leg trades, where large institutional investors use the ETF to arbitrage price differences between bitcoin futures and spot bitcoin or use the ETF to hedge options positions as derivatives and structured notes referencing iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF soared. While such trades can appear uneconomic if you view just one leg. (that is, longing the ETF), they can confer profits to these institutions in total, or hedge risks.

Third are in-kind transfers, in which large holders of physical bitcoin exchange it for shares of the ETF. The ETF was approved for these transfers in July 2025 and since then has conducted exchanges worth over $3 billion with various large crypto investors. In these instances, the ETF's dollar-weighted return would convey the return those investors captured after exchanging physical bitcoin for the ETF, but not the return on their physical bitcoin before the exchange.

(It's worth noting that the second and third factors wouldn't apply just to this ETF, but any other scenario in which the dollars originated from, or went to, vehicles other than mutual funds and ETFs. In those circumstances, we would have visibility into the fund or ETF's dollar-weighted returns, but not the other vehicle that was the source of, or destination for, asset flows.)

The ETF has done its job--it has tracked bitcoin almost perfectly and thus notched excellent total returns since inception. The problem is investors appear to have arrived late to the party--after the ETF spurted to a big gain in the first few months of its life--and that's held back their average dollar's return, caveats notwithstanding.

Those investors can't very well be called skittish: The ETF has received positive net flows on 80% of trading days since inception, meaning investors have come and largely stayed put. But the large gap between the ETF's dollar-weighted and total return underscores the importance of staying the course. If current investors do so, their average dollar's return should gradually converge toward the ETF's total return. If not, it will likely continue to lag.

It's also a reminder to be wary of narratives. The ETF's launch was heralded as a milestone in the “democratization” of crypto markets, with some arguing the surge of assets from retail investors would push bitcoin's price higher still. While bitcoin has indeed risen in the time since, it saw its biggest gains in the ETF's infancy, before it had amassed a lot of assets. That doesn't make the narrative wrong, per se, but shows that you can get the story's broad arc right and still mistime the investment.

The following table provides the net assets and estimated daily net flow figures incorporated into my estimate of iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF's dollar-weighted return from its Jan. 5, 2024, inception through Nov. 26, 2025.

The estimated daily net flows incorporated into the calculation sum to figures that closely approximate what BlackRock reported in its quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filings from inception through Sept. 30, 2025 (the date of its most recent periodic report), as shown below.

Similarly, my estimates for how much investors made (or lost) in dollar terms over time matched what BlackRock reported in aggregate, albeit with some quarter-to-quarter timing differences. All told, I estimated that shareholders had amassed $26.8 billion in net income and gains from its Jan. 5, 2024, inception through Sept. 30, 2025, which nearly matched what BlackRock reported ($26.9 billion).

Texas has launched its new cryptocurrency reserve with a $5 million purchase of Bitcoin as the state continues to embrace the volatile and controversial digital currency. 

The Texas Comptroller's Office confirmed the purchase was made last month as a “placeholder investment” while the office works to contract with a cryptocurrency bank to manage its portfolio. 

The purchase is one of the first of its kind by a state government, made during a year where the price of Bitcoin has exploded amid the embrace of the digital currency by President Donald Trump's administration and the rapid expansion of crypto mines in Texas. 

“The Texas Legislature passed a bold mandate to create the nation's first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock wrote in a statement. “Our goal for implementation is simple: build a secure reserve that strengthens the state's balance sheet. Texas is leading the way once again, and we're proud to do it.”

The purchase represents half of the $10 million the Legislature appropriated for the strategic reserve during this year's legislative session, but just a sliver of the state's $338 billion budget. 

However, the purchase is still significant, making Texas the first state to fund a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Arizona and New Hampshire have also passed laws to create similar strategic funds but have not yet purchased cryptocurrency. 

Wisconsin and Michigan made pension fund investments in cryptocurrency last year. 

The Comptroller's office purchased the Bitcoin the morning of Nov. 20 when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336, according to the Comptroller's office. As of Friday afternoon, Bitcoin was worth slightly less than the price Texas paid, trading for $89,406. 

University of Houston energy economist Ed Hirs questioned the state's investment, pointing to Bitcoin's volatility. That makes it a bad investment of taxpayer dollars when compared to more common investments in the stock and bond markets, he said. 

“The ordinary mix (in investing) is one that goes away from volatility,” Hirs said. “The goal is to not lose to the market. Once the public decides this really has no intrinsic value, then it will be over, and taxpayers will be left holding the bag.” 

The price of Bitcoin is down significantly from an all-time high of $126,080 in early October. 

Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, argued the state is making a good investment because the price of Bitcoin has trended upward ever since it first launched in early 2009. 

“It's only a 16-year-old asset, so the volatility, both in the up and down direction, will smooth out over time,” Bratcher said. “We still want it to retain some of those volatility characteristics because that's how we could see those upward moves that will benefit the state's finances in the future.”

Bratcher said the timing of the state's investment was shrewd because he believes it is unlikely to be valued this low again. 

The investment comes at a time that the crypto industry has found a home in Texas. 

Rural counties have become magnets for crypto mines ever since China banned crypto mining in 2021 and Gov. Greg Abbott declared “Texas is open for crypto business” in a post on social media.

The state is home to at least 27 Bitcoin facilities, according to the Texas Blockchain Council, making it the world's top crypto mining spot. The two largest crypto mining facilities in the world call Texas home. 

The industry has also come under criticism as it expands. 

Critics point to the industry's significant energy usage, with crypto mines in the state consuming 2,717 megawatts of power in 2023, according to the comptroller's office. That is enough electricity to power roughly 680,000 homes.  

Crypto mines use large amounts of electricity to run computers that run constantly to produce cryptocurrencies, which are decentralized digital currencies used as alternatives to government-backed traditional currencies.

A 2023 study by energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie commissioned by The New York Times found that Texans' electric bills had risen nearly 5%, or $1.8 billion per year, due to the increase in demand on the state power grid created by crypto mines.

Residents living near crypto mines have also complained that the amount of job creation promised by the facilities has not materialized and the noise of their operation is a nuisance. 

“Texas should be reinvesting Texan's tax money in things that truly bolster the economy long term, living wage, access to quality healthcare, world class public schools,” said state Sen. Molly Cook, D-Houston, who voted against the creation of the strategic fund. “Instead it feels like they're almost gambling our money on something that is known to be really volatile and has not shown to be a tide that raises all boats.”

State Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, who authored the bill that created the fund, said at the time it passed that it will allow Texas to “lead and compete in the digital economy.”

Since joining Crypto Valley VC (CV VC), a Swiss-based venture capital firm that backs blockchain-based startups, as Head of Investment for Africa in November 2024, Jarryd Kennedy has been at the centre of the firm's push to spot businesses using blockchain technology to solve everyday problems across fintech, payments, and data infrastructure on the continent.

Kennedy's career before CV VC began in investment banking, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and private equity across London, New York, and South Africa. His experience gives him a dealmaker's discipline and a technology-first lens, helping him identify use cases where blockchain reduces friction, improves trust and builds real economic infrastructure rather than hype.

In 2022, CV VC launched a $20 million Africa Blockchain Fund, which has invested in 13 early-stage Web3 startups across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Egypt, and Ghana, including Nigerian podcast-hosting platform Jamit, South African crypto investment startup Altify, Kenyan Web3 agritech Shamba Records, and South African neobank Kasi.

The firm's investment strategy writes direct cheques and backs early-stage startups from its accelerator. Through CV Labs, CV VC selects 7–9 startups to participate in a cohort each year, providing them with mentorship and growth strategy consultations. It backs nearly all the selected startups with $135,000 in funding in return for a 7% convertible note. It also writes $500,000 follow-on cheques for its portfolio startups.

After witnessing African startups' struggles to access additional capital and infrastructure for growth, the VC firm adjusted its take rate to a 6% equity through debt, increasing its ticket size to $150,000. As of October 2025, the firm claimed more than half of the startups in its portfolio have raised follow-on funding.

Circle Ventures, the investment arm of the US-based issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is among the external backers of CV VC's Africa Blockchain fund, signalling global interest in the firm's thesis.

I spoke with Kennedy for this week's Ask an Investor to understand his career, what it takes to lead CV VC's African team, and global investor appetite for African blockchain products. 

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

What brought you into Web3 venture capital, and which past roles mattered most?

My entry into the Web3 venture capital ecosystem has been shaped by a decade of experience across investment banking, M&A, and private equity, with roles spanning London, New York, and South Africa. The bulk of my career has been at Deutsche Bank, gaining exposure to Telco, Media and Technology (TMT) across capital markets and M&A.

Over time, I moved into private equity with Convergence Partners, a pan-African private equity firm focused on digital infrastructure. There, I led and supported investments into technology and telecom businesses across markets like Rwanda, South Africa, Kenya, and Malawi. That experience was pivotal because it gave me a deep appreciation for how technology can drive inclusion and development in emerging markets.

Importantly, throughout my career, there has been an enduring focus on technology: I have always viewed it as a tool to revolutionise monolithic, legacy systems, enabling the creation of more efficient outcomes. That is what ultimately drew me to Web3: I saw blockchain as an evolution in the global technology stack that could enable new structures for decentralised ownership, efficient value exchange, transparent governance, and the removal of intermediaries, thereby lowering barriers to entry and creating entirely new economic models.

At CV VC, I lead our venture investments across Africa, applying that same technology-oriented lens to early-stage startups that are building transformative real-world solutions by utilising blockchain technology.

What does being CV VC's Head of Investment for Africa mean from an operational lens?

At CV VC, no two days are the same. We are a Swiss-headquartered venture capital (VC) firm with a global footprint, and although we operate in a decentralised way, we stay tightly connected through daily team calls, cross-functional projects, and in-person engagements. 

On a typical day, I split my time across three areas: pipeline, portfolio, and investors. On the pipeline, it is all about travel, conferences, and networking, to enable relationship-building with the best startups and founders. Thereafter, we evaluate investment pitches and assess new opportunities through a data-driven lens to benchmark their performance.

On the portfolio side, I work closely with founders across our African investment portfolio, with a mix of relationship-building, hands-on support, and facilitating connections to other ecosystem participants. Finally, on the investor front, we are consistently engaged with investors to report on progress with the goal of leveraging investor expertise to bolster that progress, creating a flywheel of value creation across the ecosystem.

Across all three areas, staying sharp on market trends and emerging utility is important. This encompasses diving into data, strategic analysis, or contributing to knowledge-building efforts, which helps shape global understanding of blockchain's real-world impact on the continent.

African Web3 startups raised $122.5 million in 2024, a decline in deal value from the previous year, despite high user adoption on the continent. Why is there a gap between usage and investor appetite?

It is important to distinguish between crypto and blockchain: Crypto is one of the first applications of blockchain technology. Investors are not necessarily focused on crypto itself, but on the broader capability of blockchain technology to improve upon legacy technology stacks and to create new structures for ownership, value exchange, governance, and the removal of intermediaries.

The investment case for blockchain has never been stronger. What the internet has done for the exchange of data is equivalent to what blockchain is doing for the exchange of value. Nobody talks about a “cross-border email” because of the ubiquity with which data flows around the world! Blockchain is creating this ubiquity for the exchange of value on the internet, enabling an economic value layer which is democratised and globally accessible.

Encouragingly, we see blockchain adoption rates which are reminiscent of early internet adoption, and the blockchain economy has never been stronger. Top academics, visionary founders and over 26,000 blockchain developers are converging within the blockchain ecosystem, resulting in significant capital invested in blockchain companies and over 500 million global crypto users.

Has Africa's funding winter of 2023–2024 changed the quality or number of African Web3 startups raising capital?

Investor capital remains cautious, not just in Africa, but also across the rest of the world, which is mostly a reflection of heightened global uncertainty driven predominantly by geopolitical factors. Despite the slow start to the year, the remainder of 2024 was actually positive for Web3 venture funding, with blockchain startups taking an outsized share of venture investment in Africa.

Regardless of funding levels, blockchain builders on the continent have not been deterred in any way, with no shortage in quality or quantity of strong blockchain startups in Africa. Our pipeline is full of highly compelling investment opportunities across a wide range of sectors and geographies.

CV VC has kept writing cheques into African Web3 teams while others pull back. What explains that commitment?

Our commitment is rooted in a long-term investment philosophy and a belief in the transformative power of blockchain technology, especially in markets where it can solve real, structural problems. We focus solely on utility and ignore speculation. We're not just investing in trends; we're backing determined founders who are building infrastructure, improving access, and bringing trust to systems that need it most. That's exactly what we see happening across Africa.

Despite global funding fluctuations, innovation hasn't stopped; founders are still building, and the use cases for blockchain in multiple sectors are more relevant than ever.

How do accelerator programmes like CV Labs and ecosystem grants fit into your Africa strategy?

The proprietary CV VC accelerator program is designed to bring founders together, not just to gain investment but to share expertise, cross-pollinate ideas, and build resilience through community. Ultimately, it's about catalysing innovation that can flourish long after the initial investment.

In Africa, where markets are often fragmented and infrastructure is still evolving, accelerators play a crucial role in strengthening local capabilities and expanding access to global networks. They allow us to identify promising talent early, provide tailored support, and help founders scale solutions that are contextually relevant and often globally competitive.

Besides being highly beneficial for founders and the ecosystem at large, the accelerator is ultimately an additional mechanism used to deploy equity cheques alongside our traditional direct venture strategy. Investors benefit through an extended due diligence exercise and favourable risk-reward profiles given the early entry point.

Which African sectors best match CV VC's thesis on trust and decentralisation?

Our investment theme revolves around three key areas and applies to startups from any continent: first, applications built directly on blockchains. Second, we prioritise startups using blockchain to drive broader tech and social megatrends. Third, we also strongly consider service providers and infrastructure players that support the broader blockchain ecosystem.

From a sector point of view, we see a mature dispersion of activity across multiple sectors. Fintech leads the charge, which is in line with the broader African venture landscape and funding allocation. Beyond that, we see unique applications across the technology-enabled subset of agriculture, media, climate, property, mobility, healthcare, education, identity, gaming, and HR. Additionally, we see a focus on blockchain infrastructure development, including developer tooling and business-to-business (B2B) applications.

Given the global risk-off mood, are investors still cautious about Web3 in Africa? If so, why?

There is still some caution among investors when it comes to Web3 in Africa. This caution can be attributed to investors allocating capital based on a spectrum of risk, where blockchain, as an emerging technology and Africa, as an emerging market, are perceived as higher risk and therefore draw increased caution. This is influenced by the current risk-off sentiment globally, driven predominantly by geopolitical factors, and this is not, in our view, a critique of the technology or the market.

Having said this, many investors are intrigued by the potential of blockchain technology and its specific applications for the African continent, and appetite is growing. Investors are watching closely as African founders demonstrate real utility using blockchain to solve core issues like financial inclusion, identity, remittances, and land ownership provenance. 

We believe that as more success stories emerge from the continent, confidence will follow. Our role at CV VC is to be early in that cycle to back the builders today who will shape the narrative of tomorrow.

Do regulatory developments in key African markets matter? Which countries are leading?

Absolutely. Regulatory clarity is essential for economic competitiveness in the Web3 space. Well-defined policies attract risk-tolerant venture capital, as we've seen in Africa's leading all-sector VC hubs of Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa. In contrast, regulatory ambiguity drives talent and capital offshore, undermining trust and stalling innovation.

Investors are also encouraged by the global shifts happening, notably the US moving toward a more friendly stance in 2025. Many African lawmakers are pushing to replace fragmented oversight with clearer frameworks.

StableChain, which is a new layer-one blockchain network built around Tether's USDT stablecoin by a company known as Stable, went live with its mainnet today, alongside the launch of its native STABLE token. This network runs transactions entirely in USDT, which is by far the largest stablecoin in the world, while the STABLE token is used for governance, staking, and validator incentives behind the scenes.

Backed by crypto exchange Bitfinex, PayPal, and many others, Stable aims to focus on the key area of crypto that has gained the most demand and interest from end users, namely stablecoins (in this case, USDT specifically). While much has been made about the endless number of cryptocurrencies that have been launched over the years, the reality is that the vast majority of the decentralized finance (DeFi) activity in the space is built around dollar-pegged tokens, most notably USDT and Circle's USDC.

Stable Mainnet is now live.

Today marks a major step in the evolution of stablecoin payments: the launch of StableChain, the first USDT-native Layer 1 built for high-volume, predictable, real-world settlement.

Over the past decade, the crypto space has grown deeply dependent on these centralized stablecoins. The combined market cap of USDC and USDT alone now exceeds $250 billion, and the success of these tokens underscores a broader trend in crypto where asset issuers and fintechs build increasingly proprietary and centralized infrastructure and reject more decentralized base-layer protocols that have less relevance when so much centralization is found at other layers of the crypto technology stack anyway.

The idea with Stable is to embrace this reality of stablecoin dominance in crypto by building a blockchain that is purpose-built for these centrally issued, dollar-pegged tokens from the ground up.

Similarly, Circle rolled out its Arc blockchain for USDC earlier this year as a dedicated layer-one crypto network for stablecoin apps, using USDC for gas to bypass native crypto networks like Ethereum and Solana. Sony recently joined this wave too, along with countless other financial institutions and tech giants, with plans for a dollar-backed stablecoin for digital content payments. Many of these sorts of moves are intended to let centralized players capture value streams once thought to be promised to open, decentralized crypto protocols.

Heavy reliance on these issuer-controlled stablecoins has stripped much of crypto's decentralization down to not much more than branding or marketing. At the end of the day, the increasingly common layers of centralization found in crypto are making the industry somewhat indistinguishable from traditional fintech. For example, U.S. Bank recently highlighted the appeal of the Stellar network's asset clawback features for its own stablecoin pilot project. These are the exact sort of third-party controls Bitcoin was originally intended to route around.

Indeed, what started as a push for an ostensibly borderless, intermediary-free finance now bolsters U.S. dollar hegemony through pegged tokens while fintech giants erect walled gardens to increase their profits and user activity metrics. This path clearly diverges sharply from Bitcoin's roots. In Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 whitepaper and other early writings, the vision centered on a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminated trusted third parties: no inflation at will, no transaction blocks, no asset grabs.

Launches like Stable, Arc, and Coinbase's Base blockchain reveal how the industry has pivoted toward efficiency over sovereignty to the point where the line between crypto and fintech is becoming increasingly blurred. Due to the longstanding reliance alternative crypto networks like Ethereum have had on stablecoins and other key points of centralization, it's unclear what their value propositions will be if the likes of Tether, Circle, Coinbase, and other major, centralized players in the crypto space can push users over to their own proprietary platforms.

That said, there are some who are sounding the alarm regarding this crisis of purpose in crypto, as indicated by the controversy regarding an Ethereum Foundation researcher's exit for fintech giant Stripe's stablecoin play.

Bitcoin BTC$91,297.38 attempted a late weekend rally, but even those small gains were mostly reversed in early U.S. action Monday, with the price quietly settling in near the $90,000 area for the remainder of the day.

Trading around $90,500 as U.S. stocks closed, bitcoin was lower by about 1% over the past 24 hours.

Altcoin majors also struggled to hold on to their gains. Ethereum's ether ETH$3,147.71 slipped slightly lower, but outperformed a bit and climbed to its strongest relative price against BTC in more than a month. Other notable outperformers were privacy-focused Zcash ZEC$414.59 and institutional-centered blockchain Canton Network (CC), both booking double-digit gains. The broader crypto market, measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, declined 0.8%.

While the crypto action was muted, long duration government bond yields spiked amid fears of trouble in Japanese bonds spilling over to the other markets. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield surged to 4.19%, its highest level in about three months, while U.K. and other European countries' government debt also sold off. Meanwhile, the Japanese 10-year bond yield kept climbing towards 2%, a level not seen in almost two decades.

U.S. equities also turned lower during the day, with the S&P 500 lower by 0.5% and the Nasdaq by 0.3%, weighing on the broader risk appetite.

This week's key event will be the year's last Federal Reserve meeting. While a 25 basis-point cut is fully baked into expectations, messaging about further trajectory or other liquidity measures could stir up volatility on Wednesday.

""Any easing in financial conditions or further weakening in the US dollar could provide tailwinds, while any hawkish surprise around the pace or extent of policy accommodation from the Federal Reserve could amplify downside pressure on crypto markets,"" LMAX market strategist Joel Kruger said in a note.

Despite bitcoin's recent bounce from the November lows, Bitfinex analysts warned that the largest crypto is grappling structural softness and weakening spot demand.

While the S&P 500 is trading near record highs, BTC is stuck rangebound, highlighting a deepening divergence between crypto and traditional risk assets that points to relative weakness, they pointed out in a Monday report.

Bitfinex outlined several key signals reinforcing this view:

All those factors add up to a fragile setup into the year-end, Bitfinex analysts argued.

""With spot demand weakening, the market now faces a meaningfully lighter buy-side backdrop,"" the report said. ""This reduces immediate support for price and increases sensitivity to external shocks, macro-driven volatility and any further tightening in financial conditions.""

A Vitamin Shot Given at Birth Prevents Lethal Brain Bleeds, but More Parents Are Opting Out

Vitamin K injections have prevented deadly brain bleeds in infants for more than 60 years. New research shows refusal rates have recently jumped nearly 80 percent

Pediatric hospitalist Jaspreet Loyal recently cared for a newborn who developed bleeding inside their skull after a home birth. The baby was admitted to the intensive care unit and required a prolonged hospital stay. The cause: vitamin K deficiency—a condition that is almost entirely preventable with a simple shot given at birth.

Such cases may become more common as more people refuse the shot. According to new research published today in JAMA, the rate of vitamin K shot refusals has risen nearly 80 percent in the U.S. between 2017 and 2024. The study, which examined medical records from more than five million births during that time period, found that the proportion of newborns who did not receive the injection climbed from 2.92 percent to 5.18 percent.

The trend comes at a time of growing vaccine hesitancy and science denial. Wellness influencers have fueled skepticism by characterizing the vitamin K shot as unnecessary and questioning its lab-made ingredients, even though they are found in many routine injections. But newborns are born with naturally low levels of vitamin K, a nutrient essential for blood clotting, says Kristan Scott, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and lead author of the new study.

Without the shot, as many as one in 60 babies are at risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, which can cause permanent brain damage or death. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended the injection since 1961, and for more than six decades, the shot has been a quiet success story in newborn medicine.

“We know unequivocally that infants that don't receive vitamin K are at significantly higher risk of getting serious bleeding,” Scott says. His study did not directly measure whether the increase in refusals has led to more bleeding events.

Some online influencers suggest that parents can use oral vitamin K as an alternative to the injection. But Scott says that approach is less reliable—oral vitamin K is less effective at preventing bleeds because it's not absorbed as readily.

The shot itself carries minimal risk, and adverse reactions are rare. “Vitamin K is super safe to give to kids,” Scott notes.

Loyal, who works at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital and has also researched vitamin K refusal, emphasizes that the shot differs fundamentally from a vaccine because it doesn't target a microorganism—it simply supplies an essential vitamin. Her research has identified some of the most common reasons parents cite for refusing the shot, including the belief that its risks outweigh its benefits or the desire for a more “natural” approach.

Although the risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding may seem low, Loyal says, “it's not zero—and why take a chance when we know there is a safe preventative measure?”

Humans are one step closer to traveling at faster-than-light speeds.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In a surprising paper, scientists say they've nailed down a physical model for a warp drive, which flies in the face of what we've long thought about the crazy concept of warp speed travel: that it requires exotic, negative forces.

To best understand what the breakthrough means, you'll need a quick crash course on the far-out idea of traveling through folded space. 

The colloquial term “warp drive” comes from science fiction, most famously Star Trek. The faster-​than-light warp drive of the Federation works by colliding matter and antimatter and converting the explosive energy to propulsion. Star Trek suggests that this extraordinary power alone pushes the ship at faster-than-light speeds. 

Scientists have been studying and theorizing about faster-than-light space travel for decades. One major reason for our interest is pure pragmatism: without warp drive, we're probably never making it to a neighboring star system. The closest such trip is still four years long at light speed.

Our current understanding of warp speed dates back to 1994, when a now-iconic theoretical physicist named Miguel Alcubierre first proposed what we've called the Alcubierre drive ever since.

The Alcubierre drive conforms to Einstein's theory of general relativity to achieve superluminal travel. “By a purely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it,” Alcubierre wrote in his paper's abstract, “motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible.”

Essentially, an Alcubierre drive would expend a tremendous amount of energy—likely more than what's available within the universe—to contract and twist space-time in front of it and create a bubble. Inside that bubble would be an inertial reference frame where explorers would feel no proper acceleration. The rules of physics would still apply within the bubble, but the ship would be localized outside of space.

It might help to think of an Alcubierre drive like the classic “tablecloth and dishes” party trick: The spaceship sits atop the tablecloth of spacetime, the drive pulls the fabric around it, and the ship is situated in a new place relative to the fabric. 

Alcubierre describes spacetime expanding on one side of the ship and contracting on the other, thanks to that enormous amount of energy and a requisite amount of exotic matter—in this case, negative energy. 

Some scientists have criticized the Alcubierre drive, however, because it requires too much mass and negative energy for humans to ever seriously construct a warp-based propulsion system. NASA has been trying to build a physical warp drive through Eagleworks Laboratories for most of the last decade, but hasn't yet made any significant strides.

This brings us to the new study, which scientists in the Advanced Propulsion Laboratory (APL) at Applied Physics just published in the peer-reviewed journal Classical and Quantum Gravity. In the report, the APL team unveils the world's first model for a physical warp drive—one that doesn't require negative energy.

The study is understandably pretty thick (read the whole thing here), but here's the gist of the model: Where the existing paradigm uses negative energy—exotic matter that doesn't exist and can't be generated within our current understanding of the universe—this new concept uses floating bubbles of spacetime rather than floating ships in spacetime.

The physical model uses almost none of the negative energy and capitalizes on the idea that spacetime bubbles can behave almost however they like. And, the APL scientists say, this isn't even the only other way warp speed could work. Making a model that's at least physically comprehensible is a big step. 

Plus, Alcubierre himself has endorsed the new model, which is like having Albert Einstein show up to your introductory physics class. 

Here's a helpful video in which Sabine Hossenfelder, a Professor and Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, breaks down the findings:

Of course, there's one gigantic caveat here: The concept in this paper is still in the “far future” zone of possibility, made of ideas that scientists still don't know how to construct in any sense. 

“While the mass requirements needed for such modifications are still enormous at present,” the APL scientists write, “our work suggests a method of constructing such objects based on fully understood laws of physics.”

But while a physical drive may not be a reality today, tomorrow, or even a century from now—let's hope it's not that long—with this exciting new model, warp speed travel is now a lot more likely in a much shorter timespan than we previously thought.

The global type 2 diabetes epidemic is a major health crisis. Although the microbiome has roles in the onset of insulin resistance (IR), low-grade inflammation and diabetes, the microbial compounds controlling these processes remain to be discovered. Here, we show that the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) decouples inflammation and IR from diet-induced obesity by inhibiting interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), a central kinase in the Toll-like receptor pathway sensing danger signals. TMA blunts TLR4 signalling in primary human hepatocytes and peripheral blood monocytic cells and rescues mouse survival after lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Genetic deletion and chemical inhibition of IRAK4 result in metabolic and immune improvements in high-fat diets. Remarkably, our results suggest that TMA—unlike its liver co-metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide, which is associated with cardiovascular disease—improves immune tone and glycemic control in diet-induced obesity. Altogether, this study supports the emerging role of the kinome in the microbial–mammalian chemical crosstalk.

Globally, diabetes affects 529 million individuals1, claiming 1.6 million lives per year according to the World Health Organization. IR is a multifactorial condition and is now increasingly common owing to, among other factors, the increase in prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle, Western-style foods and obesity. IR is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases2. One of the hallmarks of these disorders is the early development of chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation3. The interaction between a high-fat diet (HFD) and the gut microbiome has a strong impact on the onset of IR4,5,6: bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and dietary fats trigger low-grade inflammation2 through activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a process called metabolic endotoxemia7.

This process is supported by complex communication that occurs between the gut microbiota and the innate immune system8, with consequences on metabolic homoeostasis9. Although some of the functional signalling molecules mediating microbial–mammalian chemical crosstalk have been characterized, a limited number of metabolite classes and their targets have been identified (G-protein-coupled10 and nuclear receptors11). However, it has been hypothesized that microbial metabolites potentially affect other pharmacological target classes, such as kinases12. In previous studies, we and others have identified a family of microbiome-associated metabolites, methylamines, associated with IR, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease13 and atherosclerosis14, but their mechanisms of action on mammalian hosts remain unclear.

TMA is one of the most abundant microbial metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. Previously, we reported that TMA may be associated with IR12. TMA results from microbial metabolism of dietary choline, carnitine and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)15,16,17,18,19 before being absorbed and N-oxidized into TMAO by hepatic flavin-containing mono-oxygenase 3 (FMO3)20. After initial reports associating TMAO with adverse cardiovascular outcomes13,16, it has since emerged that FMO3 inactivation was beneficial for several metabolic outcomes21,22,23,24, strongly suggesting that TMA and TMAO have distinct biological roles.

Here, we decipher the role of TMA in the microbiota–host kinome chemical crosstalk in IR through (1) identification of gut-derived microbial metabolites associated with HFD-induced impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), IR and obesity; (2) pharmacological target screening of discriminant microbial metabolites; and (3) mechanistic validation of the pathophysiological relevance of pharmacological interactions with in vitro and in vivo models. Using this approach, we discovered a mechanism by which gut microbial TMA acts as an IRAK4 inhibitor and directly improves the host immune and metabolic tone.

We initially carried out longitudinal pathophysiological monitoring in a cohort of C57BL/6J mice (n = 5 for HFD and n = 6 for chow diet (CHD)), which rapidly developed obesity and IGT when fed a 65% kCal HFD with a range of macronutrient and micronutrient differences compared to CHD (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b, Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Liver transcriptomics (n = 5–6 per diet group) identified 2,084 significantly (false discovery rate of <0.1) differentially expressed genes between CHD-fed and HFD-fed mice (Extended Data Fig. 1c, Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). Gene ontology and signalling pathway impact analyses (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 2–4) demonstrated upregulation of protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas carbohydrate metabolism, circadian rhythm and AMPK signalling were significantly inhibited, consistent with existing literature25,26. Surprisingly, inflammation-associated pathways were not differentially affected: expression of genes coding for acute-phase serum amyloid A proteins, Saa1 and Saa2, which are upregulated in response to acute inflammation and associated with type 2 diabetes, was reduced, whereas expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Il6 and Il1β was not significant (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 4). This is in contrast to established knowledge, as low-grade inflammation is one of the key features associated with IR2,6 and HFD27. In addition to the percentage of fat content as a macronutrient, we therefore looked for variation in micronutrients and microbial metabolites that may contribute to this phenotype by performing metabolic profiling of the urinary metabolome of this mouse cohort (CHD and HFD, four time-points) by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy, followed by multivariate modelling. Our analysis showed that diet is the main factor influencing the metabolic profiles, followed by age (Extended Data Fig. 1d), with the model's goodness-of-prediction parameters being highly significant upon permutation testing (Extended Data Fig. 1e). The urinary metabolic signature of HFD feeding compared to CHD was mainly associated with TMA excretion (Fig. 1c), consistent with our previous reports using this diet13,28. We used variance components analysis to decompose the contribution of diet and age to the excretion of these three metabolites, showing that the HFD contribution overwhelms the contribution of age (Fig. 1d). Given that the HFD contains >15 g of choline per kg of diet, we then investigated whether supplementation of this micronutrient could modulate the metabolic and immune variation in response to HFD feeding.

Male mice were weaned at 3 weeks and fed a CHD diet before being randomly assigned to a CHD group (n = 68) or HFD group (n = 47) and monitored at 5 months of age. a, Effect of HFD feeding on GTT. b, Volcano plot of differentially expressed liver genes, highlighting that Saa1 and Saa2 are downregulated in HFD after 4 months of HFD.

To test the effect of choline supplementation itself on glucose tolerance and IR in an HFD context, we initiated a series of in vivo studies. We first fed C57BL/6J mice with a 65% kCal HFD containing 2 g kg−1 or 17 g kg−1 of choline (that is, LC-HFD and HC-HFD, respectively; Fig. 1e–n). To evaluate metabolic homoeostasis, we performed glucose tolerance tests (GTTs), which displayed a similar pattern with normalization of cumulative glycemia on HC-HFD compared to LC-HFD (Fig. 1e,f). Body weight was significantly increased in mice fed a LC-HFD from weaning until 5 months of age compared to mice fed a CHD and, remarkably, compared to mice fed HC-HFD (Fig. 1g), which was not related to food intake (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We then profiled circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNF (Fig. 1h–j) and phosphorylation of NF-κB regulating their transcription (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c), which was also suggestive of an improvement of HFD-induced inflammation by choline supplementation.

To document the effect of choline supplementation on choline-related metabolic pathways, we further refined our isotopic quantification using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS)29,30 to evaluate plasma concentrations of choline-derived and carnitine-derived metabolites leading to TMA and TMAO (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). An orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) model significantly segregates the three treatment groups at 5 months of age (that is, 4 months of HFD) and highlights a choline supplementation effect on the first predictive component (Fig. 1k,l). Quantifications all reflect an increase in TMA and TMAO in the HC-HFD in line with choline supplementation (Fig. 1m,n). In particular, the circulating TMA levels were similar in the CHD and the LC-HFD (0.38 µM in CHD vs 0.3 µM in LC-HFD) and were about 20 times lower than in the HC-HFD (5.9 µM). These results depict an increased microbial conversion of choline into TMA in our HC-HFD, an observation already made in a previous study13. These results suggest that TMA could mediate the metabolic and immune benefits of choline supplementation.

To further assess the impact of choline supplementation on metabolic homoeostasis and low-grade inflammation in HFD contexts, we performed a second experiment, feeding C57BL/6J mice a 60% kcal HFD with a time frame comparable to those used in subsequent experimental designs using osmotic minipumps for constant subcutaneous TMA delivery. GTTs and weekly body weights showed a similar trend after 8 weeks of HFD feeding (Fig. 2a–d). Choline supplementation not only improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 2a,b) but also the Matsuda Index (Fig. 2c), a marker for IR derived from oral GTTs31. The normalization of insulin sensitivity was confirmed through insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) and insulin-induced hepatic Akt phosphorylation assays (Fig. 2e–h and Extended Data Fig. 3f for p-Akt/Akt ratio correction with β-actin). Notably, the normalization of insulin-induced hepatic AKT phosphorylation assays was primarily associated with a reduction of the basal level of p-Akt in HC-HFD compared to LC-HFD observed in saline conditions, demonstrating the reduction of IR (Fig. 2g). Indeed, it has been previously demonstrated that HFD increased the basal levels of p-Akt, and this contributes to IR32. We further characterized that HFD feeding increased hepatic NF-κB phosphorylation compared to CHD, which was normalized by choline supplementation, although this could also be a result of variable NF-κB protein levels between samples (Fig. 2i,j), a pattern that was also observed for expression of acute-phase proteins that are typically upregulated in response to tissue inflammation33 (Saa1, Saa2 and Saa3; Fig. 2k–m).

To test whether the beneficial effects of choline supplementation are mediated by its microbial product TMA, we sought to block bacterial TMA production in HC-HFD-fed mice both non-specifically and specifically using a wide-spectrum antibiotics cocktail or 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), inhibiting microbial TMA-lyase34, respectively. We first confirmed the functional blockage of TMA production in mice fed a HC-HFD, resulting in a drastic drop in circulating and excreted TMA and TMAO following 1% DMB administration (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). In accordance with our hypothesis, both antibiotic and DMB treatments abolished the effects of choline supplementation-induced improvements in HFD, in particular for glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity (as suggested by the Matsuda index; Fig. 3a–c and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f) and hepatic insulin sensitivity, as shown by the absence of a beneficial effect of choline supplementation on insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3d,e and Extended Data Fig. 4g for β-actin normalization). The metabolic improvements associated with chemical TMA synthesis blockage were not a result of changes in body weight gain (Extended Data Fig. 4e), thereby strongly suggesting that the effects on glucose metabolism induced by inhibiting bacterial TMA production in HC-HFD were decoupled from obesity.

a–e, C57BL/6J mice (5 weeks old) were fed LC-HFD or LC-HFD supplemented with choline (n = 10). Two strategies were used in parallel to block TMA production from choline by the gut microbiota, using either 1% DMB in the diet or an antibiotic treatment. a, Plasma glucose concentration during an ipGTT. b, Area under the curve of the plasma glucose concentration during an ipGTT. c, Matsuda insulin sensitivity index calculated from the ipGTT. d,e, Western blot analysis of liver Akt phosphorylation. f–l, Mice were weaned at 3 weeks and fed a LC-HFD before being fitted with osmotic minipumps delivering a chronic circulating dose of TMA (0.1 mM) for 6 weeks (n = 9 saline HFD, n = 8 TMA HFD), with each data point representing a single mouse. f, Plasma glucose concentration during an ipGTT. g, Area under the curve of the plasma glucose concentration during an ipGTT. h, Matsuda insulin sensitivity index calculated from the ipGTT. i, Quantification of circulating IL-6. j–l, Expression of hepatic acute-phase inflammation protein markers Saa1 (j), Saa2 (k) and Saa3 (l).

To further confirm whether TMA mediates the beneficial effects of choline supplementation, we chronically treated LC-HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice with TMA for 6 weeks using subcutaneous osmotic minipumps and assessed their immunometabolism. We confirmed that chronic TMA treatment at 0.1 mM in a LC-HFD did not affect body weight gain (Extended Data Fig. 4h) but effectively normalized glucose homoeostasis and the Matsuda Index, a readout of insulin sensitivity (Fig. 3f–h and Extended Data Fig. 4i). TMA treatment also improved the pro-inflammatory response to HFD feeding and hepatic expression of acute-phase proteins Saa1, Saa2 and Saa3 (Fig. 3i–l). These results suggest that chronic TMA treatment decouples body weight gain and adiposity from low-grade inflammation and glucose homoeostasis, thereby mimicking the immune and metabolic benefits observed in choline supplementation.

To identify a direct mechanism linking TMA to metabolic and immune benefits in HFD-fed mice, we sought to identify its host pharmacological targets. The kinome, made of 518 kinases encoded in the human genome12, represents a repertoire of critical signal transduction switches for metabolic homoeostasis and inflammation. To discover specific physical interactions, we screened TMA against a panel of 456 clinically relevant human kinases using a high-throughput assay35,36 (see Methods) and identified five preliminary hits for TMA (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 5). We then generated multiple-dose binding curves between TMA and each hit and confirmed that TMA physically binds IRAK4 (dissociation constant (Kd) = 14 nM; Extended Data Fig. 5a) but not the other four preliminary hits (flat dissociation curves with no Kd fit in Extended Data Fig. 5b–e, suggesting no physical binding was observed). Given that Kd only addresses a physical interaction in its simplest form (that is, binding), we functionally tested TMA as an IRAK4 inhibitor by quantifying IRAK4 kinase activity in the presence of ATP and increasing doses of TMA (see Methods) to derive a half-maximal relative inhibitory constant (IC50 = 3.4 µM; Fig. 4b) and an inhibitory constant Ki= 0.7 µM (see Methods). We also confirmed that choline, TMAO and DMB do not inhibit IRAK4 kinase activity (Extended Data Fig. 5f–h), and further verified that TMA does not inhibit IRAK1 (Extended Data Fig. 5i), as suggested by the phenotypic convergence of Irak1−/− mice fed a HFD, which were shown to have metabolic improvements similar to TMA treatment37. Nonetheless, this screen, combined with purified kinase activity assays, suggests that IRAK4 is the specific kinase target for TMA, which we next validated using a range of in vitro and in vivo experiments.

IRAK4 is a central kinase in the TLR pathway, sensing bacterial invasion and promoting a pyretic pro-inflammatory response in infectious contexts38,39. To further corroborate the inhibitory action of TMA on IRAK4 on innate immunity, we studied its effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokine secretion and NF-κB signalling in response to LPS stimulation, a process exclusively mediated by IRAK4 downstream of TLR4, as previously demonstrated38. Consistent with this previous work, pre-treatment with TMA for 30 min dose-dependently blunted IL-6 and TNF secretion by PBMCs challenged with LPS after 4 h (Fig. 4c,d). Moreover, IL-6 and TNF secretion was virtually abolished by pre-treatment with the IRAK4-specific inhibitor PF06650833 (ref. 40) as an additional control (100 nM). Conversely, TMA (100 µM) or the IRAK4-specific inhibitor PF06650833 (100 nM) had no significant impact on TNF secretion by PBMCs stimulated by phorbol-ester/Ionomycin (Fig. 4e), similarly to human B cells harbouring IRAK4-inactivating mutations41. Taken together, these findings support our assertion that TMA acts through IRAK4 and further validate the functional inhibition of IRAK4 by TMA in innate immune cells. In addition, TMA (0.1 mM) significantly reduced IRAK1 phosphorylation at a site (Thr209) phosphorylated by IRAK4 (ref. 42) upon short-term stimulation of PBMCs with LPS (up to 60 min; Fig. 4f). TMA also inhibited Thr209IRAK1 phosphorylation dose-dependently after LPS stimulation of PBMCs (Fig. 4g) and, similarly, TMA time-dependently and dose-dependently suppressed NF-κBp65 phosphorylation in LPS-challenged PBMCs (Fig. 4h,i). In agreement with the cellular PBMC experiments, a single TMA dose significantly improved mouse survival in a 24 h LPS septic shock experiment (Fig. 4j), showing similar protection to IRAK4 kinase-inactive mice43.

We then sought to test IRAK4 inhibition in a HFD context. The main free fatty acid in our HFD is palmitate, a saturated free fatty acid triggering TLR4 signalling. Therefore, we used a primary human hepatocyte model of low-grade inflammation and IR44.

Under basal conditions (0 min), TMA (0.1 mM, 30 min) pre-treatment resulted in a significant decrease in pThr345/Ser346IRAK4/IRAK4, pThr209IRAK1/IRAK1 and pSer176/180IKKαβ/IKKβ. Palmitic acid (200 μM, 60 min) administration resulted in increased pThr209IRAK1/IRAK1, pSer176/180IKKαβ/IKKβ and pSer536NF-κBp65/NF-κBp65 (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d), which were normalized by TMA treatment. The TMA effect was significant as determined by a 2-way ANOVA for pThr345/Ser346IRAK4/IRAK4 (P = 0.04), pThr209IRAK1/IRAK1 (P = 0.03) and pSer176/180IKKαβ/IKKβ (P < 0.001). Normalization of the phosphorylation ratios in the TLR4 pathway by TMA resulted in a normalization of palmitic acid-induced IL-6 secretion in the cell medium after 4 h (Extended Data Fig. 6e). TMA also prevented the negative impact of palmitic acid (200 μM, 4 h) on insulin action (specifically on insulin-induced pSer473Akt1/Akt1), indicating a beneficial effect of TMA on insulin signalling (Extended Data Fig. 6f). TMA also tended to decrease pThr183/Tyr185SAPK/JNK/SAPK/JNK induced by palmitic acid (200 μM, 60 min; Extended Data Fig. 5j) but had no significant effect on p38MAPK (Extended Data Fig. 5k). Collectively, our results demonstrate that TMA is an IRAK4 kinase inhibitor ameliorating LPS inflammatory signalling in PBMCs and mice and normalizing palmitate-induced low-grade inflammation and aberrant insulin signalling in vitro, requiring further assessment in Irak4−/− mice.

IRAK4 is a key kinase required for defence against pyogenic infections in acute contexts38,39. To further test whether this kinase has a role in HFD-induced chronic low-grade inflammation and glucose homoeostasis, we fed 5-week-old Irak4−/− mice45 and wild-type littermates on a C57BL/6J background (Extended Data Fig. 7a for genotyping) a LC-HFD, to avoid potential confounding effects from TMA for 8 weeks before assessing circulating cytokines, expression of hepatic inflammatory genes and acute-phase markers and metabolic homoeostasis (Fig. 5a–h). Irak4−/− mice presented improved glycemic control compared to wild-type littermates (Fig. 5a,b). Likewise, the inflammatory response to LC-HFD observed in wild-type mice was obliterated in Irak4−/− littermates (Fig. 5c–g). There was a similar trend for Saa3 (Fig. 5h), but there was no effect on body weight gains (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Hence, similarly to TMA treatment, genetic ablation of IRAK4 abolishes the HFD-induced pro-inflammatory response and IGT, thereby decoupling obesity from IGT and low-grade inflammation with a similar phenotype to Irak1 deficiency37.

Given that the Irak4−/− mice lack the whole protein, we compared the knockout phenotype with the phenotype of PF06650833, a recently discovered chemical inhibitor of the human IRAK4 protein40 that has shown promising results in a phase-I trial for rheumatoid arthritis46. Treatment with PF06650833 improved body weight in LC-HFD mice (Extended Data Fig. 7c). This inhibitor also yielded significant improvements in plasma glycemia at the latter time-points of the GTT and ITT, and in cumulative glycemia (Fig. 5i–l), which was mirrored by an increase in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5m,n and Extended Data Fig. 7d for β-actin normalization). These results collectively show that specific chemical inhibition of IRAK4 leads to significant improvements in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity and insulin signalling. Moreover, the data suggest that IRAK4 could constitute a clinically relevant target in IR and related disorders.

The discovery that TMA is a kinase inhibitor controlling IRAK4, a central kinase involved in innate immunity, is a major finding that provides an attractive mechanism for the metabolic and immune improvements observed with choline supplementation in HFD contexts (Fig. 6).

TMA is synthesized from dietary choline (1) by the gut microbiota (2) and specifically inhibits IRAK4 activity (3). This inhibition blunts the TLR signalling pathway (induced by LPS and saturated free fatty acids), leading to an improvement of metabolic response to HFD (for example, glucose homoeostasis).

IRAK4 is the first regulatory checkpoint downstream of MyD88, the adaptor protein connecting IRAK4 to at least six TLRs sensing bacterial compounds or components47. IRAK4 deficiency is associated with bacterial infections in humans39 and in mice48. Consistent with the involvement of the TLR signalling pathway at the crossroads between gut microbiota and dietary lipids49,50, IRAK4 deletion and its inhibition by TMA and PF06650833 (ref. 40) rescued HFD-induced low-grade inflammation and IR3,51,52, highlighting new and unexpected roles for this microbial metabolite and its target kinase in immunometabolism. The relative IC50 (3.4 µM) that we determined is half the plasma isotopic quantifications obtained by UPLC–MS/MS in the HFD group supplemented with choline. These quantifications are comparable to circulating TMA levels previously reported in normal human plasma, ranging between 0.42 and 48 µM (refs. 53,54), which makes this IC50 particularly relevant with respect to pathophysiological mechanisms: dosing mice with 0.1 mM TMA was sufficient to improve inflammatory and metabolic responses. TMA can therefore be considered a ‘microbial signalling metabolite'55, sending a negative feedback signal to a pathway triggered by the influx of saturated free fatty acids in HFD contexts. This mechanism participates in maintaining a low immunological footprint and improved metabolic homoeostasis in a symbiotic relationship. The role of TMA as an IRAK4 inhibitor could, for instance, explain some of the beneficial effects reported for choline supplementation in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease56 as well as the improved IR observed in those consuming higher choline diets in a healthy, genetically uniform human population57. Altogether, our results on IRAK4 inhibition and ablation provide further insight into the phenotypic convergence between Myd88, Irak4 and Irak1 knockout mouse models37,58, suggesting that the gut microbiota, through TMA, proceeds with a targeted ‘hijacking' of the TLR signal transduction machinery to the host's benefit, resulting in metabolic and immune improvements.

Our finding that TMA improves metabolic health in the context of HFD is surprising, given the extensive evidence linking higher levels of circulating TMAO (after phase-1 N-oxidation of TMA in the liver) with worse cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in patients with established atherosclerosis and thrombosis14. Our results show that the TMA-lyase inhibitor DMB blocks TMA production and abrogates the metabolic benefits brought about by choline supplementation in HC-HFD mice, suggesting that the benefits come from the conversion of choline to TMA.

Our findings are supported by the discovery that in diabetic mice, knockdown of the liver gene (Fmo3) that converts TMA to TMAO—an intervention that would increase TMA levels—improves IR and attenuates atherosclerotic burden23. Similarly, in an epidemiological study in a genetically homogeneous population, higher choline consumption was associated with improved insulin sensitivity57.

Our work is consistent with the idea that TMA and TMAO may well have contrasting roles that are context-dependent and mechanism-dependent.

To illustrate context dependence, TMAO has different effects based on the insult. It has been linked to poor cardiovascular outcomes in humans; however, independently of its role in cardiovascular disease, it increases kidney fibrosis59, beneficially reduces blood–brain barrier permeability60 and is associated with improved survival outcomes in septic ventilated patients61. Moreover, TMAO levels in healthy adults did not predict future coronary events in a 10-year follow-up study62, suggesting that in this context, TMAO might often require underlying pathology for its detrimental effects to become overt. Contrary to coronary heart disease, in which significant evidence points towards a detrimental role by TMAO63 for obesity-driven IR and dysregulated glucose handling (which is the main focus of this work), the role of TMAO is unclear, with conflicting human studies pointing to protective28,64, detrimental65 or insignificant66,67 TMAO effects. Mice fed a choline-enriched (1%) CHD showed IGT compared to those on a CHD and impaired β cell function, owing to increased plasma TMAO68, in an apparent contradiction to our results in HFD-challenged mice. We have demonstrated a similar diet-dependent phenomenon with the host-microbiome co-metabolite hippurate, whereby hippurate improved glucose handling and IR only in mice fed a HFD69. Similarly, TMA has shown context dependence, negatively affecting the blood–brain barrier60 and endothelial vasoconstriction70.

To illustrate the mechanism dependence, TMAO augments Ca2+-mediated platelet aggregation after thrombin treatment. TMAO also binds to and activates purified protein kinase RNA-like ER linase (PERK), while structurally related metabolites such as choline do not71. This proatherothrombic mechanism may well explain the adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with TMAO13,16. Conversely, it has been shown that FMO3 inactivation, preventing N-oxidation of TMA and therefore increasing TMA compared to TMAO, leads to several beneficial metabolic outcomes21,22,23,24. Consistent with our observations, Fmo3 deletion prevented hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in mice and is considered a target for dysmetabolism23. Such a protective role for FMO3 inactivation cannot be explained by TMAO removal alone and therefore points to an independent mechanism for TMA.

Our discovery that TMA binds to and inhibits IRAK4, whereas TMAO does not, provides an unexpected and independent mechanism of action for TMA. Our observations on IRAK4 inhibition by TMA and in Irak4 knockout mice are consistent with observations in Myd88 and Irak1 knockout mice, resulting in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Collectively, we submit that our study reveals a context-dependent and target-specific mechanism of action independently of the proatherothrombic mechanism reported for TMAO in an HFD context. Modifying the TMA/TMAO ratio, for example, through FMO3 inhibition, would remove the deleterious proatherothrombic effect reported for TMAO and, through increased TMA concentration, would also blunt low-grade inflammation and improve glucose homoeostasis, in accordance with both mechanisms.

Our study is not without limitations. Notably, the derived IC50 from the purified kinase activity assay was approximately 250-fold higher than the Kd derived from the kinase screen. This may be a result of (1) the different properties reported upon by the different assay (physical binding for Kd, activity for half-maximal inhibition for IC50); (2) the experimental design of the assays (IRAK4 bound to a drug-ligand versus ATP binding); (3) different kinase expression systems (bacterial E. coli versus insect Sf9 cells) and therefore potentially diverging IRAK4 catalytic activities (see Methods). Furthermore, the kinase screen tested 456 kinases out of the 518 kinases identified in the human kinome12, leaving the possibility that one of the 62 unscreened kinases could be indirectly involved, regardless of our focus on IRAK4-mediated LPS-signalling and HFD-signalling, which is consistent with established literature. Additionally, for the IRAK4 activity kinase assay, we used a relatively low ATP concentration (50 µM), which is orders of magnitude lower than the concentration in cells. Moreover, we did not calculate Ki at varying ATP concentrations. Instead, we used an IRAK4-ATP Km derived from the literature (Methods), which may have affected the accuracy of the Ki that we report (0.7 µM). Using more stringent conditions (Ki of 3 µM, ATP Km of 500 mM and assuming a cellular ATP concentration of 1–5 mM) would result in a cellular TMA IC50 for IRAK4 in the range of 9–30 µM, at the high end of physiological concentrations for TMA. We previously demonstrated in animals that plasma TMA concentrations can dramatically increase after a meal19, suggesting that TMA effects could be observed at the postprandial phase. Together with our findings here, this highlights how different meals rich in TMA precursors can affect plasma TMA levels, which will be tested in a human dietary intervention study. Despite the intrinsic limitations of the kinase assays, our work highlights the pathophysiological relevance of IRAK4 inhibition by TMA in two distinct cellular models (primary human hepatocytes and PBMCs) and four in vivo mouse models (LPS septic shock, HC-HFD, TMA supplementation and Irak4 knockout) with TMA concentrations comparable to those found in human plasma, making these results biologically meaningful.

In conclusion, through the combination of ex vivo, in vitro and in vivo approaches, we reveal a unique mechanism in which TMA acts as a gut microbial signalling metabolite inhibiting IRAK4, a central molecular target in the TLR pathway, thereby allowing the gut microbiota to control HFD-induced pro-inflammatory response(s) and IR. The kinome represents a key repertoire of regulatory host targets for microbial signals, and the uncharted microbiome–kinome crosstalk requires further investigation. Our work can guide human trials in which the efficacy of IRAK4 inhibitors available for human use or dietary interventions that increase TMA bioavailability can be evaluated in the context of obesity and IR. Moreover, given that IR is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease in humans72, our work uncovers a strategy to alleviate obesity-associated increased cardiovascular risk. By highlighting the physiological and therapeutic roles of TMA and IRAK4 on HFD-induced low-grade inflammation and IR, we anticipate that its immunomodulatory properties extend past IR to a wider range of human pathologies involving TLR signalling and modulation of innate immunity.

All experimental procedures involving mice were carried out in accordance with UK Home Office, Canadian Council on Animal Care, the Ethics Committee of the French Research Ministry (authorization number 00486.01), Belgian Law of May 29, 2013 regarding the protection of laboratory animals (agreement number LA1230314) and local guidelines on animal welfare and license conditions and the University of Oxford, University of Ottawa, Université Pierre et Marie Curie and Université catholique de Louvain guidelines on animal welfare.

PBMCs were isolated by our established method73, following local ethical approval from Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (19IC5372). Human peripheral blood samples (32 ml) were collected from donors in BD Vacutainer Cell Preparation Tubes containing Sodium Heparin/Ficoll (BD Biosciences). PBMCs were separated by centrifugation at 1600g for 30 min at room temperature (20–22 °C), followed by three washing steps with PBS and 10% FBS (LabTech) and centrifuged at 520 RCF for 10 min after each wash. Viability was measured using the Alamar Blue assay. Donors were females, aged between 25 and 32 years. All subjects were healthy volunteers by self-declaration and provided written informed consent.

Human PBMCs (1 × 105 per condition in duplicate), freshly isolated as described above, were serum-starved in 0.1% v/v FCS RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, R7638) in the presence of TMA (Sigma-Aldrich, 72761) or the IRAK4 inhibitor PF06650833 (0.5 μM; Tocris, 6373) for 30 min, as indicated in the corresponding figures. PBMCs were subsequently stimulated with 1 μg ml−1 LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, L2630) for 4 h (37 °C, 5% CO2). For the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin stimulation experiments, human PBMCs isolated as above (1 × 105 per condition) pre-incubated with TMAO (100 μM), PF06650833 (0.5 μM) or vehicle as indicated for 30 min were then stimulated with 50 ng ml−1 PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, 79346) and 1 μg ml−1 ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, I0634) for 4 h. Next, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (200g for 10 min), and supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until further use. IL-6 and TNF were measured in the media diluted 1:10 in RPMI-1640 using the DuoSet ELISA kits (R&D, DY206 and DY210, respectively) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For PMA/ionomycin TNF measurements, the media were undiluted. For all treatments, n = 4 biological repeats.

Freshly isolated human PBMCs (1 × 106 per ml per condition) were added to 96-well plates coated with L-poly-lysine for 30 min (100 ng ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich, P4707) in RPMI-1640 containing 20% FCS and were left to attach to the wells overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The following day, media were discarded and cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI-1640 containing 100 μM TMA, or RPMI-1640 vehicle for 30 min. PBMCs were then stimulated with LPS (1 μg ml−1) for up to 60 min (times indicated in the corresponding figure legends). At the end of the stimulation, PBMCs were fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, F8775) at room temperature for 20 min. Phosphorylation of IRAK1 (at Thr209) or NF-κBp65 (at Ser536) was determined in fixed PBMCs using commercially available ELISA kits (LSBio, LS-F1401-1 or LS-F891-1, respectively) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Readings were normalized to the levels of total IRAK1 protein determined in sister wells, which were treated identically. The dose-dependent impact of TMA (see corresponding figures) on phosphorylation levels of IRAK1 or NF-κBp65 upon LPS (1 µg ml−1) stimulation of PBMCs (for 10 min or 15 min, respectively) was also determined using the commercially available kits from LSBio as described above.

Cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes were commercially sourced (Innoprot) and cultured with hepatocytes medium (Innoprot) supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% hepatocytes growth supplement (mixture of growth factors, hormones and proteins necessary for culture of primary hepatocytes) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin and streptomycin. Human hepatocytes were grown on poly-L-lysine pre-coated cell dishes at 37 °C and a 5% CO2 atmosphere following the manufacturer's recommendations. The following experiments were performed 24 h after seeding: first, palmitic acid (200 μM) administration (0 and 60 min) with or without TMA (0.1 mM, 30 min) pre-treatment, plus co-administration during palmitic acid exposure were assayed. The palmitic acid solution was prepared as previously reported44,74. In this experiment, the effect of palmitic acid and TMA on IRAK1, IRAK4, NF-κBp65, IKKαβ, SAPK/JNK and p38MAPK activity was analysed. In a second experiment, the effect of TMA (0.1 mM, 30 min) pre-treatment plus co-administration during vehicle or palmitic acid exposure for 4 h on insulin action and on IL-6 release was tested. Insulin action was evaluated by measuring pSer473Akt1/Akt1 after insulin (100 nM, 10 min) stimuli.

pThr209IRAK1, total IRAK1, pSer536NF-κBp65, total NF-κBp65, pSer473AKT1, total AKT1 and GAPDH (as an endogenous control) were measured with specific colourimetric cell-based ELISA Kits (Assay Biotechnology Company, CytoGlow IRAK1 (CBP1425), CytoGlow NF-κBp65 (CBP1633) and CytoGlow AKT1 (CBP1490), following the manufacturer's instructions. For data analysis, the optical density of target proteins (read at 450 nm) was normalized with cell nuclei crystal violet staining (read at 595 nm), which was proportional to cell counts. The analysis of cell-based assays was performed in a blind manner.

pThr345/Ser346IRAK4/IRAK4, pSer176/180IKKαβ/IKKβ, pThr183/Tyr185SAPK/JNK and pThr180/Tyr182p38MAPK/p38MAPK were determined by western blot. In brief, hepatocyte proteins were directly extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cellular debris and lipids were eliminated by centrifugation of the solubilized samples at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, recovering the soluble fraction. Protein concentration was determined using the RC/DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). RIPA protein extracts (20 μg) were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by conventional procedures. Membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against the following proteins: pThr345/Ser346IRAK4 (11927), IRAK4 (4363), pSer176/180IKKαβ (2694), IKKβ (8943), pThr183/Tyr185SAPK/JNK (4668), SAPK/JNK (9258), pThr180/Tyr182p38MAPK (9215) and p38MAPK (9212), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and β-actin (sc-47778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by chemiluminescence, and quantification of protein expression was performed using Scion Image software. IL-6 concentration in hepatocyte media was measured using Human IL-6 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, D6050). All experiments were performed with at least three sample replicates.

All experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the University of Oxford. Male mice from a C57BL/6J inbred strain were bred in our animal facility by using a stock originating from The Jackson Laboratory. At 5 weeks of age, groups of eight to ten mice were transferred to a 40% w/w HFD (65% kcal) (Special Diets Services, 824155b), containing 32% lard and 8% corn oil, whereas control groups remained on a normal carbohydrate (CHD) diet containing 5% fat, 19% protein and 3.5% fibre (B&K rat and mouse pelleted diet, B&K Universal) for up to 6 months. Detailed diet formulations were published previously13 and are summarized in Supplementary Table 6.

Mice were housed under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle. For physiological profiling, several mouse groups fed CHD or HFD were tested to assess the consistency of results and discard any impact of potential batch effects. Intraperitoneal GTTs were performed on 2, 3, 5 and 7-month-old mice after an overnight fast, as previously published75 (see also metabolic phenotyping below). Then, 4 days after the GTT, 24 h urinary samples (09:00–21:00 h) were collected from mice maintained in individual metabolic cages. Urinary samples collected in a solution of 1% (wt/vol) sodium azide were centrifuged to remove solid particles and kept at −80 °C until assayed. After an overnight fast, mice were killed by exsanguination. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until 1H-NMR analysis.

At 5 weeks of age, mice were fed either a CHD containing 2 g of choline per kg of diet (Research Diets, D12450J), a LC-HFD containing 2 g of choline per kg of diet (Research Diets, D12492), a HC-HFD containing 17 g of choline per kg of diet (Research Diets, D16100401), a HC-HFD containing 1% of DMB or a HC-HFD combined with a cocktail of antibiotics (0.5 g l−1 vancomycin hydrochloride, 1 g l−1 neomycin trisulfate, 1 g l−1 metronidazole, 1 g l−1 ampicillin sodium) in drinking bottles (n = 6–10 per group) for 8 weeks (see diet formulations in Supplementary Table 6). Mice were then killed by decapitation, and organs were dissected and weighed.

Irak4−/− mice on a C57BL/6J background, as previously described38,45, were bred with C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory), and the F1 offspring were subsequently bred to produce the Irak4−/− mice and wild-type littermates used for this study. Mice were bred and genotyped at the Animal Facility of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. The following primers were used for genotyping. Irak4 knockout, 5′-TGAATGGAAGGATTGGAGCTACGGGGGT-3′; Irak4 common, 5′-GAACACGCTCCCAGGTCTCTTTCCAAC-3′; and Irak4 wild-type, 5′-TCTTCTACCTGAAATATGAAAGATTCCT-3′. The PCR reaction was run at 94 °C for 60 s, 60 °C for 60 s and 72 °C for 60 s for 40 cycles. The mice (10–12 weeks old) were fed with HFD for 8 weeks and then killed by decapitation, and their organs were dissected and weighed at the end of the study.

C57BL/6J mice (Charles River; 5 weeks old) were housed for 1 week before the experiment in a controlled environment. Mice were maintained under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle. On day 0, the 10-week-old mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane (ForeneH, Abbott). Mini-osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously (Model 2006, Alzet) (flow rate, 0.15 ml h−1; total filling volume, 200 ml; delivery duration, 42 days) as previously described76. The osmotic mini-pump contained either vehicle or TMA (0.1 mM in circulation) or PF06650833 (50 nM in circulation). After 6 weeks of metabolite treatment, mice were killed by decapitation, and the organs were dissected and weighed.

Male mice on a C57BL/6J background (6 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River and maintained in a controlled environment for 2 weeks to acclimate them to local conditions. The animal experimental protocol was approved by local and national committees in charge (Tor Vergata University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Ministry of Health, license no. 265/2019-PR) and conducted in accordance with accepted standards of humane animal care. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with 59 mg kg−1 TMA (Sigma-Aldrich, 72761) (treatment group, n = 7) or PBS alone (control group, n = 6) 30 min before LPS injection (30 mg kg−1 of LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, L2630) in sterile PBS by intraperitoneal injection). The survival of the mice was monitored every 4 h for 36 h.

Mice were housed in standard ventilated cages under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle at 20–23 °C and 40–60% humidity. For mouse experiments, staff who were responsible for phenotyping and biospecimen collection also handled the dietary intervention; therefore, they were not blinded to experimental conditions.

After 4 weeks of treatment, an intraperitoneal GTT test (2 g kg−1) was performed in conscious mice following an overnight fast. Blood was collected from the tail vein before glucose injection and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min afterwards. Blood glucose levels were determined using an Accu-Check Performa (Roche Diagnostics). Additional blood samples were collected at baseline and 30 min after glucose injection in Microvette CB 300 Lithium Heparin (Sarstedt). Plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until the insulin radioimmunoassay. Circulating insulin levels were determined using insulin ELISA kits (Mercodia). The Matsuda insulin sensitivity index was calculated as previously published31.

After 5 weeks, we performed an ITT. Mice that had been fasted for 5 h were injected intraperitoneally with insulin (0.75 mU g−1; Actrapid, Novo Nordisk). Blood glucose levels were measured immediately before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after insulin injection with a standard glucose meter (Accu-Check, Roche) on the tip of the tail vein.

Groups of six mice showing consistent pathophysiological profiles in response to CHD or HFD treatment were selected for microarray analysis performed with our established method75, and data were deposited in ArrayExpress under accession number E-MEXP-1755. Total RNA was isolated from frozen liver tissue using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies), followed by further purification with RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). The concentration and quality of RNA samples were evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies). Gene expression analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome arrays (U430A and U430B). These arrays include 22,690 (U430A) and 22,576 (U430B) probe sets, enabling the detection of transcript levels for approximately 13,250 (U430A) and 7,577 (U430B) unique genes and expressed sequence tags. For each sample, 10 μg of total RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by in vitro transcription to generate biotin-labelled complementary RNA (cRNA). The cRNA samples were then assessed for yield and integrity using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser. After fragmentation, individual cRNA preparations were hybridized to the microarrays using a temperature-controlled Affymetrix hybridization oven. Post-hybridization washing and staining were carried out using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450. Finally, the arrays were scanned at a wavelength of 560 nm with an Agilent scanner (Affymetrix). The Bioconductor77 package Limma78 was used to generate the list of differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology was implemented using Enrichr79, and signalling pathway impact analysis was conducted using SPIA80.

For qPCR analysis, total RNA was prepared from tissues using TriPure reagent (Roche). Quantification and integrity analysis of total RNA were performed by analysing 1 µl of each sample in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit). cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 1 mg total RNA using a Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed with the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system and software (Applied Biosystems) using Mesa Fast qPCR (Eurogentec) for detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. RPL19 RNA was chosen as the housekeeping gene. All samples were performed in duplicate in a single 96-well reaction plate, and data were analysed according to the 2−ΔΔCT method. The identity and purity of the amplified product were assessed by melting curve analysis at the end of amplification. The primer sequences for the targeted mouse genes are as follows: SAA1 forward, CATTTGTTCACGAGGCTTTCC; SAA1 reverse, GTTTTTCCAGTTAGCTTCCTTCATGT; SAA2 forward, GGGGTCTGGGCTTCCCATCT; SAA2 reverse, CCATTCTGAAACCCTTGTGG; SAA3 forward, CGCAGCACGAGCAGGAT; SAA3 reverse, CCAGGATCAAGATGCAAAGAATG as previously reported81. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription assays were performed in a single batch, with the personnel blinded to treatment groups.

Circulating cytokines were quantified using the MSD V-PLEX Plus Proinflammatory Panel 1 kit. Plasma samples were diluted two times in the diluent provided, and the experiment was processed as outlined by the manufacturer and read on a SECTOR imager 2400. Cytokine assays were performed in a single batch with the personnel blinded to treatment groups.

Western blot analyses were performed according to our established methods82. To analyse the insulin signalling pathway, mice were allocated to either a saline-injected subgroup or an insulin-injected subgroup so that both subgroups were matched in terms of body weight and fat mass. They then received 1 mU insulin per g body weight (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk) or an equal volume of saline solution. Then, 3 min after injection, the mice were killed and their liver was dissected. A total of 30 mg of liver was homogenized in 680 µl of RIPA buffer containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 12,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 containing 1% BSA:p-Akt Ser473 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, 4060), total Akt (1:1,000; Cell Signalling Technology, 9272S), p-NF-κB (1:3,000; AbCam, ab86299) and total NF-κB p65 (1:3,000; Cell Signalling Technology, 8242). Insulin-induced p-Akt/total Akt corresponds to the ratio between p-Akt/Akt in insulin-treated mice and p-Akt/Akt in saline-treated mice. For these western blots, the membranes were stripped and re-probed with a β-actin antibody as a loading control. In separate densitometric analyses, we additionally corrected total Akt levels with β-actin and subsequently used this ratio to correct p-Akt, so as to take into account total protein levels.

Mouse urine samples were prepared by mixing 200 μl of urine with 200 μl of distilled water and 200 μl of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (containing 10% D2O/H2O, v/v, and 0.05% sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-(2,2,3,3-2H4)-1-propionate as a chemical shift reference at δ 0.0). The mixtures were loaded into 96-well plates for high-throughput flow-injection NMR spectroscopy. Samples were prepared and measured on a spectrometer (Bruker) operating at 600.22 MHz 1H frequency as detailed previously13. In short, a standard 1D pulse sequence (recycle delay-90°-t1-90°-tm-90°-acquisition) was used. Water suppression was performed by irradiating the water peak during the recycle delay (2 s) and mixing time, tm (150 ms); t1 was set to 3 μs. The 90° pulse length was adjusted to ≈10 μs. We acquired 128 transients at 32,000 a data point resolution for each spectrum with a 20 ppm spectral width. Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function corresponding to a 0.3-Hz line-broadening factor before Fourier transformation. The NMR spectra were corrected for phase and baseline. Full-resolution 1H-NMR spectra were imported, and the area corresponding to the water region after water suppression (δ4.5–5.0) was discarded. The full-resolution spectra were then processed and analysed using O-PLS-DA as we had done previously13. In this version of discriminant analysis, class separation is maximized by using NMR data (X) to model the class matrix (Y, with n dummy variables for n classes), through decomposition of the covariance matrix (YᵀX) into n − 1 O-PLS components and additional orthogonal signal correction components13. Variance component analysis was performed as described previously83. 1H-NMR profiling was performed in a single batch with the personnel blinded to treatment groups. The O-PLS-DA model was validated using 10,000 random permutations of the original class membership variable to explain (that is, diets, treatments or genotypes), as described previously83.

Methylamines were quantified according to our previously validated methods29,30: plasma samples (20 μl) were spiked with 10 μl internal standard solution (13C3/15N-TMA, d9-TMAO, d4-choline, d3-carnitine and d9-betaine in water; 1 mg l−1) and 45 μl of ethyl 2-bromoacetate solution (15 g l−1 ethyl 2-bromoacetate, 1% NH4OH in acetonitrile) were added to derivatize methylamines (TMA and 13C3/15N-TMA) to their ethoxy-analogues, completed after 30 min at room temperature. Methylamines were derivatised with ethyl bromoacetate to increase sensitivity (the underivatized form elicited a low response from the mass spectrometer owing to its low molecular weight) and enhance chromatographic performance. A total of 935 μl of a protein/lipid precipitation solution (94% acetonitrile/5% water/1% formic acid) was added; samples were centrifuged for 20 min (4 °C, 20,000g) and transferred to UPLC–autosampler vials. Sample injections (10 μl loop) were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC-Xevo TQ-S UPLC–MS/MS system equipped with an Acquity BEH HILIC (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) chromatographic column. An isocratic elution was applied with 10 mM ammonium formate in 95:5 (v/v) acetronitrile:water for 14 min at 500 μl min−1 and 50 °C. Positive electrospray (ESI+) was used as the ionization source, and mass spectrometer parameters were set as follows: capillary, cone and source offset voltages at 500, 93 and 50 V, respectively; desolvation temperature at 600 °C; desolvation/cone/nebulizer gases were high-purity nitrogen at 1,000 l h−1, 150 l h−1 and 7 bar, respectively. Collision gas was high-purity argon. The mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The monitored transitions were as follows: for derivatized-TMA, +146 → +118/59 m/z (23/27 V); for derivatised-13C3/15N-TMA, +150 → +63 (27 V); for TMAO, +76 → +59/58 m/z (12/13 V); for d9-TMAO, +85 → +68 m/z (18 V); for choline, +104 → +60/45 m/z (14/16 V); for d4-choline, +108 → +60 m/z (15 V); for γ-butyrobetaine, +146 → +60/87 m/z (12/12 V); for carnitine, +162 → +103/60 m/z (16/14 V); for d3-carnitine, +165 → +103 m/z (16 V); for betaine, +118 → +59/58 m/z (16/16 V); and for d9-betaine, +127 → +68 m/z (16 V).

TMA was assessed using the KdELECT screening service (DiscoveRx) as described previously35,36. This technique is based on a competition-binding assay that quantitatively measures the ability of a compound to compete with an immobilized, active-site-directed ligand. The assay consists of a DNA-tagged kinase, an immobilized ligand and the potent inhibitor. The ability of TMA to compete with the immobilized ligand was measured by qPCR of the DNA tag. Kd was then calculated from a duplicate 11-point dose–response curve. Kinase interaction tree plots were generated using the TREEspot Software Tool and are reprinted with permission from KINOMEscan, a division of DiscoveRx Corporation, 2015.

The TMA IC50 on IRAK4 was determined using Kinexus kinase-inhibitor activity profiling service (Kinexus). Protein kinase assays (in duplicate) were performed at ambient temperature for 30 min in a final volume of 25 μl according to the following assay reaction recipe:

A total of 5 μl of diluted active IRAK4 target (recombinant, full length, expressed by baculovirus in Sf9 insect cells with an GST tag (SignalChem Catalogue 112-10G); ~10–50 nM final concentration in the assay).

A total of 5 μl of stock solution of substrate (Myelin Basic Protein 1 mg ml−1 diluted in H2O).

A total of 5 μl of kinase assay buffer (25 mM MOPS pH 7.2, 12.5 mM β-glycerol-phosphate, 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, added just before assay initiation).

A total of 5 μl of compound (various concentrations as indicated) or 10% dimethylsulfoxide for blank.

A total of 5 μl of 32P-ATP (250 μM stock solution, 0.8 μCi, Perkin Elmer).

The assay was initiated by the addition of 32P-ATP, and the reaction mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min. After the incubation period, the assay was terminated by spotting 10 μl of the reaction mixture onto a Multiscreen phosphocellulose P81 plate, which was washed three times, each time for approximately 15 min, in a 1% phosphoric acid solution. The radioactivity on the P81 plate was counted in the presence of scintillation fluid in a Trilux scintillation counter. Blank control was set up that included all the assay components except the addition of Myelin Basic Protein (replaced with an equal volume of assay dilution buffer). The corrected activity for the IRAK4 target was determined by removing the blank control value.

We calculated the TMA Ki for IRAK4 using the equation below84, where IC50 = 3.4 µM, as determined from the IRAK4 activity assay described above. [S] is the concentration of ATP in the assay (50 µM), and the Km value of IRAK4 for ATP (Km = 13.6 µM) was provided by the commercial vendor. Purified IRAK4 for these assays was obtained from https://media.cellsignal.com/pdf/7551.pdf.

Glutamine (Glutamax, 35050061, Life Technologies), FBS (Life Technologies), crystal violet (C6158) and trimethylamine solution (W324108) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse IL-6 Quantikine ELISA kits (M6000B) were obtained from R&D Systems, and the RNeasy Micro Kit was from Qiagen. SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase, IL-6 Taqman probe Hs00174131_m1 and FAST master mix were purchased from Invitrogen. The HFD (Special Diets Services) and CHD (B&K Universal) were specifically formulated as described in a previous publication12; the remaining foods were obtained from Research Diets: control diet (D12450K), LC-HFD (60% kcal fat and 20% kcal carbohydrates; D12492), and HC-HFD (60% kcal fat and 20% kcal carbohydrates with 17 g of choline per kg; D16100401i). The mouse insulin ELISA was obtained from Mercodia (10-1249-01). Additional reagents and kits included isoflurane (10014451, Forene, Abbott); TriPure reagent (1667165, Roche); Reverse Transcription System kit (A3500, Promega); Mesa Fast qPCR (CS-CKIT-PROD, Eurogentec); and the MSD V-PLEX Plus Proinflammatory Panel 1 kit (K15048G Meso Scale Diagnostics).

Potential outliers were identified by a Grubbs test. For statistical comparisons between study groups, normality was tested using the D'agostino–Pearson omnibus normality test, then one-way ANOVA was used, followed by Tukey's post hoc testing when data were normally distributed; otherwise, groups were compared using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney test (P < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant). Where applicable, P values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method, unless otherwise stated. Data are displayed as means ± s.e.m in all figures. All cell culture experiments included at least three biological replicates (as indicated in figure legends). All animal cohorts included at least five animals in each study group (as indicated in figure legends); animals were randomized to treatment groups and were sampled in a random order. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in our previous publications69.

Male mice were weaned at 3 weeks and fed CHD, before being randomly assigned to CHD group (n = 270) or HFD (n = 202) groups and monitored at 2 (72 CHD and 64 HFD), 3 (84 CHD and 57 HFD), 5 (68 CHD and 47 HFD) and 7 months (46 CHD and 34 HFD). (a, b) Effect of HFD-feeding on physiological parameters. (a) Body weight (BW) and (b) cumulative glycemia during GTT (AUC). (c) Heatmap of significantly (FDR < 0.1) differentially expressed liver genes after 4 months of HFD. (d) 1H-NMR-based metabotyping scores plot from a cross-validated O-PLS-DA model segregating the eight groups of mice according to both diet and age. (e) Empirical assessment of the significance of O-PLS goodness-of-fit parameters by generating a null distribution with 10,000 random permutations. Data are means ± s.e.m. Two-sided Mann-Whitney test (*P < 0.05 vs control). For the O-PLS-DA permutation test, the horizontal axis corresponds to the correlation between the original class membership variable (single dots on the right) and the randomly permuted class membership vectors (no longer correlated with the original class membership) (swarm of permutated models on the left). The y axis corresponds to goodness-of-fit parameter R2 (in green) derived for each O-PLS-DA model and the goodness-of-prediction parameter Q2 (in blue) derived by 7-fold cross-validation of each O-PLS-DA model. The R2 and Q2 parameters obtained from the original model in the top right corner are outside the confidence interval of the 10,000 randomly permuted models and therefore confirming the significance of the fitness and prediction capacity of the original O-PLS-DA model.

Electrocorticography uses non-penetrating electrodes embedded in flexible substrates to record electrical activity from the surface of the brain. To use the technology to develop minimally invasive, high-bandwidth brain–computer interfaces, it will be necessary to improve the number of recording channels and the scalability of devices, which could be achieved by merging electrodes and electronics onto a single substrate. Here we report a 50-μm-thick, mechanically flexible micro-electrocorticography brain–computer interface that integrates a 256 × 256 array of electrodes, signal processing, data telemetry and wireless powering on a single complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor substrate. The device contains 65,536 recording electrodes, from which we can simultaneously record a selectable subset of up to 1,024 channels at a given time. Our chip is wirelessly powered, and when implanted below the dura, it can communicate bidirectionally with an external relay station outside the body. We show that the device can provide chronic, reliable recordings for up to two weeks in pigs and up to two months in behaving non-human primates from the somatosensory, motor and visual cortices, decoding brain signals at high spatiotemporal resolution.

In September, OpenAI launched a way for users to generate a digital likeness of themselves they could use to create personalized deepfake videos. This is one of the core features in Sora, OpenAI's app for sharing AI videos inside a TikTok-style feed. The self-deepfaking feature was called “cameo,” and with that standout feature, Sora quickly rose to the top of Apple's iOS download charts.

This feature name led to a trademark lawsuit with Cameo, the app where fans can pay celebrities to record personalized videos. Now, because of the legal action, OpenAI has temporarily scrubbed the “cameo” branding from its Sora app. The app now refers to the feature as “characters.”

Creative originality is not achievable by generative AI, which is built on finding patterns in large datasets, and OpenAI seems to be matching this derivative vibe with its naming schemas. In addition to being told to remove “cameo” from Sora, OpenAI was also recently ordered not to call its upcoming hardware device “io,” in response to a separate lawsuit from a company named “iyO” that's already building an AI-powered hardware device.

According to update logs on OpenAI's website, the company removed the name for the Sora feature over a week after US District Judge Eumi K. Lee issued a temporary restraining order. The judge's order blocked OpenAI from using “cameo” or variations of the word. The next hearing, which may decide whether this ban sticks, is scheduled for December 19.

Discussions between Cameo and OpenAI have been “pretty nonexistent,” according to Steven Galanis, the CEO of Cameo. “They clearly knew Cameo existed. They knew we had trademarks on it,” he said in a call with WIRED shortly after the judge issued the temporary restraining order. “They chose the name anyway.”

He sees this lawsuit as an “existential” battle over the word “cameo” and the app's brand he has built over the past eight years. “When people think about the word, now it means something different than authentic personalized connections,” said Galanis. “It means AI slop.” Galanis claimed OpenAI's feature name was already hurting Cameo's visibility in Google search results.

“We disagree with the complaint's assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word ‘cameo,' and we look forward to continuing to make our case to the court,” said an OpenAI spokesperson in an emailed statement.

When the “cameo” name was not immediately removed from the Sora app, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to WIRED that the company was “taking steps to comply” with the judge's orders and highlighted a portion of the company's opposition brief saying it might take “up to three” weeks for OpenAI to make the change after a new name was picked.

Generative AI tools are incredible mimicking machines, outputting answers that match what the statistically probable answer is likely to be. An easy way for OpenAI to avoid these lawsuits altogether would be for the startup to come up with novel, original names for its drops. Though, when a business is built upon mimicking others outputs, originality is not likely its strong suit.

Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and former daytime talk show star, has recently been emailing all federal workers in his agency weekly tips on “Crushing Cubicle Cravings” and how to avoid snacking in the office.

“We all love a fun cookie swap and potluck this time of year. With several teams across CMS hosting holiday gatherings this month, I am sharing some strategies to help you make healthier choices—while still indulging in festive treats,” Oz wrote in his latest missive, which appears as a recurring section in his weekly bulletin titled “From the Administrator's Desk,” according to emails viewed by WIRED.

“Set your intentions,” writes Oz. “Decide in advance how many treats you'll allow yourself to enjoy and try to stick to that number. You don't have to try every cookie on the cookie table.”

His email continues with further guidance: “practice portion control,” “be mindful,” and “don't double fist,” he tells the agency's more than 6,000 employees. He advises subordinates to “eat off a small plate when you can and take small portions of treats so you can enjoy them without overeating,” to eat more slowly (“Savor each bite, put your fork down between bites, and pay attention to your body's cues,” he counsels), and not to hold food and beverages in more than one hand so as to free up “the other for shaking hands with colleagues and friends during this festive period.”

This kind of advice has appeared in Oz's emails since early November.

In the past, Oz has promoted a number of unproven medical tips surrounding weight loss. He at one time pushed weight-loss solutions that he subsequently admitted in a 2014 Senate subcommittee hearing “don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.” (Oz had promoted one such product on his show as “magic,” claiming, “You may think magic is make-believe, but this little bean has scientists saying they've found the magic weight-loss cure for every body type—it's green coffee extract.”)

Oz, who has also shared incorrect information about the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as a treatment for Covid, had not seemingly worked in health care policy before taking over as CMS administrator this year. CMS oversees the provision of health care coverage for more than 160 million people. Current CMS employees have described the agency to WIRED as “the most policy-dense organization in government,” where the CMS administrator makes decisions on where to spend billions of dollars in a high-stakes environment. As the administrator of CMS, Oz works under health care conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Oz worked as a physician before becoming the star of The Dr. Oz Show, where he also spoke at length about healthy eating during the holidays. In that case, however, he was sharing his opinion with interested fans as opposed to government employees obligated to receive his emails.

In his first “crushing cubicle cravings” email, Oz claimed employees had requested these tips. “I'm bringing one of your ideas to the newsletter,” Oz wrote. “From now through the holidays, I'll share tips for healthy snacking. You don't need to wait for a New Year's resolution to form healthy habits!” He continued, advising employees that “healthy snacking starts with Sunday meal prep. Prepare grab-and-go containers of nutritious snacks … eating healthy snacks—​​like those high in protein and fiber—throughout the workday will keep you energy up and help suppress overeating, especially when there's leftover Halloween candy at every turn.”

In subsequent emails, Oz advised employees to drink water and eat a balanced breakfast.

7/10

With tons of models to choose from, I think it's fair to say we have hit peak portable speaker. From tiny, $25 devices that will fit in a pocket, to massive, $400-plus boom boxes that require a built-in handle or shoulder strap, there's a Bluetooth speaker for nearly every budget and gathering size.

But that doesn't mean there isn't room for yet another model, as JBL proves with its new $100 JBL Grip. It's essentially a smaller and lighter version of the company's hugely popular Flip series, placing it between the Flip 7 and the JBL Go 4/Clip 5 on the portability scale. For some folks, that's going to be the goldilocks zone. But just to sweeten the deal, JBL has reached into its toolbox and given the Grip an integrated LED light show, clearly inspired by the brand's popular PartyBox lineup of party speakers.

In keeping with JBL's colorful approach to its smallest speakers, the Grip is available in red, white, black, purple, “squad” (a camo motif), and blue (pictured here). It's 32 percent smaller than the JBL Flip 7— but it's the Grip's weight that will make throwing it in a backpack feel like an easy decision: At 0.8 pounds, the Grip is less than half the weight of the Flip 7 (1.8 pounds), making it light enough to hang from tree branches that would buckle under the Flip 7.

JBL Grip

Rating: 7/10

Despite the Grip's smaller size, JBL pegs battery life on both speakers at the same 14-hour maximum. On the Grip at least, that might be overpromising. When I ran the speaker at 50 percent volume continuously, I only got about 10.5 hours. Using JBL's PlayTime Boost mode could help if you really need to eke out a few more songs.

The familial similarities continue with the Grip's ability to withstand the elements. Like the Flip 7, it's rated IP68, making it effectively dust- and waterproof. They're both shockproof, and yet the Grip is arguably more durable, since both ends are solid silicone rubber. The Flip's ends are passive radiators, which could be permanently damaged by a sharp object. Just keep in mind that while the Grip won't be bothered by immersion in water, it doesn't float. So if you toss it in the pool, someone will be diving in to retrieve it.

The one difference between these siblings (other than size, power, and the Grip's built-in light show) is orientation. While the Flip 7 can be used vertically or horizontally, the Grip is designed for vertical use only. Not that there's anything stopping you from laying it down—the built-in loop will keep it from rolling too far. But the controls are positioned for easier access when standing up, and the rear LED panel will end up partially obscured if the speaker is sideways.

JBL Grip

Rating: 7/10

Speaking of that LED panel, it's a fun add-on, but don't expect it to light up your get-together. There are four colors to choose from (purple, red, an icy blue, and a vibrant blue), controlled by the JBL Portables app, and five display modes: four that animate and one that's static. At full brightness, it can't compete with a well-lit room, and outdoors, you'll definitely have to keep your expectations in check. Still, in a darkened room, with the Grip near a corner or wall, it can create a subtle mood. Unfortunately, the four animated modes (Bounce, Trim, Switch, and Neon) don't sync to your music, so the effect is more lava lamp than disco light. If you want a beat-coordinated light show, consider the excellent Tribit StormBox Mini+ ($40), which has a top-mounted LED ring with this feature.

The one thing about the LED panel that perplexes me is its placement: It's on the “rear” of the speaker. If you can see the light show, it means the Grip's single racetrack driver is facing away from you. It's not a massive difference in sound quality, but it's noticeable, especially in the upper midranges and highs, which lose some of their clarity.

JBL Grip

Rating: 7/10

JBL continues to prove that it's a wizard at getting big, full-range sound out of small speakers. For its size, the Grip produces clear, balanced audio that can get surprisingly—even painfully—loud. At 400 square feet and 10 to 15 feet tall, our garage is a fairly big space. At 60 percent volume, the Grip easily filled it with sound. At 75 percent volume, if you stood too close to it, it could be an uncomfortable experience, and at 85 percent  it was overwhelming. I promise that your friends will do a double-take when they realize this little cylinder is the source of your tunes.

With this much power comes the risk of distortion, and when push comes to shove, the Grip can lose its hold on the lows. I admit it's a bit of an edge case, but if you take advantage of JBL Portables app's custom EQ setting and push the lowest slider (125 Hz) to its max, some bass-heavy tracks will create audible clipping, even at relatively low volume levels. Billie Eilish's “Bad Guy” is a worst-case scenario for bass management, and unless you stick with one of the Grip's four factory presets (Signature, Chill, Energetic, or Vocal), the speaker will noticeably distort.

JBL Grip

Rating: 7/10

That's less of a critique and more of a public service announcement. Stick with the presets (or make judicious use of the custom EQ) and 99 percent of the time you'll be fine.

For comparison's sake, I tried out the Grip alongside the $40 Tribit Stormbox Mini+, the $99 UE Miniroll, and the $150 JBL Flip 7. The Grip proved more powerful and precise than the Stormbox Mini+, though its soundstage wasn't as generous. The Miniroll offers greater detail, especially for vocals, but can't deliver as much low end or punch as the Grip. Needless to say, the Flip 7 outclasses all three of these speakers, but the difference isn't as pronounced as I expected. When regularly priced, the Flip costs 50 percent more than the Grip, yet I'm not convinced you're getting 50 percent more bang for your buck.

Sadly, JBL only sent me one evaluation speaker, so I couldn't test the Grip's ability to stereo-pair with another Grip. I did, however, try JBL's version of Auracast. You can't use the Grip to tune in to a public Auracast broadcast, but you can use it to beam audio from the Grip to a compatible JBL speaker like the Flip 7, Xtreme 4, Charge 6, or Go 4 (or vice versa). I tried it with the Flip 7 and it worked really well, with the Flip filling in some of the lower frequencies that the Grip misses.

What JBL Grip gets right is its size, sound, and ruggedness. Where the value equation falls a bit short are the extras you'll find on competitive products, but which the Grip lacks. It can't double as a speakerphone, for instance, and there's no auxiliary input for digital or analog audio sources. None of its buttons are backlit, and it doesn't come with its own charging cable.

Only you know whether this matters, but it's worth noting that the Stormbox Mini+ has them all and costs less than half the Grip's asking price.

Despite these omissions, it's hard not to like the Grip. It manages to deliver massive sound from a highly portable package that you can fearlessly toss in your backpack or cross-body bag, knowing it will hardly weigh you down. And when you get to your destination, it will take nearly anything you throw at it. Personally, I'd choose to forego the built-in LED light show if I could drop the price by $20. Still, there's no denying that flashing multicolor LEDs are no longer just for gamers, and it might just be the thing that gives JBL a grip on this holiday season.

The former chief engineer of Lucid Motors, Eric Bach, has sued the company for wrongful termination, discrimination, and retaliation, and claims one of the automaker's top HR executives referred to him as a “German Nazi.” 

The federal lawsuit, filed Monday in the Northern District of California, claims Bach was stripped of his responsibilities overseeing the powertrain division in early 2025 as a result of an HR investigation into the company's workplace culture. Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. 

Bach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint. He encouraged a co-worker to report the incident.  

TechCrunch has reached out to Lucid and will update the article if the company comments on the lawsuit. 

Bach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. 

He claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors' press release from that day only said he had “departed.”

The lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors. The company is burning through cash as it works to ramp up production of its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV. It is developing more affordable mass-market vehicles on a midsized platform slated to debut sometime in late 2026.

Lucid has also been churning through executives. The company's VP of engineering left on the same day Bach claims to have been fired, as TechCrunch previously reported. Former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson suddenly resigned in February, and the company has still not named a permanent replacement. Lucid's head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing all left within the last year, too.

Bach, in the complaint, claims to have been ascendant before the internal investigation. An engineer who spent a decade with the company, Bach says he oversaw “all hardware engineering,” “product management and corporate planning.” 

Bach states that Lucid's chairman Turqi Alnowaiser “praised Bach's loyalty and dedication to the Company and expressed a desire to continue working with Bach.” He also claims board member Andrew Liveris “signaled that Bach would become Chief Technology Officer (the position ‘is yours to lose') and that Bach could one day become Chief Executive Officer,” according to the complaint.

The workplace culture investigation launched in late 2024, which Bach claims was “tainted by HR's racist beliefs,” “initially resulted in Bach losing significant responsibilities.” The HR department told Bach at the time that he contributed to a poor culture at the company, according to the complaint. In addition to losing oversight of the powertrain team, Bach claims to have been excluded from board meetings.

As energy demand for data centers soars, environmental groups are calling for a moratorium on the approval and construction of new facilities.

More than 230 organizations, including Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace signed a public letter urging members of Congress to support a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers, citing rising electricity and water consumption. 

“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans' economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter reads. 

Several studies have linked higher energy prices to the arrival of new data centers in a region. Consumers have been arriving at similar conclusions: A recent survey, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that eight in 10 consumers were worried about data centers negatively affecting their utility bills.

Electricity prices have already shot up 13% this year, bigger than any annual increase in the past decade.

The effects are expected to be felt most in a handful of states, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey, which are slated for the largest increase in data center capacity.

Energy demand for data centers is expected to nearly triple in the coming decade, up from 40 gigawatts today to 106 gigawatts in 2035. Much of that will take place in rural areas.

“All this compounds the significant and concerning impacts AI is having on society, including lost jobs, social instability and economic concentration,” the environmental groups said.

Proposed data centers have become a flash point in recent days. 

Last week, protestors marched outside the headquarters of utility DTE in Detroit. The company is requesting approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission to supply OpenAI and Oracle with electricity for a 1.4 gigawatt data center. Protestors said they were concerned about the data center driving up electricity bills, using too much fresh water, and snarling traffic.

Also last week, three people were arrested in Wisconsin during a common council meeting about a 902 megawatt data center that's slated to be part of OpenAI and Oracle's Stargate project.

Anthropic is launching Claude Code in Slack, allowing developers to delegate coding tasks directly from chat threads. The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic's existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn't the model; it's the workflow. 

Previously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests.

The move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work.

Cursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI's Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots.

For Slack, positioning itself as an “agentic hub” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work.

By letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows.

While Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic. The AI coding market is getting more competitive, and differentiation is starting to depend more on integration depth and distribution than model capability alone.

That said, the integration raises questions about code security and IP protection, as it adds another platform through which sensitive repository access must be managed and audited — while also introducing new dependencies where outages or rate limits in either Slack or Claude's API could disrupt development workflows that teams previously controlled locally.

TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and Slack for more information.

This seems excessively paternalistic. If medical professionals hold a legal monopoly on providing diagnostic care, then decide it's better to just not diagnose things, it leaves patients with no way to discover life-altering information about their own health.

We already have an extreme shortage of available healthcare workers. We don't need to stress them further because 20% of the population suddenly decides they need 80 elective surgeries to remove things that would've gone away or stayed benign on their own.

I then talked to several doctors I know (family practice and two internal medicine).It was embarrassing how little they knew. And even more shocking actually, is how wrong they were about things.Two of them told me the risk of infection from a prostate biopsy was basically zero. I asked for clarification with actual numbers, and even led them with ""for what kind? Like 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000?""One said basically zero, the other said 1 in a million.Neither knew to mention the two common types, and to make sure we go with the one type that carries less risk of infection.Even then, the less risky one is about 1 in 1000. If you have bad insurance you might go with the older type which is about 1 in 100. And that's with them giving you antibiotics beforehand....Basically they got everything I asked about wrong compared to specialists you can read online.Ps, my dad got an MRI with two 1cm growths.He changed his diet and added fasts, and did nothing else. His doctor basically writing him off in anger.5 years later, PSA lower than before the incident. Paid for a scan last year, zero growth.Internet/YouTube experts/doctors really do beat most general doctors. The odds of you having someone in the top 10% of their field, let alone top 1-2% in your local town is pretty low. Even my bay area doctor friends work at pretty basic general bay area hospitals. Imagine who's left in Modesto, CA.

You are just assuming that all cancer must be treated if detected, even if it is medically unnecessary, therefore we must not detect medically insignificant cancer which would be net harmful to treat. You can detect things and determine no action should be taken. I can understand if that might be the modern standard of care, but if so then that is the problem; not early detection of cancer, which could be medically insignificant, but which may also allow the early detection of medically significant cancer.

reply

There are probably a dozen things wrong with your body right now. That doesn't mean they're even affecting you. While you may have some type of cancer that is at the absolute first day of detectability, or a bone slightly out of place, or a weird spot on your heart, someone else has a case that is 6 months deeper and needs more dire treatment.There is zero benefit to society to massively overburden our healthcare system (this is true of any nation) by searching constantly for random problems that may or may not exist.If there were good reason to do this, you'd have regularly-scheduled checkups, like with colon or breast cancer.

Maybe if we were all pretty rational people, we could better manage positive screening results and follow up actions that lead towards taking no specific action; but that's not where people are at the moment.There's a tradeoff of early detection of fast growing tumors that are likely to cause issues vs detection of slow growing tumors that are likely to not cause issues except if they're detected.

Type and size and growth you can't find out without doing some sort of test/screening.I agree that oncologists are ultimately who should be making the call on what needs to be treated and how.  But I think your characterization of how common non-dangerous tumors are is off.

For oncology?  A whole lot.  It's actually miraculous what they've developed to treat cancer.  Cancer treatment has gotten so good that it's common for oncologists to caution against the 5 year study survival rates due to new and better treatments rapidly coming online.  A 5 year study is necessarily 5 years out of date.Medicine isn't a unified field.  Having broad skepticism is an irrational position as there's a huge difference between the oncology field and the nutrition field.

Medical science has done a lot to earn credibility over the last couple hundred years. It fully eliminated a disease that was a leading cause of death in multiple human civilizations. It reduced rates of infant mortality by staggering numbers. It created vaccines and surgeries that have each saved countless lives and effectively cured life-altering disabilities and injuries, and demoted tons of diseases from death sentences to mere manageable disabilities or even mild temporary inconveniencesMedical practitioners are a mixed bag that ranges from total altruists to total mercenaries. Most people can learn a skill and incentivizing any skill via things like money or social status creates some goal-misalignment, but also dramatically increases the prevalence of the skill and also the community surrounding it, including research, pedagogy, and infrastructure. I think there's considerable value in not automatically trusting every medical practitioner, but on the whole many of them have earned credibilityMedical institutions have mostly been responsible for the existence of trustable practitioners and research, though in the rich world and especially the US specifically there are significant misalignments that come from capture from power-hungry parties in both government and the private sector. The American medical establishment in particular seems at this point near unsalvageable, having broken so badly that it often deliberately tanks quality of care to enforce state power or to turn a profit. We should probably rethink a lot of how institutions fund research, administer hospitals, prioritize care, act as financial buffers, what legal and enforcement authority we vest in medical practitioners sanctioned by the institutions, etc. So I agree with you there, especially in the United States specifically, though much of this was apparent well before 2025 (practically before I was born)

Essentially they are saying that many of these diagnoses are potentially false positives. To the point where detecting them might be more harmful then not. Keep in mind most cancer treatments are pretty harsh. They are better than cancer, but if you don't have clinically significant cancer then the treatments can be very not worth it.

The research seems split on if it is worth it or just causes unneeded worry. Obviously if you catch something early then that is great, but there are a lot of people who have a ton of followup testing only to find out there is no issue.There are also limitations with the level of detail a full body MRI can capture.I could see it becoming similar to a colonoscopy where you get it like when you turn 30 or something and then every 5-10 years after that.

These people under 50 were the first generation to sit around at home for long periods of time playing video games. The NES came out in 1985-86 in the US and home video gaming has been mass adopted since. From there add on the full adoption of sitting down at a computer for work in offices across the 1980s and 1990s. Then throw in the full adoption of home computing in the 1990s with Win3 & Win95 + GUI. And for the past 20 years, throw in the smartphone.It's the sitting primarily, hours and hours of it every day.

It's true SRAM comes with your logic, you get a TSMC N3 (or N6 or whatever) wafer, you got SRAM. Unfortunately SRAM just doesn't have the capacity you have to augment with DRAM which you see companies like D-Matrix and Cerebras doing. Perhaps you can use cheaper/more available LPDDR or GDDR (Nvidia have done this themselves with Rubin CPX) but that also has supply issues.Note it's not really about parameter storage (which you can amortize over multiple users) it's KV cache storage which gets you and that scales with the user count.Now Groq does appear to be going for a pure SRAM play but if the easily available pure SRAM thing comes at some multiple of the capital cost of the DRAM thing it's not a simple escape hatch from DRAM availability.

Just FYI, the latest X3D flipped the stack; the cache die is now on the bottom. This helps transfer heat from the compute die to the heatsink more effectively. In armchair silicon designer mode, one could imagine this setup also adds potential for multiple cache dies stacked, since they do interpose all the signals, why not add a second one ... but I'm sure it's not that simple, for one: AMD wants the package z-heights to be consistent between the x3d and normal chip.

The real story is that Nvidia is accepting equity in their customers as a payment for their hardware.  ""What, you don't have cash to buy our chips?  That's OK, you can pay by giving us 10% of everything you earn in perpetuity.""This has happened before, let's call it the ""selling the goose that lays golden eggs scan.""  You can buy our machine that converts electricity into cash, but we will only take preorders, after all it is such a good deal.  Then, after bulding the machines with the said preorder money, they of course plugged the machines in themselves instead of shipping them, claiming various ""delays"" in production.  Here I'm talking about the bitcoin mining hardware when the said hardware first appeared.Nvidia is doing similar thing, just instead of doing it 100% themselves, they are 10% in by acquiring the equity in their customers.

This is the second article that gained a lot of traction on HN in the last few months with similar fundamental errors. The previous one was similarly written by someone with a dev background where they didn't understand the difference between gross margins, operating profit, and net income–concepts which were the basis for their analysis.I wonder with this author or the previous, if they're just a little too confident in their abilities. Accounting and Finance are very deep and highly technical fields. Particularly for publicly traded companies where the businesses tend to be very complex and sophisticated and the consequences for making mistakes or committing fraud are severe. I'm not suggesting that non-finance people shouldn't try to analyze this stuff, but some humility might be in order.It reminds me of a data scientist I worked with who was doing some modeling on companies' revenues. He believed he'd uncovered some secret, conspiratorial truth about Samsung having trillions in revenues, thereby making it the largest and most powerful entity on Earth. We had to gently inform him that he was looking at the revenues denominated in Korean Won and they needed to be converted to USD.

I don't see why. Graphcore bet on SRAM and that backfired because unless you go for insane wafer scale integration like Cerebras, you don't remotely get enough memory for modern LLMs. Graphcore's chip only got to 900MB (which is both a crazy amount and not remotely enough). They've pivoted to DRAM.You could make an argument for buying Cerebras I guess, but even at 3x the price, DRAM is just so much more cost effective than SRAM I don't see how it can make any sense for LLMs.

Here is a possible roadmap for the coming correction:1. The Timeline:
We are looking at a winter. A very dark and cold winter. Whether it hits before Christmas or mid-Q1 is a rounding error; the gap between valuations and fundamentals has widened enough to be physically uncomfortable.The Burry thesis—focused on depreciation schedules and circular revenue—is likely just the mechanical trigger for a sentiment cascade.2. The Big Players:Google: Likely takes the smallest hit. A merger between DeepMind and Anthropic is not far-fetched (unless Satya goes all the way).By consolidating the most capable models under one roof, Google insulates itself from the hardware crash better than anyone else.OpenAI: They look ""half naked."" It is becoming impossible to ignore the leadership vacuum. It's hard to find people who've worked closely with Altman who speak well of his integrity, and the exits of Sutskever, Schulman, and others tell the real story.For a company at that valuation, leadership credibility isn't a soft factor—it's a structural risk.3. The ""Pre-Product"" Unicorns:
We are going to see a reality check for the ex-OpenAI, pre-product, multi-billion valuation labs like SSI and Thinking Machines.These are prime candidates for ""acquihres"" once capital tightens. They are built on assumptions of infinite capital availability that are about to evaporate.4. The Downstream Impact:The second and third tier—specifically recent YC batches built on API wrappers and hype—will suffer the most from this catastrophic twister.When the tide goes out, the ""Yes"" men who got carried away by the wave will be shouting the loudest, pretending they saw it coming all along

Whether it hits before Christmas or mid-Q1 is a rounding error; the gap between valuations and fundamentals has widened enough to be physically uncomfortable.The Burry thesis—focused on depreciation schedules and circular revenue—is likely just the mechanical trigger for a sentiment cascade.2. The Big Players:Google: Likely takes the smallest hit. A merger between DeepMind and Anthropic is not far-fetched (unless Satya goes all the way).By consolidating the most capable models under one roof, Google insulates itself from the hardware crash better than anyone else.OpenAI: They look ""half naked."" It is becoming impossible to ignore the leadership vacuum. It's hard to find people who've worked closely with Altman who speak well of his integrity, and the exits of Sutskever, Schulman, and others tell the real story.For a company at that valuation, leadership credibility isn't a soft factor—it's a structural risk.3. The ""Pre-Product"" Unicorns:
We are going to see a reality check for the ex-OpenAI, pre-product, multi-billion valuation labs like SSI and Thinking Machines.These are prime candidates for ""acquihres"" once capital tightens. They are built on assumptions of infinite capital availability that are about to evaporate.4. The Downstream Impact:The second and third tier—specifically recent YC batches built on API wrappers and hype—will suffer the most from this catastrophic twister.When the tide goes out, the ""Yes"" men who got carried away by the wave will be shouting the loudest, pretending they saw it coming all along

You have to actually do some work yourself to make a system behave the way you require.For example, Postgres' isolation level is weak by default, leading to race conditions. You have to explicitly enable serialization to avoid it, which is a performance penalty. (https://martin.kleppmann.com/2014/11/25/hermitage-testing-th...)

Woah, those are _really_ strong claims. ""Lost writes are accepted""? Assuming we are talking about ""acknowledged writes"", which the article is discussing, I don't think it's true that this is a common default for databases and filesystems. Perhaps databases or K/V stores that are marketed as in-memory caches might have defaults like this, but I'm not familiar with other systems that do.I'm also getting MongoDB vibes from deciding not to flush except once every two minutes. Even deciding to wait a second would be pretty long, but two minutes? A lot happens in a busy system in 120 seconds...

Even if most users do turn out to want “fast_and_dangerous = true”, that's not a particularly onerous burden to place on users: flip one setting, and hopefully learn from the setting name or the documentation consulted when learning about it that it poses operational risk.

The trouble is that you need to specifically optimize for fsyncs, because usually it is either no brakes or hand-brake.The middle-ground of multi-transaction group-commit fsync seems to not exist anymore because of SSDs and massive IOPS you can pull off in general, but now it is about syscall context switches.Two minutes is a bit too too much (also fdatasync vs fsync).

Why? Why do some databases do that? To have better performance in benchmarks? It's not like that it's ok to do that if you have a better default or at least write a lot about it. But especially when you run stuff in a small cluster you get bitten by stuff like that.

reply

Many applications do not require true durability and it is likely that many applications benefit from lazy fsync. Whether it should be the default is a lot more questionable though.

reply

reply

The kind of failure that a system can tolerate with strict fsync but can't tolerate with lazy fsync (i.e. the software 'confirms' a write to its caller but then crashes) is probably not the kind of failure you'd expect to encounter on a majority of your nodes all at the same time.

Postgresql was able to fix their bug in 3 lines of code, how many for the parent system?I understand your core thesis (sometimes durability guarantees aren't as needed as we think) but in postgresql's case, the edge was incredibly thin. It would have had to have been: a failed call to fsync and a system level failure of the host before another call to fsync (which are reasonably common).It's far too apples to oranges to be meaningful to bring up I am afraid.

Is the performance warning in the NATS  possible to improve on? Couldn't you still run fsync on an interval and queue up a certain number of writes to be flushed at once? I could imagine latency suffering, but batches throughput could be preserved to some extent?

reply

Yes, and you shouldn't even need a fixed interval. Just queue up any writes while an `fsync` is pending; then do all those in the next batch. This is the same approach you'd use for rounds of Paxos, particularly between availability zones or regions where latency is expected to be high. You wouldn't say ""oh, I'll ack and then put it in the next round of Paxos"", or ""I'll wait until the next round in 2 seconds then ack""; you'd start the next batch as soon as the current one is done.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

Google's push into XR is in full swing, and we just got a clearer picture of what that face-worn wearable future will look like. In a special XR edition of Google's recurring Android Show, the company gave a preview of two devices that haven't been released yet. Probably the best look we got was of its Project Aura, a pair of AR glasses being developed in tandem with Xreal.

While we've seen renders of the smart glasses previously, Google showed Project Aura off in action with a pre-recorded demo, giving a firsthand look at some of the functionality, UI, and a puck that actually handles the computing for the glasses.

As far as functionality goes, Project Aura appears to work similarly to how you'd expect if you're familiar with other wired XR glasses. Mostly, it acts as a big virtual screen for “spatial computing” and watching stuff like YouTube, which isn't groundbreaking in the smart glasses world but would be novel for Google-made hardware. Like other spatial computers (i.e., Apple's visionOS), Google similarly envisions you wearing Project Aura to do stuff like multitasking with Android apps and…following along with recipes? The latter use case feels a little weird to me, considering the combination of wearing wired glasses and holding a sharp knife, but I'll suspend my disbelief until I try them on for myself.

Project Aura, as Google showed, is also intended to be used in tandem with laptops as an additional display, so theoretically, you could use the smart glasses and their 70-degree field of view to do stuff like video editing at a coffee shop. Whether you feel comfortable wearing these smart glasses and pinching the air in public is another question entirely, but that's the direction Google is nudging you in.

Here's a first look at XREAL's Project Aura, a pair of Android XR glasses powered by a tethered puck that houses the computer and battery. Together with Gemini, you can watch YouTube videos, browse the internet or use them as a virtual work setup. pic.twitter.com/c9Pk4TFpJr

— Nathie (@NathieVR) December 8, 2025



The UI inside the smart glasses looks fairly familiar if you've used or seen Android XR, Google's XR operating system, which debuted on the Samsung Galaxy XR headset in October. Just like the Galaxy XR, Project Aura appears to be controlled with a combination of both hand and eye tracking. I'm curious to see how bright, sharp, and high-def the screen is, though, since that will be a major indicator of how effective Project Aura really is at doing any of the stuff Google says you can do. For that, we'll have to wait; Google says it's planning to release Project Aura next year.

In addition to XR glasses, Google also gave a small preview of a second category of unreleased wearable: AI glasses. While we didn't get a ton of information on that front, Google at least showed off a prototype that it's developing in partnership with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. Similar to Meta and its Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses, Google's AI glasses appear to blend more seamlessly with a regular glasses form factor and rely on cameras to offer computer vision as a defining feature.

Just like Meta, Google says it's envisioning two categories of AI smart glasses: one with a display and one without. While smart glasses with a display could act as a second screen for notifications, navigation, and translation, the screenless variety will lean on audio, pictures/video, and AI via Gemini. There's not much groundbreaking here, but it definitely positions Google's future AI smart glasses as a direct competitor to Meta and both varieties of its Ray-Ban-branded smart glasses. Google says these smart glasses will also arrive next year.

There's obviously still a lot more to learn about both ends of Google's unreleased XR smart glasses, but it's clear that it's taking a multi-tier approach to hardware. If you want a light dose of XR, you've got AI glasses. There's wired XR for a happy medium. And if you're ready to be fully immersed, there's Samsung's Galaxy XR headset. One thing is for sure: there's a lot of XR incoming, and Google intends to be right in the middle of it.

If true, Nvidia would be able to ship much more capable GPUs to China, enhancing its positions and ensuring dominance of its CUDA software stack. The only question is whether China lets these AI accelerators in, as it previously blocked imports of the weaker H20.

The authorization reportedly only covers Nvidia's H200, a processor that originates from 2022, but features formidable performance and comes with 144 GB of HBM3 memory (an important spec for training large AI models), so it is years behind the leading edge Blackwell GPUs. When compared to the HGX H20 — specifically designed to meet U.S. export control regulations of 2023 — it still delivers a formidable performance advantage over H20. Although Huawei now offers accelerators and rack-scale systems that can compete against Nvidia's H200 and even GB200 NVL72 systems, many Chinese companies still prefer Nvidia hardware largely because of their reliance on the CUDA-based software stack.

Semafor claims that the decision also reflects an assessment inside the U.S. government that the earlier restrictions did not significantly hinder progress by Chines AI leaders like Alibaba, DeepSeek, or Huawei. These companies continued to release advanced AI models and fill hardware gaps with domestically engineered products, therefore blunting the intended effect of U.S. policy and spreading Chinese AI standards when it comes to hardware, software, and eventually ethics.

An avid reader would ask whether the Department of Commerce — a part of the executive branch of the federal government — is overriding laws set in 2023. This is not exactly the case. The DoC is not formally canceling or rewriting the 2023 export control rules, but it is preparing to apply them far more flexibly. The ECCN 3A090/4A090 framework — which sets performance caps and interconnect thresholds for AI accelerators — remains intact. What is changing is the DoC's willingness to grant licenses for hardware that sits above those limits. By approving Nvidia's H200, the U.S. is effectively raising the practical performance ceiling that China may receive, without altering the existing export rules. Whether or not AMD can receive appropriate indulgences is something that remains to be seen.

One thing to keep in mind is that China rejected the H20 for political, not technological, reasons.

On the one hand, China is more likely to permit H200 imports than it was to accept the H20, because the H200 is a full-fat Nvidia GPU rather than a deliberately slow-downed, export-only model. Meanwhile, H200 will help China to develop its AI prowess faster than any domestic hardware.

On the other hand, China's approval is not guaranteed as availability of H200 could slowdown development of domestic AI hardware solution.

Last but not least, China may hesitate to re-open reliance on U.S. technology that the U.S. government could cut off again. Therefore, it may prefer to protect the momentum of domestic manufacturers like Huawei as it fits into China's broader semiconductor self-sufficiency plan.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that incorporates narrative assessment — a tool that uses storytelling to assess suicide risk while fostering therapeutic alliance — had a 32% lower risk for suicide attempts than CBT alone, a new meta-analysis showed.

“The evidence is convincing that using patient-centered, collaboratively developed suicide risk assessment models contributes to reductions in suicide risk and distress,” Justin C. Baker, PhD, The Ohio State University, Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, wrote in an accompanying editorial.

“This is good news for clinicians seeking to integrate simple interventions that can have a real impact on inspiring hope, reduce the risk of suicide attempts, and improve the lives of their patients,” added Baker, who was not part of the study.

The study was led by Wilco C. Janssen, MSc, 113 Suicide Prevention, Amsterdam, Netherlands. The study and the accompanying editorial were published online on November 20 in JAMA Network Open.

The age differences between study populations may have influenced the findings because interventions in younger populations often yield smaller and more inconsistent effect sizes. Additionally, the studies without narrative assessment had a significantly lower event rate and a slightly higher risk for bias, and causal conclusions would require direct head-to-head trials.

The study investigators and the editorialist reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

There are “clear failings” in how GPs assess and support older people living with frailty, with unexplained variation in practice across England, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). 

The report described frailty as “one of the greatest challenges facing the NHS.” Improvements could be “a massive gamechanger,” boosting care quality and freeing up hospital capacity.

Frailty occurs when the ageing process causes multiple physiologic systems to lose resilience. It affects an estimated 1.5 million people aged 65 or over in England and costs the NHS £5.8 billion a year. People with frailty may become housebound and have higher risk for disability, falls, and long-term care needs. They have nearly a sixfold increase in risk for hospital admission.

Early identification and timely support can help slow progression and maintain independence.

GPs must identify registered patients aged 65 years or over who have moderate-to-severe frailty. However, the NAO said GPs assessed only 17% of eligible patients in 2024-2025, well below the 25% target.

Support after diagnosis was also limited. Of the 226,000 patients diagnosed with severe frailty in 2024-2025, only 16% received a medication review and 18% underwent a falls risk assessment, despite both being mandatory. Just 29% had consented to the enriched summary care record.

The NAO reported “significant variation” in assessment rates and “worrying inconsistency” in the delivery of support. 

Support for care home residents under the Enhanced Health in Care Homes framework has also deteriorated.

Only 44% of residents received a personalised care and support plan within 7 working days of admission or readmission in 2024-2025, down from 76% in 2022-2023.

Care England said the findings showed a crisis demanding urgent action, investment, and a prevention-focused national strategy. Structured movement, stability programmes, and personalised activity could delay, reduce, or even reverse frailty, it said. 

Care England's chief executive, Professor Martin Green, said care homes were “ready and willing” to deliver preventive, rehabilitative support but the national framework was “incomplete.” Primary care, community services, and social care must be “properly aligned” so older people receive proactive support, he added.

The NAO recommended that:

Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said, “With the need for health and social care services set to increase in our ageing population, it is crucial that people with frailty are supported effectively and consistently across the country.” 

Professor Victoria Tzortziou Brown, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the findings were “disappointing” and must be taken seriously. Barriers to delivering consistent, proactive care for frail patients must be addressed, she said.

She warned that the GP workforce had not kept pace with rising demand and complexity. Political priorities “focused overwhelmingly on rapid access” had deprioritised interventions such as structured medication reviews, often “at the expense of the long-term, continuous care that older people with complex health needs require.”

Professor Mumtaz Patel, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said frail older people's needs were not being met. Many could be well supported in the community “but only with sufficient investment in primary and community care.” The shift from hospital to community care must involve physicians, particularly community geriatricians, playing a more proactive role early in managing complex cases, she said.

Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, said the report should prompt action to address a longstanding challenge. “There are far too many older people being admitted to hospital who could have better care in a place they'd prefer, at or close to home,” he said.

“We can and must tackle this with a new model of care,” he said, pointing to integrated health organisations, multi-neighbourhood contracts, and payment reform. “That would be a massive gamechanger, improving care for older people and unlocking much-needed capacity in hospitals.”

The experience of NHS patients obtaining a GP referral has improved, but many still face delays and uncertainty, according to a new report from Healthwatch England.

The organisation found that 1 in 7 patients (14%) fell into “referral black holes,” where referrals were delayed, lost, rejected, or never sent. However, this marks an improvement from 2023 when 1 in 5 (21%) reported similar issues.

Healthwatch England said the shift follows national efforts to improve the system, including better visibility of referral pathways through the NHS App, pharmacy referral pilots for suspected cancer, and a push to direct patients to community services rather than specialist care.

This year, 62% of survey respondents said they were satisfied with the referral process, while almost 1 in 4 (23%) were not.

The survey included 2622 people who had a referral experience within the previous 12 months. It took place between 7 and 23 of March, 2025.

More than 20 million referrals from general practice to community and hospital teams were made between October 2024 and October 2025.

The report identified several factors linked to higher patient satisfaction:

Healthwatch England reported that “almost universal satisfaction” was achieved when patients received an early referral, fast confirmation, adequate information, and some degree of choice. Among those referred between their first and third appointment, with confirmation within a week, sufficient information, and choices offered, satisfaction reached 98%.

The report recommended a referrals checklist, accurate waiting time estimates, and rapid implementation of Jess's Rule to ensure patients are referred when symptoms remain unresolved.

“Despite progress, many patients still report that poor communication, delays, and uncertainty caused by long waits are affecting their health, wellbeing, and ability to work,” Healthwatch England said.

Three in four people (75%) who experienced a referral issue reported at least one negative impact on their health and wellbeing, compared with 36% of those who had no referral issue.

“While improvements have been made, too many people remain stuck in the referral “black hole,” telling us they're ‘existing, not living' due to delays,” said Chris McCann, deputy chief executive at Healthwatch England.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told Medscape News UK that the situation remained unacceptable. “We have been clear it will take time to turn around the NHS but we are starting to see improvements,” the spokesperson said in an emailed comment.

Federal regulations bar bilingual staff from interpreting unless they become certified, yet many clinics rely on these employees anyway. So researchers tested whether a 1-week long training in medical interpretation could offer a low-cost path to compliance. 

A study of the results, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, showed nearly three-quarters of bilingual staff became qualified medical interpreters after going through the course, which cost $500 per person. 

“Our patients deserve better than ‘getting by,' and we should not just accept someone's word about how bilingual they are,” said Mike Hardin Jr, MD, chief clinical officer at Waco Family Medicine,Texas, who helped conduct the study. “This research studied a strategy that any medical office — even a small one — could use to meet federal requirements in a cost-effective manner.” 

Staff at the community clinic were already informally helping translate for patients but held varying levels of ability to provide accurate assistance with medical language. Around 25% of patients preferred to communicate in Spanish. 

Prior to training, staff were assessed for their verbal abilities in Spanish and rated on their level of proficiency. 

Staff also underwent assessment of their ability to interpret medical terms on a 12-point scale. Scores increased from a baseline of 7.34 to 8.46 after training (P < .001). Overall, employees displayed low accuracy in their ability to predict their Spanish proficiency (P = .003), whether they passed the training or not. 

The Waco strategy may help address health disparities identified in a recent report in the Annals of Internal Medicine. 

Many Latino patients face barriers to accessing needed medical care, such as not having health insurance, experiencing discrimination from healthcare staff, and navigating complex health systems in a foreign language and without adequate information about services. 

As a result, these patients are less likely to have a primary care clinician and have high rates of diabetes, infection-related cancers, and complications of asthma, including deaths from the condition. 

John Heintzman, MD, MPH, a professor of family medicine at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, said multilingual support can mitigate some of the negative health outcomes. In addition to providing translation services, clinicians can help reduce disparities by focusing on a patient's strengths, which might include abstaining from use of tobacco or drugs, strong social connections, and emphasis on religion and spirituality. 

“Clinicians often aren't very good at affirming existing positive health behaviors,” 

Heintzman, who was not involved with the study, said. “We look for what to correct, not what to encourage. This really needs to change, especially because there is so much evidence that Latino patients and communities have so many positives.”

An experimentalurine test can detect aggressive prostate cancers in men on active surveillance, potentially sparing them from repeated biopsies, researchers reported on Friday.

The MPS2-AS test is based on the MyProstateScore 2.0 (MPS2), a commercially available assay from Lynx Dx that the FDA approved in 2024 to evaluate the risk for clinically significant prostate cancer. MPS2 can detect aggressive tumors diagnosed at Grade Group 3, or Gleason 4+3, or above, the point at which treatment is generally recommended over continued surveillance.

Blood and urine tests are used to determine if patients have elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which can indicate prostate cancer. This month, the FDA granted premarket approval to IsoPSA, a blood test from Cleveland Diagnostics, to help men older than 50 years with high PSA levels decide whether to undergo a prostate biopsy.

Biopsies have predictable short‑term side effects — mostly bleeding and urinary symptoms — and clinically meaningful risks for infection, including rare sepsis or serious bleeding that may require hospitalization.

The new study found that use of the urine test could avoid up to 67% of unnecessary prostate biopsies while still detecting 93% of higher-grade tumors, according to the researchers, who presented the findings at the 2025 annual meeting of the Society of Urologic Oncology.

Jeffrey Tosoian, MD, MPH, an assistant professor in the Department of Urology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, who helped conduct the study, said, “The goal is simple: Keep active surveillance safe, while reducing the burden associated with accurate monitoring. A urine test that can flag higher-grade cancer moves us closer to that reality.”

Compared to the current clinical approach, in which all patients are recommended to undergo routine biopsies during surveillance, “this research suggests it may be possible to use a noninvasive molecular urine test to identify better who needs a biopsy and who can safely defer one,” he added.

Todd Morgan, MD, a professor of urology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who helped conduct the study, said he was “blown away” by the results.

“I'm very cautious about this space by nature. Many biomarkers have been tested in active surveillance, and none have really panned out. This is still a relatively small study, but it's incredibly promising and would be really great news for the field if the data holds,” Morgan told Medscape Medical News.

Morgan and his colleagues from nine institutions — three academic and six community centers — participated in evaluating the urine test. The primary endpoint was the detection of Grade Group 3 cancer or higher.

In the study, 223 men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer provided a urine sample just before their scheduled surveillance biopsy. All patients underwent an initial MRI to look for any suspicious lesions. Each man then underwent a standard biopsy, and if the MRI showed a concerning lesion, additional targeted biopsies were taken from those areas.

Tosoian said the MPS2-AS test outperformed both MRIs and risk calculators — tools commonly used now to screen men on surveillance.

If the MRI Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System alone was used, 48% of unnecessary biopsies would have been avoided while detecting 79% of cancers scored at Grade Group 3 and above, Tosoian said. If a Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator alone was used, 16% of unnecessary biopsies would be avoided while 95% of cancers with Grade Group 3 and above would be identified.

The focus on predicting a patient's risk for progressing to the critical Grade Group 3 and above reflects the threshold at which treatment is consistently recommended. In contrast, a proportion of men with Grade Group 2 cancers remain eligible for active surveillance, Tosoian said. The new study was designed to evaluate whether the urine-based test can predict when a cancer has progressed to a level that routinely warrants clinical intervention, he said.

Bradley Moore, MPH, spokesman for Lynx Dx, said MPS2-AS, like MPS2, supports both in-office and at-home urine collection and does not require cold shipping.

Christian Pavlovich, MD, director of the Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Program at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, said, “MPS2-AS might be the biomarker we have been looking for. While not all GG2 is indolent and any pattern 4 is potentially dangerous, there is certainly benefit to a urinary test that can help decide if and when surveillance MRI and biopsy are needed. So let's hope MPS2-AS ushers in a new era of molecular prognostication for patients living with untreated prostate cancer. Of course, we will have to see the data in full before getting too excited, but this abstract certainly suggests there is much to be gained by using this test.”

Michael Leapman, MD, clinical program leader at the Prostate & Urologic Cancers Program at Yale Cancer Center, in New Haven, Connecticut, called the new study “impressive and thoughtfully executed.”

But he added, “MRI-positive rates were high, and the prevalence of upgrading in this cohort suggests the possibility of enriched risk. As such, a prospective, randomized trial would be important to isolate the true incremental benefit of MPS2 testing and to understand how it performs.”

Tosoian reported being an advisor to and a co-founder of Lynx Dx. Leapman has been listed as an uncompensated researcher with Veracyte, Inc., a company involved in other genomic and molecular diagnostic platforms. Morgan reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

Developing new drugs is one of the riskiest and most expensive endeavors in science. Today, The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) announced a bold initiative to improve that trajectory, powered by an up to $30 million contract from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) Computational ADME-Tox and Physiology Analysis for Safer Therapeutics (CATALYST) program. CATALYST is led by ARPA-H Health Science Futures Mission Office Acting Deputy Director Andy Kilianski, Ph.D.

The initiative, called CARDIOVERSE, will leverage mice and human stem cells that model the range of genetic backgrounds found in people, combined with advanced artificial intelligence to create computational ""digital twins"" of the human heart. By building virtual, beating hearts, JAX scientists aim to dramatically reduce the need for large-animal studies, streamline FDA approval, and ensure safer, faster delivery of new therapies to patients.

This is a moonshot vision. Imagine a future where computational models predict drug safety so reliably that it becomes ethical to move forward on computational evidence alone. That would revolutionize drug development, making it far more affordable and accessible.""

Matt Mahoney, JAX computational biologist and project lead

Despite passing early safety standards, more than 90 percent of drugs fail – often due to unforeseen toxicities that emerge late in clinical trials. CARDIOVERSE tackles one of the most persistent and consequential challenges in drug development: cardiotoxicity, when potential drugs can interfere with heart function. It's a leading cause of clinical trial failure and responsible for up to 15 percent of withdrawals of new drugs after FDA approval. Individuals may experience different adverse effects, which further complicates the approval process.

To address this, Mahoney's team will train AI algorithms using data from mice and human cells that replicate human heart function in a dish and capture the genetic variability present across patient populations. JAX is a world leader in mouse studies and the use of human stem cells, and with its recent acquisition of the New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF), the team will profile these cellular models at an unprecedented scale using cutting-edge robotic automation.

This data will power AI models that go beyond safety predictions. They will uncover how genetic differences control individual responses to treatment, offering a more complete picture of cardiotoxicity across patient populations. The result: advanced AI models capable of predicting drug safety across a broad spectrum of human genetic makeups.

""Too many promising medicines never reach patients because we can't predict early enough who they will help and who they might harm,"" said Lon Cardon, JAX president and CEO. ""With CARDIOVERSE, we're building virtual hearts that more accurately reflect the broad genetic backgrounds of real people. This means we can identify which drugs are safe and effective for certain patients, and which may not be, so every person has a better chance of receiving the treatment that's right for them.""

Working with partners from the University of Michigan, InSilicoTrials Technologies, and the University of Connecticut Health Center, Mahoney's team will also investigate the molecular mechanisms inside the heart. They will study gene activity and metabolic changes following drug exposure-insights that could reveal biomarkers and genetic risk factors that make certain populations more vulnerable to toxicity.

Building on this foundation, the CARDIOVERSE team will assemble one of the largest data resources of its kind. Using mice and human cells that represent a broad range of genetic profiles, they will generate the critical data needed to train AI models, creating a powerful tool to make cardiotoxicity predictions more accurate than ever before.

""Our AI model will show a population of virtual hearts, each one beating and responding differently to the same drug,"" Mahoney said. ""That range of responses lets us capture cardiotoxicity outcomes across wide patient groups, identifying what fraction of the population may be at risk and uncovering potential biomarkers for that risk.""

This knowledge could improve patient stratification in clinical trials and give companies greater confidence in advancing drugs to later stages, enabling safer, more precise decisions about which therapies should move forward.

For heart drugs, rare toxicities are a leading reason for failure. Even if only one in a thousand patients experiences a severe reaction during clinical trials or after a drug has been approved, regulators must take that risk seriously.

Current computational models estimate the overall chance a drug will be deemed unsafe, but not who might be affected or how severe the response could be. ""It's like a weather forecast that predicts a 50 percent chance of rain but doesn't say whether it will be a drizzle or a hurricane,"" Mahoney explained.

By simulating hundreds or thousands of virtual hearts across different genetic backgrounds, CARDIOVERSE will identify those rare but serious reactions before human trials begin.

""It will be a big win if we can surrogate large-animal studies with a state-of-the-art computational platform,"" Mahoney said. ""That would take an expensive experiment off the table and allow more drug candidates from lean startups that are not well capitalized to get to human trials. CARDIOVERSE could help make that happen.""

Project co-leads include JAX scientists Nadia Rosenthal, recognized for her expertise in high-resolution imaging of tiny mouse hearts; Paul Robson, a stem cell biology expert and a lead developer of the genetically varied human iPSC panel; and Travis Hinson, a cardiologist whose lab investigates inherited conditions leading to heart failure. They are joined by Daniel Paull of NYSCF, a pioneer in high-throughput automation for generating iPSCs at scale and overseer of the Global Stem Cell Array®.

The Club World Cup took place in America over the summer as a forerunner to the World Cup and was blighted by player welfare concerns.

Players complained of feeling dizzy during matches, while managers were left with little option but to train minimally due to the searing heat in many of the same venues that will host World Cup matches. Changing kick-off times to avoid peak temperatures and using more covered stadiums has been suggested by some, but FIFA has now announced a different solution.

Compulsory three-minute ""hydration breaks” will take place midway through each half of every match at the World Cup next summer. It means that the two 45-minute halves fans have become used to will not be in effect, with the new breaks mandatory, even if temperatures are not soaring.

Cooling breaks have been in place before in other competitions, but only when temperatures reach a certain level. This time, however, play will be halted 22 minutes into each half, no matter what the climatic conditions are. It effectively means that, at the 2026 World Cup, matches will be played in quarters, like in basketball or American football.

FIFA said the blanket decision had been taken after consultation following the draw on the weekend and will ensure the same playing conditions across every game. But it is certain to prove controversial, with critics likely to point out that it will also offer advertisers another opportunity to appeal to viewers.

Meanwhile, the three-minute hydration breaks are also unlikely to appease FIFPRO, the global players' union, which had called for shorter but more frequent cooling breaks for games played in high temperatures.

FIFA has tried to address the issues seen at the Club World Cup in the summer, where matches kicked off at 3pm local time in scorching heat. Most games in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Miami, Kansas City and Monterrey will kick off in the evening, while most afternoon matches will take place at roofed stadiums with air conditioning, or in cities with cooler climates.

But issues remain despite the mitigation and there is sure to be further criticism of FIFA's decision-making around the tournament. Campaigners have voiced concerns over FIFA's partnership with Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco, while others have noted that the expansion to 48 teams and the huge distances between venues will make it comfortably the most polluting World Cup ever.

“One way or another, the 2026 World Cup will be a turning point as it becomes clear that ever hotter summers are killing football's traditional tournament model,” said Peter Crisp from Fossil Free Football. “Exhausted players will struggle through the heat, surrounded by Aramco's oil advertising, having flown thousands of miles between matches.”

The upcoming World Cup will feature new elements to past iterations and that includes the introduction of two set hydration breaks per match.

Announced on Sunday by FIFA, the two hydration breaks will be mandatory and last for three-minutes at the midway point in each half.

The clock will not stop for the breaks, but three minutes will be added at the end of each half as stoppage time.

The decision was discussed at the weekend where national team coaches and many broadcasters had congregated for the World Cup draw in Washington, DC on Friday.

It received support from all parties, including FIFA's medical team, with the welfare of players the main focus.

However, the breaks will also allow coaches to use the time to discuss tactics with players.

The decision comes off the back of the Club World Cup this summer, which drew criticism from managers and players who struggled with the soaring temperatures in the United States when they kicked off at midday local time.

However, FIFA have decided that even if the temperatures are cool at the World Cup there will still be a drinks break.

'There will be no weather or temperature condition in place, with the breaks being called by the referee in all games, to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches,' FIFA said in a released statement on Sunday night.

Manolo Zubiria, FIFA's 2026 World Cup chief tournament officer, told stakeholders at a World Broadcaster Meeting that the breaks would 'be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves.'

'Obviously, if there's an injury (stoppage) at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee,' Zubiria added, according to FIFA.

During the Club World Cup, Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Enrique complained about the heat after beating Atletico Madrid 4-0 in a midday kick-off in Los Angeles with temperatures reaching nearly 40 degrees Celsius under the sun and 60 per cent humidity.

'The match was clearly influenced by the temperature,' he said. 'The time slot is great for European audiences, but the teams are suffering.

'In terms of play, it's impossible to perform at a very high level for 90 minutes.'

His sentiments matched that of Chelsea midfielder Enzo Maresca who complained of dizziness due to the heat throughout the tournament.

'Honestly, the heat is incredible. The other day I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy,' the Argentine said.

'Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous. Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home.

'The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew debate which host nation will go the furthest in the FIFA 2026 World Cup. (3:19)

Every 2026 World Cup game will pause for three-minute ""hydration breaks"" in each half, FIFA has announced.

The new measure has been introduced to ""prioritise player welfare,"" amid expectations of high temperatures at next summer's expanded tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It will see every game -- regardless of weather conditions -- paused at the 22-minute mark, effectively turning the match into a four-quarter affair.

The decision was made after consultation with coaches and broadcasters.

FIFA say it is ""a streamlined and simplified version of the breaks used at some previous tournaments, including the FIFA Club World Cup 2025."" At last summer's Club World Cup, water breaks were used, but only in games in extreme heat.

Some games at that tournament topped 100 degrees fahrenheit (38 degrees celsius).

""I don't think I have ever played in such heat,"" Benfica forward Andreas Schjelderup said after playing against Bayern Munich. ""I don't think it's healthy, to be honest, but I managed to get through it.""

Chelsea's Enzo Fernández added later in the tournament: ""The other day I got a bit dizzy during a play. I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy.

""Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous.""

Inter Miami claimed MLS Cup, but will face an offseason of uncertainty with a number of key players surely on the way out in the coming months.

You can finally breathe now. MLS playoffs is over. It's done. And the game was a fitting climax to what has been a gripping playoffs. Inter Miami came out on top, winning 3-1 in a game that was really far closer than the scoreline suggests. A bit of luck, a bounce here and there, and the Vancouver Whitecaps could have easily lifted the trophy. Then again, Miami have this little guy named Lionel Messi who can turn games in an instant - and that's more or less what happened. 

But what happens now? The season is over, and such is the chaos of MLS that Miami, who won the whole thing, will likely undergo a significant rebuild this offseason. Half of their starting XI could be gone within a few weeks. There is room for another Designated Player, is the Neymar rumor legit?

Vancouver, the runner-ups, won't splash like Miami and still have issues to solve, but they're close - one signing away from being champions themselves. And if they stumble, others are ready. LAFC have Son Heung-Min and Denis Bouanga. San Diego FC reached a conference final in their debut season. And there is competition in the East, too. Everything looks as tasty as ever, and GOAL U.S. writers break it down in another edition of... The Rondo.

Tom Hindle: Once he got there, very important. If Messi had left MLS with zero MLS Cups, it would leave room for the haters to continue to hate. Failing to win without making it to the final would be a bad look. But getting there and falling short in the last game of the season? Yikes. Good thing he was the sole difference maker then! 

Ryan Tolmich: Extremely important. Everything is gravy now that the big ole trophy isn't hanging over his head. He has the individual accolades, obviously, but now has the big domestic team ones, too - outside of the CONCACAF Champions Cup. There is no denying that his tenure has been an overwhelming success now that there's no big ""but"" hanging over him or Inter Miami. Now, the focus turns to seeing how much further he can push boundaries before he inevitably calls it a day.

TH: Honestly? Not quite. Vancouver dominated for the best part of an hour - something Mascherano admitted in his post-match presser. The Herons were on the back foot for most of the game and won it, in effect, thanks to three moments of magic from the best to ever do it. 

RT: Absolutely. They did exactly what they had to do early on the attacking end, withstood the Whitecaps' push and, ultimately, put the game to bed with a late goal. That's what champions do, and that's why Messi and co. lifted the trophy this weekend.

TH: Is it possible? Certainly. But there are plenty of other good teams out there who will surely strengthen this offseason. LAFC are a player away, while Vancouver aren't far behind. FC Cincinnati will also be in the mix. If Miami get their offseason right, they will certainly be favorites. But nothing is guaranteed. 

RT: Let's see what their offseason looks like first. If these playoffs taught them anything, it's that the recipe for getting the most out of Messi is surrounding him with young, hungry stars that can do the running he can't anymore. Is that as fun as playing with your best friends? Not quite, but it is infinitely more successful. Let's see if they stick with that vibe in the interest of winning.

TH: Half of their team could be gone within a couple of weeks. Alba and Busquets are already out. Suarez likely is, too. Meanwhile, Baltasar Rodriguez, Tadeo Allende, and Rocco Rios Novo are in on loan. Maybe one or two of those get made permanent, but that still leaves some gaping holes. Honestly, it depends on the Messi effect.

RT: A significant one. They're going to lose at least two key pieces in Busquets and Alba, while Suarez appears to be on the way out, too. Players like Baltasar Rodriguez, Tadeo Allende, and Rocco Rios Novo are all on loan, as is Rodrigo De Paul, although he seems almost certain to stay. Either way, the club has plenty of spots to fill and, of course, they have the best draw in the world to fill them: Messi.

TH: Absolutely! Thomas Muller said it right after the game: This is a team still on the up. If they had brought Muller in a few months earlier and had a little more time to adjust to his game, Saturday might have been a different story. They will need to get this winter right and stay fit during the World Cup. But otherwise, they will certainly be among the faves.

RT: Yeah, they'll be fine. It'll be interesting to see if some of these players regress to the mean or if they all did actually take these big leaps forward. Either way, with a full preseason with Muller, they'll be in a pretty good place to perform in what is, admittedly, a very crowded Western Conference.

TH: Unless Miami massively screw things up in the transfer market (possible), MLS Cup looks like it's theirs to lose. This writer is playing it safe. Ask again in March, though, and things might be different. 

RT: It all depends on what Inter Miami does on the transfer market, but it's worth betting on them to get it right. If they do, they're favorites again, but even if they don't, they still have Messi, and that's enough to buy them some time at worst.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Arne Slot handed further setback after Mohamed Salah outburst as Liverpool manager confirms key attacker will miss Inter clash with injury","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/arne-slot-setback-mohamed-salah-outburst-liverpool-manager-key-attacker-miss-inter-clash-injury/bltbc4b975349ff3370","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 22:01:12 GMT","

Arne Slot has confirmed a key Liverpool player will miss his side's Champions League trip to Inter Milan due to injury. The Reds were left reeling after Mohamed Salah accused the club of ""throwing him under the bus"" amid his struggles to get back into their starting XI. After it emerged that the 33-year-old won't travel to Italy, a team-mate of his also won't feature.

After Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Leeds United on Saturday, Salah said someone at the club wants him to ""get all the blame"", that he deserves to start for the Reds after what he has done for them over the years and his relationship with manager Slot has broken down. In response, the Dutchman admitted he had ""no clue"" whether the Egypt international had played his last game for the Merseyside outfit and that he was not ""weak"" for entertaining the possibility of re-integrating the 33-year-old back into the fold. Hot on the heels of that, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher called Salah's comments ""disgraceful"" and accused him of trying to get Slot sacked. This came after the Reds had decided against taking Salah to the San Siro for Tuesday's Champions League encounter with Inter, and to make matters worse, the Premier League title holders will be without more attacking options for this tough fixture.

On Monday night, Slot told reporters that winger Cody Gakpo will be out for several weeks after picking up an injury against Leeds, and fellow wideman Chiesa is also not going to play due to illness.

He said: ""Federico is ill, that is poor timing you could say but not something you can do about. If he has an amazing recovery, which doctors don't expect, he might travel tomorrow, but that's not what I expect. Cody picked up an injury against Leeds and he will be out for a few weeks.""

Between Gakpo and Chiesa, they have scored six goals in the Premier League this season, in addition to four assists. The Dutchman has more goal contributions (seven) than any other Reds player in the league this term, so he could be a big loss for them in the coming weeks.

Incidentally, on the Inter test, goalkeeper Alisson added, ""We have a big challenge tomorrow. Inter Milan is doing so well this season, so my focus, the focus of the team, is on the challenge we're going to face tomorrow.""

There was a great deal of excitement when Chiesa swapped Juventus for Liverpool for around £10 million in the summer of 2024. However, injuries and a failure to break into the first team limited him to just 14 appearances in all competitions. This term, however, he has already played 15 times and provided five goal contributions. And that has not gone unnoticed by Slot.

When asked about the winger's chances of making Italy's World Cup squad, he said: ""It's not up to me to decide who should be selected for the national team. I'm very pleased to see that Federico is in a much better place this season than last season, when he struggled a lot with his fitness. This season, he has been much fitter and, as a result, has had more playing time than last season. When he's played, he's had some very good moments, so it is up to the Italian manager if he wants to select him. I like him as a player and person.""

A Chiesa-less Liverpool face a tough test in Italy against Inter on Tuesday night, before they return to Premier League action on Saturday at home to Brighton. The Reds, who are ninth in the table, will hope they can emerge victorious in both these encounters this week.

On the Inter game, Slot said: ""I see more similarities than differences. Same system, all the same players in what I expect as a starting line-up. Probably he did a few things but the way they press higher up the pitch, I see more similarities between Simone Inzaghi and Christian Chivu.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Mohamed Salah is in danger of “destroying his legacy” at Liverpool, says Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney, with the Egyptian superstar aiming an explosive rant in the Reds' direction. He has accused the Premier League giants of 'throwing him under the bus', with his exploits down the years deserving greater respect, but Rooney claims it is the Anfield icon who is acting out of order.

Salah has earned legend status on Merseyside, with 250 goals recorded for Liverpool through 420 appearances. He has won two domestic titles and a Champions League crown with the Reds, collecting PFA Player of the Year and Golden Boot honours along the way.

A new two-year contract was signed during the summer of 2025, with that agreement set to take Salah to a decade of loyal service. Questions are now being asked of whether he will make it beyond January 2026.

After being benched for a third successive game, as he was left watching on as Liverpool squandered two more points in a dramatic 3-3 draw at Leeds, Salah admitted that his working relationship with Arne Slot has broken down. He has hinted at bidding farewell to Reds fans during a home date with Brighton on Saturday - before he heads off on Africa Cup of Nations duty.

Rooney is among those to have been left stunned by the shocking episode, with the ex-England captain saying on his latest BBC podcast: “Arne Slot has to show his authority and pull him in and say 'you are not travelling with the team, what you said is not acceptable'. Take yourself off to Afcon and let everything calm down. If I was him there would be no way he would be in the team. It needs to be sorted out quickly either way.”

Rooney went on to say of Salah speaking out in public, with his comments dividing opinion among a fan base that have taken him to their hearts: “He is absolutely destroying his legacy at Liverpool. It would be sad for him to throw it all away. He's gone about it all wrong.”

Salah has claimed that he should not have to “go every day fighting for my position because I earned it”. Rooney believes no player should adopt that mentality, with every place having to be earned - especially at the very highest level.

He added on The Wayne Rooney Show: “Time catches up with all of us, and this season he hasn't looked as his best, at his sharpest. You want to see him roll his sleeves up and say 'ok then, I'll show you'.

“To have the arrogance to say he doesn't have to earn his place because he has already earned his place, you need to be at your best every week to try and stay in the team. If I was one of his team-mates, I wouldn't be happy at all with what he said because this is where Liverpool need him most. If anything, he has thrown Liverpool under the bus with his words.

“He's been absolutely incredible for Liverpool, but this was disrespectful to his team-mates, manager and fans. I would imagine he will be very quiet around the training ground and that will bring a negative energy in itself to the new players Arne has bedded in. I am sure over the next couple of years he will regret saying what he has.”

Liverpool are reportedly considering leaving Salah out of their travelling squad for a Champions League clash with Serie A giants Inter on Tuesday. It could be that he is left at home to reflect on his actions and whether the matter could have been handled differently.

Slot will likely be quizzed on the issue at his pre-match press conference in Italy, with the Dutch tactician being left with another fire to fight after finding positive results hard to come by of late - with the reigning Premier League champions struggling for consistency as a collective.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lorenzo Musetti has added veteran coach Jose Perlas to his team, the Italian confirmed in an Instagram post Monday.


“Let's start preparing for 2026,” Musetti wrote, captioning a photo of him with longtime coach Simone Tartarini, Perlas and fitness trainer Damiano Fiorucci. “Welcome Jose 💪.”

A post shared by Lorenzo Musetti (@lore_musetti)


Perlas boasts an extensive resumé, having coached a list of names including Carlos Moya, Albert Costa, Guillermo Coria, Nicolas Almagro, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Janko Tipsarevic and Fabio Fognini, among others. Perlas most recently worked with Serbian Dusan Lajovic. The Spaniard also captained his home country to the Davis Cup title in 2000 and 2004.


Musetti finished the 2025 season at No. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings, tallying a 45-22 match record for the year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The 23-year-old competed at the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time, gaining a spot in Turin following the withdrawal of Novak Djokovic.


Musetti hit a career-high No. 6 in June following a standout clay-court swing. He reached his first ATP Masters 1000 final in Monte-Carlo and then advanced to the semi-finals in Madrid, Rome and at Roland Garros, his first major semi-final appearance. Among his other results in 2025, Musetti reached the US Open quarter-finals for the first time and was a finalist in Chengdu and Athens.


In November, Musetti shared that he and his partner Veronica welcomed the birth of their second child, Leandro.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: All the angles as Piastri grabs P2 from Norris on Lap 1

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

From karting to Formula 1 World Champion, here is Lando Norris' journey to the top.

Lando Norris claimed his maiden Formula 1 Drivers' Championship in Abu Dhabi, becoming the 35th driver to achieve the feat in the sport's 75-year history.

The Briton's path to the top came on a foundation of success in the junior formula, starting in karting, which included the FIA F3 European Championship title in 2017 and finishing runner-up the following season in F2.

Having been promoted to a McLaren F1 seat in 2019, success gradually followed including a maiden podium just one year later in Austria and a first pole position in 2021.

The breakthrough win came in 2024 at the Miami Grand Prix and was followed by three further wins as he helped McLaren secure the Teams' Championship title.

Seven wins, including in Monte Carlo and in front of his home fans at Silverstone, as well as a further 11 podiums, ensured Norris claimed his first world title in 2025 by just two points.

TRACK INTERVIEWS

(Conducted by David Coulthard)

Q: Lando Norris, you are a world champion! The world champion!

Lando NORRIS: The world champion. Oh, God. I've not cried in a while. I didn't think I would cry, but I did. It's a long journey. First of all, I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone in McLaren, my parents. I'm not crying. My mom, my dad, you know, they're the ones who supported me since the beginning. Oh, I look like a loser!

Q: You look like a winner to me. You're only the 35th man to win a Formula 1 world championship. This is the biggest prize in motor sport.

LN:  I mean it feels amazing, you know. Yeah. I now know what Max feels like a little bit and I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors the whole season. It's been a pleasure to race against both of them. It's been an honour. I've learned a lot from both of them as well, so I've enjoyed it. It's been a long year. But we did it. We did it. And I'm so proud of everyone.

Q: Look, it's been an incredible season. It was so tight between you all. You were feisty in that race as well. We were curious to know, would you sit back and not take any risks, but you pulled off some good passes, did what you had to do. How much of that world championship was in your mind when you were running in third and how much is it just in the moment?

LN: It's a bit of both. I mean, you can't not think of it. But anyway, it's a long race to the very end. You know, we've seen many times anything in Formula 1 can happen, and I just kept pushing until the last two or three laps, [then] I could ease it off a bit, but I was still wanting to fight to the end and that's what we did. That's what we had to do this season, you know, with Max chasing us the whole way, with Oscar catching up again at the end. They certainly didn't make my life easy this year. But yeah, I don't know. I'm happy.

Q: Understandably so. And, you know, this is a beautiful moment of winning your first world championship. I don't know if you were aware of a moment — we were — you were under investigation with the overtake on Tsunoda where you went beyond the white lines, and of course nothing came of that. But were you aware of it? Did your team tell you? Because we were all on the edge of our seats.

LN: I had no idea. I had no idea. I didn't care. I mean, I knew what I did was fine so I had nothing to worry about. Yeah. I was just trying to enjoy the moment. You know, there's not many people in the world, not many people in Formula 1 ever get to experience what I've experienced this season and this year. So, I'm happy for everyone. I'm happy for everyone more than me, but yeah, I'm just crazy happy.

Q: That's wonderful to see. We're looking across, we see Zak Brown, we see your parents, your brother, your family, everyone here who's been on this journey with you. So just once again, are you able to compartmentalise — you are the world champion?

LN: I mean, look, it's been a long journey with me and McLaren. I've been with them for like nine years and we've been through plenty of crazy difficult times and plenty of good times, you know. So, for me to feel like I can bring something back to them — it's their first Drivers' in many, many years — so I feel like I did my part for the team this year and I'm very proud of myself for that, but I'm even more proud for everyone that I've hopefully made cry.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Max, look, very well done. What a race. What a season. How do you reflect on the race and the weekend as a whole? Let's start with that.

Max VERSTAPPEN: Well, honestly, we maximised everything that we could. We put it on pole, and we won the race. And I think also in the race, we had very strong pace. So, there's really not much that I could have done different. I think what complicated it a bit was that Oscar was on a different strategy. So, you never know, of course, when he then pits, how much pace he has in hand to catch up again. That also complicates a bit trying to keep the pack together or whatever. But, yeah, overall, just very proud again of the weekend that we had. We put it all out there, and, yeah, the car was actually enjoyable to drive.

Q: And what about the season as a whole? I mean, think back to Hungary where you finished more than a minute behind the winner, and here you are within two points of the world champion.

MV: Yeah. Massive rollercoaster for us. Of course, the first half had some nice moments, but mainly tough moments — some really tough races and feelings. But I'm also very proud of how we never gave up. And, again, that's also a lesson for the future, for everyone, that even when it looks like you're out of it, you never give up. You keep working hard to try and understand your issues, and then you never know what can happen.

Q: Final one. A few words from you on our new world champion, Lando Norris.

MV: Winning your first title is something that I think we all dreamt of when you get into the sport. You work for that since you're a little kid. It's what you dream of. So, when you win your first title, this is very emotional. And, yeah, I hope for Lando as well. You know, I saw a lot of his family is here, so it's important to enjoy this a lot as well tonight. Also, with his team. I think, again, that's another story where it showed that even when you have tough years, when you keep working hard, you keep adding good people to the team, you can overcome all of those things, and you can become very successful again. And, yeah, they had an incredible season together, so it's important that they enjoy it.

Q: Oscar, many congratulations on your 16th podium of 2025. You raced hard and fast this evening. How do you reflect on the race and the weekend?

Oscar PIASTRI: I think, honestly, pretty good. There wasn't anything left out there. Obviously, we tried a bit of a gamble on the strategy to give ourselves some different options and hope that the stars aligned to give ourselves the best chance. But ultimately, in the end, that didn't happen. So, yeah, I think given as well I missed a practice session, it took a little bit to find my feet. I think that was the maximum we could have achieved today. We didn't have an answer for Max's pace. So pretty happy with the weekend. Not much more we could have done.

Q: And the season as a whole, how do you reflect on that? You led the title longer than any other driver this year.

OP: Yeah. I mean, I think, obviously, I would have wished for a slightly different ending, but I think this year I've learned a hell of a lot about myself as a race car driver, myself as a person. I think if you had presented this season at the start of the year with the pole positions and the wins and the podiums, I definitely would have been pretty happy with that. And I think even in the tough moments, I've learned a lot about myself and how I can be stronger in the future. So, I think, ultimately, there's a little bit of disappointment, obviously, but I think I can be very proud of the season I've had and plenty of lessons to take to the future.

Q: And can we get your thoughts on Lando and the job he's done this year to be world champion?

OP: I think a very deserving winner. I know that every weekend I go on track, it's going to be tough. And I think we've pushed each other through the last three years. I think especially this season has been tighter than ever. So, yeah, I think he's had a great season. Probably all three of us, but obviously, myself and Lando in the same team, in the same car, have had our ups and downs at different moments. Ultimately, I think he's had a good season and a deserving champion.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race). Max, you hinted a little bit at the complication with Oscar's strategy and how you ran your race. Did you give much thought pre-race or during the race about backing up or trying to impact the flow of the race that way? Or was it more just focus on getting the job done out front?

MV: I had a lot of scenarios in my head, but then, of course, I knew once the tyres Oscar had on the car, that would be quite difficult. I think we were probably a bit too quick up front. The others couldn't really follow that well. I think Charles drove his heart out today to try and get onto that podium, so that was also impressive to see. But, of course, they went for a two-stop. I think even that made it more complicated because if you stay on a one-stop, backing the whole thing up is tough. And I think this new layout around here makes it even harder to do that compared to 2016 or whatever.

Q: (Ben Waterworth – Speedcafe) Oscar, you obviously touched on the disappointment of the season and ultimately not achieving what you were hoping. But do you think, in reflection, you'll look back at this year as a success? Not to take away from the careers of your other two rivals but neither of them was fighting for a world championship in their third season. You've come away with the most ever wins by an Australian in a single season. Can you take that hunger for the title into next year?

OP: Definitely. I mean, comparing different parts of different people's careers is always difficult with different cars and stuff. But I think definitely I can be very proud of the season I've had. When I look at this season compared to my first two years in F1, this year has been head and shoulders above the first two. Ultimately, whilst the end result is not quite what I wanted, there's a lot of optimism and a lot of strength that I've gained from proving to myself what I can achieve through this season. Those are the kinds of things that are not necessarily tied to results. So I think for me, I can definitely take that forward into the future. It's only my third attempt at this in F1. Hopefully, I've got plenty more to go, but there are definitely lessons from this year that will only make me stronger.

Q: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Max, congratulations on the race win. We heard you on the radio to GP. What has he meant to you over your career, in particular this season with all the ups and downs?

MV: It's been an emotional year. Forget about the results this year. I also don't want to go too much into detail, but it's been tough. But I'm very happy to be able to work with someone that passionate. Of course, he is my race engineer, but I see him as my friend. We have lived through so many emotional things together and fantastic achievements. I'm sure he was a bit emotional after the flag. So, I'm really looking forward to leaving here and catching up with him because it's not been easy at times for him. I'm just very proud to be able to work with someone that good. A proper example of someone that never gave up this season, even through the difficult times.

Q: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com) Oscar, you mentioned a couple of times that you've learned a lot of lessons this year. What have been the most valuable lessons? Is that related to Austin, Mexico, or does it go further?

OP: Ultimately both, I think. There've definitely been lessons directly to do with how I drive the car, how I can be better in different conditions, and just become a better all-round driver. There have also been lessons outside the car — dealing with adversity, dealing with difficult moments. I've learned a lot about myself in those kinds of things. So, there have been lessons both in and out of the car that will definitely help me for the future.

Q: (Julian Linden – Herald Sun) Oscar, 91 days till Melbourne. I'm sure you're not thinking about it now. What will you do over the summer break to prepare for it? How will you rest and recuperate?

OP: Yeah, it's nice having another summer break. I'm going back to Australia for a little bit, see my family and friends, give my annual hellos and goodbyes. I'm looking forward to some time away from racing, to be honest. It's been a long, demanding season. As enjoyable as driving the fastest cars in the world is, a break now and again is always a nice thing. So, I'm just looking forward to not thinking about race cars and spending time with people around me. Then obviously, the new season is not far away, so it's going to be important to enjoy that time off and then come back refreshed with the new challenges for next year.

Q: (Mat Coch – PlanetF1.com) Max, result and championship outcome aside, is this the best that you feel you've ever driven in Formula 1?

MV: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I have no regrets about my season. I think the performance has been strong. I've hated this car at times, but I've also loved it at times. And I always tried to extract the most from it, even in the difficult weekends that we've had. But, yeah, it's been, like I said before, a proper rollercoaster with the car. Luckily, the last, I would say, eight, nine rounds in general have been a lot more enjoyable. And also, in the team, we have a great atmosphere at the moment. We're really on a roll — positive energy, belief, confidence — and that's exactly what you want heading into next year.

Q: (Vincent Sondermeijer - NRC Netherlands) Max, was there a point during the race where you sort of resigned and thought, “Okay, I'm not going to win the title,” or did you keep believing that there might be something happening until the final lap?

MV: I just kept looking on the screen to see if something would pop up. Yeah, I mean, the race itself went really well, and I was just enjoying sitting in the car and driving it. And every straight you keep looking if something happens, but at the same time, that's part of racing. So I was not really too fussed about it.

Q: (Tom Cary – The Telegraph) Oscar, you mentioned taking some time. Are you going to get to any of the cricket this winter? Don't know if you were aware of the result earlier today in the Ashes...

OP: Oh yes, I am.

Q: (Tom Cary – The Telegraph) Did you think maybe luck was on your side — Australia gave England an absolute walloping there — and in time for the race as well?

OP: Yeah, it was nice that the boys could wrap it up before the race started. Hopefully, I will get to some cricket — ideally Boxing Day, given it's in Melbourne. I mean, there's part of me that kind of wants the series to still be alive by that point, and part of me that really doesn't. So I'll take whatever we can get. It's been enjoyable to watch for the last couple of weeks.

Q: (Tom Cary - The Telegraph) Oscar, you've been in quite a few championship battles since your career began. Is fighting for an F1 title anything comparable to other championship fights you've had?

OP: I think there are similarities, yes. The emotions you feel are more or less the same. I think what's different in F1, when I compare it to the junior championships, is the length. The longest junior championship I had was ten rounds. This one has been two and a half times that. The duration you have to live through is much more. My F2 season, for example, was eight rounds., So I think that part is quite different. And I think just the stakes are a little bit different as well. In the junior categories, you obviously want to win the championship, but you're trying to make your case for why you should be in F1. I think we've seen through the years — Max is probably the perfect example — you don't need to win championships to demonstrate your capabilities for F1. Whereas when you get to F1, there's nothing more than becoming champion. So that aspect is a bit different, but, yeah, there are also some similarities.

Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) Oscar, how do you think the dynamics will change next year in the team between yourself and Lando? Will it be harder to fight with him now that he's a reigning world champion?

OP: No, I don't think so. I don't think that will change anything. For me, he's obviously had a great season this year and a deserving champion, but he's still Lando Norris. It's not like he's become Superman. So, I don't think things will change with that. I'm expecting full fairness from the team and equality going forward. I don't have any concerns that that will change at all. Clearly, Lando's had a very strong season this year, and ultimately did a better job.

Q: (Jack Smith (Motorsport Monday / MotorsportWeek.com) Max, to follow up on Matt's question. Given how well you did drive this year and how much ground you made up to take it all the way to this race, can you take as much pride from this season compared to the pride you took from the last four years when you did win the championship?

MV: I mean, at the end of the day, of course, it's always nicer to win it. But, honestly, I'm sitting here now with probably a better feeling than what I had last year at this time because the second half of last year was pretty tricky at times as well. So, we have been struggling for, I would say, a year — the second half of last year and the first half of this year. But I actually feel a lot better now. Of course, shame to miss out on the title, but at the same time, for a long period of time I was not even thinking about the title. I never felt like I was in it until a few rounds ago. That's pretty crazy. But, yeah, you take your pride in different ways. I'm happy with myself and going into next year I'm not in a state of having to worry about my skills or whatever. So, yeah, I feel good.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Oscar, just picking up on your point about fairness. McLaren's got quite a bit of flack at points this year for the papaya rules and the equality between you and Lando. But we've got through this season without any major bust-ups and the team achieved the ultimate goal of a McLaren driver winning the title. How much is that testament to the team's approach and culture?

OP: I think it is a testament to the way we go racing. Obviously, it's not easy fighting for both the Constructors' Championship and the Drivers' Championship with two very evenly matched drivers. But ultimately, that's a problem we knew we were going to have. At the end of the day, I think there's a lot of good things that come from that. Yes, there's difficult moments and tension at times, but I think both Lando and I have become better drivers from pushing each other to the limit. Sometimes that's been uncomfortable for everyone, but ultimately, yeah, it's been a good thing. We've had a lot of discussions through the year, and I'm sure we'll have discussions in the off-season about anything we want to do slightly differently for next year. But I think at the end of the day, they gave us both as good a chance as the team could have to fairly fight for a world championship, and that's all you can ask for.

Q: (Giles Richards – The Guardian) Max, you lost out to Lando by just two points. What do you think now about the incident with George Russell in Spain? Do you regret that looking back in hindsight?

MV: You forget all the other stuff that happened in my season. The only thing you mention is Barcelona. I knew that would come. You're giving me a stupid grin now. I don't know. Yeah, it's part of racing at the end. You live and learn. The championship is one of 24 rounds. I've also had a lot of early Christmas presents given to me in the second half, so you can also question that.

CHAMPION'S PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: A very warm welcome to the FIA Formula One World Champion Lando Norris. Can you begin to describe how this feels for us?

LN: I just laugh. It's tough to describe. It's tough to put in words. I mean, I just want to go and spend some time with my team, my engineers, my mom and my dad. I don't know what I'm going to say. So much goes into achieving what we've achieved today. You know, from all those years ago when I saw Formula 1 on the TV, when I saw a go-kart for the first time – my memories the last couple laps were really just that. They took me back to where it all started because I wouldn't be here without my parents and the sacrifice they've done. My brother and my sisters, the amount of times they text me and I don't get back to them. You know, just everything. Everything that leads into achieving what we all achieved today. And this is not my world championship. This is ours. This is one where I get to say, ""Thank you, mom,"" and ""Thank you, dad."" They're the ones who sacrificed so much to let me be the lucky boy that I am today – to live my dream, to do what I have loved doing since I was a kid, driving that go-kart for the first time at home. The best memories ever, you know. And so much goes into it every year. And for the first time, I really get to say thank you to them, to my parents, to my family. And I get to really make them feel like everything they did was worth it. They might have felt like it was worth it after getting to Formula 1 or getting the first win in Miami. But, you know, the thing that makes me smile every day is making my parents proud, making my friends proud, the people who support me so much through the plenty of tough times I've had this year, celebrate the good times that I've had this year. But I feel like I finally get something to say thank you – not just in words, but in terms of the volume of a championship – that they are just as much a part of as I feel like I go out on track and perform. They're with me through every step of the way. And today, I just get to say thank you to all of them. I get to make them smile. And that's all I really want in my life is all of them to be happy and to get to celebrate. And that's what I managed to do for them all today.

Q: Lando, you were pretty convincing earlier in the weekend when you said you felt relaxed. Was that the reality? Just how tough has this weekend been for you emotionally?

LN: I've had a lot of tough moments in the beginning of the season. I had great moments – winning the first race in Australia certainly gave me a big boost. But quite quickly, I had not the best run of results, and Oscar did an incredible job, was consistently ahead of me. It got tricky at times. I think at the end of the day, it shows that consistency over a year is what helps achieve what we've achieved today. But those tricky moments, like everyone says, you've got to learn from them, acknowledge them, understand them. I've had to go above and beyond in terms of expanding my group, the people I work with on the track, and more so off the track. The amount of people that I have in my corner – not from McLaren but externally: my friends, my family, my coaches, people that help me think in better ways and perform in better ways. So many people allowed me to go out and be more calm and almost try and not acknowledge the pressure or just perform under pressure and have the second half of the season that I had. If I look back on it, my first half of the season – not the most impressive. Certainly, times I made some mistakes, made some bad judgments. I made my errors, as I'm sure every driver would admit to. But how I managed to turn all of that and have the second half of the season that I had is what makes me very proud – that I've been able to prove myself wrong.

There were doubts I had in the beginning of the year, and I proved myself wrong. And that's something that makes me very happy. Like I said, this was a moment that I got to thank them all for that – all their hard work, all the stuff that other people do for me. This is my way of saying thank you. But I did feel calm. I felt calm until three corners to go. I started to shake a little bit. I got to think of all those incredible memories very quickly, and then I got to see the team when I went over the line. And this is a moment that I'll never forget.

Q: Final one from me. Just how do you think you're going to grow as a driver as a result of this championship?

LN: That I'll find out. You know, I feel proud but not because I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and go, ""I beat everyone."" I'm not proud because I get to just say I'm a world champion. I'm proud because I feel like I made a lot of other people happy. I made my engineer Will, Jarv as well – they don't get to see their family much. They've seen me grow up more than they've seen their own kids grow up. I feel bad about that. But the fact that they put so much effort into making me perform and helping us... I'm shaking. Helping us all perform. The fact I get to make them feel like their time has been, hopefully, a little bit worth it—that's what makes me so happy. I hope it doesn't change anything I do, the way I think, the way I do things. I believe I won the championship this year my way – by being a fair driver, by trying to be an honest driver. At times, could I have been more aggressive and got off the brakes and had a few people over? I certainly could have done, and maybe I would need to do more of that in the future. But did I need to do it this year? Is that the way I want to go racing? Is that me? It's not. And I'm sure if you compare me, if that's what you wanna do, to all the champions: have I been as aggressive as them at times? No. Have I been as daring as them at times? No. But did I do just what I needed to do to win the world championship? Did I perform consistently? Did I perform when I needed to under the most pressure? Post-Zandvoort, did I come back in the way I had to? Did I have three, four weekends of great results? I did. And I performed when I needed to perform to win the World Championship this season. And in the end, that's what I needed to do. That's all I needed to do. Of course, I'll learn from everything. Like I said, moments I wish I could go back on and I feel bad for, like Montreal and things like that, I embarrassed myself. But I wish I could go back and change some things. Plenty of moments to learn from. I feel like I'm a better driver now, certainly, than I was at the beginning of the season. But everyone's going to do it. And when I'm racing against Max, a four-time world champion, when I'm racing against Oscar, a guy who at some point in the future will probably beat me and be a world champion, I'm performing. And I'm having to perform against the best in the world. And I look forward to plenty more times like that. And I need to understand what I can do better, how can I do better, how can I perform more consistently against them and learn from them? And I feel like I did that this year, and I've got to do that even more next year if I want to retain what we've been able to achieve this year.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Laurence Edmondson – ESPN) Congratulations, Lando. Well done. Fantastic. Just on the Zandvoort thing you mentioned there. Obviously, there you were 34 points behind all of a sudden. Did that actually release some of the pressure and allow you to get more of your true performance from yourself for that period afterwards?

LN: I honestly would just want to say no. It didn't allow me to relax. Like, when I see 34 points against a guy who's in the same car, who's doing an incredible job, who I know is incredibly quick, that didn't fill me with confidence. And it wasn't like, ""I got nothing to lose now, I can just go."" I felt like I was trying to do everything I could before, and I continued to try and do everything I could after. But I just had to step up what I was doing away from the track. Like I said before, the people I was working with, I added more people to that group. I had to work harder both on the simulator and here at track. I had to change my approaches. I had to change my... yeah, like a lot of people do. I had to dig deep and try and understand more things quicker and in a more advanced way than I ever have before. That's what gave me the advantage I had – not, ""Oh, the pressure's off, I can go and do what I'd like to do."" It was really the opposite. I was like, ""Oh, shoot. I'm quite a long way behind against a pretty freaking fast driver, and I've got to step it up."" And I got to be more myself because of external factors—working with more professionals in different areas to unlock more of my ability. And I think when you saw that, I had that run of great results, which is ultimately what got me the championship in the end.

Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) Congrats, Lando, on getting the job done. You've often described Max this year as, you know, the best that there's ever been, you know, almost the GOAT. What does it feel to you to be able to have actually beaten him to win the first world title? And now you've got that one out of the way, do you think more world championships can follow?

LN: Look. I hate ever having to try and compare myself to other people. This is all for you guys to decide whether someone's better than someone else or not. All I try and do every weekend is the best of what I can. But then you decide he's better than him, or he's got a worse car and he's doing better – write what you like, decide what you like. I certainly feel like at moments I've driven better than I feel like other people can. And I feel like I drove at a level I don't think other people can match. But have I also made my mistakes? Have I made more mistakes than other people at times? Yes. Is there stuff Max could do better at times than me? Yes. Do I believe he's unbeatable? No. But you also don't know, do you? It's hard to know. Like, they also struggled with the car in the mid part of the season. They've had an incredible second half of the season. They took advantage of the fact we had two of us fighting for a world championship. He really made the most of that and Max drove like he is a four-time world champion. And I'm very happy that I got to race against him and try to prove myself against him. Whether then you want to write whatever you want to write, against him, against me, or whatever it is, feel free. But I'm not here—honestly, like I said at the beginning—my motivation is not here to prove I'm better than someone else. That's not what makes me happy. I'm not goping to wake up tomorrow and go, ""I'm so happy because I beat Max."" I honestly, deep down, don't care about that. I don't care if every article is, ""Do you think he's better than me?"" or ""Oscar's better,"" or whatever it is. Doesn't matter. I have no interest in that. I've just done what I've needed to do to win the world championship. That's it. And I made my people happy. That's all I really care about at the end of the day. I'm not going to wake up happy tomorrow because I can just go and say to myself, ""I'm world champion."" It might make me smile, but it's not gonna be the truth. It's gonna be, ""My mom's happy. My dad's happy. My sisters are happy. My brother's happy. My friends are happy."" And that's all I need in my life.

Q: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) Congratulations, Lando. You mentioned the difficulties in the first part of the year. Just wondered around sort of the first third of the season—did you start to feel like the chance was slipping away at all? And at what point did you start to change things around you? You mentioned additions and who you worked with and whatnot. Did that come later, or were you starting to do things already earlier in the season?

LN: Honestly, I can't remember the exact time things started. Certainly levelled up a lot more through the halfway point – around Zandvoort time – but it definitely started prior to that.

It started after I had that kind of bad run in race two, three, four, five, six, that kind of area. Or certainly when it was like, ""Alright, my way is not working. I've got to understand things differently. I've got to speak to more people. I've got to understand what I'm thinking, why I'm thinking it. Why am I doing this? Why am I getting tense in qualifying? Why am I making the decisions that I'm making?"" Whatever it may be. Certainly, the bad run of results and lack of performance—not speed, because I think the speed's always there—but lack of putting things together when I had the capability of putting things together, allowed or opened up the doors to go and understand: ""Okay, I need to do more than just try again next weekend. I need to try and understand things on a deeper level."" Mentally. That opened up understanding myself more, understanding things more at a championship level. That's the level I've got to be at.  They are world champions. And yes, certainly the struggles turned into strength. So I would say, if I didn't have those struggles at the beginning and then had the weakness at the end, would I have caught on to those things as quickly? Probably not. So I was thankful that I had some of the tough moments early on and managed to turn them around. When I got in that kind of good rhythm in the last three months, almost when there's been more pressure than ever, was almost when I felt most comfortable and most confident into qualifying, you know, I could go from chatting to my engineers and having a fun time with my mechanics to going out and getting pole a few minutes later. So, yeah, the struggle was at the beginning really allowed me to unlock my potential later on.

Q: (Molly Hudson – The Times) Huge congratulations, Lando. How proud are you not just of in the car, but outside of the car you've stayed the same Lando, you've still been critical on yourself, you've still worn your heart on your sleeve. There's been a lot of people that have written or said, ""you can't win a championship like that,"" and you have.

LN: Thank you. End of. Look, again, that's one of the things that makes me most proud. I feel like I have just managed to win it the way I wanted to win it, which was not by being someone I'm not. Not trying to be as aggressive as Max or as forceful as other champions might have been in the past – whatever it may be. I'm happy. I just won it my way. I'm happy I could go out and be myself and win it Lando's way, as Andrea would tell me. That certainly makes me happy. Like I said at the beginning, could I have gone out and been more of that person you probably want me to be at times? I could have done. I would have been less proud about it in some ways. So, that's why I'm very happy with myself. I kept my cool, I kept to myself, I kept the focus on myself, and I got the most out of how I am. And I know at times I say some stupid things, and I say some things about Max, or I might have said some things at times in the past that everyone talks about, about Lewis. Some things I regret and I wish I could take back and never have come out my mouth. But I honestly believe I give more respect to anyone else than anyone else. I give more respect to Oscar. I give more respect to Max. I try and give as much respect as I can to Lewis—he's seven-time world champion. He's the best driver—you compare him to Schumacher—the best driver that's ever been in Formula 1. I'm not even close to that. I might never be. I dream of those kind of things. I dreamed of today, and I've managed to achieve one of seven, comparing to him. And do I regret some of the comments I might have said in cooldown rooms or whatever it is? Yes. But a lot of those are in the heat of the moment. And by the time I've said it, I've gone, ""Why the hell did I just say that?"" So, I try and be as genuine as I can. I try and always speak the truth. I never try and give you guys false understandings of things. If I think we're going to win, I'm going say, ""I think we're gonna win."" If I think Red Bull are going be fast or probably going to be fast, I'm going to say it. I'm trying to honestly always—I have no gain by trying to hide things from you guys. And, you know, deep down, do I really hate when you write crap about me? I do. It's also life, and I've learned to live with some of those things more. And I also value that everyone has their own opinions—whether they like me or not or think someone else is better or not—like we just spoke about. What I'm happy is that I did things my way this season. I won it in my way, my style of just trying to be a good person and a good team member. And I'm proud about that. No matter what other people want to write about and say about it, no one really knows the truth apart from the people on the inside, in terms of what's going on.

And I don't need to listen to those things. So, as long as I know I've done a good job, which I have now proven to myself I have, then that's the only thing I really need to listen to. Is now myself and my team. And that's all I need.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Lando, massive congratulations. In the race itself, how stressful were those moments? Obviously, quite a few, bits of traffic, you had to fight your way through and things like that. What's your plan to celebrate tonight? Is it just Monster in that glass or anything stronger?

LN: Hell no! It's way more! This might be my only time—I really hope it's not, and I am confident it's not going be my only time of sitting here alone. It's quite lonely here. No one else sat by my side.

But I want to enjoy this moment because not many people ever will get to experience what I've managed to experience today. The effect, the feeling it's had on other people, that makes me so happy. So I'm going to celebrate. Well. My friends, I really hope they've all had many drinks already because I want to go and party with them, because this is more about them than it is about me.

My mechanics, my engineers, I mean, crap, we got a test on Tuesday morning, but yeah. I know certainly moments through the race today where I was like, ""Okay, Tsunoda's up next."" And we knew from before that Tsunoda might try and do it—try and hold me up and make my life difficult like Perez did to Lewis just a few seasons ago. So a lot of that was in our script and estimations already. But I managed to get through pretty quickly. And it was a bit close. It got pretty close. And it's crazy thinking about it, because they do think about it straight away. You're like, ""Damn, if that was five centimetres closer—it's over."" And that's when you get to the end of the race—three laps to go, four laps to go—I stopped taking any kerbs because I'm like, if that just makes one piece of the car undo itself, it's over. That kind of thing. So, I'm like, ""Should I go for fastest lap on the last lap? Maybe."" It's not worth it. A lot of those things go through your head. I had to make some fairly decisive overtakes and commit to a few things. But again, the championship was not won today. It was won by my consistency this year, by my great races over the last four months or so. It could have been an easier race. It also could have been a harder race. But sometimes, yeah—it was just another race on the calendar for me. It was a fun race, but I tried to really treat it as, ""Okay, it's just another race today,"" like I said, and tried to stay calm through it, which I feel like I did, and tried to just maximise my result.

Jimmy Kimmel is sticking around for another year.


	The comedian has signed a one-year extension with ABC to continue hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live! It means that his deal, which was set to run through May 2026, will now run through May 2027.


	Deadline understands that it will likely be his last contract to host the show, although given that Kimmel has vacillated wildly over the years when it comes to his contracts, it's never a given. 


	It comes after a tumultuous year for Kimmel after he was pulled off the air by Disney in the wake of comments surrounding the murder of Charlie Kirk. He also lost his close friend and bandleader Cleto Escobedo III last month.

	Speaking at last month's Screentime event, hosted by Bloomberg, which broke the news, Kimmel said that he didn't want to discuss his future. “I often answer that question, and then I do the opposite of what I said previously. I said this is going to be like my last one [on the] last three contracts. I said this is the last one. So, I've learned not to say anything anymore, because it upsets my staff,” he said.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Kimmel, who told staff at the show on Monday, said that he still thinks late-night television has a future, but the cost of these shows, which he has pegged at around $120M per year, is one of the problems.


	“I don't think there's a reason for these shows to go away. I think there are different. There are ways. These shows started out because they were a way to get high priced talent for almost free. That was the whole trick. That was the whole reason they started these shows. It was deemed to be promotional. So, the idea that these shows need to cost $120M is crazy,” he said.

	











Jimmy Kimmel Live! is currently in its 24th season, having started airing in 2003.

Paramount's last and best offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, one that it took hostile today, includes funding from the Public Investment Fund (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), L'imad Holding Company PJSC (Abu Dhabi), Qatar Investment Authority (Qatar) and Affinity Partners, the investment fund of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.


	Abu Dhabi-based Lunate and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund are both big investors in Affinity. The Kushner firm is also part of a group that's agreed to buy Electronic Arts for $55 billion.


	Paramount earlier Monday announced a hostile takeover offer for WBD, taking its arguments directly to shareholders after, it said, the company run by David Zaslav rebuffed its repeated overtures (six in total). WBD inked a deal instead to sell its studios and streaming assets to Netflix. 

	











	WBD says it will “carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer” but “The Board is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix. Warner Bros. Discovery intends to advise its stockholders of the Board's recommendation regarding Paramount Skydance's tender offer within 10 business days.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump said last night that Netflix's streaming dominance if combined with HBO Max “could be a problem” and that he would be involved in assessing any deal. The merger would likely go before the Department of Justice.


	A series of SEC filings today detailed the saga and revealed Paramount's Middle Eastern backers in the final bid submitted last week. In response to WBD concerns, Paramount said, the groups “agreed to forgo any governance rights – including board representation – associated with their non-voting equity investments.

	











	“Accordingly, the Transaction will not be within CFIUS's jurisdiction,” it said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency body that reviews foreign investments for potential national security risks.


	China's Tencent, which was part a previous offer, was no longer a partner in the transaction in its latest iteration.  


	“Paramount addressed every single material issue that it received specific feedback on, despite never receiving any written response … on any of the transaction documents submitted,” Paramount said pressing its case directly with WBD shareholders. It's offering them $30 a share in cash to buy the entire company. They have until Jan. 8 to take Paramount up on the offer, which may be extended.


	The total cash funding from Paramount's affiliates and partners, which also includes RedBird Capital, comes to $40.7 billion. The deal also includes debt financing arrangements with Bank of America, Citi and Apollo Capital Management in an aggregate principal amount up to $54 billion.


	Paramount notes that the $40 billion is entirely backstopped by the Ellison Trust, meaning it could and would if needed cover all financial commitments.


	“The Ellison Trust has financial resources well in excess of what would be required to meet its commitments … including, among many other assets and financial resources available to it, record and beneficial ownership of approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle Corporation stock with a market value of approximately $252 billion as of the date of this Offer to Purchase.”


	The Ellison Trust played a similar role in Skydance's much smaller acquisition of Paramount.


	On a call with Wall Streeters earlier today hosted by Paramount's CEO David Ellison and chief strategy and operating officer Andy Gordon, one analyst noted the passive Middle East backers and asked for “any color on why they're investing so much with no governance rights? Like, is there any rationale you can provide?”


	Ellison said they're doing it for the returns of a merged Paramount-WBD, which would be extremely “cash flow generative.”


	“It's incredibly attractive to obviously all shareholders, and from that standpoint, I think that's why our partners obviously are here. When you look at the returns, this is a good thing for our business. It's obviously why we're advocating for it so strongly here today … They're incredibly sophisticated investors. They'll look at it through the lens all investors do, which is how do they maximize value. And one of the things that we always look at as the largest investor in this business is we are shoulder to shoulder with shareholders, looking to maximize value for everybody involved in our company.”

Rebel Wilson and wife Ramona Agruma are expecting baby No. 2 — and it's a girl!

The fashion designer announced that she was pregnant with the couple's second child Monday, posting an Instagram video that showed several photos from their relationship.

In the first pic, the two women hugged and kissed before sharing a sweet photo of their first daughter, Royce Lillian, as a newborn.

They then shared a snap of Agruma's positive pregnancy test before she flashed her growing bump.

“From this to … baby number 2 is on her way,” they wrote on the video as they captioned the post, “The happiest news in our family 🥰 it will be 4 of us soon! Baby number 2 is on her way ❤️❤️❤️❤️I love you @rebelwilson.”

Wilson, 45, also celebrated the news by reporting the video on her Instagram Stories, which she captioned, “Big Wilson family news.”

In November 2022, Wilson surprised her fans when she announced the birth of her first daughter.

“Beyond proud to announce the birth of my first child, Royce Lillian, born this past week via surrogate 💗 I can't even describe the love I have for her, she's a beautiful miracle!” the actress, who had always struggled with her fertility, captioned a photo of her newborn lying down on a blanket.

The “Bridesmaid” star said she was “forever grateful” to everyone involved in her surrogacy journey and thanked her “gorgeous surrogate who carried her and birthed her with such grace and care.”

“Thank you for helping me start my own family, it's an amazing gift. The BEST gift!!” Wilson concluded. “I am ready to give little Roycie all the love imaginable. I am learning quickly…much respect to all the Mums out there! Proud to be in your club. 💗💗💗.

At the time, Wilson had confirmed her relationship with Agruma just five months prior. 

The two went on to get engaged on Valentine's Day 2023 when Wilson proposed in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland in California.

By September 2024, the sweet couple had tied the knot during an opulent seaside wedding ceremony at the Hotel Cala di Volpe in Sardinia, Italy.

However, it wasn't until December 2024 that Wilson and Agruma got legally married in the former's native Australia.

The “How To Be Single” star explained that she and Agruma decided to wed in Sydney so her elderly grandmother could be there in person.

Wilson came out as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community in June 2022 when she introduced Agruma as her partner via social media.

Meghan King and her ex-husband Jim Edmonds have reached an agreement after the “Real Housewives of Orange County” alum lost temporary custody of their three kids.

“The custody hearing has been called off, and both sides have reached an agreement that is in the best interests of the children,” Edmonds' rep, Steve Honig, told Page Six on Monday.

The details of the agreement were not immediately known.

Last month, Page Six revealed that King lost temporary custody of her and Edmonds' daughter, Aspen, 9, and twin sons, Hart and Hayes, 7, after allegedly giving Hayes unprescribed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication.

She also allegedly asked the school nurse to administer the medication.

An insider told us that Hayes has not been diagnosed with ADHD.

We were told that Jim and his current wife, Kortnie Edmonds, then received a call from Child Protective Services (CPS) and flew from Tennessee, where they reside, to his kids in Missouri.

Our insider said King was granted supervised visits with her children twice a week, and a hearing was supposed to take place on Dec. 9.

Page Six was also told that the exes' brood spent the Thanksgiving holiday with Jim and Kortnie.

After Thanksgiving, the retired MLB star celebrated Aspen's 9th birthday by throwing her a Taylor Swift-themed party.

 On Nov. 30, Jim took to Instagram to share a glimpse at the bash and decor, including pink balloons and a themed cake.

Another snap showed the birthday girl holding a brand new Labubu.

“What a week! A lot to be Thankful for @kortnieoc,” the former athlete captioned the photos.

King honored Aspen's big day with a birthday tribute via Instagram, which read, “My favorite female to ever walk the planet. 

“A spectacular gift from God was born 9 years ago today. When I learned what love is. I love you Aspen King Edmonds. I love you to infinity. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.”

While the ex-Bravolebrity has yet to publicly address her custody situation, her former co-star Kelly Dodd has defended her by calling her a “good mother.”

Patrick Mahomes knows Travis Kelce's football career can come to an end at any time.

The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback said he's savoring the time he gets to play with the 36-year-old tight end following their tough loss to the Houston Texans on Sunday.

“Every season I've had with him these last few years, I try to cherish because you never know,” Mahomes, 30, said.

“He got himself in great shape this year and he's played great football,” he continued. “He'll have the option to do whatever he wants to do after this season, but I know one thing: He'll give everything he has for the rest of this season to try to give us a chance to make a playoff run.”

Advertisement

“We know the chances are getting lower and lower.”

Mahomes acknowledged the Chiefs' struggles this season.

“We just have to execute at a higher level in those big moments,” he said. “It's something we haven't done this year.”

Kelce looked visibly upset on the sidelines after he dropped a pass from Mahomes in the fourth quarter, which led to a Houston interception late in the game. His dropped pass came during the Chiefs' last chance to score and tie the game.

He declined to give interviews after the game, according to ESPN.

Kelce's fiancée, Taylor Swift, attended the game on Sunday alongside Selena Gomez and Lena Dunham. Leonardo DiCaprio was also spotted in Kelce's suite at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., though the Oscar-winning actor wasn't seated by Swift and her pals.

Last month, Kelce shared that he was focused on winning, rather than retirement.

“All of that will be at the end of the season and I won't be thinking about it until then,” he told reporters.

And of course, he has his upcoming wedding to Swift, 35, to focus on. Multiple sources told Page Six that the pop superstar wants to marry the NFL athlete at Ocean House in Rhode Island on Saturday, June 13, 2026 — so much so that she paid off a couple who already booked the venue for that day to secure the wedding date.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","All is disappointingly calm in the Silent Night, Deadly Night remake","https://www.avclub.com/silent-night-deadly-night-review","Mon, 08 Dec 2025 19:00:00 GMT","

The original Silent Night, Deadly Night has a two-fold cultural legacy: A killer poster that looked great on a video store shelf and the “garbage day” meme, which originated in the first of four sequels. In 1984, the film elicited outrage from the likes of Mickey Rooney, who would ironically star in Silent Night, Deadly Night 5: The Toy Maker, but was more of an exploitation also-ran to that summer's big Christmastime horror-comedy: Gremlins. With this second remake (following 2012's Silent Night), Silent Night, Deadly Night writer-director Mike P. Nelson has a low bar for his sleigh to clear, and he came up with a fun-in-theory premise to deliver: A Hallmark movie about a serial killer Santa, adding grisly killings to the rote clichés of laid-back, low-budget holiday rom-coms. But in practice, the film is even less than the sum of its genre trappings.

Like the original, Silent Night, Deadly Night opens with eight-year-old Billy Chapman watching Santa Claus gun down his parents in cold blood. Cut to 20 years later and Billy (now played by Halloween Ends‘ Rohan Campbell) is an aimless drifter, murdering in motel rooms at the behest of the malevolent baritone voice in his head (Mark Acheson, best known as Elf‘s Mailroom Guy) telling him to “Kill the naughty or else the nice will die.” Still haunted by that fateful Christmas, Billy carries out the voice's murderous whims while dressed as a Temu Santa. Fleeing his most recent crime scene, Billy hops a bus to the underpopulated small town of Hackett, Wisconsin, where he meets Pam (Ruby Modine), the clerk at her father's (David Lawrence Brown) quaint Christmas shop. Immediately smitten, and despite his inner voice's protests, Billy rips a “Help Wanted” sign out of the shop's window with the confidence of a Depression-era train-hopper and scores a job as a stock boy.

Silent Night, Deadly Night fares best when in Hallmark mode, punctuating stock beats with a quick kill. The small-town meet-cute and Billy's stay at the local inn evoke the cozy comforts of those low-effort seasonal delights. But the movie can't decide which kind of Hallmark movie it is. Is this one where he finds the spirit of Christmas in a small town's warmth and a high school sweetheart, or one where he's dating Santa Claus' daughter? The movie isn't sure, so it does what any self-respecting slasher would do: It adds unnecessary side plots and superfluous business from different versions of the script to gum up the works. An ancient advent calendar where Billy counts down the days in the blood of his victims, a body-swap plot pulled from Child's Play, and another local killer known as “The Snatcher” all provide frequent diversions that lead to an overcooked turkey. As the film progresses, it works itself into knots to frame Billy as an antihero. When the movie can't find sufficient evidence of his victims' wrongdoing, Nelson retcons what he can. A handsy older neighbor turns out to be a wife killer! The town Scrooge is actually a white nationalist! It's all enough to pad out the original's overlong 82 minutes to an unforgivable 95. 

As Billy, Rohan once again takes on the role of proxy killer, trading Halloween Ends‘ absentee Michael Myers for a low-rent Eddie Brock. Rohan makes for a good drifter and, if you squint hard enough, some semblance of humanity can be spotted in his brief, quasi-charming flirtations with Modine. However, he's restrained by the film's structure, which retains the killer's POV. That keeps this underlit remake in the lurid exploitation mold of the original, but it does nothing for the suspense. With plenty of splatter but minimal gore, Nelson often cuts away just as Billy's axe makes contact, as if he were conspicuously aiming his unrated film at the confines of an R. So why bother, beyond boasting “unrated” as a marketing stunt? Nelson's attempts to convince us that these Billy's victims are “naughty” enough to have their heads hacked off are a struggle throughout, leading to a third-act info dump that serves to make a neo-Nazi even worse (she also kills people!). In that third act, Nelson's merciful editor, Geoff Klein, reveals how much of the film he has excised, condensing what was likely a prologue down into a last-minute, cut-to-ribbons flashback. 

There is an original take on Silent Night, Deadly Night somewhere in this film. Actually, there are several. But the movie is noncommittal toward all of them, as if Nelson were playing whack-a-mole with studio notes. At times, the movie is aiming for the nihilistic satire of this year's Toxic Avenger, but lacks that film's strong point of view and consistent sense of humor. Unfortunately for all involved, the best version of Silent Night, Deadly Night remains the Tales From The Crypt segment “And All Through The House,” in which a femme fatale's Christmas Eve murder plot is interrupted by an escaped mental patient sporting a Santa costume. There's tension, tinsel, and simplicity to that story that Silent Night, Deadly Night‘s overworked script would wrap in lights and baubles, as if over-decorating a dead tree. Silent Night, Deadly Night misses its holiday mark and lands in the no-man's land between Christmas and New Year's: There's not much going on as unrealistic anticipation leads to disappointment around how you spent your night.

Guillermo del Toro has long told stories about the gnawing ache of being alive. Before “The Shape of Water” won Best Picture, before “Pinocchio” raised the bar for animation, before this year's “Frankenstein” positioned him as a serious Oscar contender yet again, the Mexican filmmaker was meditating on the same themes. 

The foundation to all of that was “Cronos,” his auspicious 1993 debut — now in newly restored 4K from Janus Films, opening in theaters at New York's IFC Center on Wednesday, December 31. 

 










An unconventional take on the futile pursuit of immortality, “Cronos” sees antiques dealer Jesús Gris (Federico Luppi) discover an ancient device with addictive powers that restore his youth and make him blood-thirsty but unkillable. The vampiric scenes that build his genre-mandated downfall are born from the same golden DNA that would define del Toro's entire career. Extravagant production design and creature work enshrine an intricate meditation on what it means to be human, challenging audiences to consider how individual actions change the meaning of each person's fleeting time on Earth. 

 








Related Stories Director Kevin Lewis Almost Died from COVID — but That Wasn't the Only Battle This Filmmaker Had to Fight Golden Globes Snubs and Surprises, from ‘Wicked: For Good' and ‘Avatar: Fire and Ash' to ‘Jay Kelly' and ‘Sirāt' 

Actor Ron Perlman, delightfully deranged and playing one of two antagonists here (the other is Mexican film legend Claudio Brook), went on to become one of del Toro's most enduring collaborators. The director's lifelong interest in the tenderness and grotesquerie is immediately apparent and presented with the kind of frenzied confidence that continues to make del Toro's work feel explosive even as studios have made his movies more expensive and polished. 

Revisiting “Cronos” now, the artistic journey del Toro took from making his first movie to adapting a text as epic as Mary Shelley's “Frankenstein” for Netflix resembles a straight line as deep and effecting as the cut of a butcher's knife. Already earning awards buzz, “Frankenstein” feels like the culmination of threads that began in this debut — a melancholy fixation on the prepossessing nature of beauty and a tragic reflection on bodies that don't quite belong to the world around them. 

As del Toro enters the Oscars' race with one of his best projects to date, the return of the feature that founded his filmography serves as a kind of toast to the mastery of art, life, and indescribable spaces between. “Cronos” is a timeless win for the big screen; not to mention, a New Year's movie. 

 










The “Cronos” 4K restoration from Janus Films opens at the IFC Center on December 31. Watch the trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, below.

The star of Pitchfork's fourth and final zine of the year is Dijon. Few artists had a more impactful 2025 than the Los Angeles singer-songwriter, who not only released his critically acclaimed sophomore album, Baby, but also toured North America, had key features on Justin Bieber's Swag and Bon Iver's SABLE, fABLE, and made his acting debut in Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another.

In our cover story, which is accompanied by photos from Julian Klincewicz, contributor Paul A. Thompson speaks to Dijon about a whirlwind 12 months, going from cult act to one of the most compelling voices in modern music.

							By 

	Tessa Stuart



	Just a few weeks ago, the Republican Party was ripping itself apart as factions moved to either distance themselves from Nick Fuentes, the 27-year-old white nationalist streamer, or to loudly announce they would never bow to the woke mob demanding they disavow the openly racist, proudly misogynist, Holocaust-denying Hitler fanboy. 


	The outrage cycle is apparently over now, and Fuentes has come out on top: Instead of being sidelined by the uproar that erupted after his appearance on Tucker Carlson's show in October, Fuentes is now being courted by some of conservative media's biggest names. Last week he appeared on Alex Jones' Infowars and Steven Crowder's podcast Louder With Crowder. Today he's scheduled to sit down with Piers Morgan, for his YouTube show Uncensored. 


	The latest uproar fits a pattern for Fuentes, a merchant of young white male rage. He has not only survived repeated attempts to cancel him, dating back to his days as a college freshman, but seems to grow more emboldened and attract an even larger audience with each attempt to make him go away. (Fuentes did not respond to an interview request.)

	











	The onetime Ted Cruz fan with what he once described as “off the shelf” Republican views has become so popular as a white nationalist, woman-hating, Charlie Kirk-antagonizing influencer that even the White House is apparently shaking in its boots.


	Whether Fuentes' views are worthy of condemnation is not really a question. He's called Hitler “really fucking cool” and cast doubt on the Holocaust, saying there was no way to bake “6 million cookies” in five years: “The math doesn't add up!” After breaking onto the national scene as a figure at Charlotteville's Unite the Right protest, he argued that life was better for Black Americans under Jim Crow. (“They had to drink out of a different water fountain? Big fucking deal. Oh no, they had to go to different schools! Who cares, grow up.”) The self-described “proud incel” has also said rape is not a big deal, women are too emotional to make political decisions, and he celebrated Donald Trump's defeat of Kamala Harris by tweeting: “Your body, my choice. Forever.” (This is merely a small sample.)

	There was a moment, a few weeks ago, when the GOP appeared poised to unite in a stand against him. Cruz called Fuentes a “poison,” and House Speaker Mike Johnson said it was a “mistake” to platform him. Commentators Ben Shapiro and Mark Levin piled on. And Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts was nearly pushed out of his job, under fire from former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and employees at the right-wing think tank, for defending Carlson's decision to host Fuentes. 


	But a funny thing happened next: The leaders of the Republican Party shrugged the whole thing off. “You can't tell him who to interview,” Trump finally said of Carlson in November, after weeks of silence on the subject. “If he wants to interview Nick Fuentes — I don't know much about him — but if he wants to do it, get the word out. Let him, you know, people have to decide.” 


	Asked about Fuentes himself — and what his role should be in the conservative movement — Trump was circumspect, offering no opinion at all. He also brushed off a question about having dinner with Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, after Kanye West brought him as a guest. “I didn't know he was coming,” Trump claimed, adding matter-of-factly that “people are controversial — some are, some aren't.”


	“Thank you, Mr. President!” Fuentes posted after Trump declined to bash him.


	Trump weighing in at all was notable, considering how studiously the White House has avoided the topic of Fuentes altogether. As The New York Times reported in September, “Current and former members of the Trump administration as well as outside advisers would not be quoted for the record about Mr. Fuentes out of fear, they said, of inviting online attacks from him and his zealous followers. Three of them mentioned the sudden ubiquity of Fuentes-related clips circulating in their social media feeds.”

	Vice President J.D. has also been conspicuously quiet on the subject. In the midst of the Republican flamewar over Fuentes' Carlson appearance, he tweeted, “The infighting is stupid. I care about my fellow citizens — particularly young Americans — being able to afford a decent life, I care about immigration and our sovereignty, and I care about establishing peace overseas so our resources can be focused at home. If you care about those things too, let's work together.” (Fuentes gleefully celebrated this non-disavowal too, explaining that Vance was caught in “the groyper squeeze,” wanting Fuentes' far-right supporters' votes but feeling pressure from donors to distance himself from Fuentes' views.)

	











	His success can, in a sense, be attributed to Trump himself: More than any other young conservative figure operating today, Fuentes is a student of the president and the conservative media ecosystem that rejected him before it embraced him. Fuentes grew up in La Grange Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. At the beginning of the 2016 election, the high school senior and student body president was a committed Ted Cruz head, canvassing for the Texas Republican ahead of the Illinois primary. But something in him shifted after Super Tuesday. 


	“I said: I could get behind Trump because he's a winner. He'll win for our side. That was the first big thing,” Fuentes explained to Carlson. “Then as I listened to him more and more, his speeches and his rhetoric, I started to think about immigration” — a subject he says he, having grown up in a “95 percent white suburb,” hadn't given much thought to in the past. 


	It was not Trump, but Mark Levin — who, today, is the country's second most-popular conservative radio host, after Sean Hannity — whom Fuentes credits with putting him on the path to radicalization when he was still in high school. “I'll never forget one show, he goes live and he says, ‘America is becoming a majority nonwhite country. Does anybody think that's a good idea?' I was thinking to myself, yeah, that actually doesn't sound so good,” Fuentes told Carlson. “I didn't really even think that America was becoming a majority-minority like that.”


	“You were radicalized on race by Mark Levin?” Carlson asked.


	“Yes,” Fuentes said. “He planted the seed, at least.”


	Levin has denounced both Carlson and Fuentes, who he called “little Adolf.”


	“Everybody is not worth debating and everybody is not worth platforming — neo-Nazis, Klansmen, racists, bigots,” Levin said on his show on Oct. 30. “These aren't policy disputes. These aren't white-paper issues. These aren't debates about principle.” (Levin did not respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone.)


	Fuentes left Chicago for Boston University, where he quickly distinguished himself as the kid in the MAGA hat railing against “multi-cultural movement in America.” Within a couple of months, he became a recognizable character on campus — no small feat, at a school with more than 30,000 students — and a magnet for reporters looking for Trump supporters to interview. 


	In fall 2016, Fuentes shared his enthusiastic support for the Republican candidate with several local outlets, including a video recorded by the campus newspaper, BU Today — an interview that solidified his notoriety on campus.

	











	“He definitely leaned into it,” says one BU student who remembers seeing Fuentes speak. “He was not afraid of being a heel. I just don't think he was leaning into what he's currently leaning into, or at least not to the same degree.”


	Still, the same student remembers being impressed with him. “I actually had texted my friend at one point, but I was like, ‘I'm gonna remember this guy, I'm gonna be seeing him on the news one day.' But I thought it would be, like, as a politician and not as like an alt-right fringe leader,” the student says. “I had met freshmen boys before, and they're typically not super articulate.”


	The BU Today story “brought him negative attention. It honestly got to the point where people were regularly threatening him with violence online, on the Facebook group, some in-person,” says another former BU student, the then-president of BU's libertarian campus group. (He asked that his name not be used in this piece). The online vitriol — the kind directed at Fuentes directly — bothered the Young Americans for Liberty chapter president, who reached out to Fuentes and offered to host a debate about the 2016 election between Fuentes and another student. 


	“The whole point of college is to get exposed to opposing ideas and consider other points of view and just engage with them intellectually, not violently,” says the YAL president, who asked that we not share his name in the piece since he has experienced his own backlash for a mere brush with Fuentes a decade ago. “Everyone associated with him at that point was considered to be like platforming white supremacy or platforming hate speech. I just took the view that censoring people is the last thing you should do — especially at an institution like a college.”


	The debate “ended up becoming this big, hyped-up event with a lot of buzz around it,” the YAL president says. There was so much interest that it was moved to a large auditorium on campus, where a few hundred people showed up to watch Boston University's then-student body president, Jake Brewer, debate Fuentes onstage. The YAL president remembers Fuentes' dad showing up to support him. “I'm sure his dad was probably worried about him getting all of these threats.”


	Kassy Akiva, now a video journalist at The Daily Wire, was at the debate, and she recorded the whole thing. “She was very impressed with Nick and she sent it directly to Ben Shapiro,” the YAL president remembers. Shapiro, Fuentes said to Carlson, took an interest in him, and Fuentes was under the impression he was on his way toward a lucrative future as a conservative commentator, but he says that dream was snuffed out quickly after Fuentes criticized Israel online. 

	











	Shapiro and Akiva, Fuentes told Carlson, “started paying attention to me. And the more critical of Israel I was, I started to get this really intense pushback from both of them and from a lot of the people at Daily Wire.… All of them one day said, ‘You're done. We're blocking you. We're never going to speak to you again. We're never going to have you on our show.'” 


	Akiva, for her part, has disputed the idea that she and Fuentes fell out over his criticism of Israel. “We fell out because I thought he was being unnecessarily nasty to people,” she wrote on X. “Nick has been retelling this story recently to attack Ben Shapiro and claim that being ‘betrayed by friends' somehow radicalized him. It's never been true.” (Akiva did not respond to a request for comment.)


	Fuentes' version of his own story is a classic comic-book villain backstory that mirrors Trump's rise: Cast out of the club he desperately wanted to be part of, Fuentes struck out on his own, personal grievances fueling a nightly livestream that, over several years, amassed a huge audience. Today, he has more than a million followers on X.


	The recent efforts to push Fuentes out of the public square felt like déja vu to the YAL president. “It seems like every time he's censored or goes away, he comes back bigger — that's just what I've seen for the past 10 years.” Like Trump, he still believes challenging Fuentes in the open would be more effective than trying to shut him out. “Getting those ideas out in the open and actually enabling him to be confronted by someone like Tucker, or whatever shows he's going on, I think can only help moderate his views … instead of just going on his own show every night, where it's just him talking.”


	For better or worse, Fuentes is definitely getting out there more now. Whether getting out there will moderate his views remains to be determined. 


	“It sort of seems like he tried to have two paths — one more mainstream, and one fringe alt right,” the other BU student says. “The mainstream wouldn't have worked for him, he just would have been lost in a sea of conservative grifters. He went as far out there as possible, and found a group of people — founded? spearheaded? — an entire movement. It's, unfortunately, sort of impressive.”


	That movement is now big enough that Trump and Vance are both being careful not to incur its wrath. Fuentes, meanwhile, has not been shy about criticizing the Trump administration, declaring in September: “Trump 2.0 has been a disappointment in literally every way but nobody wants to admit it.” The day the Epstein files were released he tweeted three words: “MAGA is dead.”

	Even as a BU freshman, Fuentes had a keen awareness of the power of extreme rhetoric — and a recognition of the limits of continually ratcheting it up. “Strategically, we need to be supportive of Trump, and we need to overlook the bad things that he says for tactical and pragmatic purposes,” Fuentes said in an unpublished video interview recorded in 2016. But, he added: “What would we do if this fails? … What could possibly succeed Trump if he fails?”


	Almost a decade later, it remains an open question, but one that the Nick Fuentes of today seems determined to answer.

EXCLUSIVE: The Age of Disclosure, Dan Farah's explosive documentary that makes a potent case for the existence of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and the U.S. government's alleged efforts to conceal that knowledge, is off to a tremendous start on VOD, boosting the film's underdog bid for Oscar recognition.


	Within 48 hours of the film's release on Prime Video, it broke that platform's record for highest-grossing documentary, producers tell Deadline, surpassing the mark set by Oscar winner Free Solo.


	“The documentary debuted at #1 and #2 (purchase and rental respectively) on Prime Video's chart of Best Selling Movies in all genres, where it remained for the first 8 days of its release,” The Age of Disclosure producers said in a release, “outperforming major studio titles such as Warner Bros. One Battle After Another, Weapons, The Conjuring Last Rights, Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth, Disney's Tron, and Paramount's Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning. Two weeks after release, the film remains in the top ten of Prime Videos New Releases Best Sellers chart, and #1 and #2 out of all documentaries.”

					'The Age Of Disclosure' Director Dan Farah Explains ""Cold War"" For Alien Technology - Contenders Documentary		
			








The Age of Disclosure is a Farah Films Production, distributed by Relentless Releasing. It features interviews with an extraordinary array of current and former government leaders and experts in a position to know detailed information about UAPs, including Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY); Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD); James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence under Pres. Obama; Jay Stratton, retired defense intelligence senior executive, and many others.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Congress has held recent hearings on UAPs (what used to be termed UFOs) and senators Rounds and Gillibrand and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are calling for passage of the UAP Disclosure Act, which would allow for greater transparency on government findings that date back 80 years. Experts in the film say these encounters have included recovery of crashed vehicles as well as bodies of pilots. They say the U.S., China and Russia have been engaged in a kind of Cold War to “reverse engineer” the alien craft to boost their countries' defense and technology capabilities.


	“As the film shows, the truth about this situation has been covered up from public, been kept from Congress and even been kept from sitting presidents,” Farah said on Sunday during an appearance at Deadline's Contenders Film: Documentary event. He added that for his film he only interviewed “people who have direct knowledge of this topic as a result of working for the government so that the bar was set there at this credible level of people who truly know what they're talking about.”


	Hundreds of encounters with unexplained aerial phenomena have been recorded in the last few years alone, the film notes, citing improvements in radar technology as a possible reason for growing numbers of sightings.


	“It really is the biggest issue of our time,” Farah told Deadline. “It's the permanent bureaucracy in various intelligence agencies and private defense contractors and inside of the military that are gatekeeping this information and keeping it from us and our elected officials.”


The Age of Disclosure marks Farah's directorial debut. He also produced the film. His previous credits including serving as a producer on Ready Player One directed by Steven Spielberg and the Austin Butler starring fantasy series, The Shannara Chronicles, from Wednesday creators Millar & Gough.


	The documentary is one of 201 nonfiction features in the running for the Academy Awards. Shortlist voting by the Academy's documentary branch began today and extends to Friday; that vote will narrow the list to 15 remaining contenders. The shortlists in 10 Oscar categories, including documentary features and shorts, will be announced on December 16.

The end is coming for The Boys, Prime Video's adaptation of the comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. It feels as if this show has been on forever, but this final season is only its fifth—though of course there's the Gen V spinoff, the upcoming Vought Rising spinoff, the animated The Boys Presents: Diabolical anthology series, and a yet-to-come series set in Mexico. 

But first, Butcher (Karl Urban) and company need to save the world. That is the primary focus of this trailer—saving the world, what it costs, how it's worth it even if everybody dies—and to that end, said trailer involves a lot of shots of individual characters looking angry and/or worried. The synopsis says:

In the fifth and final season, it's Homelander's world, completely subject to his erratic, egomaniacal whims. Hughie, Mother's Milk, and Frenchie are imprisoned in a “Freedom Camp.” Annie struggles to mount a resistance against the overwhelming Supe force. Kimiko is nowhere to be found. But when Butcher reappears, ready and willing to use a virus that will wipe all Supes off the map, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change the world and everyone in it. It's the climax, people. Big stuff's gonna happen.

But the secondary focus—or the primary focus, depending on your feeling about a certain long-running CW series—is that this season includes a Supernatural reunion. Jensen Ackles has been on The Boys for a while now, playing Soldier Boy (who will be central in Vought Rising). But now here comes Jared Padalecki to join him! Padalecki, whose character is still a mystery, appears to walk into a room where Soldier Boy looks mighty confused by his arrival. (This could be tricky editing; it's not entirely clear if Padalecki's arrival is what Ackles' expression is about.) In Soldier Boy's defense, Padalecki kind of looks like a serial killer who stole Michael Sheen's wig from the Underworld movies.

To underscore this momentous occasion, the trailer is set to a vamped-up version of Styx's “Renegade,” a song which memorably appeared in a second-season episode of Supernatural.

The Boys is created by Eric Kripke, and along with everyone mentioned above, it also stars Antony Starr, Jack Quaid, Erin Moriarty, Jessie T. Usher, Laz Alonso, Chace Crawford, Tomer Capone, Giancarlo Esposito, Karen Fukuhara, Colby Minifie, Cameron Crovetti, Susan Heyward, and Valorie Curry.

The final season begins April 18, 2026.

      Ross Coulthart and his team of investigators explore mysterious reports of an Underwater UFO Highway leading to unexplained sightings and stories in waters below and skies above these ocean depths worldwide
    


      When it comes to UFO sightings, there are several cases that stand out for their credibility and the sheer volume of evidence and witness testimonies. Here are some of the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, based on the opinions and discussions of Redditors:
    


Location: Ruwa, Zimbabwe
    


Details: Over 60 schoolchildren witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard, and a few beings reportedly came out. The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and the children's testimonies were remarkably consistent.
    


Quote: ""The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out.""



Location: Alaska, USA
    


Details: A Japanese pilot and his crew encountered a massive UFO that was also tracked by ground radar. The pilot was later put on desk duty for speaking about the incident.
    


Quote: ""JAL Flight 1628. This imo was just incredible. What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well.""



Location: Suffolk, England
    


Details: US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge reported seeing unusual lights and a metallic object in Rendlesham Forest.
    


Quote: ""Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour. When it comes to Rendelsham, I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO.""



Location: Phoenix, Arizona, USA
    


Details: Thousands of people, including the then-Governor of Arizona, witnessed a series of lights in the sky forming a V-shape.
    


Quote: ""I live in AZ, and saw the Phoenix Lights with my own eyes, (which actually happened twice). It was never given a reasonable explanation, and even our Governor at the time admits he was told to dismiss the story and make fun of it.""



Location: Off the coast of San Diego, California, USA
    


Details: US Navy pilots, including Commander David Fravor, encountered a tic-tac-shaped object that performed incredible maneuvers. The incident was captured on FLIR footage.
    


Quote: ""The Nimitz case. You've got like 8 aviators who see and film something they can't explain.""



Location: Tehran, Iran
    


Details: Iranian military pilots attempted to intercept a UFO that caused their equipment to malfunction. The incident was also recorded by a military spy satellite.
    


Quote: ""1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO.""



Location: Weyauwega, Wisconsin, USA
    


Details: A woman and her son witnessed and photographed a disc-shaped craft with a triangular pattern of lights.
    


Quote: ""On February 1, 2003, in Weyauwega, Wisconsin, a woman and her son witnessed a disc-shaped craft with a triangular pattern of lights on its underside.""



Location: Pascagoula, Mississippi, USA
    


Details: Two fishermen claimed they were abducted by aliens with crab-claw-like hands. Their traumatized testimonies were secretly recorded by the local sheriff.
    


Quote: ""The pescagoula one with the two fishermen in the 70s where they said there was an oval ufo and robots with crab claws came out of it and took them on board and examined them before putting them back.""



Location: Suffolk, England
    


Details: US Air Force personnel reported multiple UFO sightings, which were corroborated by radar data.
    


Quote: ""In the Lakenheath case, 1956, the Condon Report said 'The apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting.'""



Location: Roswell, New Mexico, USA
    


Details: A supposed crash of a ""flying disc"" was initially reported by the local military, only to be retracted and explained as a weather balloon.
    


Quote: ""I know it'll probably get me downvoted, but I'd say Roswell. We know an event took place. The military response proves that.""



      These cases represent some of the most compelling and well-documented UFO sightings, often involving multiple witnesses, radar confirmation, and official investigations. While opinions vary, these incidents are frequently cited as strong evidence for the existence of UFOs.

The Trump administration‘s revolution of common sense took another sensible turn this week with the announcement of its plan to roll back federal fuel economy rules for passenger vehicles. The bold reversal of Obama-era standards that were escalated under former President Joe Biden builds on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's elimination of civil penalties for Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) noncompliance. The removal of these burdensome federal regulations, including the Biden administration's preposterous 50 miles per gallon target for model year 2031 vehicles, will benefit the nation in myriad ways.

Crucially, consumers can expect the cost of new vehicles to come down significantly in the coming years. Strict fuel efficiency standards force automakers to adopt expensive technologies that get tacked onto the price. The administration claims that the new standard of 34.5 miles a gallon for vehicles by model year 2031 will save people $109 billion over the next five years and cut the average cost of new cars by about $1,000. The logic behind their math is sound: the avoided technology costs will allow automakers to offer a more affordable product. The nation has been hankering for action on the affordability crisis, and ditching CAFE is a bullseye.

The change will also be a boon to the auto industry. The stubborn truth is that people prefer more affordable gas vehicles to expensive electric vehicles. That means significantly lowering the fuel efficiency mandate will stimulate sales. A thriving auto industry creates a ripple effect throughout the economy. For one thing, it is a jobs multiplier; high car sales means more manufacturing plants, parts suppliers, and auto shops.

Today, the auto industry, which drives over $1 trillion into the economy each year, employs over 10 million workers. Every dollar spent on vehicle manufacturing creates an additional $3.45 in economic value. By allowing people to buy the affordable trucks and SUVs they actually want instead of forcing expensive electric cars on them, millions more vehicles will be sold. This will keep factories humming and protect or create tens of thousands of new jobs.

Stimulating sales will also accelerate fleet turnover. When new cars are expensive, people keep their old, less safe cars for longer — the average age of cars and light trucks rose to a new record of 12.6 years in 2024, up from 11.6 in 2016. A newer fleet of vehicles means fewer highway fatalities and serious injuries due to continuous advancements in structural design and safety technology.  

Environmentalist groups predictably reacted to the announcement with horror, arguing that the rollback will be disastrous for the climate. But as they often do, climate alarmists exaggerate the risk here. The entire CAFE mandate was only projected to reduce global temperatures by 0.003 degrees Celsius by 2100. Meanwhile, compliance costs for automakers, suppliers, and ultimately consumers would have registered in the hundreds of billions over the next two decades. Is hamstringing one of our most vital industries and exacerbating the affordability crisis really worth such a vanishingly small temperature reduction, if it's even accurate to begin with? Rolling back this rule isn't “destroying the planet.” It's simply refusing to keep burning hundreds of billions of dollars while China, India, and the rest of the non-Western world continue emitting with zero constraints.

BIPARTISAN BREAKTHROUGH ON OVERCRIMINALIZATION

Critics have also argued that scrapping CAFE will increase gas prices because of increased demand for fuel. But flooding the market with more U.S. oil supply could actually exert downward pressure on global crude prices. And Trump's parallel push to unleash millions of extra barrels per day is sure to counteract whatever minor rise might occur as a result of increased demand.

Trump's rollback of federal fuel economy rules is a major win for people whose prosperity relies on a thriving auto industry and access to affordable cars.

President Donald Trump on Monday said the United States will allow tech giant Nvidia to ship its H200 artificial intelligence chips to ""approved customers"" in China and elsewhere, under a set of conditions.

Chinese President Xi Jinping ""responded positively"" to the proposal, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

Trump's post appeared to state that 25% of the chips sales will be paid to the U.S. government as part of the deal, which the president said allows ""for continued strong National Security."" 

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for clarification.

Alina Habba, who had previously served as President Donald Trump's defense lawyer, said Monday that she was stepping down as U.S. attorney for New Jersey after judges disqualified her from that position.

Habba's resignation came a week after the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a district court judge's ruling that found her ineligible for the top prosecutor's job because of the circumstances of her appointment as the interim holder of that post.

Habba and Attorney General Pam Bondi said Habba would remain at the Department of Justice as senior advisor to the attorney general for U.S. attorneys.

Bondi also said the DOJ would appeal the 3rd Circuit's ruling and that the department is confident it would be reversed.

""As a result of the Third Circuit's ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down in my role as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey,"" Habba said in a statement on X.

""But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me,"" Habba said.

""Make no mistake, you can take the girl out of New Jersey, but you cannot take the New Jersey out of the girl.""

Bondi said on X, ""I am saddened to accept Alina's resignation.""

""The court's ruling has made it untenable for her to effectively run her office, with politicized judges pausing trials designed to bring violent criminals to justice,"" Bondi said. 

""These judges should not be able to countermand the President's choice of attorneys entrusted with carrying out the executive branch's core responsibility of prosecuting crime.""

Trump called the reasons for Habba's resignation ""a shame.""

""She's not disqualified,"" Trump said.

""You got a blue slip thing that's horrible,"" Trump said, referring to the practice of the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow effective vetoes of nominations  of U.S. attorneys unless the senators from the state housing that office agree on the person nominated.

""It's a shame ... Republicans should be ashamed of themselves"" for allowing it to go on, Trump said.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche appointed three people to supervise the criminal, civil and appellate, and administrative functions of the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office in light of Habba's departure.

Lindsey Halligan, another former lawyer for Trump, was recently disqualified by a judge from serving as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia because of the circumstances of her appointment.

Because of Halligan's disqualification, the grand jury indictments she obtained against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James were dismissed last month.

Bondi appointed Habba as interim U.S. attorney in March after her predecessor resigned.

Trump later nominated her to hold the post permanently, but her nomination was never considered by the Senate, as is required. 

The DOJ engaged in a byzantine series of maneuvers that it argued enabled Habba to automatically become the acting U.S. attorney, but a federal judge and then the 3rd Circuit rejected that effort, saying they failed to comply with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

Advanced Nvidia AI chips can head back to China after all.

The Department of Commerce will allow Nvidia to ship H200 chips to China, as originally reported by Semafor, to approved customers in the country. The U.S. will take a 25% cut of these sales, CNBC reported. 

H200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported.

“We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch. 

The news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China was in President Donald Trump's hands.

The decision to send these chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security.

Pete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would block the export of advanced AI chips to China for more than two years.

The Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It's unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips.

While Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports.

The Trump administration hit chip companies like Nvidia with licensing requirements to send their chips to China in April before it formally rescinded a Biden administration diffusion rule that would have regulated AI chip exports in May. Over the summer, the U.S. government signaled that companies would be able to start sending chips to China as long as the government got a 15% cut of all revenue, as chips became a bargaining tool in trade talks with China.

However, by that point, the market for U.S.-developed chips in China was strained.

In September, China's internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, banned domestic companies from buying Nvidia's chips, leaving companies in the country to rely on less advanced domestic chips from Alibaba and Huawei.

On Monday, Trump said that Chinese president Xi Jinping “responded positively” to the latest H200 news in a Truth Social post. 

This story was updated on December 8 when the proposed decision was confirmed.

If your Spidey senses tingled when Sam Altman got super defensive when one of his own supporters and investors gently asked where the company is getting the money to pay for its trillion-dollar commitments, then your whole body is probably vibrating right now. With Google Gemini eating into the company's market share and interest in ChatGPT slowing, OpenAI is in full-blown panic mode and appears prepared to throw everything possible at the wall to see what sticks.

Last week, Altman reportedly declared a “code red” to employees as he was growing concerned that the company was losing the sizable head start it had built up by being first to market with an LLM chatbot. Those concerns were likely not quelled by Sensor Tower data, reported by Digital Trends, that shows ChatGPT has lost about 3% of its market share in recent months, and its steady growth has started to significantly slow down. Meanwhile, Google Gemini has seen a major uptick in usage since August. Notably, daily usage of Gemini has also been climbing while ChatGPT reportedly dropped. The bad buzz for Sam Altman has only gotten worse since Gemini 3 launched last month and has since been widely praised as superior to GPT-5.

So what's OpenAI doing about this? Well, it started by putting out some fires. Over the weekend, the company put the kibosh on promotional messages in ChatGPT that users thought were a little too much like advertisements. The messages offered suggestions for apps or services that a user might be interested in, often unrelated to the conversation the user was having with ChatGPT. Users revolted against the supposed test feature, and the company ultimately backed down, killing the recommendations (for now).

Next step: reestablish the status quo. Some data shows that people are slowly drifting away from ChatGPT, so OpenAI dropped its own research that shows that people love using its chatbot, actually. In a survey conducted by OpenAI of about 9,000 workers across 100 companies, it found that people report saving about 40-60 minutes per day on their work by using AI tools. That data was released as part of a larger report on enterprise AI, which highlighted how weekly messages to ChatGPT Enterprise increased by about eight times over the course of the past year. So nothing to worry about here!

What's next? Well, it's time for OpenAI to change the narrative. The company is ready to release a new model, GPT-5.2, sometime this week, according to The Verge. That model has supposedly outperformed Gemini 3 in OpenAI's internal tests, per The Information. Altman is also going to make an appearance on “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon on Monday, where he will probably get his hair tussled and play charades while talking up the next version of ChatGPT.

It's rare to see any single moment as make-or-break for a company, but there is a very real threat to OpenAI that if it can't right the ship and reestablish ChatGPT as the genericization of the AI space, the scrutiny from investors who no longer feel like the company is a sure bet will start asking questions that OpenAI doesn't have the answers for.

Donald Trump said on Truth Social this morning that he plans to sign an executive order that will preempt any and all state regulations on AI, which was apparently news to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who just last week announced a proposal to establish an AI Bill of Rights for Floridians and introduce protections for communities where AI data centers are being built.

DeSantis's Bill of Rights would establish several protections that mirror what other states like California have done, including requiring companies to notify a consumer when they are interacting with a chatbot, prohibiting companies from using a person's likeness without consent, and restricting companies from sharing user information with third parties. The bill also hits on some more conservative-aligned concerns, as well, like banning any local government from using “Chinese-created AI tools” like DeepSeek.

Two specific industries also get a call-out in DeSantis' proposal: mental health services and insurance providers. The bill of rights would prohibit any licensed therapist or mental health counselor from using AI and bar AI imitations of a licensed professional. It would also limit the ability of insurance companies to use AI for claims, preventing them from relying on AI as the sole determiner in adjusting or denying a claim.

In a separate proposal, the Florida governor also introduced potential protections for Floridians who may have a data center as a neighbor. Most notably, the proposal would prohibit utilities from charging residents more on their energy bills to support hyperscale data centers. It'd also restrict taxpayer subsidies flowing to Big Tech firms setting up shop in the Swamp State, give local governments more ability to block unwanted projects, and prevent the construction of data centers on agricultural lands or nature reserves. It also slips in an apparent ban on the construction or operation of data centers by “foreign principals.”

All of that sounds, frankly, pretty solid! It was good enough to piss off the people at the prominent conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute, which accused DeSantis of “drifting toward the regulatory reflexes” of blue states, and at the center-right R Street Institute, which accused Florida's governor of “opening the door to let Gavin Newsom and Zohran Mamdani run America's AI marketplace and decimate our nation's ability to counter Chinese advances in the rising AI Cold War.”

DeSantis will also find President Trump on the opposite side of this fight. Trump said he will be introducing “One Rulebook” for AI, which could be read as finally passing a federal framework or (more likely) could mean he will finally give the AI industry what it has been asking for and attempt to prohibit states from passing AI regulations. There are some similarities in this case to Trump's handling of healthcare, which involves constantly threatening to repeal the Affordable Care Act because of its shortcomings, while having nothing waiting in the wings to replace it. Technically, banning states from having their own rules does create a single rulebook, but it just has no rules in it.

The AI battle has caused some rifts within the MAGA movement, most notably being one of the areas of disagreement that eventually pushed Marjorie Taylor Greene out. And while it's hard to imagine a fight over state-level regulations would be enough to split the party, there's certainly a start of a tear in the fabric. DeSantis seems like he might be ready to keep pulling where it's threadbare.

 December 08, 2025  

TORONTO — GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) such as semaglutide are well known for helping lower blood sugar and supporting weight loss, as well as reducing the risk for heart and kidney complications. Another benefit that is gaining interest is the effect these medications have on inflammation, and the potential role for this effect in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and other conditions.

“I'm quite convinced…that treatment of inflammation is going to become part of our treatment [of T2D],” said Marc Y. Donath, MD, medical director of the Centre d'Excellence Intégré en Santé Métabolique at the University Hospital Montreal, Montreal, in his presentation at Diabetes Canada and Canadian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism (CSEM) Professional Conference 2025.

Inflammation-related benefits of GLP-1 RAs were seen in a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers found that in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, semaglutide resolved steatohepatitis in 62.9% of patients without worsening liver fibrosis, while also promoting weight loss and improving metabolic health.

The results of the study might be explained by the decrease in body weight associated with the GLP-1 RAs. But Donath said that weight loss only accounts for “around half” of the benefit. He suggested that anti-inflammatory effects may also play a role.

“If you have increased glucose and increased fatty acids, these induce chronic inflammation in the body,” he said. But “if you have another driver of inflammation — like uric acid, which is a strong activator of the IL-1 [interleukin 1] system — then you have two reasons to be inflamed.”

So “it's not by chance” that patients with obesity and T2D are more prone to rheumatoid arthritis, he said. “They end up with a double inflammatory drive, [and] if you block the inflammation then you improve the diabetes and you improve the arthritis.”

In a 2019 PLoS Medicine study, researchers found that blocking inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and T2D improved both conditions. “This is quite elegant,” said Donath, “and it is one direction where these anti-inflammatory treatments are going.”

In terms of T2D, Donath said that an elevation of glucose and other changes “induce an inflammation that is sensed by the inflammasome NLRP3, which seems to be a kind of sensor in the body of metabolic stress.” The IL-1 system, which contributes to the complications of diabetes and associated diseases, becomes activated.

An inflammasome is a large, multiprotein complex within the cell that senses danger signals like infection or cellular damage. In terms of potential treatments, “it's quite attractive to tackle this inflammasome,” said Donath. “This is where the field is now going. There are at least seven or eight companies [studying] inhibitors of this inflammasome.”

He pointed to a 2021 phase 1 study, published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology, that examined the use of dapansutrile, an oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, in patients with systolic heart failure. The drug was well tolerated, with no adverse effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or renal function.

“We had a chance to look at this phase 1 study, which was done for the indication of heart failure, and within these patients, there was quite a strong improvement in glycemia,” Donath said, suggesting a potential improvement in T2D, as well. He and his colleagues are recruiting participants for a phase 2 clinical trial in Switzerland investigating the use of dapansutrile for the treatment of T2D and complications such as the risk for cardiovascular disease.

“If it is proven that the GLP-1 RAs have a direct effect on inflammation, it would be one of the most significant findings in modern medicine,” Peminda K. Cabandugama, MD, DABOM, an internal medicine and obesity medicine specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, and spokesperson for The Obesity Society, told Medscape News Canada.

“It will also further strengthen what obesity medicine practitioners have been talking about for years — that there are direct correlations between the chronic disease that is obesity and other chronic diseases due to increased inflammation, such as heart disease and kidney disease.

“Ultimately,” he said, “the hope is that we will find that the weight-management properties of the GLP-1 RAs…will be the tip of the iceberg.”

Donath reported receiving funding from Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Olatec. Cabandugama reported having no relevant financial relationships.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Watch the highlights from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as Lando Norris became the world champion, finishing third behind race winner Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri.

While Max Verstappen masterfully drove to victory in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, it wasn't enough to prevent Lando Norris from becoming the 2025 World Champion as he secured third place behind Oscar Piastri.

The Red Bull driver maintained the lead from pole position on the opening lap while Piastri executed a superb overtake on his McLaren team mate to improve to P2, kicking off a 41-lap stint on hard tyres for the Australian.

Norris' alternative strategy of choice saw him come out into a DRS train after his first pit stop, but he was able to clear those ahead in quick succession, including an impressive double pass on Lance Stroll and Liam Lawson.

He gradually made his way back into the top three, which was all that was needed for him to win the championship by just two points over Verstappen, who beat Piastri to the chequered flag by 12 seconds.

Further back, Charles Leclerc placed early pressure on Norris but ultimately settled for fourth, with Mercedes' George Russell finishing fifth, over 22 seconds behind the Ferrari driver. Fernando Alonso was sixth, heading a mighty performance from Esteban Ocon while Lewis Hamilton slotted into eighth and Nico Hulkenberg was ninth. Lance Stroll rounded out the top 10 in the season finale.
