                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Advanced Nvidia AI chips can head back to China after all. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch. The news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China was in President Donald Trump's hands. The Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. While Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports. The Trump administration hit chip companies like Nvidia with licensing requirements to send their chips to China in April before it formally rescinded a Biden administration diffusion rule that would have regulated AI chip exports in May. Over the summer, the U.S. government signaled that companies would be able to start sending chips to China as long as the government got a 15% cut of all revenue, as chips became a bargaining tool in trade talks with China. However, by that point, the market for U.S.-developed chips in China was strained. In September, China's internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, banned domestic companies from buying Nvidia's chips, leaving companies in the country to rely on less advanced domestic chips from Alibaba and Huawei. On Monday, Trump said that Chinese president Xi Jinping “responded positively” to the latest H200 news in a Truth Social post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former chief engineer of Lucid Motors, Eric Bach, has sued the company for wrongful termination, discrimination, and retaliation, and claims one of the automaker's top HR executives referred to him as a “German Nazi.” Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors' press release from that day only said he had “departed.” The lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors. It is developing more affordable mass-market vehicles on a midsized platform slated to debut sometime in late 2026. An engineer who spent a decade with the company, Bach says he oversaw “all hardware engineering,” “product management and corporate planning.” Bach states that Lucid's chairman Turqi Alnowaiser “praised Bach's loyalty and dedication to the Company and expressed a desire to continue working with Bach.” He also claims board member Andrew Liveris “signaled that Bach would become Chief Technology Officer (the position ‘is yours to lose') and that Bach could one day become Chief Executive Officer,” according to the complaint. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In September, OpenAI launched a way for users to generate a digital likeness of themselves they could use to create personalized deepfake videos. This is one of the core features in Sora, OpenAI's app for sharing AI videos inside a TikTok-style feed. The self-deepfaking feature was called “cameo,” and with that standout feature, Sora quickly rose to the top of Apple's iOS download charts. This feature name led to a trademark lawsuit with Cameo, the app where fans can pay celebrities to record personalized videos. Creative originality is not achievable by generative AI, which is built on finding patterns in large datasets, and OpenAI seems to be matching this derivative vibe with its naming schemas. The next hearing, which may decide whether this ban sticks, is scheduled for December 19. They knew we had trademarks on it,” he said in a call with WIRED shortly after the judge issued the temporary restraining order. “When people think about the word, now it means something different than authentic personalized connections,” said Galanis. “It means AI slop.” Galanis claimed OpenAI's feature name was already hurting Cameo's visibility in Google search results. “We disagree with the complaint's assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word ‘cameo,' and we look forward to continuing to make our case to the court,” said an OpenAI spokesperson in an emailed statement. Generative AI tools are incredible mimicking machines, outputting answers that match what the statistically probable answer is likely to be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If medical professionals hold a legal monopoly on providing diagnostic care, then decide it's better to just not diagnose things, it leaves patients with no way to discover life-altering information about their own health. We already have an extreme shortage of available healthcare workers. We don't need to stress them further because 20% of the population suddenly decides they need 80 elective surgeries to remove things that would've gone away or stayed benign on their own. I then talked to several doctors I know (family practice and two internal medicine).It was embarrassing how little they knew. And even more shocking actually, is how wrong they were about things.Two of them told me the risk of infection from a prostate biopsy was basically zero. And that's with them giving you antibiotics beforehand....Basically they got everything I asked about wrong compared to specialists you can read online.Ps, my dad got an MRI with two 1cm growths.He changed his diet and added fasts, and did nothing else. His doctor basically writing him off in anger.5 years later, PSA lower than before the incident. Paid for a scan last year, zero growth.Internet/YouTube experts/doctors really do beat most general doctors. The odds of you having someone in the top 10% of their field, let alone top 1-2% in your local town is pretty low.

You are just assuming that all cancer must be treated if detected, even if it is medically unnecessary, therefore we must not detect medically insignificant cancer which would be net harmful to treat. You can detect things and determine no action should be taken. I can understand if that might be the modern standard of care, but if so then that is the problem; not early detection of cancer, which could be medically insignificant, but which may also allow the early detection of medically significant cancer. There are probably a dozen things wrong with your body right now. That doesn't mean they're even affecting you. While you may have some type of cancer that is at the absolute first day of detectability, or a bone slightly out of place, or a weird spot on your heart, someone else has a case that is 6 months deeper and needs more dire treatment.There is zero benefit to society to massively overburden our healthcare system (this is true of any nation) by searching constantly for random problems that may or may not exist.If there were good reason to do this, you'd have regularly-scheduled checkups, like with colon or breast cancer.

Maybe if we were all pretty rational people, we could better manage positive screening results and follow up actions that lead towards taking no specific action; but that's not where people are at the moment.There's a tradeoff of early detection of fast growing tumors that are likely to cause issues vs detection of slow growing tumors that are likely to not cause issues except if they're detected.

But I think your characterization of how common non-dangerous tumors are is off. I agree that oncologists are ultimately who should be making the call on what needs to be treated and how. But I think your characterization of how common non-dangerous tumors are is off. No one is suggesting adding extra stress to healthcare workers. It's also not you or your doctors call to make: let's gatekeep this patients cancer because our hospital can't deal with the workload. What a truly wicked idea.To help alleviate the extreme shortage of available healthcare workers we should instead allow those wanting to pay for these elective surgeries, to pay for them! Yes, this is true even if the person opting for the elective surgery has millions, potentially even billions of dollars to pay with. Having money doesn't make your illness more important.Don't get all holier-than-thou on topics like this; it's already a difficult-enough topic. Don't get all holier-than-thou on topics like this; it's already a difficult-enough topic. But, as the article notes, we don't know if any particular cancer will kill an individual.It's a conundrum. I'm not even going to comment on this: "You're not a doctor, you're not qualified to tell the difference", because this is such a weird statement that I don't understand how anybody could utter it on this website.If that is your standard for critical thinking, you are paving the way for anti-science rhetoric to dominate public discourse.Treat people like stupid idiots if you want but then don't be surprised by the way they vote in elections as a result.

Cancer never SHOULD be present, it just happens to be there often, like any other thing your body clears out.Edit: the word “diabetes” originally comes from a word meaning “to pass through”.

What did the medical field do to earn such credibility with you? We identify these experts with a reputation system so you might call them authorities.Similarly, there truly are institutions that have decades or more of people, procedures and culture to benefit society and a track record of these benefits.The malicious erosion, by propaganda and by rhetoric, of the public's trust in our authorities and institutions is one of the biggest crimes of this century. It's actually miraculous what they've developed to treat cancer. Cancer treatment has gotten so good that it's common for oncologists to caution against the 5 year study survival rates due to new and better treatments rapidly coming online. Having broad skepticism is an irrational position as there's a huge difference between the oncology field and the nutrition field. Having broad skepticism is an irrational position as there's a huge difference between the oncology field and the nutrition field. Medical science has done a lot to earn credibility over the last couple hundred years. It reduced rates of infant mortality by staggering numbers. It created vaccines and surgeries that have each saved countless lives and effectively cured life-altering disabilities and injuries, and demoted tons of diseases from death sentences to mere manageable disabilities or even mild temporary inconveniencesMedical practitioners are a mixed bag that ranges from total altruists to total mercenaries. Most people can learn a skill and incentivizing any skill via things like money or social status creates some goal-misalignment, but also dramatically increases the prevalence of the skill and also the community surrounding it, including research, pedagogy, and infrastructure. I think there's considerable value in not automatically trusting every medical practitioner, but on the whole many of them have earned credibilityMedical institutions have mostly been responsible for the existence of trustable practitioners and research, though in the rich world and especially the US specifically there are significant misalignments that come from capture from power-hungry parties in both government and the private sector. The American medical establishment in particular seems at this point near unsalvageable, having broken so badly that it often deliberately tanks quality of care to enforce state power or to turn a profit. We should probably rethink a lot of how institutions fund research, administer hospitals, prioritize care, act as financial buffers, what legal and enforcement authority we vest in medical practitioners sanctioned by the institutions, etc. So I agree with you there, especially in the United States specifically, though much of this was apparent well before 2025 (practically before I was born) Most people can learn a skill and incentivizing any skill via things like money or social status creates some goal-misalignment, but also dramatically increases the prevalence of the skill and also the community surrounding it, including research, pedagogy, and infrastructure.

Keep in mind most cancer treatments are pretty harsh. They are better than cancer, but if you don't have clinically significant cancer then the treatments can be very not worth it. You have no authority to treat your patient like a child. My spouse found out they had a benign brain tumor, an accidental discovery while doing a brain scan for some other reason.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump said on Truth Social this morning that he plans to sign an executive order that will preempt any and all state regulations on AI, which was apparently news to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who just last week announced a proposal to establish an AI Bill of Rights for Floridians and introduce protections for communities where AI data centers are being built. DeSantis's Bill of Rights would establish several protections that mirror what other states like California have done, including requiring companies to notify a consumer when they are interacting with a chatbot, prohibiting companies from using a person's likeness without consent, and restricting companies from sharing user information with third parties. The bill also hits on some more conservative-aligned concerns, as well, like banning any local government from using “Chinese-created AI tools” like DeepSeek. Two specific industries also get a call-out in DeSantis' proposal: mental health services and insurance providers. The bill of rights would prohibit any licensed therapist or mental health counselor from using AI and bar AI imitations of a licensed professional. It would also limit the ability of insurance companies to use AI for claims, preventing them from relying on AI as the sole determiner in adjusting or denying a claim. Most notably, the proposal would prohibit utilities from charging residents more on their energy bills to support hyperscale data centers. It'd also restrict taxpayer subsidies flowing to Big Tech firms setting up shop in the Swamp State, give local governments more ability to block unwanted projects, and prevent the construction of data centers on agricultural lands or nature reserves. It also slips in an apparent ban on the construction or operation of data centers by “foreign principals.” DeSantis will also find President Trump on the opposite side of this fight. Trump said he will be introducing “One Rulebook” for AI, which could be read as finally passing a federal framework or (more likely) could mean he will finally give the AI industry what it has been asking for and attempt to prohibit states from passing AI regulations. DeSantis seems like he might be ready to keep pulling where it's threadbare. ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron claims that the removal is a suppression of free speech Musk says he's going to make 1 million robots per year by 2030. How do you keep an antitrust-curious president from sinking your M&E deal? Put "AI" in your name and watch the stock price climb.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of physicians specializing in genetics and neurology discovered that mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are closely linked to mutations in the GRIN2A gene. When functioning optimally, it promotes the transmission of electrical signals between nerve cells and facilitates essential processes such as learning, memory, language, and brain development. These results show that carriers of the mutation have a significantly higher risk than those without variations. Furthermore, the patients exhibited strictly psychiatric symptoms, which largely rules out environmental or contextual explanations. Until now, clinicians have considered that these diseases arise from the interaction of multiple factors, including genetic ones. As this trial was conducted prior to the main study, the authors clarify that it cannot yet be considered a definitive therapeutic method. However, they point out that the efficacy of L-serine can be confirmed in a randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that manifests itself with delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and language, behavioral changes, and loss of motivation or pleasure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this disorder affects some 23 million people worldwide, equivalent to 0.29 percent of the global population. Even so, science has not identified a single cause or fully explained the variability among those at risk. Some people develop the illness and others do not, even if both parents have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. There is also no clear strategy for preventing its onset.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A Slovenian security researcher has published an analysis of Sipeed's NanoKVM that raises far-reaching concerns about the €30-€60 ($35-70) remote management device. Alarmingly, the researcher's teardown shows the device ships with a catalogue of security failures and an undocumented microphone that can be activated over SSH. The compact RISC-V board, which arrived on the market last year as a budget alternative to PiKVM, offers HDMI capture, USB HID emulation, remote power control, and browser-based access to a connected PC. Early units arrived with a pre-set password and open SSH access, a problem the researcher reported to Sipeed and which the company later corrected. The web interface still lacks basic protections, including CSRF defence and any mechanism to invalidate active sessions. The NanoKVM's network behavior raises further questions, as it routes DNS queries through Chinese servers by default and makes routine connections to Sipeed infrastructure to fetch updates and a closed-source binary component. The key verifying that component is stored in plain text on the device, and there is no integrity check for downloaded firmware. The underlying Linux build is also a heavily pared-down image without common management tools, yet it includes tcpdump and aircrack, utilities normally associated with packet inspection and wireless testing rather than production hardware intended to sit on privileged networks. With default SSH credentials still present on many deployed units, the researcher demonstrated that audio could be recorded and exfiltrated with minimal effort, and streaming that audio in real time would require only modest additional scripting. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Thankfully, because NanoKVM is nominally open source, community members have begun porting alternative Linux distributions, first on Debian and later Ubuntu. Reflashing requires opening the case and writing a new image to the internal microSD card, but early builds already support Sipeed's modified KVM code.

Welcome, my name's Splave, or Allen Golibersuch, and I am a professional overclocker. You may have read some of my previous articles on Tom's Hardware, or spotted me in a YouTube video or two. In this column, I will delve into extreme overclocking and muse about what it's like to run your own bespoke system integrator business. But first of all, if you're not acquainted with who I am or what I do, here's an introduction. I would jet across the world to events like Computex and other live events, winning or placing across overclocking competitions. After some experimentation with launching my own bespoke PC, I knew that I didn't ever want to just sell normal PCs. I wanted to make performance computers that are better than what's out there for a similar price, where my overclocking talents could be used as an added benefit, not merely a pricing burden. That's when a company I had a long-time relationship with approached me, and asked if they could take a percentage share of ownership and invest in launching my own brand of PCs. It all initially started as a very boutique operation, but eventually rolled over into a full-on system integrator, which is where I am today. For the inaugural edition of Splave's Cave, I pick apart a very special graphics card, the Asus ROG Astral RTX 5090. Yes, the 5090 came out months ago, and yes, there is a gold version, which I sadly do not own. Here's how I set a 3DMark Port Royal World Record. Don't catch your fingers on that silicon, because it's about to get cold. Luckily, Asus has crafted an incredibly performant graphics card, with excellent R&D and overclocking departments that work hard on providing workarounds for the protections that any GPU might have. Yeah, those protections, the ones that make sure that the cards don't go boom or catch fire. We're finally in a place where those protections have extended far enough that we can pull out some wild performance from these GPUs at sub-ambient temperatures. But, there is one thing: You can't try this specific technique at home. I am using a special, non-public BIOS for the GPU that offers a much higher power limit than the standard one would allow. Equipped with the bespoke BIOS, another challenge awaits. If you let your card get super hot, it's going to still lower its clock speed in an attempt to avoid outright failure. So, this bespoke BIOS with its extended power limits is practically useless without sub-ambient cooling. For the standard OC BIOS, there's plenty of headroom, which the ROG Astral RTX 5090's cooler is equipped to handle; many cards can run +2000 MHz memory speeds without additional cooling, which is a feat of engineering in itself. I've been doing this for a long time, and Asus' latest effort is head-and-shoulders above the next-best card I have touched. I'm not trying to wax lyrical about Asus because I am "glazing," as the kids like to say; they've really earned it, and I have nothing negative to say about it at all. When using liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling, the ROG Astral RTX 5090 starts misbehaving at around -10°C to -20°C. By misbehaving, I mean that the screen goes black, the system hangs, and you have to wait until the card is above 0°C before you can boot it back into Windows — otherwise known as a 'cold bug.' This is one of those situations where I just have to take a step back, take a deep breath, turn around toward my punching bag, and away from the expensive electronics, to let off some steam for a few minutes. But, not liking the cold isn't an issue specific to Asus' ROG Astral 5090; it's an Nvidia issue. The RTX 5090 die itself doesn't like being cold, with users of other brands reporting similar experiences. He always had a way to finesse Nvidia into fixing cold bug issues, which isn't something a basement hobbyist can achieve. But, with that being said, the ROG Astral RTX 5090 can still pull off some pretty impressive feats, without reaching extremely cold temperatures; this card could hit core clock speeds of 3600MHz+. Now, just imagine if the RTX 5090 could come close to running at those temperatures, it would simply be absurd. Hopefully, any amount of additional cold temperature tolerance will yield even greater results. Meanwhile, with the card safely idling at -20°C, the ROG Astral RTX 5090 demands over 1,000 watts of power when you start a benchmark. This spikes the temperature from -20°C to +10°C instantly, and that's with a five-pound copper pot filled with LN2 attached to it. This can be tricky to maintain throughout the benchmarking process. Needless to say, that punching bag I mentioned earlier is getting a lot of use. These were achieved a little while ago, so it's likely that you'll spot me elsewhere on the leaderboards, too. That about wraps it up for the first edition of Splave's Cave on Tom's Hardware Premium. Coming up next will be a guide on how to actually set yourself up for extreme overclocking, with a similar setup to the images posted in the article. Keep your eyes peeled, and thanks for reading. A world-champion competitive overclocker who frequently tops the charts at HWBot, a site which tracks speed records, Allen will do just about anything to push a CPU to its limits. He shares his insights into the latest processors with Tom's Hardware readers from a hardcore, push-it-to-the-limit overclocker's perspective.

Wahi recently joined Arnold & Porter to launch its Seattle office and lead strategic growth on the West Coast, following a long tenure at K&L Gates, where she was a managing partner. “Arnold and Porter has a very deep regulatory bench, and that is really what makes them so much of a differentiator in the market,” Wahi said. The firm's specialties span healthcare, technology, manufacturing, cross-border trade, FDA and antitrust work — areas where she said corporate clients increasingly need strategic and practical guidance as rules evolve. But she also draws a clear boundary for the legal profession: while AI can help lawyers, it can't replace them. “We have to be careful that it doesn't substitute for actual legal work,” Wahi said. “You should not be filing briefs or doing anything which is generated by AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia recently shattered records by reaching a staggering $5 trillion valuation. It is a number that defies gravity, logic, and, historically speaking, sustainability. But if you look closely at the pillars holding up this massive financial edifice, you'll see they aren't made of superior silicon or magical AI dust. They are built on a foundation of software lock-in known as CUDA. We are standing on the precipice of a massive correction in the AI market, one that will likely see Nvidia's valuation stripped down to reality. The catalyst isn't a better chip from AMD or Intel; it is a piece of code that makes the hardware irrelevant. Let's talk about how Spectral could bring down Nvidia's house of cards. Then, I'll close with my Product of the Week: HP's OmniBook 5 Laptop 16″ AI PC. If this were purely a hardware race, AMD and Intel would have eroded the margins years ago. Nvidia reached this height by creating a walled garden so high and so thick that developers felt they had no choice but to stay inside. Nvidia gave it away to universities, hooked researchers early, and ensured that the entire AI software stack — from PyTorch to TensorFlow — ran natively and best on Nvidia green. Investors looked at this moat and saw infinite returns. However, monopolies built on coercion rather than preference are notoriously fragile. Microsoft, arguably Nvidia's most important customer, has effectively sounded the alarm. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been increasingly vocal about the logistical nightmares associated with Nvidia's latest hardware. The Blackwell architecture, touted as the next leap forward, has been plagued by overheating issues and massive power requirements that existing data center infrastructure simply cannot support. A company drunk on its own lock-in power, however, tends to double down. Microsoft has reportedly cut orders for Blackwell racks, signaling that the pain of staying with Nvidia is finally starting to outweigh the fear of leaving. What it has is a technology called Scale, a “C to silicon” compiler that allows CUDA applications to run natively on AMD hardware — and eventually on other hardware — without porting, without performance loss, and without the headaches that have plagued previous conversion attempts. For the first time, a company can run a massive library of legacy CUDA code on AMD's MI300 or upcoming MI400 chips by simply recompiling. If CUDA code can run on any hardware, Nvidia's “moat” evaporates. The hardware becomes a commodity again, and commodities do not trade at 40x revenue. There is a quiet army of major and minor players working on breaking CUDA's grip. AMD has its HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) and HIPIFY tools. There are open-source projects, like the recently resurrected Zluda, attempting similar feats. CIOs, currently sweating over Nvidia's extortionate pricing and delivery delays, will look at AMD's comparable performance at half the price and realize they finally have a choice. IBM's leadership genuinely believed that the customer's opinion didn't matter. We weren't just selling mainframes; we were, as one executive famously put it, “selling air.” The implication was that our customers needed us to breathe. Customers didn't just leave; they fled with a vengeance, angry at years of being taken for granted. If Spectral's technology gains traction — and I believe it is a matter of when, not if — Nvidia's stock won't just dip; it will crater. A valuation of $5 trillion implies total domination for decades. The AI bubble, inflated largely by Nvidia's multiplier effect, will burst. Companies that leveraged themselves to buy H100s and Blackwells will see their asset values plummet. But the most immediate human toll will be inside Nvidia itself. Right now, thousands of Nvidia employees are paper millionaires or billionaires. A massive correction turns those options from lottery tickets into confetti. When a workforce that expects to retire at 35 suddenly realizes they have to work for another 20 years, morale doesn't just drop; it disintegrates. The talent drain that follows will further accelerate the company's decline, creating a death spiral that is incredibly difficult to pull out of. The customer resentment required to drive adoption is at an all-time high. I expect Spectral's power to pivot this market will become widely known within the next two quarters. Once a major player — likely Microsoft or Meta — publicly announces they are shifting a significant portion of their production workload to AMD using Spectral's Scale, the illusion of Nvidia's invincibility will shatter. The market correction will be brutal, but it is necessary. It will return competition to the chip industry, lower AI development costs, and serve as a harsh history lesson that, in technology, no wall is high enough to keep the future out forever. Navigating the chaotic sea of Black Friday and Cyber Week deals can be exhausting. Often, the “doorbuster” specials are older models, refurbished units, or devices so underpowered they struggle to run a web browser and a spreadsheet simultaneously. This season's standout is the HP OmniBook 5 Laptop 16” AI PC. Historically, the laptop market has been segmented by size and price. If you wanted a 16” or 17” display — often preferred for the “desktop replacement” experience — you had to pay a premium for the extra glass and chassis materials. For entertainment, it provides a far more immersive streaming experience than smaller notebooks. Furthermore, for users with aging eyes, the larger screen allows for increased font scaling without losing too much context on the page. Getting this form factor at these price points is highly unusual. HP offered three distinct tiers of discounts during Black Friday and Cyber Week, when I wrote this column, making this machine accessible to almost anyone. It features the Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 255U processor, which includes 12 cores and 14 threads, capable of speeds up to 5.2 GHz. Where things get truly disruptive is with the customizable SKUs. That price point is usually reserved for Chromebooks or low-end Celeron-based Windows machines, not devices equipped with Core i5 processors. Beyond the specs, HP continues its push for sustainability. We are accustomed to paying a “screen tax” for larger laptops, but HP has effectively eliminated that barrier this season.
