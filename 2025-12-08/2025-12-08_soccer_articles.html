                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arne Slot has confirmed a key Liverpool player will miss his side's Champions League trip to Inter Milan due to injury. After Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Leeds United on Saturday, Salah said someone at the club wants him to "get all the blame", that he deserves to start for the Reds after what he has done for them over the years and his relationship with manager Slot has broken down. Hot on the heels of that, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher called Salah's comments "disgraceful" and accused him of trying to get Slot sacked. This came after the Reds had decided against taking Salah to the San Siro for Tuesday's Champions League encounter with Inter, and to make matters worse, the Premier League title holders will be without more attacking options for this tough fixture. On Monday night, Slot told reporters that winger Cody Gakpo will be out for several weeks after picking up an injury against Leeds, and fellow wideman Chiesa is also not going to play due to illness. If he has an amazing recovery, which doctors don't expect, he might travel tomorrow, but that's not what I expect. Cody picked up an injury against Leeds and he will be out for a few weeks." Between Gakpo and Chiesa, they have scored six goals in the Premier League this season, in addition to four assists. Incidentally, on the Inter test, goalkeeper Alisson added, "We have a big challenge tomorrow. There was a great deal of excitement when Chiesa swapped Juventus for Liverpool for around £10 million in the summer of 2024. This term, however, he has already played 15 times and provided five goal contributions. When asked about the winger's chances of making Italy's World Cup squad, he said: "It's not up to me to decide who should be selected for the national team. I'm very pleased to see that Federico is in a much better place this season than last season, when he struggled a lot with his fitness. A Chiesa-less Liverpool face a tough test in Italy against Inter on Tuesday night, before they return to Premier League action on Saturday at home to Brighton. The Reds, who are ninth in the table, will hope they can emerge victorious in both these encounters this week. On the Inter game, Slot said: "I see more similarities than differences. Probably he did a few things but the way they press higher up the pitch, I see more similarities between Simone Inzaghi and Christian Chivu."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Friday's ceremony in Washington DC was cringe-inducing and craven enough to make football fans nostalgic for the reign of Sepp Blatter Donald Trump's heroic victory over a field of one to claim the inaugural Fifa peace prize, on-stage banter so dead it was already fossilized, Gianni Infantino doing crowd work, and Wayne Gretzky struggling through the pronunciation of “Macedonia” and “Curaçao” in the draw's linguistic group of death: even with the benefit of a few days' distance it's impossible to overstate how impressively bad the draw for the 2026 World Cup, held last Friday at the Trump-purged Kennedy Center in Washington DC, was. And put on a show Fifa did – just not one that anyone wanted to watch, least of all a desperately bored-looking Trump, who sat through Andrea Bocelli's Nessun Dorma with the granitic joylessness that has become his default expression at each of the sporting events he's ruined with his presence this year. If this was a preview of next summer, the 23rd Mundial is on course for catastrophe. Danny Ramirez and Rio Ferdinand, in particular, seemed to generate some kind of purely negative chemistry that could make a useful contribution to science. “Which team – will be drawn – by Mr Mark Carney?” he devilishly asked, with all the charisma of a middle-aged magician doing card tricks for small change at a weekend farmer's market. It takes a rare talent to make football fans nostalgic for Sepp Blatter, but Fifa's presiding gollum is so insistently unpleasant, such a strange, damp little man, that he makes his famously venal predecessor look positively dapper and twinkle-eyed in comparison. The last World Cup draw held on US soil, in which Robin Williams monkeyed about on stage calling Blatter “Mr Bladder”, was a minor comic miracle. Instead of Robin Williams, this launch got Robbie Williams, a devastating drop in off-field quality that also showed how much football's ambitions in America have changed over the past 30 years. Well, unfortunately the World Cup draw had a lot to say about that too, in a series of “fun” segments debating what to call the sport in America (who cares?) that briefly threatened to kill anyone with an IQ over 50. Over on the set of host broadcaster Fox, new network talent Thierry Henry, holding on for dear life in the blast zone of Alexi Lalas's jingoism, looked almost immediately regretful about his decision to accept the assignment as American TV's token big tournament Euro. Giorgio Chiellini and others have taken on this task in previous years and made it to the end looking like they've lived through centuries. Predictably, all the emotional meat of Friday's ceremony was in the theatre of a Fifa president groveling before America's would-be king. Over the past few months, as Trump has overseen the destruction of the East Wing, begun work on his cherished ballroom, and set about transforming the White House into a Live Laugh Love-themed suburban wedding reception center, it's been reasonable to wonder where exactly they'll put Infantino's bedroom. Now we have the answer: Infantino does not need a room in the presidential home because he's taken up residence directly in Trump's pocket. (Presumably these will have to make way on the Oval Office mantelpiece next year for whatever Fifa gives Trump for winning the second annual Fifa peace prize.) On the one hand, Trumpian nativism is an inherently awkward fit for the World Cup, which even in the moral quicksands of Qatar still made a basic effort to advance its boilerplate clichés about openness to the world, inclusivity (“Today I feel, ah… gay”), and global friendship. On the other, next year's tournament won't be the first time that sport and authoritarian theatrics have come together on the global stage; we know from the 1936 Berlin Olympics that international sport and fascism mix easily, that they're a match made in high-camp heaven. Fifa's customary blather about equal rights and an end to racism has been swiftly forgotten amid the urgent task of getting on good terms with America's reigning fascist. – seems determined to remake itself as Maga's external affairs department. Perhaps we can all hope for a resurrection of the Fifa boss who declared, in Qatar, that Europeans should spend 3,000 years apologizing for the suffering they've inflicted on the world, but that seems like a message unlikely to endear him to the white supremacists and Great Replacement freaks who run America today. So enthusiastic is Infantino's tonguing of the Trumpian boot that it's fair to wonder how much worse things will be once the tournament proper begins, how much tighter Fifa's embrace of Trumpworld will grow. Will we see walk-on roles before the opening match for Stephen Miller, JD Vance, Kristi Noem, and other lackeys of the Nerd Reich? Might there be a special live stream of the Trump administration's latest extrajudicial killing to spice things up during the heat breaks in Côte d'Ivoire v Curaçao? These sound insane but we're already at the point where insanity can't be ruled out. Nothing about Infantino's management of the tricky relationship between his three co-hosts suggests a change in course from the cold-sweated sycophancy we've seen to date. But Fifa also wants to squeeze the World Cup for everything it's worth, and so far that's translated into a determination to inject this whole soccer thing with a good old-fashioned dose of American garbage. Fifa trialed US-inspired game “improvements” – NBA-style players' entrances and the like – during last summer's Club World Cup and wants more next summer: recent reports suggest that these will include half-time interviews for head coaches and players and a lavish, Super Bowl-style half-time show during the final. No fans want this – least of all in the US itself, which Fifa continues to misunderstand as a land of footballing neanderthals in need of sugary treats to maintain engagement through the mind-bendingly complicated exercise that is watching a 90-minute sporting contest. The tournament that is taking shape promises to be hostile and patronizing to fans, unaffordable, excessively long and morally repugnant all at once. If that's not worthy of some kind of award, then I guess I'll have to find another use for these special Gianni-engraved commemorative cufflinks I just had made for Fifa's numero uno. A World Cup that, off the field at least, everyone will hate: this is your prize, Mr Infantino!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinity Rodman's next move will impact the entire NWSL. “We want those top players here in the NWSL,” Berman said before last month's NWSL Championship, where Gotham FC defeated Rodman and the Washington Spirit, “and particularly we want Trinity in the NWSL.” As things stand now, the NWSL isn't fighting for Rodman. It's fighting against her, and shadowboxing with its own potential in the process. A league source, who wasn't authorized to freely discuss the sensitive topic, said that the structure of the deal would provide Washington with an unfair advantage in competition and that the proposed salary would make it unfeasible for the Spirit to field a team in 2028 and still be salary cap compliant. Rodman has interest from top European clubs and an offer in the same market she has called home since turning pro, thanks to D.C. Power of the Gainbridge Super League, a Division I U.S. professional women's league that started in 2024. Her agent, Mike Senkowski, confirmed on CBS Mornings on Friday that these potential avenues offered “greater value” than the deal she had agreed to with the Spirit before it was vetoed by Berman and the league. And as for Rodman, who has stayed silent since the Spirit's loss in the NWSL Championship as this contract negotiation has played out publicly, her agent said she is “disappointed” over the latest turn of events. “She wanted to go back and play in D.C. in front of the fans, continue to work with (Spirit owner) Michele Kang and be a part of the league,” Senkowski said. The NWSL, as it has so many times before, had a head start and let an advantage slip through its grasp. Rodman was eager to stay in the NWSL. Now, the league has opened up an opportunity for top European clubs. “With no sure, certain way to get her fair market value within the NWSL, naturally that forces you to look elsewhere,” Senkowski said Friday on CBS. The league — until now, at least — wasn't actually in competition with the mystique of Champions League or life in London. Many suspect Berman is simply serving as a shield for her owners, too nervous (or cheap) to set a precedent with Rodman that could blow up the salary cap or increase the level of investment across the board. “Washington Spirit drive viewership: Three of the top five most-watched NWSL matches on ABC and ESPN featured the Washington Spirit, led by U.S. Women's National Team star Trinity Rodman,” read the top line of ESPN's press release on 2025 viewership. (Rodman only played in two of these three games due to injury.) Washington's attendance has risen year over year since the move to Audi Field, but in 2025, eight other NWSL teams saw higher-than-average attendances when the Spirit were in town. Every NWSL owner, not just Michele Kang, stands to benefit from Rodman staying. As the NWSL Players' Association said, right now, that message is that if the league can mess with Rodman's free agency, they can mess with any current or future player's free agency, too. “Our goal is to ensure that the very best players in the world, including Trinity, continue to call this league home. We will do everything we can, utilizing every lever available within our rules to keep Trinity Rodman here,” a league spokesperson said Wednesday night. Last Thursday, league sources said the NWSL would approve a $1-million-per-year deal immediately if that was presented. NWSL operates as a single entity, a status which the league says allows it final say on every player contract, the league source said. The league has attempted to use the single-entity concept as a defense for its decisions over a single player's contract before, with Olivia Moultrie. Maybe all of these explanations, in the league's eyes, are evidence of how they're fighting for Rodman — and implying the rejected deal, as structured, is worth more than $4 million total across the four years. But it's another slippery slope if the NWSL takes full responsibility for how every team might use its cap space on a single player, no matter what the final number may be. There is no maximum salary set by the collective bargaining agreement. So maybe the NWSL wants to fight for Rodman, but Berman and the league front office only want a fight they're guaranteed to win: parity above all, no new salary cap rules, no new roster rules setting a precedent, protecting all its owners and its single entity status — and somehow keeping Rodman at the same time. But the NWSL can't have it all. Rather than living its purported value of innovation, or forcing owners to dig into their wallets moving forward for top players, the NWSL is daring Rodman to walk out the door on a free transfer — where the league gets nothing. She continues to write columns and features around women's soccer, as well as host Full Time and contribute to the free weekly women's soccer newsletter, but also works to deliver a big-picture, conceptual vision for women's sports coverage across The Athletic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adjustments are still being finalized with less than seven months until kickoff, and one of FIFA's most recent announcements directly targets concerns raised during the 2025 Club World Cup. Now, FIFA has taken steps to address the issue. FIFA announced Sunday that the 2026 World Cup will feature a three-minute pause in the middle of each half for a designated “hydration break.” While cooling breaks have been used in recent years, this marks the first time a specific timeline and duration will be formally established, giving players a structured window to recover and fans clearer expectations for when play will resume. With matches now effectively split into quarters (featuring a 15-minute halftime break and short stoppages around the 22nd and 67th minutes) the measure aims to protect player health and safety during a tournament held at the peak of summer. Coaches will also be allowed to communicate with players during these pauses, creating opportunities for tactical adjustments. To suit global audiences, several matches in the 2025 Club World Cup, especially those involving European teams, were scheduled for midday in the United States. Cristiano Ronaldo €7 Portugal banknote goes viral ahead of 2026 FIFA World Cup: Portuguese Bank forced to clarify position One of them was Chelsea's Enzo Fernández, who required medical attention for heat exhaustion during the match against Fluminense. Playing in this kind of temperature is very dangerous… Hopefully next year they change the schedule at least, so that it's more of a show, and football stays beautiful and exciting.” FIFA president Gianni Infantino later addressed the issue directly during a media briefing in New York: “Every criticism we receive is a source for us to study and analyze what can do better. With the World Cup spread across three countries, venue conditions will vary, and not all stadiums can guarantee relief from extreme heat. Now, FIFA has taken a major step by formally defining the timing, duration, and purpose of in-match cooling breaks for the first time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From epic NFL arenas to legendary soccer cathedrals, these are the top 5 stadiums hosting the world's biggest crowds at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. FIFA says it will include three-minute hydration breaks in each half of every game at next year's World Cup, not just those played in hot weather. The change may also be a hit with broadcasters, since it makes the game schedule more predictable. FIFA said it was first announced when the governing body's chief tournament officer for the 2026 World Cup, Manolo Zubiria, attended a meeting with broadcasters. He indicated that referees may have some flexibility if there's a stoppage shortly before the 22-minute mark for an injury. FIFA said the move is a “streamlined and simplified version” of an earlier practice of having breaks after 30 minutes over a certain temperature threshold, once set at 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit) on the wet bulb global temperature system. The change comes after heat and humidity affected players during some games at this year's Club World Cup in the U.S. At that tournament, FIFA reacted by lowering the threshold for cooling or water breaks and also placing more water and towels around the edge of the field. Heat has long been an issue at major soccer tournaments. Amid concerns ahead of the 2014 World Cup, a Brazilian court ordered FIFA to make its recommended breaks mandatory or face fines.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SeattleFWC26, the local organizing committee, emphasized that the Pride Match designation is independent and “not affiliated with or endorsed by FIFA,” according to its website. Newsweek reached out to the Seattle FWC26 committee for comment on Monday. The Group G fixture, set for June 26 at Lumen Field, was designated a “Pride Match” by Seattle's local organizing committee well before the tournament draw. Local organizers have partnered with artists across Washington state to create LGBTQ-themed public artwork that will be displayed throughout the city during the match. As the World Cup draw unfolded and match assignments were finalized, none of the host cities—including Seattle—knew in advance which countries they would be staging. Both governments criminalize same-sex relationships: in Iran, homosexuality can be punishable by death, while in Egypt, LGBTQ+ individuals are frequently targeted under public morality laws and prosecuted for “debauchery.” “The Pride Match has been scheduled to celebrate and elevate Pride events in Seattle and across the country, and it was planned well in advance,” a spokesperson for the Pride Match Advisory Committee (PMAC) said in a statement to Outsports. Several European teams, including England and Wales, dropped plans to wear the bands after FIFA warned that players could be penalized on the field. Hedda McLendon, Senior Vice President of Legacy at SeattleFWC26, to Outsports: “We're working with small businesses so the region's LGBTQ+-owned enterprises are ready to benefit from the tournament's unprecedented visitor surge.” Eric Wahl, member of the Seattle PMAC and brother of late journalist Grant Wahl, on social media: "The match-up of two countries where it is illegal to be gay is actually a 'good thing' for the Pride Match". It is too early to say whether players or officials from either side will participate in or acknowledge the Pride-focused aspects of the event.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let Marketing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Catherine Newman details the creation of the “Never Chase Reality” effort as soccer prepares for a stronger U.S. spotlight. U.S. Soccer launched a new campaign, “Never Chase Reality,” in support of the U.S. Men's National Team — and fans across the country — ahead of next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup. Billed as one of the largest public-facing efforts from the organization to date, “Never Chase Reality” will run across broadcast, digital, out-of-home and experiential channels, and was informed by a deep psychological profile of U.S. soccer fans. Newman joined U.S. Soccer in July 2024 with a remit to reset the organization's marketing function ahead of the Men's and Women's World Cup tournaments and the 2028 Summer Olympics — events where increased fandom around soccer has attracted major marketers including Unilever, Kellanova, AB InBev and more. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CATHERINE NEWMAN: Soccer is always about more than the game. There's a saying in the UK that “soccer is more than life,” and I think it translates well for everybody. But we also wanted to acknowledge the journey that soccer has been on in the U.S. for a number of years. From a fan sentiment point of view, they want to understand how the team is feeling, and to be part of the journey. Part of this has been science, and part of this has been creativity, which I think is where the best ads always live: they understand the job that they need to do, but they are data-informed. We travel to Europe with them at times to capture content, but when we're in camp with them, we are there, 24/7, so it enables us to make it in-house, because we have an insight that no agency could ever hope to have in that respect. Whilst we have an agency partner in M+C Saatchi… we felt very confident in the capability of the folks in-house. We were trusted with something so intimate — the thoughts, hopes and dreams of the players and the coaching staff — that it felt like we were very well equipped to make that in-house. We obviously have our owned and operated channels, and we will be doing paid as part of this [campaign]. But we also have 118 members organizations and a large fan database. They are our most precious media and distribution channels, because there are members, coaches, referees, volunteers and staff, and our most loyal fans, so we are actually putting the ad in the hands of those folks to actually push it out first. So you'll see the media continue in that respect. We are also working with a number of partners, as well, to make sure that we are building our own affiliate network for U.S. Soccer. We are looking at seeding out our content with a few selected media partners. They are now a distribution partner for us, and we work with them in a very different way for our content, and making sure that they have exclusives. Ahead of “Never Chase Reality,” we launched our Soccer Forward campaign called “Keeping Score of What Matters,” and it talks about soccer as a force for good. It's good for your mental health, particularly if you're physically involved, and it gives people an opportunity to come together. Part of the psychological driver of the work that we did, [we found] the number one reason that people love soccer above any other sport was it because it was a place that they felt they belonged. We don't check your status when you come in. If I learned nothing else at WWE, it's that every moment is an is an opportunity for a story. It may not always be the one that people want to hear. It may not always be the thing that people hoped for, but storytelling is incredibly powerful, and keeping people updated with what you're doing is just so important. We need the help of our members, partners, donors, fans and staff. WWE talked a lot about the WWE universe, because they recognize everybody had a role to play, and that could not be more true at U.S. Soccer as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA World Cup 2026 to have two mandatory hydration breaks lasting three minutes each FIFA described the new model as a “streamlined and simplified” version of earlier protocols. The governing body's decision comes after player welfare concerns resurfaced during last year's FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, where high heat and humidity had a clear impact on performances. The new rule is therefore framed as a proactive, player-first measure designed to reduce fatigue, heat stress and overall physical risk. FIFA acknowledged that the rule may also benefit broadcasters by making match timing more predictable. By formalising the breaks, scheduling becomes more consistent, reducing uncertainty for live coverage and commercial slots. With the FIFA World Cup 2026 set to be the largest in history, featuring 48 teams and increased travel between venues, FIFA's universal hydration-break policy represents an effort to standardise protections across all matches and climates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Next year's World Cup will take place across June and July in Canada, the United States and Mexico, forcing organisers to find solutions to the scorching temperatures expected at many of the stadiums. North America has faced growing problems with extreme weather in recent years, with wild fires, high temperatures and humidity frequently impacting sporting events. Players complained of feeling dizzy during matches, while managers were left with little option but to train minimally due to the searing heat in many of the same venues that will host World Cup matches. Changing kick-off times to avoid peak temperatures and using more covered stadiums has been suggested by some, but FIFA has now announced a different solution. Compulsory three-minute "hydration breaks” will take place midway through each half of every match at the World Cup next summer. It means that the two 45-minute halves fans have become used to will not be in effect, with the new breaks mandatory, even if temperatures are not soaring. This time, however, play will be halted 22 minutes into each half, no matter what the climatic conditions are. It effectively means that, at the 2026 World Cup, matches will be played in quarters, like in basketball or American football. Meanwhile, the three-minute hydration breaks are also unlikely to appease FIFPRO, the global players' union, which had called for shorter but more frequent cooling breaks for games played in high temperatures. Most games in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Miami, Kansas City and Monterrey will kick off in the evening, while most afternoon matches will take place at roofed stadiums with air conditioning, or in cities with cooler climates. But issues remain despite the mitigation and there is sure to be further criticism of FIFA's decision-making around the tournament. Campaigners have voiced concerns over FIFA's partnership with Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco, while others have noted that the expansion to 48 teams and the huge distances between venues will make it comfortably the most polluting World Cup ever. “One way or another, the 2026 World Cup will be a turning point as it becomes clear that ever hotter summers are killing football's traditional tournament model,” said Peter Crisp from Fossil Free Football. “Exhausted players will struggle through the heat, surrounded by Aramco's oil advertising, having flown thousands of miles between matches.” Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The upcoming World Cup will feature new elements to past iterations and that includes the introduction of two set hydration breaks per match. Announced on Sunday by FIFA, the two hydration breaks will be mandatory and last for three-minutes at the midway point in each half. The decision was discussed at the weekend where national team coaches and many broadcasters had congregated for the World Cup draw in Washington, DC on Friday. It received support from all parties, including FIFA's medical team, with the welfare of players the main focus. However, the breaks will also allow coaches to use the time to discuss tactics with players. However, FIFA have decided that even if the temperatures are cool at the World Cup there will still be a drinks break. 'There will be no weather or temperature condition in place, with the breaks being called by the referee in all games, to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches,' FIFA said in a released statement on Sunday night. Manolo Zubiria, FIFA's 2026 World Cup chief tournament officer, told stakeholders at a World Broadcaster Meeting that the breaks would 'be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves.' During the Club World Cup, Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Enrique complained about the heat after beating Atletico Madrid 4-0 in a midday kick-off in Los Angeles with temperatures reaching nearly 40 degrees Celsius under the sun and 60 per cent humidity. 'The match was clearly influenced by the temperature,' he said. 'The time slot is great for European audiences, but the teams are suffering. 'In terms of play, it's impossible to perform at a very high level for 90 minutes.' His sentiments matched that of Chelsea midfielder Enzo Maresca who complained of dizziness due to the heat throughout the tournament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Soccer has announced the launch of the Kang Women's Institute, a platform for research and standards development in women's soccer. The institute is backed by an investment from Michele Kang, founder and CEO of Kynisca, a global organization dedicated to women's sports, headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The Kang Institute will establish research-backed best practices for the training and wellbeing of women and girls at every level of soccer. Only 6% of published research in sports and exercise journals is focused exclusively on women, according to a recent analysis. In November 2024, Kang pledged a $30 million gift to US Soccer to scale competitive opportunities for youth players, expand talent identification, and support professional development for female players, coaches, and referees. In April 2025, Kang made an additional $25 million investment to integrate the Kynisca Innovation Hub into Soccer Forward‘s research initiatives. “For far too long, women and girls have trained under systems and standards built for men, and the Kang Women's Institute is an essential first step in changing that,” said US Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone. “By grounding our work in real research and evidence, we can finally give female players the support, care, and understanding they deserve.” The institute has begun work on several projects, including conducting the first comprehensive national study to assess the current and emerging needs of female players at every level, including injury prevention, mental health, workload management, menstrual health, and the transition from youth to elite competition. The institute is co-creating a framework with the National Women's Soccer League and United Soccer League that defines best practices in player health, safety, training, and development ahead of the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women's World Cups.
