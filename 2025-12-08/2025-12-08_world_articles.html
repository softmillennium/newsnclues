Republican congressional leaders unveiled a sprawling military policy bill late Sunday that would authorize $901 billion in US military spending for the coming fiscal year, just months after GOP lawmakers and President Donald Trump pushed through the largest-ever cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition assistance. The bill, a compromise between House and Senate versions of the annual legislation, would authorize $8 billion more in US military spending than Trump asked for in his 2026 budget request. If passed, the 2026 NDAA would pump billions of dollars more into the Pentagon, a cesspool of the kinds of waste, fraud, and abuse that Johnson and other Republicans claim to be targeting when they cut safety net programs, stripping health insurance and food aid from millions. The Pentagon has never passed an independent audit and continues to have “significant fraud exposure,” the Government Accountability Office said earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bruna Ferreira, who was released from ICE custody Monday on bond, denies claims that she's an absentee parent The Brazilian-born mother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's nephew – who was recently detained by US immigration authorities – has rejected the Trump administration's characterizations of her as an absentee parent. Bruna Ferreira, who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in November during a traffic stop in Massachusetts and was being held at a Louisiana detention center, said in an interview with the Washington Post that the White House's statements that she had never lived with her son or spoken with Leavitt “in many years” were incorrect. They had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, now aged 11. She said she takes her son to Dave & Buster's, a food and video games chain; ferries him to school, cheers at sports games; and fills his bedroom with “everything a young boy needs”. Ferreira told the Post that she also “moved mountains” to ensure her son could attend Karoline Leavitt's wedding to real estate developer Nicholas Riccio in early January. “Why they're creating this narrative is beyond my wildest imagination.” The differentiated accounts came as Ferreira was released on a $1,500 bond on Monday after immigration judge Cynthia Goodman ordered that she be freed on the lowest-dollar bail possible, according to her lawyers. A lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not object to Ferreira's release and said he agreed with her lawyers that she was not a danger to society or a flight risk, the Washington Post reported. Ferreira came to the US from Brazil with her family when she was six years old. DHS officials have not produced records relating to her alleged arrest for battery. Ferreira's lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, told the Post his client had no criminal record, with immigration authorities possibly alluding to an incident when she was summoned to juvenile court after a fight outside a Dunkin' Donuts over $8 in 2008. They fell in love, got engaged, had a child, and lived together – but instead of marrying they broke up in 2015 and have since shared parenting responsibilities. Ferreira has alleged in court documents that her son's father had threatened in the past to try to get her deported. Leavitt, in a text exchange with the Post, denied seeking to have her deported. “I had no involvement in her being picked up by ice,” he reportedly wrote on Wednesday to the outlet.</p>

Sudanese paramilitary forces bombed a kindergarten and the hospital where victims were brought for treatment in southern Sudan on Thursday, killing at least 50 people, including 33 children. A local official told Al Jazeera that at least 116 people were killed. Forty-six of those killed were children, the official said. According to UNICEF, many of the victims were aged between 5 and 7 years old. The UN Secretary-General is “appalled” by the strikes, spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement, and called on states to take action to stop further violence in Sudan. The UN has reported that a humanitarian convoy carrying food supplies to North Darfur, including a World Food Programme truck, was also hit in an aerial strike on Thursday. The strikes come amid warnings that South Kordofan may become “another el-Fasher,” as UN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Thursday. UN officials have estimated that tens of thousands of people have been slaughtered in the city in the past three weeks alone. Satellite evidence shows the city resembles a “slaughterhouse,” Yale University researchers say. Once-busy markets from the city that formerly had a population of 1.5 million are now empty. Since Sudan's horrific civil war and genocide began in April 2023, as many as or more than 400,000 people have been killed. “The RSF just attacked a kindergarten, killing at least 33 children in Sudan. “Imagine if [Donald] Trump spent as much time trying to stop the killing, as he did getting the UAE to invest in his crypto coin.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president's efforts under harsh spotlight as Rwanda-DRC deal and Thailand-Cambodia mediations waver For the sake of anyone confused by Donald Trump's apparently supernatural abilities as a global peacemaker – for which he was given the inaugural (and perhaps only) Fifa “peace prize” – current events have intervened to offer some clarification. In the space of a few hours on Monday, however, those claims were thrown under a harsh spotlight even as Trump and his officials continued to try to pressure Ukraine into rewarding Russia for an illegal international aggression by surrendering its sovereign territory. In the Great Lakes region too, a deal freshly inked in Washington between Rwanda and the DRC was also struggling, with the Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, telling lawmakers in a speech that Rwanda was already violating its commitments under a peace deal mediated by Washington. A classic example of a negative peace is the long-running tension between India and Pakistan, which has resulted in episodic fighting (and is, needless to say, one of the crises Trump claims to have solved.) The reality, as critics have pointed out since Trump was given his medal and trophy by the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, is that most of what Trump and his team are involved in is not even properly categorisable as working towards even a negative peace. The business that Trump and his envoys are in is dealmaking, a fundamentally transactional affair and very different from the hard slog of mediated peace processes. As Arthur Boutellis wrote in an essay for the Global Observatory of the International Peace Institute in October: “Dealmakers bring valuable skills to peace mediation, including pragmatism, persistence and a results-oriented mindset. “Yet there is a fundamental difference between dealmaking and peacemaking. It is inherently transactional, zero-sum and contractual: one party transfers ownership to another in exchange for payment. “Peacemaking, by contrast, seeks to shift parties from bargaining over fixed positions to addressing their underlying interests and needs in pursuit of durable ‘win-win' outcomes. When it comes to peace efforts, Trump's instincts are more performative than interested in hard graft. Most dangerous of all is that this lack of commitment is transparently obvious to all involved, turning negotiations into long-winded exercises in bad faith, where the game is to be able to trade recriminations over failure, and a mediator (in the shape of Trump) who is often the most unreliable and bad faith actor.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has emphasized the importance of “unity” after arriving in London for a meeting with European leaders at Downing Street in a show of solidarity. • Meanwhile, Russia has praised the US' new national security strategy, released last week. It comes after a weekend of diplomacy between Europe, Kyiv, and Washington, DC, which itself ended without any significant breakthroughs. Yesterday, Donald Trump Jr. suggested that US President Donald Trump “may” walk away from Ukraine peace efforts, while Trump himself said he was “a little bit disappointed” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing him of not having read the latest US peace proposal. “We are still and remain strongly behind Ukraine and giving support to your country because we all know that the destiny of this country is the destiny of Europe.” French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz departed 10 Downing Street in London, just a short while ago. As the leaders left after today's talks, Macron embraced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with handshakes and a hug. Zelensky then joined British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in returning to Downing Street. You can scroll below to see remarks the leaders made earlier today. Europe has “a lot of cards in (its) hands” when it comes to negotiations for an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron said a little while ago, during the opening remarks of a meeting with the leaders of the United Kingdom, Germany and Ukraine. He said cards in Europe's favor included the impact of European and US sanctions on Russia's economy, which was “starting to suffer” and the “fact that Ukraine is resisting in this war.” The European Union, US and UK established extensive sanctions regimes  against Russia in response to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Britain's foreign office has estimated that these sanctions have “deprived the Russian state of at least $450 billion in war funds between February 2022 and June 2025.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has also just spoken in London. While Europe is “trying to continue (its) support for Ukraine… on the other hand, we are seeing these talks and negotiations in Moscow and in the US,” Merz said, referencing recent discussions between US and Kremlin officials in the Russian capital last week, as well as talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators in Miami this weekend. Merz said he was looking forward to hearing about the outcome of these talks, stressing that Germany remains “strongly behind Ukraine… because we all know that the destiny of this country is the destiny of Europe.” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also said his country stands with Ukraine, but struck a wary tone when mentioning a potential end to the war. “If there's to be a ceasefire, it needs to be a just and lasting ceasefire,” he said, reiterating that “matters about Ukraine are for Ukraine.” Addressing Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, Starmer added: “We stand here to support you in the conflict and support you in the negotiations and make sure that this is a just and lasting settlement if we can get that far.” We can bring you remarks now from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who's currently in London. He emphasized the importance of unity between Ukraine, Europe and the United States when he joined British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz while speaking in Downing Street. “That's why we need to make some important decisions,” the Ukrainian leader said, before thanking Starmer for organizing the meeting, and expressing gratitude to Macron and Merz for their attendance. Russian forces continue to edge forward in several parts of the frontline in Ukraine — but have failed to complete the capture of several towns they have been attacking for months. “Enemy units are constantly carrying out offensive actions,” he said. Ukrainian troops were though “in complete control of the northern part. Speaking to journalists today, Peskov said it was also “clear that the parties now understand better that the work must be done in silence. “We don't know exactly what the differences of opinion are,” Peskov added, after US President Donald Trump claimed his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky has yet to read the US peace plan. The strategy was deeply critical of Europe, saying that the US wealthy allies “must assume primary responsibility for their regions and contribute far more to our collective defense.” It speaks of the need for dialogue and building constructive, good relations,” Peskov said. “We understand that by eliminating these current bilateral irritants, we could have the opportunity to restore our relations and bring them out of their rather deep crisis,” he added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said territorial issues are among those yet to be resolved in talks between Ukrainian and US officials over the Trump administration's peace plan. Speaking today before his arrival at Downing Street in the last 30 minutes, Zelensky told Bloomberg News that elements of the US plan required further discussion, including “sensitive issues” such as security guarantees for Ukraine and control over its eastern regions. He said that Kyiv also wanted a separate agreement on security guarantees from Western allies, above all the US. “There is one question I — and all Ukrainians — want to get an answer to: if Russia again starts a war, what will our partners do,” Zelenskiy said. As we've reported, Zelensky is expected to talk with Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz about the current status of negotiations to end Russia's war in Ukraine. Zelensky posed for photographs and shook hands with Starmer before entering the building. “We are joining forces to end this war with a dignified peace for Ukraine. French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have now greeted each other at the entrance of Downing Street, after the French leader arrived for talks with fellow European leaders today over steps towards ending the war in Ukraine. Like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who arrived a few minutes earlier, Macron did not respond to several questions shouted at him by a reporter. Some context: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to join the leaders in Downing Street today, after talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Miami to end the war ended with unresolved questions over security guarantees, territorial issues and continued concern that the US proposal tilts in Russia's favor. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has just arrived at 10 Downing Street, the official residence of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, where European leaders are set to discuss the status of negotiations to end to Russia's war in Ukraine. It's set to be a busy day of diplomacy for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is due to be meeting with European leaders in London soon, as we've reported. On top of that visit, separate statements from NATO and the Municipality of Rome also say that they are expecting him to be in both Belgium and Italy later today. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, President of the European Council, António Costa and President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, are set to meet with Zelensky at Rutte's official residence in Brussels, NATO said. Then this evening local time, Zelensky is expected in Rome, according to the city's municipality. He will meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni tomorrow afternoon, the country's government said. Turning now to the battlefield in Ukraine, where at least ten civilians were killed and 38 people injured in Russian attacks over the past 24 hours, according to authorities. Here's what we know about the number of victims in each region: • Speaking separately in Doha, Donald Trump Jr. hinted his father could walk away from the talks, adding that “what's unique about my father is, you don't know what he's going to do.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov applauded the “adjustments” as “consistent with [Russia's] vision.” Last week, the Netherlands said it would contribute another €250 million euros to Ukraine's air-defense capabilities. Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said the funds would be used to purchase American-made weapons and F-16 munitions through the US Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), a program that allows countries to supply urgently needed military equipment directly from U.S. stockpiles. For context: The Netherlands announcement of further support comes as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as we've reported. People in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv face 16 hours without power today due to scheduled power cuts caused by major Russian attacks on the nation's energy infrastructure. A feature of Ukrainian life since October, they are scheduled at varying intensities and were introduced into all regions yesterday. Russia has launched more than 1,600 attack drones, around 1,200 guided aerial bombs and nearly 70 missiles against Ukraine in the first week of December, Zelensky said yesterday, adding that Russia's primary objective is to target the infrastructure “that keeps everyday life going.” One schedule for a Kyiv apartment block seen by CNN advises residents that electricity will be available for less than four hours in the morning, between 8 am and 11.30 a.m. local time (1 am - 4.30 a.m. ET)  before switching off for most of the day and returning for less than four hours in the evening between 6.30 pm and 10 p.m. local time (11.30 a.m. - 3 p.m. As we await today's meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a number of European leaders in London, here's what we can tell you about who is expected to be in attendance. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will be at Downing Street for the talks. The gathering is a show of solidarity following the release of the US' new national security strategy, which blames European officials for blocking American-backed efforts to end Russia's war in Ukraine and assumes a more confrontational posture towards Europe as a whole. “Europeans will necessarily be a key pillar of the just and lasting solution we are collectively building,” he said. Donald Trump Jr. suggested that President Donald Trump “may” walk away from Ukraine peace efforts over repeated allegations of corruption against several close allies of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Giving his reaction to CNN's Fredricka Whitfield yesterday, Rep. Seth Moulton, a Democrat on the Ukrainian Caucus, said doing so would “be a gift to our adversaries.” More now from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who has praised US President Donald Trump's new national security strategy - as we've reported - for aligning with some of Moscow's own views. Strong in terms of his domestic political position, and this gives him the opportunity to make adjustments in accordance with his own vision,” Peskov told pool reporter Pavel Zarubin yesterday. He also suggested that the so-called “deep state” could prevent Trump's plans from taking shape. “Therefore, of course, one needs to monitor very closely how this concept will be implemented,” Peskov said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, December 8. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO PA) adopted a statement during its plenary session on Monday, underscoring the imperative to reinforce international security collaboration as the world moves toward multipolarity. "The CSTO PA advocates for intensified cooperation in upholding peace, strengthening the international security system, and countering international terrorism, extremism, organized cross-border crime, including drug and arms trafficking, as well as cybercrime," the statement declares. The document further stresses the significance of developing common approaches to constructing an architecture of "equal and indivisible Eurasian security" that is not targeted against any specific nation or alliance. "We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to advancing policies of good-neighborliness and peaceful coexistence among states, with due consideration for each other's national interests, and to jointly pursuing political and diplomatic resolutions to interstate conflicts and disputes," the parliamentarians emphasized. The CSTO PA also invoked "the calamities of past world wars, which inflicted irreparable loss, suffering, and devastation upon humanity." "We recognize the perils of further escalation in international tensions, the application of force, and other forms of interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, as these could precipitate global confrontation," the statement declared. The joint meeting of the CSTO PA Council and 18th plenary session of the CSTO PA is under the chairmanship of Vyacheslav Volodin. The agenda focuses on aligning legislation among member states, addressing challenges and threats within the CSTO's area of responsibility, and reviewing a draft statement on ensuring international security in a multipolar world. The session includes parliamentarians from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Iran.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces destroyed 20 fuel tanks — 70% of the total — in a drone strike on Russia's Temryuk Seaport in Krasnodar Krai on Dec. 5, the General Staff reported Dec. 8. The Dec. 5 attack sparked a large fire at the Temryuk Seaport, a facility that handles various types of cargo, including liquefied natural gas used to supply the Russian military. The fire continues to burn at the liquefied gas loading rack, where roughly two dozen rail tanks are stationed. Ukrainian forces also struck a fuel and lubricants depot near the Simeykine settlement in Luhansk Oblast, as well as a mobile fire group and a Pantsir-S1 air defense system in Donetsk Oblast. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. The list includes Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine's defense minister and previously the longest-serving prime minister, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov, Deputy Presidential Office head and ex-commander Pavlo Palisa, and Sergiy Kyslytsya, the first deputy foreign minister and one of Ukraine's key negotiators. "There are visions of the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine — and we don't have a unified view on Donbas," Zelensky told Bloomberg regarding the latest discussions on the peace plan for Ukraine. Ukraine will focus on strengthening its army through better mobilization, recruitment, and high-quality training as it continues to resist Russia's full-scale invasion, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 8, following a recent meeting with military personnel. Within this program, 300 million euros ($350 million) will fund a dedicated Ukraine Support Instrument that focuses on modernizing Ukraine's defense industry and integrating it into the EU's broader defense-manufacturing network. The Dec. 5 attack sparked a large fire at the Temryuk Seaport, a facility that handles various types of cargo, including liquefied natural gas used to supply the Russian military. The leaders of Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden said that they "strongly support" the so-called reparations loan. The move follows an appeal from the parliament to release an additional 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in support for Kyiv for next year. Four Russian soldiers were given sentences in the range of 1.5 to 12 years for their involvement in the murder of Russell "Texas" Bentley and an attempt to conceal the crime. Russia has accused Robert "Madyar" Brovdi in absentia of organizing an alleged terrorist attack in Russia's Kursk Oblast. Congress is also calling for more frequent reporting of aid provided to Kyiv by its European allies, reflecting Washington's push for Europe to take on a greater share of responsibility for supporting Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump said Dec. 7 he was "disappointed" that President Volodymyr Zelensky allegedly had not yet reviewed a U.S. peace proposal to end the war in Ukraine. Donald Trump Jr. warned on Dec. 7 that his father may walk away from Ukraine, parroting Kremlin propaganda about corruption in Kyiv driving Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix's NFLX-Q US$72-billion Warner Bros WBD-Q deal led to several price target cuts by Wall Street analysts as U.S. President Donald Trump warned of market-share concerns, underscoring the tough scrutiny that the acquisition is likely to face. The deal that combines the world's largest streaming service with HBO Max and a major Hollywood studio has also drawn criticism from bipartisan lawmakers and unions on concerns it could lead to job cuts and higher prices for consumers. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Monday that the U.S. Justice Department would examine the deal's impact for “quite a while.” Hollywood unions have voiced concerns about increased market concentration, reduced film output and the potential for higher consumer costs. Rival bidder Paramount Skydance PSKY-Q has said the deal process was biased, raising chances of a higher bid or a hostile takeover. The political dynamics may be further complicated by Warner Bros Discovery's rejection of Paramount Skydance, a studio with Trump connections, in favor of Netflix, analysts said. At least three brokerages cut their price targets for Netflix, with consensus median price target now at US$139, according to data compiled by LSEG.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora has died at the age of 70, the Russian foreign ministry said. "It is with deep regret that the Russian foreign ministry must inform that Russian Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Alexander Matsegora passed away on December 6, 2025 at the age of 70," the ministry said. Matsegora has been Russia's ambassador to North Korea since 2014. "We will cherish the memory of the outstanding Russian diplomat and patriot, who made a serious contribution to the establishment and development of comprehensive strategic partnership between Russia and North Korea, in our hearts," the ministry stressed. "We offer our sincere condolences to his family and friends." In 1978, he graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He joined the diplomatic corps in 1999 and has held various offices both in the foreign ministry's central headquarters and abroad. In 2005-2006, he served as a section chief at the ministry's first Asia department, and as minister-counsellor of the Russian embassy in North Korea in 2006-2011. In 2011-2014, he was deputy director of the first Asia department. He spoke English and Korean.</p>

Socca is a fast-paced variant of football played six-a-side on a smaller pitch, blending elements of futsal and street football.

The triumph marks a historic milestone for the Polish national team.

The final pitted two unbeaten sides against each other.

Mexico had topped their group with maximum points and a +10 goal difference, before eliminating Greece, Bulgaria, and Kazakhstan in the knockout stages.

This victory finally secures Poland's place among the socca world champions. In previous tournaments, Poland had twice reached the final - losing 0-1 to Germany in 2018 and 2-3 to Russia in 2019 - before taking bronze in 2022.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's government has been under fire over its involvement with several companies tied to Edmonton businessman Sam Mraiche.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press For months, there has been a swirl of unanswered questions concerning allegations of political interference by Alberta government officials in the procurement practices for outsourcing to private surgical facilities. Those questions were sparked by news of the abrupt firing of Athana Mentzelopoulos last January as chief executive of Alberta Health Services, two days before she was to discuss her investigation into the procurement process for private surgical facilities with the province's Auditor-General, Doug Wylie. Ms. Mentzelopoulos has alleged that some of the agency's contracts for private surgery were at inflated prices, that they may have been tainted by conflicts of interest and that political officials – including former chief of staff Marshall Smith – pressed her to proceed with deals. Those allegations have not been tested in court; the government has said Ms. Mentzelopoulos was fired for incompetence. The intervening months have done little to provide clarity. Last spring, the Alberta government appointed Raymond Wyant, a former chief judge of the Provincial Court of Manitoba, as an independent investigator, albeit one with a circumscribed mandate and limited powers (he could not subpoena witnesses or conduct testimony under oath). Mr. Wyant also examined the province's ill-fated effort to import children's analgesics through a company owned by Mr. Mraiche. Mr. Wyant did not interview any elected officials, but concluded there were no improper actions by any minister, ministerial staff member or member of the public service. He had earlier noted that he was “not in a position to make a final and absolute determination.” Even for the independent investigator, there remain many unanswered questions. Last Friday, the Alberta government cancelled negotiations with two companies, owned in part by Mr. Mraiche, to open private surgical facilities in Red Deer and Lethbridge. “Concerns were raised about the procurement practices and procedures and handling of conflicts of interest in AHS procurement,” Matt Jones, the Minister of Hospital and Surgical Health Services, told the Alberta legislature on Tuesday. All the more curious, then, that Mr. Mraiche's company was selected, given that it did not have the drug establishment licence needed to import pharmaceuticals. Why were companies tied to Mr. Mraiche considered for private surgical services? Mr. Mraiche was already facing questions over the botched effort to secure children's analgesics. The Wyant report notes that “Alberta has paid almost $50-million for product not yet received.” So why was the province considering a proposal to outsource surgeries to facilities in Red Deer and Lethbridge, owned in part by numbered companies in which Mr. Mraiche held a 25-per-cent stake? Alberta ends procurement talks with two firms tied to businessman at centre of health care controversy What, if anything, has the government done to address those gaps and failures? Mr. Smith (no relation to Premier Danielle Smith) hired several relatives of Mr. Mraiche, while he lived in a home owned by one of Mr. Mraiche's sisters. Mr. Mraiche, who has said he paid rent and has acted appropriately at all times, also popped up at high-profile events involving government officials, including box seats during NHL playoffs and an election night victory party. Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote from the Wyant report to the as-yet unfinished report of Alberta's Auditor-General, Doug Wylie.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Investigative Committee issued an international arrest warrant on Dec. 5 for Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, according to his Dec. 7 statement on Facebook. Russia has accused Brovdi in absentia of organizing an alleged terrorist attack in Russia's Kursk Oblast that killed Anna Prokofieva, a military correspondent for the pro-Kremlin Channel One, on March 26. "But remember, worms, in your own swampy language: 'Annushka has already spilled the oil,'" Brovdi wrote on Facebook, referencing a work by Kyiv-born Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov. Russia regularly issues arrest warrants for citizens of countries it labels "unfriendly," including last year's warrants for President Volodymyr Zelensky and former President Petro Poroshenko. Both Ukrainian officials were later removed from the Russian Interior Ministry's wanted list. Hungary, whose government remains one of the few in Europe to preserve close relations with Russia, banned Brovdi from entering the country in August. The ban came after Brovdi, who has Hungarian roots, confirmed that the Unmanned Systems Forces had struck the Druzhba oil pipeline, a key route supplying Russian oil to Europe, including Hungary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. What Kind of World Order Does His National Security Strategy Seek? In his first term as U.S. president and on the campaign trail for reelection in 2024, a variety of Donald Trump's instincts were visible. One was an appreciation of power for its own sake. For Trump, it is power, not principles, that makes the world go round. “We are going to make America wealthy again,” Trump vowed in 2016. “Only I can fix it,” Trump declared at the 2016 Republican nominating convention. Trump's new National Security Strategy, which was published late last week, synthesizes and formalizes these three instincts, presenting them as the necessary drivers of international order. The NSS points to “the character of our nation, upon which its power, wealth, and decency were built,” entrusting the protection of this character to the president himself and his “team,” who in his first term “successfully marshaled America's great strengths to correct course and begin ushering in a new golden age for our country.” It is Trump's personality, power, and supporters that have enabled this golden age. The strategy document is also an expression of American conservatism. Trump's Republican Party is not that of George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan, two presidents who tied conservative domestic politics to liberal internationalism. Trump's GOP is motivated more by an eagerness to separate friends from foes, a distinction that unites domestic politics with foreign policy. This binary mandates a blanket rejection of the Biden administration (to which Trump, in his introductory letter to the NSS, attributes “four years of weakness, extremism, and deadly failures”), a concern with national purity and hence with foreign contamination, and a will to shore up civilizational principles “in Europe, the Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world.” The new strategy simultaneously mirrors and distorts international reality. This is a world Trump has helped bring into being. Although the strategy document is unlikely to explain Trump's day-to-day decision-making, it describes an aspirational world order. It would not be the function of great-power competition or of civilizational clashes, and it would not be rules-based. This network could provide Russian President Vladimir Putin with an opening to end the war in Ukraine on his terms. It could be conducive to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's grandiose plans for his country. Most of all, though, it will accommodate the actions of a man who sees the world in viscerally personal terms, who can easily and quickly change his views and his commitments, and who thinks less in terms of negotiation and treaties than in terms of rapid-fire dealmaking. This is more than just the world Trump wants. The Helsinki Final Act of 1975, which solidified western Europe's U.S.-backed security architecture, proceeded from fine-grained negotiation carried out by faceless diplomats; it now belongs to a distant past. Bureaucracies, institutions, and ministries of foreign affairs have all been losing stature, as ambitious, centralizing leaders—some charismatic, some authoritarian, some both—have emerged in many of the world's biggest countries. Trump, Putin, and Xi, along with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, dominate the foreign policies of their respective countries. Contemporary media can still democratize access to information, but it also augments the optics of personalized power. Whether effective or ineffective in reaching their goals, these leaders straddle the global attention economy; they are impossible to ignore. A striking feature of the strategy is its presentism. Absent is a common historical argument: that after World War II, the United States built an institutional architecture conducive to security, prosperity, and liberty. The world must patiently stand by, watching and waiting for his next steps. Its passages on Europe are especially revealing in this regard. Rather than calibrated persuasion within an alliance structure, the document advocates a strategy of promoting conservatism in Europe. It recommends “cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations,” a trajectory that inclines toward liberal internationalism or, in the case of the European Union, toward liberal transnationalism. Accomplishing it would require the sustained application of American power overseas. Meaningful persuasion requires empathy for foreign countries or at least attention to them: they must be a concern not only when they pose an acute threat. Meaningful persuasion requires the suspension of some short-term interests for the sake of long-term interests, which is why coercive economic statecraft among allies is ill advised. Meaningful persuasion enshrines deference toward other countries (when merited) so that others may respond with deference in return (when merited). All too often in Trump's brash strategy document, foreign policy is construed as nothing more than naked assertiveness, a means to the end of “an American-led world of sovereign countries and free economies.” To judge from the new strategy, Europe is a second-order consideration. The strategy rightly establishes freedom of navigation and regional stability as priorities in the Indo-Pacific, positioning China as a competitor while underscoring the importance of avoiding direct conflict with a nuclear power that is a military behemoth. Illegal immigration and drug trafficking are also problems that demand a nuanced set of solutions, from reforms rooted in domestic American politics to collective problem solving with the countries that contribute to migrant or drug flows into the United States. Trump's strategy risks militarizing problems that are not military in nature. In some passages, the document defines “stopping regional conflicts” as a U.S. responsibility. In this view, Washington must prevent any one antagonist (meaning Russia or China) from achieving a position of regional dominance. The war in Ukraine should be Europeanized so that Europe can police its own region and keep Russia from exerting outsize influence beyond its borders. Elsewhere, however, the strategy recognizes “the outsize influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations,” describing their influence as a “timeless truth of international relations.” Some countries are entitled to preeminence, and Russia may be one of these countries. But regional stability in Ukraine and elsewhere will not arise from spheres of influence created by a handful of great powers. The document does not acknowledge that Ukraine could lose the war, which is a real possibility, and it skirts a fundamental dilemma for the United States, which is that strategic stability with Russia can be realized only by giving Russia some degree of control over Ukraine. Yet were Russia to acquire such control, it would destabilize NATO and non-NATO European countries. On Ukraine, the new strategy does little more than make assertions, many of them too sanguine about what the country needs to survive and too credulous about Russia's potential to serve as a constructive regional actor. National security strategy documents of this kind are not blueprints. American presidents end up reacting to crises more than dictating outcomes. On September 11, 2001, George W. Bush's presidency became a reaction to an unanticipated terrorist attack. Donald Trump's first term was refashioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Joe Biden had to contend with Russia's re-invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and with the regional fallout from Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. No doubt Trump's second term will be defined more by unpredicted future crises than by any paragraph, sentence, or phrase from the 2025 NSS. This past February, I wrote in Foreign Affairs about the potential for “flexible diplomacy” from the Trump administration and the possibility that a nimble White House could pull off “the deft management of constant tensions and rolling conflicts.” At times during the past year, such nimbleness has materialized: in diplomacy that yielded a cease-fire in Gaza, for example, and a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Resolving the conflict in Ukraine would demand not just flexibility but close coordination with allies and carefully plotted incentives to curb Russian aggression. This is incompatible with the project of imposing American-style conservatism on Europe. Contending with China's reach in the Indo-Pacific and beyond will benefit from Washington's talent for persuasion rather than for imposing tariffs. And if the United States is to minimize its military footprint, it will have to look past civilizational patterns and affinities, whatever these may be, and establish global partnerships that are based on mutual respect.
