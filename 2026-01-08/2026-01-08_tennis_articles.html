                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madison Keys came from a set and 4-2 down in the Brisbane International third round to defeat Diana Shnaider in three tiebreaks -- the first triple-tiebreak scoreline of her career, and the 12th on tour this decade. 5 seed Madison Keys was pushed to the limit by No. 12 seed Diana Shnaider in a Brisbane International third-round thriller, coming from a set and 4-2 down to squeak through 6-7(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(5) in 2 hours and 59 minutes. Keys finished with 38 winners, including nine aces, to Shnaider's 17. Keys' victory sets up a quarterfinal matchup against No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka -- a rematch of last year's Australian Open final, which the American edged 6-3, 2-6, 7-5. "That had a little bit of everything," Keys remarked in her on-court interview. "It's good to start the year off with a little bit of drama -- so glad we got that out of the way. Diana played such a great match, I had to come back and figure out how to get myself back into that match. Really trying to keep the score as close as possible and give myself the best opportunity, then when that opportunity finally came round, to take advantage of that." From that point on, the dynamic switched, and it was the reigning Australian Open champion who had to hold off her opponent's fightback. Down 5-4, Shnaider saved the first two match points against her with service winners, but Keys' volleying prowess proved key in snatching victory in the tiebreak. Keys improved to 3-0 overall against Shnaider, having also won in the 2024 Miami second round and 2025 Queen's quarterfinals. Keys was followed on Show Court 1 by compatriot Jessica Pegula, who notched yet another three-set victory as she came from 2-0 down in the third set to defeat Dayana Yastremska 5-7, 6-2, 6-3. Pegula remained steady, resetting after dropping the first set from 5-3 up, and found 18 winners to 26 unforced errors. The former US Open finalist also saved her best for the home stretch, stealing some crucial points from Yastremska with anticipation. "At least I didn't go that long," she said while glancing at the 2-hour, 16-minute time on her match clock. "When she won the second set I was like, uh ... 2020 Lyon SF, Sofia Kenin d.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Mmoh continued his statement start to 2026 on Thursday at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open, where he upset familiar foe Karen Khachanov 7-6(2), 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals. It marked Mmoh's first win over a Top 20 opponent since 2023, when he also moved past Khachanov at the US Open. “Funnily enough, my first ITF junior win was against Karen Khachanov, so we've been battling from the age of 14,” said Mmoh, who now leads World No. “He's a great guy who's had an unbelievable career, so just to share the court with him, I knew I needed to play at the highest level possible.” 285 in the PIF ATP Rankings, failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set, but regrouped in a tidy tie-break to advance to his seventh ATP Tour quarter-final. The 27-year-old will next face countryman Marcos Giron, who earlier upset seventh seed and defending champion Alexandre Muller 6-4, 7-6(4). Earlier, Chinese lefty Shang Juncheng became the first player to reach all three Hong Kong quarter-finals since the ATP 250 returned in 2024. The 20-year-old hit 24 winners in his 6-3, 6-4 victory over fifth seed Lorenzo Sonego. Shang, who missed six months of the 2025 season due to a foot injury, will next face second seed Alexander Bublik, who opened his 2026 with a laser-focused 6-3, 6-3 win over Botic van de Zandschulp. Bublik finished 2025 with a 30-9 record since Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, highlighted by titles in Halle, Gstaad and Kitzbuehel. “We tried many things before arriving here,” Bublik said of his preseason. “You never know what's going to happen [in the first match].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It doesn't appear as if Elena Rybakina used the offseason to cool off after her blazing finish to 2025, as she defeated No. She appears to have carried that momentum into the new year, following a flawless second-round win over Zhang Shuai with an equally impressive straight-sets victory over No. “It's always tough battles against Paula,” Rybakina said after the match. “She has great shots, she plays really fast and has a very good serve, so it was not easy. I started a little bit slow and was struggling with my serve too. Rybakina did indeed get off to a slow start. But Rybakina quickly steadied herself, breaking right back and fending off Badosa's further advances to level the set at 2-all. After Badosa saved a break point and held in the next game, Rybakina rattled off four straight games to close out the opening set. That surge became part of a run of seven consecutive games, as Rybakina raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set. Badosa briefly halted the slide with a hold for 3-1, but it wasn't enough. By match end, Rybakina had won nine of the last 11 games. “I was trying to focus one [game] at a time,” Rybakina said. I still have a lot of things to work on for the next match, but hopefully it will be better.” Here are some takeaways from Rybakina's win over Badosa: Whether she was playing her forehand or her backhand, it didn't matter, as she struck every ball with conviction, especially on big points. She hit 13 winners to just 7 unforced errors in the second set and finished with 24 winners and 21 unforced errors overall. The head-to-head is level at 1-1, but their last meeting came all the way back in 2023 at Indian Wells. Rybakina won that quarterfinal match in three sets. It doesn't appear as if Elena Rybakina used the offseason to cool off after her blazing finish to 2025, as she defeated No.</p>

The Filipina notched an almost-flawless 6-0, 6-2 victory, where she was perfect 6-for-6 break-point conversion rate. Alexandra Eala needed just over an hour to book a place in her fourth career WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz quarterfinal, routing Petra Marcinko 6-0, 6-2 on Thursday at the ASB Classic. And she hardly let up after jumping out to an early lead to seal her place in the last eight in 63 minutes. "I'm so happy with how I was able to compete and handle the different situations on court," said Eala, who needed 2 hours and 40 minutes to win her opening match. 2: Eala is now 2-0 against players from Croatia at WTA main-draw level in her career. 6: Eala was a perfect 6-for-6 on break-point opportunities in the match. She also faced six break points herself, but saved five of them. She ended the match by winning six in a row, from an early break deficit at 2-1. 11: Marcinko came into the tilt having won 11 straight matches. 82 won just 12 points in seven service games overall -- a 31% clip. For a spot in the semifinals, Eala will face No. 5 seed Magda Linette, who defeated unseeded Italian Elisabetta Cocciaretto in three sets, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3. She hopes to beat the 33-year-old for the first time, having lost their two previous matches -- including a match on grass in Nottingham last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>9 Nicolas Massu spoke with his player, Hubert Hurkacz. The Pole was readying for his first tournament in seven months thanks to a knee injury that required surgery last July. “Enjoy the competition again,” Massu told Hurkacz. Since then, Hurkacz has made a dream start to his comeback in Sydney, earning straight-sets victories against World No. And when you are out of competition seven months — it is a lot of time — you need to be patient,” Massu said. You are missing weeks and then there is a slow recovery.” Although Hurkacz's game has been sharp inside Ken Rosewall Arena, claiming his 20th win against a Top-10 opponent according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, that does not mean recent months have been perfect. “But at the same time, I'm totally convinced — because I had this in my so many years of Tour, so many years in tennis — that at some point, if you keep strong and you believe and you work hard, you deserve it.” Massu made clear that Hurkacz has done everything in his power to not only recover physically, but to prepare for his comeback. From Marbella and Malaga to Monaco and Poland, Hurkacz has worked exhaustively to put himself in position for moments like he has experienced in the past week. “It's incredible, the work ethic of Hubi. So I think that when you work like this, the [positive] things need to come back. You deserve to have these kinds of results.” Early mornings, late nights and a lot of hard work. There were moments of pain and fatigue. But as the coach explained, “these things are hard”. “My experience from my life and from my tennis career is that everything that is strong against you or sometimes it is dark, at the end of the tunnel, you see the light,” Massu said. They took things quite slowly, prioritising listening to Hurkacz's doctors and physio. “We were strong in the difficult moments and I think that the whole thing for me, from my point of view, that I wanted, is to see him again on the court competing.” One thing that has certainly not left the Pole is his serve. Hurkacz has hit 42 aces across four sets and faced one total break point against formidable opposition. "Also for sure he works a lot. He put a lot of focus there." But the Chilean was also keen to point out how much of an all-around player Hurkacz is. 83 stands 6'5", but has more than a big serve. "I think that he's a very complete player. I still believe that he can play even on clay the same level as on hard court," Massu said. " And of course, we need to improve some little details that can bring him again to fight in the top of the top. But the most important is the health, I still believe that if he's healthy, we can achieve good things." While he hopes to maintain his great early form this week in Sydney, the overall comeback has just begun. Massu very much believes in his charge. “I always believe that nothing is impossible if you maintain the work ethic, if you maintain your positive mind,” Massu said.
