                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Anna Brady-Estevez is a deep tech venture capitalist, founding partner of American DeepTech. She holds a PhD in chemical/environmental engineering from Yale and previously directed SBIR programs at the NSF, investing in space, energy, and blockchain startups. Recently Karl Nell said something that i think is related to her role: Karl Nell: "And so, you know, this program probably still needs to continue. So i think this Anna Brady-Estevez maybe played that role to get companies interested in the tech. See the purple section on this slide from Karl Nells presentation (mirror) Now on to what she said in yesterdays interview: Anna Brady-Estevez: "[...] I've actually spoken about some of these things before and I've been a little bit uncomfortable talking about it too, but [she whispers] it's been edited out" So what I've subsequently seen is... which I understand might be very close to what David had seen is in terms of, not necessarily the same place, not necessarily the same beings, but something perhaps similar, was these exotic biologics" Anna Brady-Estevez: "And when I say exotic biologics, they... I went with a doctor... they are not human. Anna Brady-Estevez: "So those tests can be complex, on archaeological samples. So it's not that there aren't errors that could be introduced, including having a much, the newer terrestrial DNA being amplified up to a much and it's it doesn't need to be terrestrial" I know you've talked about consciousness, so [...] we're looking at why is something much higher performing? Anna Brady-Estevez: "But on the biologic side some of these things have really bizarre implants. Is it something that you want to stay away from? She continues to describe that from the hundreds of entrepeneurs and businesses she has funded, some of them report getting their information from "somewhere else". For all of the above, i do wonder if she is talking about those dried up Peru tridactyl mummies. I know very little about the tridactyl stuff and this is just what my AI told me. I think its more likely she is talking about those tridactyl mummies than that she had access to biologics from the legacy program. We know Grusch told Burlison to have a look at them, so Grusch must think they are similar to what he has seen. I recommend people to watch it from about timestamp 35:25 onwards However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples: Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail. Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): "Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. President Jimmy Carter: "If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. Astronaut Gordon Cooper: "I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla..." While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature. - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee. Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling. Rectangular Craft Sighting: "Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom." Corroboration: "I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. Triangular Craft Sighting: ["I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Uri Geller has offered his island off the coast of East Lothian to Donald Trump as a military base. His offer came following Trump's announcement he wanted to take over Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, as the 51st US state. The president previously claimed it would be vital to US national security. Its location, between North America and the Arctic, means it is well-placed for early warning systems should a missile attack occur, and monitoring activity in the region's waters. Edinburgh easyJet flight diverted to Glasgow after missing airport curfew Trump first attempted to buy the territory during his first term in the White House in 2019, but was told by Denmark it was not for sale. Geller bought Lamb Island, located in the Firth of Forth near North Berwick, 18 years ago, and claimed this week it was "blessed by supernatural powers", and had a "mind-blowing" connection to Greenland. Lamb is protected by mystical forces and you will succeed with its power. "All Greenlanders can become citizens of Lamb, so Denmark does not need to worry." The psychic previously said he believed his island, which he declared his own micronation with its own flag and national anthem, had a link to Ancient Egypt and the Great Pyramids of Giza.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A24 is about to expose viewers to the sound of pure terror with its new horror film, Undertone. She soon realizes, however, that they are more than just deeply disturbing sounds, but legitimately haunted recordings that turn her life into a waking nightmare. Everything they received came from an anonymous email, but as the pair starts digging into them, all Evy hears is a jumble of mildly creepy sounds. Her partner, however, believes he can pick up a message when playing the recordings in reverse. Everything quickly takes a turn as more words become discernible, a nerve-shredding version of "Baa Baa Black Sheep" plays, and the hauntings seem to spread into the host's house. Undertone marks the feature directorial and writing debut of Ian Tuason. Like fellow filmmakers Skinamarink's Kyle Edward Ball and Talk to Me's Danny and Michael Philippou, Tuason first gained recognition on YouTube, making virtual reality horror shorts that racked up millions of views and earned showcases at SXSW and beyond. The White Lotus and Overcompensating star Adam DiMarco is also on board, alongside Michèle Duquet, Keana Lyn Bastidas, and Jeff Yung. Dan Slater and Cody Calahan are set to produce. A24 jumped all over Undertone following its much-lauded premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival last year. The slow-burning horror mystery earned rave reviews for its haunting atmosphere and attention to detail, using the in-universe podcast to create a uniquely rich soundscape for terror. Tuason's debut feature was impressive enough that he's already set to make a massive step-up in his career with a legendary found footage franchise — Paranormal Activity. Back in December, he was tapped to helm the upcoming reboot entry being produced by James Wan at Blumhouse-Atomic Monster. Given Undertone's setup, it appears to be a match made in heaven for the filmmaker, and it's moving along quickly at the banner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly six years after the finale, fans are still hoping for a revival of the long-running fantasy TV show, Supernatural, which has had an immense impact on pop culture. However, several other side characters from the series will also be hoped for in a reboot. These characters had a significant impact on the Winchesters' arcs and the overall storyline, making them critical players in any new plot. Claire is a controversial Supernatural side character, known for her tough and harsh personality. However, fans would still like to see the Wayward Sisters spinoff, which was proposed and would have focused on Jody Mills and her pupils, including Claire. Some viewers preferred the other side characters and found Claire unlikable, but she's still one of the most fascinating characters, with enough substance to support a Supernatural spinoff series. What is most appreciated about Claire's inclusion is how she represents the next generation of hunters who will take up the torch after those like Sam and Dean. If there is ever to be a revival, the storyline cannot forget about this next generation. Despite being unorthodox and goofy, he quickly becomes a cherished friend of Dean, who relies on the hunter several times throughout the years. Garth doesn't work like many of the other hunters introduced, but always manages to take down the villain and survive another day. Garth defied the odds, learning to control his impulses as a werewolf. In the end, he is married to another werewolf with children and supports others of his kind who live in peace without hurting humans. Rowena MacLeod's story began as a powerful villain in Supernatural, introduced as an ancient witch who keeps herself alive through dark magic and works to get Lucifer out of Hell's cage, hoping it would benefit her. However, she eventually becomes a powerful ally to the Winchesters, especially after Lucifer kills and discards her (from which she resurrects herself with a spell). Though Rowena was rarely someone the Winchesters could trust entirely, she had one of the most impressive plot twists in Supernatural. Considering Rowena's morally gray characterization, this seemed like the perfect ending for her. However, most fans would love to see her return for a revival, especially if there is another conflict between Heaven and Hell. Jack Kline is one of the most powerful Supernatural characters ever, fathered by Lucifer and born to a human mother, Kelly Kline, who sacrificed her life to bring him into the world. Despite the odds, Jack ended up siding with good and helped take down God when he tried to destroy the world. Considering his position in the final season, there is a high likelihood that he will play a role in any revival that brings back Sam and Dean Winchester, who are both in Heaven by the conclusion. One of the most devastating stories in Supernatural is that of Jody Mills, the sheriff of Sioux Falls, who loses her son and husband during an encounter with the dark supernatural world around her. It is this experience that connects Jody with the Winchesters and Bobby Singer on a more personal level, becoming a part of their trusted inner circle. Though she occasionally helps them with cases, Jody eventually becomes a respected and skilled hunter. Jody Mills isn't just one of the best hunters in Supernatural, but an endearing character who fills the role of mother and friend for several characters. She loses her own child to tragedy, but takes in Claire Novak, Alex Jones, a girl raised by vampires, and also Kaia, a girl from another dimension. By the conclusion, she is a safe person for dozens of characters harmed by supernatural beings, but is also the one people can count on to give them tough love as well as endearing encouragement. Among the hundreds of side characters throughout the fifteen seasons, Jody is one of the overall best characters in Supernatural, beloved as much as significant supporting characters like Bobby Singer and Castiel. As one of the most trustworthy people in the Winchesters' chosen family, a revival could not happen without bringing back Sheriff Mills. Though Ben turns out not to be Dean's biological son, he joins their family in Season 6 when he believes Sam is in Hell. Dean's experiences with Lisa and Ben give him a taste of a normal life before he is pulled back into the dangerous world of hunting. One of the most infuriating storylines in Supernatural is when Dean has Castiel take the memories Lisa and Ben have of him after they're attacked by a demon. Many viewers considered this a cheap and heartbreaking way to end their storyline, especially considering how important they became to Dean. This time, having a family shaped Dean's characterization, though they were rarely mentioned after Season 6. This is one of the frustrating Supernatural storylines that fans hope get addressed in a revival. It would be thrilling to see the boy come back as an adult, potentially taking up monster hunting even after losing his memories of Dean. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. I would love to see Claire return and was disappointed we didn't get the Wayward Daughters spinoff but it worked out for the best for Kathryn Newton since she has gone on to become a movie star and if she had done the spinoff show she might never have got the lead role in 'Freaky.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI VALLEY — Several viewers called into the WHIO newsroom, wondering what was causing the strange lights spotted across the Miami Valley Wednesday night. The lights are not a sign of alien life but rather from a Starlink Satellite. The satellites can appear as a string of pearls or a“train” of bright lights moving across the night sky. SpaceX launched its first Starlink of 2026 on Jan. 4. They orbit at an altitude of 342 miles above Earth, according to space.com. You can track the satellites' path here.
