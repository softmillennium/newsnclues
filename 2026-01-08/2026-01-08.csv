            A small bloc of Senate Republicans has delivered a notable rebuke of President Donald Trump just days after his operation ousting Venezuela's leader, voting to advance a resolution that would limit future US military force in the nation without Congress' approval.
    


            Five Republicans on Thursday voted with all Senate Democrats to allow a future vote that would limit the president's powers in the deepening conflict with Venezuela — a move that surprised even some Democrats who had not been certain how the GOP votes would fall.
    


            The full measure is expected to pass next week, which would require 51 votes in the Senate. The measure, though, will still need to withstand a full amendment process and support for the final resolution is not guaranteed.
    


            The vote in the Senate had been considered mostly a messaging exercise by Democrats and Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, a co-sponsor of the measure, to force their GOP counterparts to register their discontent over – or support of – an increasingly emboldened White House. But now that it has won over enough Republican votes, it becomes a much more real threat to the reach of Trump's power.
    


            Sens. Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri were the surprise GOP defections to join with Paul, a critic of Trump's overseas military actions, and GOP moderate Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman also surprised his colleagues by voting with his party, despite his public suggestions he may oppose it. After his vote, Fetterman refused to answer questions about why he voted in favor.
    


Trump officials scramble to sell skeptical lawmakers, oil execs on Venezuela plan



            The House will take a similar vote on a measure limiting Trump's authorities to intervene militarily in Venezuela later this month, thanks to a push by House Democrats. If that passes, the two chambers would need to unify their two resolutions — ultimately sending something to Trump's desk for his consideration.
    


            It has been a closely watched vote in both GOP leadership suites and the White House in a week where members of Congress have pressed the administration for answers about its next steps in the widening conflict with Venezuela. It's the second bipartisan resolution to come up in the Senate since November to check the president's powers.
    


            Top Democrats, along with Paul, had been privately pushing Republicans to support the move, amid growing frustration behind the scenes about the president's moves. While Republicans like Speaker Mike Johnson have been clear they believe Trump was within his powers to execute the operation in Venezuela without approval from Congress, not all Republicans agree.
    


            The question of the boundaries of the president's authority – and Congress' role in authorizing military action abroad – has roiled Capitol Hill in recent months as the Trump administration has escalated its military campaign in South America. The operation leading to the ouster and capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro triggered a series of classified briefings in Washington this week that left a partisan split in their wake.
    


            And there have been further questions, including among Republicans, about where Trump might deploy US military forces next, including Cuba, Colombia or Greenland.
    


            Speaking with reporters on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of the vote, Paul emphasized that this resolution is not a referendum on whether or not Maduro was a “bad guy,” but about asserting Congress' right to declare war.
    


            “The debate really isn't about good or evil, bad or good. There's a lot of evil in the world. The question is about who has the power to take the country to war,” he said, later adding, “The Constitution was very clear, and it divides war into two aspects. One is the declaration or initiation of war, that power was given to Congress, and then the execution of the war, the making of the war, was left to the president.”
    


            Paul previously said he had heard from two other Republicans who were considering backing the resolution, increasing its chances for passage.
    


            Kaine had said he had “high hopes and low expectations,” for the vote, and was hopeful they could pull more GOP support after the operation to capture Maduro than they received in November, noting that some of his colleagues had thought Trump was “bluffing.”
    


            “If the first one was premature, and that was an opinion by a number of my colleagues who voted no, this isn't premature,” he added.
    


            Both senators argued that the administration's insistance that the Venezuela operation was a law enforcement effort, with some military support, and not a military operation didn't ring true.
    


            “We're seizing its oil. We've got a military blockade,” said Kaine, “You know, this is, this is not a surgical arrest operation, by any stretch, and that means we got to declare where we are on it.”
    


            However, in a speech on the Senate floor earlier this week, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham countered that Trump did not need congressional consent or approval for capturing Maduro, calling the War Powers Act “patently unconstitutional,” and argued that Congress can push back on extended US involvement in Venezuela through its control over government funding.
    


Analysis: Congressional Republicans are running out of powers to give Trump



            “If you don't want any American boots on the ground, I think you could come forward and pass, through the appropriations process, a prohibition of funds to be used to have American ground forces in Venezuela,” he said. “What we can't do is substitute our judgment for the decision itself,” to use military force.
    


            Kaine also told reporters that senators would be forcing votes to block military action in other nations and territories mentioned by the administration in recent days, including Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Nigeria and Greenland.
    


            Paul said that behind closed doors he hasn't heard any Senate Republican argue that there is a military rationale for using force to capture Greenland, despite the administration refusing to rule it out.
    


            “On Greenland, I just have found no support, and I heard no support within our caucus for introducing troops into Greenland, taking military action, zero support. I've not heard of anybody in the hallways, in the gym, anywhere, I haven't heard one Republican go up to me and say, get it by military force. But I think that loose talk is not just not good, but it's also counterproductive,” he told reporters.
    


            Paul suggested that such points are not coming from senators, saying, “It's from you know, people like [senior White House aide] Stephen Miller, who also ruminated about getting rid of habeas corpus. So that kind of stuff is, should be condemned.”

            Jennifer Garner is fully aware that some people are impressed with how she successfully co-parents with her ex-husband Ben Affleck, but it's not because she read it in a tabloid.
    


            In a newly published interview with Marie Claire UK, the actress promoted the second series of her Apple hit thriller “The Last Thing He Told Me” and talked about the lessons the past decade taught her.
    


            One thing is that she “protects her peace by refusing to engage with tabloid coverage.”
    


            “It doesn't serve me to take in gossip about myself or anyone else, much less my kids, so I don't do it,” Garner said.
    


            She shares three children with Affleck: Violet born in 2005, Seraphina born in 2009, and Samuel born in 2012.
    


            The couple married in June 2005 and confirmed their split in 2015, a day after their 10th wedding anniversary. 



            More than 20 years later, they continue to make headlines whenever spotted together, including last year, a month after he settled his divorce with Jennifer Lopez and Affleck and Garner reunited for son Samuel's birthday party.
    


            Affleck is on the same page as Garner about tabloids.
    


            “We used to have a thing, my ex-wife and I, when they would see something on a supermarket stand,” he told GQ last year. “We would say, ‘Well, you know this isn't always true because if it were, you would have 15 brothers or sisters or whatever the number of stories is where they said that your mom was pregnant.'”
    


            While the former couple are in a good place now, that wasn't always the case.
    


            “You have to be smart about what you can and can't handle, and I could not handle what was out there,” she told Marie Claire UK.
    


            But what was out in the public sphere was not the most difficult part, Garner said.
    


            “The fact of it is what was hard,” she said. “The actual breaking up of a family is what was hard. Losing a true partnership and friendship is what was hard.”
    


            The new season of “The Last Thing He Told Me” is scheduled to drop on Apple TV+ on February 20.

            Protests fueled by crippling economic conditions have swept across Iran's provinces, as authorities revert to their tested playbook of cracking down without offering viable solutions to grievances driving public anger.
    


            Millions of Iranians are grappling with rampant inflation and a plummeting currency, as thousands took to the streets in demonstrations that turned violent after the deployment of government security forces.
    


            What began last month as organized protests in Tehran's bazaars and universities has gradually spread to cities nationwide. Experts said the leaderless and uncoordinated movement turned violent as economic protests intertwined with political ones.
    


            “This feels different because it's about the people's buying power and people really can't afford anything,” said a 30-year-old Tehran resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Prices keep going up almost hour-by-hour at this point, but how it ends no one really knows. … Everyone feels worried.”
    


            When shopkeepers in the narrow streets of Tehran's Grand Bazaar protested the government's failing economic policies last week, their chants rattled the regime.
    


            Exacerbating the situation, the central bank decision last week to end a program allowing some importers to access cheaper US dollars compared to the rest of the market – a decision that led shopkeepers to increase prices.
    


            Prices of basic goods like cooking oil and chicken dramatically spiked overnight and some products vanished all together. The volatility pushed the bazaaris to close shop, a drastic measure for a group traditionally supportive of the Islamic Republic.
    


            After days of protests and crackdown, the reformist-ruled government attempted to alleviate the pressure by offering direct cash handouts – almost $7 per month, saying at the same time that it alone cannot solve the crisis.
    


            “We should not expect the government to handle all of this alone,” President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a televised speech Monday.
    


            Iranian provinces as far west as Ilam, a Kurdish-majority region bordering Iraq, and Lorestan, have emerged as restive hotspots. Fueled by ethnic division and poverty, crowds set fire to the streets and chanted “Death to Khamenei,” directly challenging Iran's Supreme Leader, who holds ultimate authority over the nation's religious and state affairs.
    


            The city became a focal point this week after wounded protesters were taken to a hospital, only for security forces to subsequently raid the facility and arrest them in an incident that sparked widespread condemnation from human rights groups and prompted the government to promise an investigation.
    


            Iranian state affiliated Fars news agency said 950 police forces and 60 personnel from the paramilitary Basij force have been injured in the protests mostly in confrontations with “rioters” in western provinces “equipped with firearms, grenades, and weapons.”
    


            People in more than 100 cities have taken to the streets since demonstrations began 11 days ago, including the capital Tehran.
    


            At least 38 people have been killed and over 2,000 arrested in the ensuing crackdown, human rights organizations based outside Iran claimed. CNN could not independently verify the numbers of those killed and arrested, and Iranian state news organizations have sometimes reported individual deaths without reporting a comprehensive tally.
    


            The ongoing protests are the biggest since the large scale and deadly protests that were sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the religious police in 2022.
    


            This time, the bazaaris, a powerful force for change in Iran's history and one that is seen as loyal to the regime, began the protests.
    


            The enduring alliance between the bazaaris and the clergy in Iran had the shopkeepers play a crucial role as kingmaker across Iran's history. It was their support to those very clergymen that eventually helped the Islamic Revolution of 1979 succeed, giving the rebels a financial backbone that led to the fall of the Shah, or monarch.
    


            “For more than 100 years of Iranian history, bazaaris have been key actors in all of Iran's major political movements. … Many observers do believe that the bazaaris are some of the most loyal to the Islamic Republic,” said Arang Keshavarzian, associate professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies at New York University and author of “Bazaar and State in Iran,” told CNN.
    


            Their role as a major political force has since become more symbolic, but the impact of fluctuations in currency on their business is what led them to spark the protests that have since turned deadly.
    


            Authorities have also sought to differentiate between economic protesters and those calling for regime change, branding the latter as “rioters” and foreign backed “mercenaries” while pledging a tougher crackdown against them.
    


            The exiled son of Iran's former monarch, Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi has positioned himself as a viable alternative to the ruling regime, declaring support for the protests and issuing direct calls for coordinated nationwide action. Pro-monarchy chants have been heard in videos from the demonstrations, though the extent of monarchist support across the country remains unclear.
    


            The current protests also take place under rising foreign threats. Just six months ago, Israel and the United States launched attacks on Iran for the first time, with US President Donald Trump raising the prospects of new attacks just last week, just days after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            During his campaign, Pezeshkian positioned himself as a champion of the working class, promising economic relief through reduced government intervention in the currency market while also blaming US sanctions, corruption, and excessive money printing.
    


            But corruption across all parts of government, mismanagement of funds and the convergence of environmental problems and stagnant leadership has the government on the brink.
    


            More than a year after he was voted in, the very working class he vowed to protect and the middle class that form the backbone of the Iranian society, are struggling.
    


            External factors like crippling sanctions and a potential new war with the United States and Israel, has left the state paranoid, and the population anxious.
    


            The ongoing protest are the biggest public challenge to the regime since the 12-day war with Israel in June, and since Iranians demonstrated the killing of Mahsa Amini, the young woman who was arrested for not abiding by the dress code, the state now struggles to provide any tangible steps that could prevent an eventual complete dysfunction.
    


            Experts say that without a viable alternative to the current ruling system, protests are unlikely to instigate regime change, yet the widespread unrest underscores the profound crises confronting Iran's government.
    


            “None of Iran's political leaders have a blueprint to get Iran out the crises,” Keshavarzian told CNN.
    


            “The only tool that the Islamic Republic truly has left is coercion and force. People have tried different methods to air their views,” he added. “But over the past 15 years large segments of the population have lost trust in the regime and don't believe they are able and willing to actually listen to them and address their grievances and interests,” he said.

The ICE agent who fatally shot a woman during an altercation in Minneapolis in the US state of Minnesota on Wednesday was acting in self-defense, US President Donald Trump has said.

According to video of the incident, an immigration agent attempted to open the door of an SUV driven by Renee Good and fired multiple shots when she tried to drive away.

While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged that Good had attempted to ram ICE officers with the car, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey dismissed that version of events as “bullsh**t.”

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump backed ICE officers. “I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,” Trump wrote.

“The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” he added.

The president blamed the incident on members of the “radical left” targeting ICE agents. “We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!” he wrote.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told reporters that Good's vehicle was blocking a road when federal agents approached her. “The vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired,” he said.

Good's mother, Donna Ganger, denied that her daughter was involved in anti-ICE protests. “She was probably terrified,” Ganger told the Minnesota Star Tribune. “Renee was one of the kindest people I've ever known,” she said.

Trump launched a crackdown on illegal immigration after returning to the White House in January 2025, vowing to carry out the largest deportation effort in American history. Democrats have denounced ICE raids in US cities as an abuse of power and scapegoating of migrants.

BRUSSELS, January 8. /TASS/. Amid US President Donald Trump's increasingly harsh rhetoric about establishing control over Greenland, the European Union is preparing for a direct confrontation with the US leader, according to Politico Europe.

""We must be ready for a direct confrontation with Trump,"" an EU diplomat briefed on ongoing discussions told the newspaper. ""He is in an aggressive mode, and we need to be geared up,"" he added.

The newspaper notes that while European governments previously did not realize the seriousness of Trump's threats, they now understand them and are ""desperately searching for a plan to stop him.""

Trump has repeatedly stated that Greenland should join the US. He did not rule out the use of force to resolve the issue in an interview with NBC News in early May 2025.

On January 6, the White House, in a written statement provided to Reuters, commented on plans regarding Greenland, stressing that ""of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal,"" meaning it is available to Trump.

In turn, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified on January 7 that Trump is actively discussing the possibility of purchasing Greenland with his subordinates.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, January 8. /TASS/. Moscow calls on Washington to adhere to the rule of law and immediately cease illegal actions against the oil tanker Marinera, according to a statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry.

""We call on Washington to resume compliance with the fundamental norms and principles of international maritime navigation and immediately cease its illegal actions against the Marinera and other vessels engaged in law·abiding activities on the high seas,"" the ministry said.

""We reiterate our demand that the US ensure humane and dignified treatment of the Russian citizens comprising the tanker's crew, strictly observe their rights and interests, and make no obstacles to their prompt return to their homeland,"" the Foreign Ministry added.

 

US knew the owner

 

The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed ""serious concern"" over the US military's use of force against the oil tanker.

""The Marinera, which on December 24 received temporary permission to sail under the Russian flag in accordance with international law and Russian legislation, was peacefully transiting international waters in the North Atlantic, heading for one of Russia's ports,"" the ministry said. ""The US government has repeatedly received reliable information, including from the Russian Foreign Ministry, about the ship's Russian origin and its civilian status. They could not have had any doubts about this, just as there were and are no grounds for arguing that the tanker was sailing ‘without a flag' or ‘under a false flag.'""

""Russia did not give consent to these actions. On the contrary, it lodged an official protest with the US government regarding the pursuit of the Marinera by a US Coast Guard vessel over the past several weeks, insisting on the immediate cessation of these activities and the withdrawal of the unlawful demands made on the Russian ship's captain,"" the ministry said.

 

Violation of international law

 

Under these circumstances, US military personnel boarding a civilian vessel on the high seas and effectively seizing it, as well as capturing its crew, ""can only be viewed as a gross violation of the basic principles and norms of international maritime law and freedom of navigation.""

 

Illegal sanctions

 

Moscow considers the US references to its national ""sanctions legislation"" to be unfounded.

""Unilateral restrictive measures by the US, as well as other Western countries, are illegitimate and cannot justify attempts to establish jurisdiction and, even more so, to seize ships on the high seas,"" the ministry said. ""The statements by some US officials that the seizure of the Marinera is part of a broader strategy to establish Washington's unlimited control over Venezuela's natural resources are extremely cynical. We strongly reject such neo-colonialist tendencies,"" the ministry concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

NEW YORK, January 8. /TASS/. The United States is not attempting to steal Venezuelan oil and is only trying to control fuel sales and transactions, US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said.

""We are just controlling the marketing and the flow of funds in Venezuela so those funds can be used to better the conditions of the Venezuelan people and reduce the risks to the American people,"" he said. ""Well, we're not stealing anyone's oil.""

At the same time, Wright said that on the day of the US military operation in Venezuela he phoned the heads of three major oil companies to discuss prospects of their future work in the Bolivarian Republic.

In his words, companies are not yet ready to invest heavily in Venezuela.

""Are they going to put billions of dollars building new infrastructure in Venezuela next week? Of course not. You've got to have transformation of the conditions there. But they want to be productive advisors and helpers in that process,"" the US energy secretary said.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto said on January 3 that the United States had attacked civilian and military facilities in Caracas. He condemned Washington's actions as a military aggression. A state of emergency has been imposed in Venezuela. US President Donald Trump has confirmed the attack on Venezuela. According to the US leader, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife have been captures and taken out of the country. They were later brought to the United States and are held in a detention facility in Brooklyn, southern New York. On January 5, Maduro and his wife appeared before the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. US authorities accuse them of involvement in drug trafficking, allegations both defendants have denied.

Trump also claimed that the United States would assume interim governance of Venezuela. In addition, the US president expressed confidence that Washington would secure compensation from Caracas for US oil companies. Trump said Venezuela's interim government would be ""turning over"" between 30 and 50 million barrels of ""high quality"" oil to the US.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Jessica Plichta faces misdemeanor charges, which locals say is a tactic of Grand Rapids, Michigan, police to suppress protests

Jessica Plichta was arrested on 3 January after a live interview with a local news station about a Grand Rapids, Michigan, protest against the Trump administration's seizure of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela's president, in an attack with a reported death toll of 100. The clip went immediately viral, racking up millions of views across social media. While the headlines focused on Plichta's age (22) and that she's a preschool teacher, Plichta believes the reason for her arrest – seemingly the only one among roughly 200 protesters – went beyond the day's events.

Plichta, who recently co-founded local group Grand Rapids Opponents of War, which helped organize Saturday's protest, had visited the Venezuelan capital of Caracas just last month, amid the Trump administration's blockade. She was a part of a delegation to the International People's Assembly for Sovereignty and Peace of Our Americas. Activists from dozens of groups planned to attend. But after Trump ordered that Venezuelan airspace be “closed in its entirety” on 29 November, many canceled their trips.

Plichta still attended, visiting communes and meeting with activists there, and claims she even spoke with Maduro.

“I came back to the US, and I've done report-backs. I had spoken at that rally. I gave an interview, and immediately, during the interview, I get shut down and arrested out of 200 people. So what else can you say about that?” Plichta said.

Plichta is now facing misdemeanor charges of “obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command from a police officer”, according to local outlet 13 On Your Side. Emerson Wolf, co-director of Grand Rapids' Institute for Global Education and chair of Palestine Solidarity Grand Rapids, said this is an established tactic of Grand Rapids police to suppress local protests and protesters.

Last March, Wolf spoke at a local International Women's Day event; the next month, as they were preparing to lead the local Hands Off! protest, they were arrested with the same charge as Plichta over the previous action.

“If it's truly about the safety of people executing their sacred free speech rights in the streets of Grand Rapids, then why doesn't [the Grand Rapids police department] arrest protesters right away, or do more to help encourage the safety of protesters downtown? Instead, they issue citations months later in order to criminalize dissent,” said Wolf.

Amid yesterday's ICE killing of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, thousands have taken to the streets in cities across the US to demonstrate. “First, they arrest us on camera, and then they shoot us in the streets,” Wolf said of protesters. “This is unacceptable. We're living in a nightmare right now, and it's time for us to be escalating against this sort of brutality.”

Wolf said they had been following the anti-war movement since they were a teenager during the Iraq war; Plichta has been organizing for about two years. Both feel strongly that the Trump administration's actions in Venezuela were a five-alarm fire for international politics writ large.

“We do not want war. We do not want the US to escalate its attacks on Venezuela. We don't want our friends and family to have to fight a rich man's war for oil,” Plichta said.

Despite attempts at protest suppression across the US under the Trump administration, Plichta is undeterred. “I've seen a comment [that] ‘there's now going to be 1,000 Jessicas with this'. It's not about me or my name,” Plichta said. “So many people are going to be coming out more and more.

Emmanuel Macron's comments come as Germany's president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, warns against turning world into ‘robber's den'

Europe live – latest updates

The presidents of France and Germany have sharply condemned US foreign policy under Donald Trump, saying respectively that Washington was “breaking free from international rules” and the world risked turning into a “robber's den”.

In unusually strong and apparently uncoordinated remarks, Emmanuel Macron and Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned the postwar rules-based international order could soon disintegrate.

“The US is an established power, but one that is gradually turning away from some of its allies and breaking free from the international rules that it was until recently promoting,” Macron told France's diplomatic corps at the Élysée Palace on Thursday.

“Multilateral institutions are functioning less and less effectively,” the French president said. “We are living in a world of great powers, with a real temptation to divide up the world.”

He said France “rejects the new colonialism and new imperialism – but also vassalage and defeatism. What we have achieved for France and in Europe is a step in the right direction. Greater strategic autonomy, less dependence on the US and China.”

The comments came as EU leaders – torn between the needs to defend international law and to keep the US onboard as a vital economic partner and defence ally in Ukraine and beyond – struggle to agree a coordinated response to Washington's actions.

While neither president said so directly, both were widely presumed to be referring to last weekend's US raid on Caracas and capture of the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, and to Trump's repeatedly stated aim of taking control of Greenland.

The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said on Thursday that the bloc was weighing its response if US plans to acquire Greenland materialise. “The messages we hear are extremely concerning,” she said. “If this is a real threat ... then what would be our response?”

Nato ambassadors in Brussels also held a discussion about the Arctic territory, where they reportedly agreed the alliance should strengthen Arctic security. “No drama,” a senior Nato diplomat told Reuters. “Lots of agreement that Nato needs to accelerate its development of [a] stronger deterrence presence in the region.”

Specific steps remain undecided, though some nations suggested modelling efforts on Nato's eastern flank missions, Baltic Sentry and Eastern Sentry, which use flexible multinational deployments and advanced tech such as drones and sensors to monitor land and sea.

Steinmeier, speaking on Wednesday night at a symposium in Berlin to mark his 70th birthday, said global democracy was at risk. The former German foreign minister said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a watershed, but subsequent US behaviour marked a second “epochal rupture”.

There had been a “breakdown of values by our most important partner, the US, which helped build this world order”, said the president, whose role is largely ceremonial. “It is about preventing the world from turning into a robber's den, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want.”

Steinmeier said the erosion of the world order had already reached an advanced stage. Smaller, weaker states risked becoming “completely defenceless”, and entire regions could be treated “as the property of a few great powers”.

He said European security policy needed to be revised as a consequence. “We must not be weak,” he said, adding that Germany could only play a role “if we are taken seriously, also militarily”, so this was “the goal we have to achieve”.

Macron in his speech also stressed the importance of safeguarding academic independence and “a controlled information space, where opinions can be exchanged completely freely, but where choices are not made by the algorithms of a few”.

He said the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which covers competition, and the Digital Services Act (DSA) on content moderation – which the US has denounced as an attempt to “coerce” its tech companies into censorship – “must be defended”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

PHILIPPINES

Eruptions force evacuations

A series of eruptions at the nation's most active volcano has prompted the evacuation of nearly 3,000 people from a danger zone on its foothills, officials said on Wednesday. Authorities raised the five-stage alert around Mayon Volcano in the northeastern province of Albay to Level 3 on Tuesday after detecting intermittent rockfalls from its peak crater along with pyroclastic flows — an avalanche of super-hot rock fragments, ash and gas. “This is already an eruption, a quiet one, with lava accumulating up the peak and swelling the dome, which cracked in some parts and resulted in rockfalls, some as big as cars,” said Teresito Bacolcol, the country's chief volcanologist. It was too early to tell if Mayon's restiveness would worsen, and lead to a major and violent eruption given the absence of other key signs of unrest, such as a spike in volcanic earthquakes and high levels of sulfur dioxide emissions, Bacolcol said. Troops, police and disaster-mitigation personnel helped evacuate more than 2,800 people from 729 households inside a 6km radius from the volcano's crater that officials have long designated as a permanent danger zone, demarcated by concrete warning signs, Albay provincial officials said. Another 600 people living outside the permanent danger zone evacuated voluntarily to government-run emergency shelters to be safely away from the volcano, said Claudio Yucot, regional director of the Office of Civil Defense.

Penguin diplomacy deployed

President Lee Jae-myung on Wednesday portrayed himself and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as a pair of affectionate penguins in a social media post urging Kim to meet with him. Lee wrote on X that he hoped for the day that “the abnormal state of turmoil and hostility on the Korean Peninsula will be overcome.” The Korean-language post said: “Go meet, Po Jae-myung and Po Jong-un,” a reference to Pororo the Little Penguin, a popular children's animation featuring penguin characters. One of the South's most successful animated series, the program's creators outsourced some work in its initial production phase to North Korean studios in the early 2000s.

Trump exits UNFCCC

President Donald Trump is withdrawing the nation from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of a sweeping exit from collective global action, the White House said on Wednesday. Sixty-six global organizations and treaties — about half of them affiliated with the UN — were listed in a White House memorandum as “contrary to the interests of the United States,” including the UNFCCC, the parent treaty underpinning all major international climate agreements.

Somalian aid halted

Department of State officials on Wednesday rebuked Somalia's leaders over reports of food aid theft, and paused “all ongoing US assistance programs” to its government, the department wrote on X. Noting its “zero-tolerance policy” for waste or theft, the Undersecretary for Foreign Assistance, Humanitarian Affairs and Religious Freedom wrote that it had received reports Somalian officials “destroyed a US-funded World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse and illegally seized 76 metric tons of donor-funded food aid for vulnerable Somalis.” Any future aid would be dependent on the Somalian Federal Government taking accountability and remediating the matter, it said.

Cambodia's government on Wednesday said that it had arrested and extradited to China a tycoon who has been accused of running a huge online scam operation.

The Cambodian Ministry of the Interior said that Prince Holding Group chairman Chen Zhi (陳志) and two other Chinese citizens were arrested and extradited on Tuesday at the request of Chinese authorities.

Chen formerly had dual nationality, but his Cambodian citizenship was revoked last month, the ministry said.

US prosecutors in October last year brought conspiracy charges against Chen, alleging that he had been the mastermind behind a multinational cyberfraud network, used his other businesses to launder its profits and sanctioned violence against workers.

Prince Holding Group had claimed to be getting US$30 million a day from the scams, the indictment said.

The US Department of the Treasury and the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office imposed sanctions, while authorities also seized Chen's assets, which included properties worth at least US$100 million and US$14 billion in cryptocurrency.

Scam centers have proliferated across Southeast Asia, swindling money by persuading people to join bogus investment schemes.

According to estimates from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, scam victims worldwide lost between US$18 billion and US$37 billion in 2023.

The US and the UK imposed sanctions against Chen, 38, and his companies' legitimate involvements, which were primarily involved in real-estate development and financial services.

US authorities also seized what they said was an estimated US$14 billion in bitcoin linked to Chen or his operations.

They have charged him with wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies.

He has been accused of sanctioning violence against workers, authorizing bribes to foreign officials and using his other businesses, such as online gambling and cryptocurrency mining, to launder illicit profits.

Prosecutors in the US said that his organization scammed 250 Americans out of millions of dollars, with one losing US$400,000 in cryptocurrency.

In 2024, Americans lost at least US$10 billion to Southeast Asia-based scams, treasury department data showed.

British authorities froze Chen's British businesses and assets, including a 12 million euro (US$14 million) mansion and a 100 million euro office building in London.

Other authorities followed. Singapore launched an investigation on Oct. 30 last year after announcing the seizure of financial assets belonging to Chen of more than S$150 million (US$117 million) and a yacht.

In Taiwan, police seized 26 luxury vehicles, including a Ferrari, a Bugatti and a Porsche, while Hong Kong police seized financial assets.

All three authorities launched investigations into Chen.

However, Chen was prepared to fight, issuing a statement via lawyers in November last year, that “the Prince Group categorically rejects the notion that it or its chairman has engaged in any unlawful activity.”

Zelensky quips on Chechen leader after US capture of Maduro","https://kyivindependent.com/maduro-worked-why-not-kadyrov-zelensky-quips-that-additional-pressure-will-make-putin-think-twice/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 04:46:14 GMT","

President Volodymyr Zelensky urged additional pressure from the United States on Jan. 7 to help achieve a peace deal in Ukraine in the coming months, jokingly evoking calls for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov to suffer the same fate as captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

""(The Americans) must put pressure on Russia. They have the tools; they know how to do it. And when they really want to, they can find a way,"" Zelensky told reporters.

""Here is an example with Maduro, right? They carried out an operation... Everyone sees the result — the whole world. They did it quickly. Let them carry out some kind of operation with this — what's his name — Kadyrov. With this murderer. Maybe then (Russian President) Putin will see it and think twice,"" Zelensky joked.

Zelensky's quip comes just days after the U.S. carried out a large-scale attack on Venezuela, an ally of Moscow, with the stated goals of effecting regime change and seizing control of the country's oil reserves. Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife were captured and brought to the U.S., where they have been indicted on narcoterrorism conspiracy and other charges.

Kadyrov, a ruthless strongman who has referred to himself as ""Putin's foot soldier"" has ruled the pro-Kremlin Chechen Republic since 2007. Under his leadership, the Chechnya has become known as one of the most dangerous parts of the world, infamous for forced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings.

The U.S. and other Western allies have imposed sanctions against Kadyrov and his family over human rights abuses in Chechnya.

The comments come as U.S.-led peace talks continue to unfold despite increased tensions between Russia and the U.S., sharpened by Washington's military operation in Venezuela, Moscow's ally, and Russia's refusal to cease hostilities in Ukraine.

Zelensky said earlier in the day that peace ""negotiations have reached a new milestone together with our European partners and, of course, the United States,"" sharing his belief that Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine could be brought to an end in the first half of 2026.

U.S. President Donald Trump proposed on Jan. 7 raising the 2027 defense budget from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion to build a ""dream military.""

""This will allow us to build the 'Dream Military' that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us safe and secure, regardless of foe,"" Trump said on Truth Social.

The news follows Trump's signing of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2026 on Dec. 18, which set a record $901 billion for military spending.

The decision came after ""long and difficult negotiations"" with senators, congressmen, cabinet members, and other U.S. politicians, Trump said.

The president added that raising the defense budget is necessary for the good of the country, especially ""in these very troubled and dangerous times.""

According to Trump, the increase in the military budget was allegedly made possible by U.S. revenues from tariffs, which he broadly implemented over the past year.

Any increase in the military budget would require approval from the U.S. Congress.

The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2026 calls for $800 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine — $400 million in each of 2026 and 2027 — under the Security Assistance Initiative, which funds the purchase of American weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces.

The 2026 U.S. defense budget includes provisions to bolster European security, deploy 28,500 troops to South Korea, and fully fund the Taiwan Security Initiative at $1 billion.

Russia sent bombers to Venezuela to support Maduro not too long ago, but now the Kremlin has stood by and watched as the US arrested the disputed leader. What does the US surprise attack mean for the war in Ukraine?

Nicolas Maduro showered Vladimir Putin with praise during his visit to Moscow on Victory Day in May 2025. The Venezuelan leader described Russia as ""a key power of humanity,"" and the two heads of state signed a cooperation agreement.

But on January 3, Russia stood back and watched as the US forcibly brought Maduro and his wife to New York, where they are being tried for drug trafficking.

Three days after the fall of the Venezuelan president, Putin remained silent. The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its concern and called for Maduro's release and negotiations between the US and Venezuela. According to official reports, after a phone call in early December, Maduro received a New Year's greeting from the Russian president.

Maduro was one of the few heads of state who supported Russia in February 2022 when Moscow recognized the separatist pseudo-republics of Donetsk and Luhansk before launching its major attack on Ukraine.

In December 2018, Russia sent two Tu-160 strategic bombers to Venezuela for exercises, which experts interpreted as a sign of support for Maduro. They landed at Caracas airport — the same airport used by the US to fly out the Venezuelan leader in handcuffs.

But Russian air defenses were unable to protect the disputed leader during last week's operation, as US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has pointed out.

""Russia's support for Venezuela has been more symbolic than practical,"" Neil Melvin, an expert at the Royal United Services Institute, told DW. In his view, Russia is not in a position to challenge the deployment of US forces in the neighboring region.

Felix Riefer, a German political scientist and author of a book on Russian foreign policy, also said he was not surprised by Putin's response. After Trump's return to the White House led to a rapprochement between Moscow and Washington, Russia responded to ""American hints toward Venezuela with relative restraint,"" he said. ""Russia had already abandoned Maduro.""

Both experts said a key explanation for Putin's silence is Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and the US shift from being Kyiv's partner to acting as a mediator in talks. Russia is keen to avoid harsh criticism of Washington because it does not want to cause offense, according to Melvin. In his opinion, Moscow's rhetoric on the events in Venezuela would be ""significantly harsher"" if it weren't for the war against Ukraine.

The British expert saw no immediate consequences for the war in Ukraine. This could change if Trump does not stop at Venezuela but goes further and, for example, attempts to annex Greenland, which belongs to Denmark — something the US president recently hinted at again.

Melvin believes that NATO would probably not survive such a development. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed a similar view on Monday. 

Kyiv, meanwhile, is keeping close tabs on events in Venezuela. ""If dictators can be treated this way, then the United States knows what to do next,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry reiterated that it does not recognize Maduro as president.

Experts in Kyiv are cautiously optimistic. Markets expect relations between the US and Venezuela to normalize in the foreseeable future, which will open Venezuela up for oil production and have a significant impact on the global economy and oil prices, said political scientist Petro Oleshchuk of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.

""Anything that lowers oil prices is beneficial for Ukraine and could have a positive impact on negotiations. The cheaper oil is, the less money Russia has at its disposal, making the idea that Russia is prepared for an endless war seem less and less credible,"" Oleshchuk said.

Some media outlets have suggested the US could weaken its role as a democratic negotiating partner by arresting Maduro. However, experts interviewed by DW are skeptical. According to Oleshchuk, the US military's intervention is in line with the US doctrine of the Western Hemisphere as a sphere of interest. He noted that it's impossible to draw parallels between Maduro's arrest and Russia's aggression against Ukraine.

""In the case of Venezuela, the US is not annexing territory and is not claiming that Venezuela is a fictitious state,"" he said.

Political scientist Riefer said Russia could try to use the case of Venezuela to justify its aggression against Ukraine. While this is a possible outcome, ""a direct comparison is flawed,"" he said. 

Riefer is convinced Moscow's reputation in the world has been weakened, saying ""those who rely on Russia cannot hope to be protected."" 

Melvin, meanwhile, emphasized that this is not the first time that Putin has let an ally go. ""Russia has lost Armenia, Syria and now Venezuela,"" he said. ""Russia's international position is weakening noticeably as it escalates its war against Ukraine and lacks the resources to maintain such relationships.""

In the case of Cuba, Russia's most important partner in Latin America and one of Venezuela's closest allies, Moscow's protests may be louder, added Melvin, but Russia's options are ultimately ""very limited."" Cuba has been among the countries that were recently verbally attacked by Trump.

CDU cancels weekend conference because of Storm Elli

Welcome to our roundup of news in Germany on Thursday, January 8.

A kitten put the saying ""cats have nine lives"" to the test early on in its young life, after surviving nearly a week hidden in the back of a lorry that travelled from Turkey to Germany.

Germany's customs office said that police heard loud meowing coming from the lorry during a routine check near the southern German city of Würzburg.

Customs officials discovered the exhausted kitten in a space in the vehicle laden with machine parts.

The kitten — believed to be around 3 months old — was taken to an animal shelter and is reported to be doing well.

Once fully recovered and vaccinated, it will be allowed to be rehomed in Germany.

Parts of the River Spree's surface in Berlin iced over on Thursday, as snow covered the German capital.

Berlin is famed for regularly enduring some of the harshest winters anywhere in the country, excluding the mountainous areas in Bavaria.

The city's BER airport warned on Thursday that it anticipated considerable disruptions, particularly if conditions worsened on Friday as forecast. 

""We anticipate that there will be severe delays to services in the event of the massive snowfalls currently forecast in much of Europe starting on Friday,"" the airport said in a statement. This could lead to delays and flight cancellations, it said. 

BER said that it had 60 winter service vehicles in service and that it was bringing in additional staff. 

Rail operator Deutsche Bahn said it wanted to cancel some services in advance, and also that it planned for trains to operate at slower speeds as a precaution. It warned passengers to be prepared for potentially long delays. 

DIY stores like Obi, Bauhaus and Hornbach also warned of shortages in some stores of salt, grit and other material designed to help clear ice. Under German law, houseowners or tenants are liable for keeping the sidewalks outside their residences safe for pedestrians. This is known locally as the Räumpflicht, or ""clearing duty.""

Police in Reutlingen in southwestern Germany say three people have died in an apartment collapse after a suspected gas explosion in Albstadt. 

A 33-year-old man, his 30-year-old wife and their 6-year-old child were all killed as a result of the blast, which took place at around 5 a.m., police said in a statement. 

""Several surrounding buildings were damaged, some seriously, by the detonation,"" police said, adding that based on current information, residents of the nearby buildings had not been injured. 

Fire services, rescue workers and police were on site in large numbers, with some local streets in the Tailfingen district of Albstadt closed because of the response. 

""Investigations into the cause continue,"" police said. A fire service spokesman said the blast was a gas explosion. 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrat Union (CDU) has canceled its first big party meeting due to severe weather brought by Storm Elli.

The annual CDU meeting had been scheduled to begin on Friday.

""Due to the severe weather warnings and the associated dangers, as well as the announced train and flight cancellations, we unfortunately feel compelled to cancel our annual kick-off meeting this coming Friday and Saturday,"" the CDU spokeswoman said.

The CDU was planning to hold closed-door meetings at a hotel in Mainz, near Frankfurt.

But the German Weather Service (DWD) has forecast snowstorms overnight in central and eastern parts of the country.

The country's rail operator Deutsche Bahn has also cautioned passengers to expect delays and cancellations on long-distance services, while those traveling by car have been asked not to embark on lengthy journeys.

Around 350 participants and some 100 media representatives had been expected to attend the CDU talks.

The party's executive committee will still meet virtually.

An elderly man has succumbed to his injuries in hospital in the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg after being hit by a snowplow. 

Police said that the 86-year-old was on a sidewalk in Villingendorf when he was struck. The snowplow driver was moving to rejoin the roads after clearing a local car park. 

He was taken to hospital with serious injuries and died on Wednesday evening. Prosecutors tasked an appraiser with evaluating the accident.

German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has said the government will continue its ""tough course"" on asylum and repatriation in 2026, after initial asylum applications halved in 2025 compared to the previous year, at 113,236 new applications. 

""We have set out on course to implement a new collective European asylum system,"" Dobrindt told DW's Rosalia Romaniec on the sidelines of his Bavarian CSU party's conference this week in Seeon. 

""This will happen this year,"" he said. ""We have together agreed that we will set up repatriation centers, that we want to organize so-called ""Return Hubs"" in third countries. This is a challenging task. But we created the legal framework to do it in December. And that means that we want to open up this option in 2026."" 

Asked which third countries might be considered, Dobrindt said only that a group of EU member states was currently trying to decide on this.

He also said that he hoped individual national governments could reach a consensus, ""because we do not want to leave this question to the European Commission."" 

""There is a group of like-minded countries that want to organize this now,"" he said. ""And this group will agree within the coming weeks on which country outside the EU to go into talks with first.""



Dobrindt said he also anticipated a reduction in asylum applications from Ukraine in 2026, one of the more common source countries in recent years since Russia's 2022 invasion. He said that the reduction would be because of legal changes in Germany and likely changes from the government in Kyiv.

A Hamburg youth service worker took the stand in the high-profile trial concerning the abduction of two of the children of steak restaurant chain heiress Christina Block. 

The youth service worker told the court that she was not aware of any allegations of violence against Block. 

""No accusations had been raised with me beforehand,"" the 43-year-old said in court. 

The heiress of the ""Block House"" restaurant chain was in a long-running custody dispute with the children's father, Stephan Hensel, who failed to return the couple's two youngest children, then aged 10 and 13, after a planned visit to his residence in Denmark. Hensel justified keeping the children by accusing Block of violence against them.

""The situation was established from one day to the next,"" the youth worker told the court on Thursday in the northern city of Hamburg. 

Block stands accused of tasking an Israeli private security company with abducting the children and bringing them back to Germany. She denies this and says the company acted on its own initiative on New Year's Eve of 2023/24 without explicit instructions from her. 

The children currently reside in Denmark after a Danish court ruled they should be returned to the father at least pending the resolution of legal proceedings in Germany.

The German fashion delivery service Zalando is closing its logistics center in the eastern city of Erfurt, which employs roughly 2,700 people. 

The company announced the move at its Berlin headquarters on Thursday. It said that it was in the process of informing employees about the plans. 

Zalando said the reason for the closure was the reorganization of the company's European logistics network in the aftermath of its takeover of another online fashion retailer, About You, last year. 

The Erfurt offices would close by the end of the year, with operations continuing broadly unchanged until then, Zalando said. The offices had opened in 2012 and is the only one of its kind in eastern Germany, according to Zalando press spokesman Christian Schmidt. 

Zalando also operates larger logistics centers in Giessen, to the north of Frankfurt, in Lahr in the Black Forest in the southwest, and in Mönchengladbach in the west, near the Dutch border. In total, the company foresees retaining 14 logistics centers of various sizes in seven German states after the reorganization.

The DWD German Weather Service is warning of extreme weather conditions in much of the country on Friday, with red snow warnings already in place for the north of the country around Hamburg. 

It anticipates snowfalls to start in earnest by the evening. 

""Fresh snowfalls in the evening the night into Friday arriving from the southwest, progressing northeast rapidly and later transitioning into rain in the west and south,"" the DWD forecasts in its national status report from 10:30 a.m. CET (0930 GMT/UTC). ""New snowfalls of between 3 and 10 centimeters from the northwest via the central regions and through to Bavaria [in the south], and up to 15 centimeters within nine to 12 hours in flashpoints."" 

The DWD also warns of the potential for freezing rains and black ice build-up overnight, particularly in the west and south as snows turn to rain.

Police in Hamburg in northern Germany closed a major bridge in the city center connecting the A7 highway and the island of Wilhelmsburg. 

""The Köhlbrandbridge is currently closed in both directions because of the heavy snowfall and the ice,"" police said online, also asking drivers to avoid the area where possible. 

Around an hour later, it was possible to reopen the busy bridge, which is typically used by tens of thousands of vehicles on weekdays.

In a more general appeal, police asked anyone on the road to drive particularly carefully and allow extra time for journeys.

Germany's DWD weather service forecasts between 3 and 6 centimeters (1 to 2 inches) of fresh snow in the Hamburg area on Thursday morning, and forecasts heavier snows of up to 10 centimeters for Friday.

The northern port city is expected to bear the initial brunt of the arrival of the ""Elli"" storm front. 

Hamburg authorities asked the city's state schools to prepare for a closed snow day on Friday.

The city politician in charge of schools, Thorsten Altenburg-Hack, called for children from the first to sixth grades to be issued either with learning materials for use at home, or potentially with online classes. He also called for the organization of emergency full-day care for children who could not stay home. 

Children in the seventh to 13th grades should be provided online classes or exercises. Exams would be delayed or canceled. Authorities said they would advise on Monday's school status by Friday morning.

There are roughly 273,000 school-age children in Hamburg, the vast majority of them in state schools.

Around 50 sheep wandered into a Penny supermarket in the small Bavarian town of Burgsinn, the retailer said.

The sheep lingered among the shelves and checkout area for about 20 minutes, after they had strayed from their flock before entering the store on Monday. It is unclear how the sheep broke loose. 

Penny said the supermarket was cleaned after the incident and it does not plan to seek compensation from the farmer.

Germany has deported a convicted Syrian criminal to his home country, authorities said on Wednesday.

This is the second such case since the ousting of former President Bashar Assad in December 2024.

The 32-year-old man, who had been serving a prison sentence in Saxony-Anhalt after being convicted in 2020 of drug offences and assault, was returned to Syria on Tuesday, an Interior Ministry spokesperson told Bild newspaper.

""Another Syrian criminal was returned to Syria today on a scheduled flight,"" the spokesperson said.

The Syrian deportee had multiple convictions for violence and drug-related offences.

The first post-Assad deportation took place shortly before Christmas, when a Syrian man convicted of aggravated robbery, assault and extortion was returned from Gelsenkirchen in western Germany.

Germany suspended deportations to Syria in 2011 after the outbreak of civil war.

Following Assad's removal, the conservative-led government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to resume deportations to Syria and Afghanistan, starting with convicted criminals.

Berlin mayor Kai Wegner drew criticism after admitting to journalists he played tennis on the first day of the city's largest blackout in decades, as tens of thousands were left without power, heating and phone service.

The outage that began last Saturday was caused by an arson attack on a cable bridge in the city's southwest. It initially cut electricity to 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses, with some 100,000 residents left without heat as temperatures hovered below freezing.

Power was fully restored over five days, making it the longest blackout in Berlin's postwar history. 

Wegner, a member of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said he played tennis for an hour Saturday with his partner, Berlin Senator Katharina Günther-Wünsch, around five hours after the blackout began. He said he needed time to ""clear his head"" after taking phone calls, and remained reachable.

Read our full story on Wegner's criticism here.

Guten Tag from Bonn! 

After power was restored in southwest Berlin following an arson attack, the city's mayor is under pressure after he admitted playing tennis for an hour on the first day of the blackout. 

It was the German capital's worst blackout in decades. Wegner's conservative party in Berlin will hold a special phone conference to discuss the blackout response. 

And also Thursday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will address the party conference of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, on policy platforms for 2026, with numerous state and local elections on the horizon. ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

US forces encountered little resistance from Venezuela's military when they captured Nicolas Maduro, the country's leader, in a surprise nighttime raid. The attack has exposed the massive power discrepancy between the two countries.

The US raid on Caracas captured Venezuela's leader, Nicolas Maduro, and signaled zero tolerance for resistance. Dozens of strikes killed at least 80, officials have said, with no US casualties.

Despite Venezuela's large force on paper, experts cite outdated Russian gear and economic strain. The US, though smaller in numbers, fields advanced assets like the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and F-35s stealth fighter jets.

The family of a woman shot and killed by an immigration agent in Minneapolis say she was “murdered”.

Renee Nicole Good, 37, was shot dead by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who claimed she was “blocking the street” with her car while they carried out an operation in Minnesota city on Wednesday.

A video of the incident posted online showed a burgundy SUV stopped in the middle of the road as someone off camera shouted at agents to “get the f--- out of our neighbourhood”.

As one agent tried to open the door, Good drove the car forward. At the same time, another agent who stepped out of the way of the vehicle fired three shots towards the driver's window.

Good, a poet and mother of three, was married to a woman named Becca Good at the time of her death.

She had previously been married to Timmy Ray Macklin Jr, who died in 2023 at the age of 36.

Speaking to The Telegraph, her former father-in-law Timmy Ray Macklin Sr, said he believed she had been “murdered” by ICE agents.

“It is horrible, it's murder. Everybody is terribly shocked right now,” he said. “She was a good, outgoing person. I didn't agree with a lot of her ways, but it's really sad to see these things happen.”

Good and her former husband had a child, aged six, who she would bring to see his grandparents “a couple of times a year”, he added.

“My main concern right now is getting my grandchild,” he said.

Donna Ganger, her mother, described Good as “an amazing human being” and “one of the kindest people I've ever known” in a tribute to the Minnesota Star Tribune.

“She was extremely compassionate. She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate,” she added.

Good described herself as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” from Colorado who was “experiencing Minneapolis” in her apparent Instagram profile.

Minnesotans gathered to protest, arguing Good had been killed by federal agents without cause.

Donald Trump claimed that Good “violently, wilfully and viciously ran over the ICE officer”.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, later claimed she was a domestic terrorist.

“The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, wilfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defence,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.”

Jacob Frey, the city's mayor, rejected claims that the agent had acted in self-defence.

“Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly – that is bulls---,” he said of the claim.

He added: “They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. I have a message for ICE: get the f--- out of Minneapolis.

“They're ripping families apart. They're sowing chaos on our streets and in this case quite literally killing people.”

Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, accused the Trump administration of “governing by reality TV”.

When responding to claims from the department of homeland security that the deceased woman had “weaponised her vehicle”, Mr Walz said: “Don't believe this propaganda machine.”

He added: “The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.”

Rob Crilly

In the hours after the shooting, a large crowd began to gather at the site of the incident, which is less than a mile from the scene where George Floyd was murdered.

Crowds were heard chanting “shame, shame, shame” and “ICE out of Minnesota” as they demanded the agency leave the city.

Protesters later gathered outside a courthouse where they banged and smashed windows.

			Seizure of sanctioned vessels in the Atlantic is latest example of American military dominance

Almost three weeks after escaping US authorities in the Caribbean, the crew of the Marinera realised they had nowhere left to run.

Army helicopters were hovering over the steel-grey surface of the North Atlantic. Looming out of the fog, they could make out the hulking Legend-class warship with the red stripe of the US Coast Guard. American forces were closing in.

The Marinera, allegedly one of a “dark fleet” of tankers used to evade oil sanctions, had covered thousands of miles since fleeing a US naval blockade of Venezuela in mid-December.

Just hours earlier on Wednesday, US forces had seized another sanctioned vessel in the Caribbean, releasing footage of armed troops rappelling onto its deck and seizing control.

“The world's criminals are on notice. You can run, but you can't hide,” declared Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary.

The Marinera embarked on its desperate escape on Dec 17 after shaking off US forces assembled off the coast of Venezuela, where it had been due to collect a shipment of crude oil, and repelled a boarding attempt by the Coast Guard.

It changed its name from the Bella 1 to the Marinera, and its registration from Guyana to Russia by hastily painting a Russian flag on its hull: the nautical equivalent of claiming asylum.

Moscow issued a diplomatic request for Washington to halt its pursuit and sent a submarine escort for the tanker, which was thought to be making a break for the port of Murmansk.

Both were ignored.

American and British forces had been keeping the vessel under close surveillance. The USCGC Munro, a formidable Coast Guard warship, has been pursuing the Marinera for weeks.

One photo released by US European Command on Wednesday shows a Coast Guard officer surveying their target from a short distance through binoculars.

“The heroic crew of the USCGC Munro pursued this vessel across the high seas and through treacherous storms – keeping diligent watch, and protecting our country,” Ms Noem said.

RAF surveillance planes also monitored the Marinera's passage in the waters between Iceland and Scotland, where it had been heading north-east before making a sharp turn towards Britain.

By Wednesday morning, the US was ready to move in and end the game of cat and mouse. US Navy Seals were flown onto the vessel by the elite “Night Stalkers” aviation unit and quickly commandeered the tanker, officials said.

They appeared to have piloted on light helicopters known as AH/MH-6 Little Birds which would likely have taken off from the USCGC Munro, Col Mark Cancian, a former marine and Pentagon official, told The Telegraph.

Officials have yet to reveal further details of the operation, but Col Cancian said it would have been relatively straightforward.

A dozen or so troops would have boarded via helicopter before taking over the tanker's bridge and engine. “They tell the captain what to do, and the captain does it,” he said.

Around 12pm local time, US forces seized control of the Marinera, whose crew reportedly did not offer any resistance. Moscow, which had been communicating with the vessel, quickly lost contact.

The US also deployed a P-8 Poseidon “sub-hunter” aircraft, equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance capabilities and a fearsome array of harpoons and missiles, in addition to “Ghostrider” gunships.

If it felt like overkill, then that was the point. Donald Trump, the US president, is determined to stake the US' claim to Venezuela under his “Donroe Doctrine” policy and has taken an uncompromising stance on attempts to skirt its sanctions regime.

“We're going to keep the oil,” the president said on Tuesday.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said the crew of the Marinera, which she called a Venezuelan rather than a Russian tanker, would face prosecution for seeking to evade US sanctions.

Some 4,000 miles away, US forces intercepted another sanctioned oil tanker in the Caribbean, bringing the tally of captured vessels up to four, following the apprehension of the Skipper and the Centuries in December.

Under the cover of darkness on Wednesday, hours before the Coast Guard finally brought the Marinera's long journey to an end, troops descended from what appeared to be H-60 military helicopters onto the Sophia.

Black-and-white footage shows six soldiers rappelling down onto the vessel and making their way stealthily up the deck, moving from cover to cover.

Troops who landed from a second helicopter, who from close-up shots appear to be heavily armed, can be seen making their way up a stairwell and taking up positions on platforms on the tanker's deckhouse.

It was swiftly taken over “without incident”, according to US Southern Command.

Just days after US special forces seized Nicolas Maduro, the former Venezuelan leader, and bundled him into a helicopter, it was another demonstration of American military dominance.

British forces helped the US seize a sanctioned oil tanker heading to a Russian port in a direct challenge to Vladimir Putin.

UK spy planes and ships supported the US Coast Guard and special forces to take control of the Russian-flagged Marinera vessel, which was in Icelandic waters.

The USCGC Munro pursued the tanker, previously named Bella 1, for two weeks before it was captured.

With Russian military assets in the vicinity, including a submarine, the operation risked bringing British and American forces into direct confrontation with Moscow in the North Atlantic.

On Wednesday, Russia's transport ministry confirmed that all contact with the vessel had been lost and condemned its seizure as a “violation of international law”.

The US operation suggests an emboldened Donald Trump is ready to confront Russian interests after repeatedly offering concessions to Putin in the pursuit of peace in Ukraine.

Two British officials denied early reports that the Marinera was on its way to the UK. One said the tanker was under the control of US authorities and was being sailed to American waters.

The US European Command said the sanctioned vessel had defied a US naval blockade of Venezuela.

Washington later announced a separate seizure of the MT Sophia tanker on the other side of the Atlantic, which it said was “conducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea”.

The seizures of the vessels on Wednesday are one prong of Mr Trump's plan to control Venezuelan oil. A day earlier, he said Caracas and Washington had reached a deal to export up to $2bn (£1.48bn) of Venezuelan crude oil to the US.

Chris Wright, his energy secretary, explained how it would work, with cash from sales deposited into a US-controlled account and used for the benefit of the Venezuelan people.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, told reporters that Venezuela's interim authorities had asked that oil on one of the seized vessels be included in the deal. He also denied accusations that the administration had become rudderless after White House insiders told The Telegraph that Mr Trump did not have a plan for the next steps in Venezuela.

John Healey, Britain's Defence Secretary, said the Russian tanker was seized as part of “global efforts” to take a tougher approach to those evading sanctions.

RAF aircraft were involved in the operation and UK airbases were used as launchpads for US military aircraft. A Poseidon MRA1, an RAF maritime patrol aircraft, was tracked flying over the North Atlantic before “going dark” and turning off its transponder.

“UK Armed Forces provided pre-planned operational support, including basing, to US military assets interdicting the Bella 1 in the UK-Iceland-Greenland gap following a US request for assistance,” the Ministry of Defence confirmed.

Mr Healey said the ship had a “nefarious” history and was part of a “Russian-Iranian axis” that was fuelling terrorism, conflict, and misery from the Middle East to Ukraine.

He added: “The UK will continue to step up our action against shadow fleet activity to protect our national security, our economy, and global stability – making Britain secure at home and strong abroad.

“The US is the UK's closest defence and security partner. The depth of our defence relationship with the US is an essential part of our security, and today's seamlessly executed operation shows just how well this works in practice.”

At the White House, Mr Trump's press secretary was asked whether the seizure of a Russian-flagged vessel risked a deeper confrontation with Moscow.

Karoline Leavitt said the president would always enforce the policy that is best for the US.

She added: “And with respect to these ship seizures, that means enforcing the embargo against all ‘dark fleet' vessels that are illegally transporting oil and only legitimate commerce. That's the policy of this administration, and he's not afraid to implement it.”

Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, said the operation should “put the world's criminals on notice”, adding: “You can run, but you can't hide.

“We will never relent in our mission to protect the American people and disrupt the funding of narco-terrorism wherever we find it – period.”

Russian commentators were quick to condemn the operation. Alexander Kots, a correspondent for the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote on Telegram that “nuclear war could be just one step away”.

RT, the Russian state broadcaster, published an image of a helicopter hovering near the Marinera as American forces tried to board the tanker.

Mr Trump has spoken openly about controlling all of Venezuela's oil reserves and Mr Rubio has indicated that he will use a blockade as leverage over the country.

A senior White House official said: “The US is already in control of Venezuela's oil supply at this time.”

Sir Keir Starmer spoke to Mr Trump by phone on Wednesday evening.

“They discussed the joint operation to intercept the Bella 1 as part of shared efforts to crack down on sanctions busting, recent progress on Ukraine and the US operation in Venezuela,” said Number 10. “The PM also set out his position on Greenland.”

Mr Trump and his administration have started the year with a string of military operations to add muscle to its rhetoric that it will not tolerate foreign interference in the Western Hemisphere.

On Saturday, special forces toppled Nicolás Maduro, the former Venezuelan president, in a lightning raid in Caracas.

The US attack left 100 people dead and dozens more wounded, Venezuela's interior minister Diosdado Cabello said on Wednesday. He added that Mr Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were injured in the seizure but were “recovering”.

The tanker seizures come amid concerns about the future of Nato as Mr Trump's administration considers using military force to take Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.

Speaking after the Marinera was boarded, Mr Trump said the US would always support Nato and that Russia and China only feared the alliance because it had the United States as a member.

“We will ‍always be there for Nato, even if they won't be there ‍for us,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Mr Rubio said he would be meeting Denmark's leaders next week to discuss Greenland. He said Mr Trump had been consistent in his desire to acquire the territory.

“He talked about it in his first term, and he's not the first US president that has examined or looked at how we could acquire Greenland,” he added.

The US is the first country to abandon the landmark UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday withdrew the United States from dozens of international treaties and organizations aimed at promoting cooperation on the world's most pressing issues, including human rights and the worsening climate emergency.

Among the treaties Trump ditched via a legally dubious executive order was the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), making the US — the world's largest historical emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gases — the first country to abandon the landmark agreement.

The US Senate ratified the convention in 1992 by unanimous consent, but lawmakers have repeatedly failed to assert their constitutional authority to stop presidents from unilaterally withdrawing from global treaties.

Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement that “Trump cutting ties with the world's oldest climate treaty is another despicable effort to let corporate fossil fuel interests run our government.”

“Given deeply polarized US politics, it's going to be nearly impossible for the U.S. to rejoin the UNFCCC with a two-thirds majority vote. Letting this lawless move stand could shut the US out of climate diplomacy forever,” Su warned. “Withdrawing from the world's leading climate, biodiversity, and scientific institutions threatens all life on Earth.”

Trump also pulled the US out of the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the UN International Law Commission, the UN Democracy Fund, UN Oceans, and dozens of other global bodies, deeming them “contrary to the interests of the United States.”

The president's move came as he continued to steamroll domestic and international law with an illegal assault on Venezuela and threats to seize Greenland with military force, among other grave abuses.

Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Trump's withdrawal from the world's bedrock climate treaty marks “a new low and yet another sign that this authoritarian, anti-science administration is determined to sacrifice people's well-being and destabilize global cooperation.”

“Withdrawal from the global climate convention will only serve to further isolate the United States and diminish its standing in the world following a spate of deplorable actions that have already sent our nation's credibility plummeting, jeopardized ties with some of our closest historical allies, and made the world far more unsafe,” said Cleetus. “This administration remains cruelly indifferent to the unassailable facts on climate while pandering to fossil fuel polluters.”

Democratic strategists are telling swing district candidates to focus on the economy and to avoid discussing Trump.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

Recent statements from political strategists and Democratic Party insiders seem to suggest that the party's strategy for the 2026 midterm races — particularly in hotly contested swing districts —  will be to focus on economic concerns rather than on holding President Donald Trump accountable.

The statements from these strategists, highlighted in a report from The Hill this week, seem to imply that candidates will also avoid candidly discussing the idea of impeaching Trump — a move that has the potential to hurt their chances more than help them, polling data suggests.

“You can't ignore Trump because it's his economy,” one strategist from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) said. “But the top message is the economy and affordability.”

Thirty-nine seats are viewed as competitive by Democrats this year, 28 of which are in districts Trump won by at least 5 points. GOP strategist and never-Trumper Kevin Madden told The Hill he viewed those districts as competitive because the economy resonates with voters in those areas — and implied that voters would dismiss messaging that focuses on holding Trump accountable for his abuses of power as president.

“The core focus of any candidate running in 2026 has to be focused on the reality that these affordability concerns, even one year later, still exist,” Madden said.

Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons seemed to agree. Although he called Trump “an easy foil,” he also said swing district candidates should avoid putting too much focus on him.

“We still have to appeal to the anxiety and aspiration that made people support him because what happens in the course of a year if Trump finds his footing with the American people again?” Simmons said.

The strategy is already being implemented, in a way, by Democrats currently in Congress. In December, around two dozen Democratic members of Congress joined Republicans and voted against advancing a Trump impeachment measure, brought forward by Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who had included in his articles of impeachment the fact that Trump had threatened lawmakers with charges of sedition and the death penalty after they correctly pointed out that military servicemembers can disobey illegal orders from their higher ups or the president.

But avoiding Trump may be impossible, especially since Trump himself is making impeachment an issue for voters.

Speaking to Republicans at a GOP retreat held at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday, Trump told lawmakers up for reelection in November that they had to win to prevent the possibility of a future impeachment vote.

“You've got to win the midterms because, if we don't win the midterms, it's just going to be — I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me,” he said. 

It is possible, of course, for Democrats in these districts to take a two-pronged approach — centering the economy while still campaigning on holding Trump accountable when he disrespects the separation of powers, infringes on people's constitutional rights, or otherwise uses his office to engage in abuses of power.

Polling indicates that voters (both in general and in swing states) are mostly split when it comes to whether or not they want Trump impeached. But the numbers suggest that Democrats shouldn't avoid the issue entirely.

A Data for Progress poll in April, for example, found that a majority of respondents, 52 percent, supported impeaching Trump. (Notably, the poll was conducted just three months into his second term.) Forty-eight percent said they opposed the idea.

Among independent voters, whom Democrats are worried about offending, the split was wider, with 55 percent saying they backed the idea of impeachment and only 44 percent saying they opposed it. 

More recently, a Free Speech for People survey in September, which focused on likely voters in 17 swing districts across the U.S., found plurality support for impeaching Trump, with 49 percent saying they backed the move and 44 percent saying they were opposed. Six percent expressed no opinion.

A new anthology marking the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's murder aims to stir action against white supremacy.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

Emmett Till is someone that we know through documentaries, writings, photos, and inadequate history lessons. Open Casket: Philosophical Meditations on the Lynching of Emmett Till draws us unsettlingly and lovingly close to Emmett Till, and to his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley. George Yancy's and A. Todd Franklin's breathtaking new anthology brings us face-to-face with the disquieting sorrow of Black death, and the unsettling reality that Emmett Till does not rest in peace.

Published to mark the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death, Open Casket is a potent reminder that bearing witness to the horrors of white supremacy is a historically rooted collective grieving process that has particular resonances for Black people — and anyone with a moral conscience. Each essay upends the attempted erasure of the horrors wrought on a Black 14-year-old child by white adult men and the system designed to protect them. This collection raises questions that complicate our thinking about Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley, victimhood, the politics of refusal, Black maternal militancy, Black agency, and more.

This book attests that for Black people living in an anti-Black society, our mourning and mournability are part of our story, but they are not the full story. Readers are invited to bear witness and tarry with Mamie Till-Mobley as she rejects suggestions to keep her only child's funeral private and hidden from public view. Her act of Black maternal resistance connects us to the slave ship and bridges the gap between 1955 Jim Crow Mississippi and today.

While it rigorously interrogates the past, Open Casket illuminates the present with unflinching and piercing insight. The text unfolds with profound clarity and care. While many people have moved on because they can, our collective psychological and emotional wounds remain tender. We see ourselves in Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley precisely because we know that no amount of Black suffering and Black death has been enough to unsettle white supremacy.

Yancy and Franklin's book is conceptually rich, and analytically sharp. It honors Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley by calling on all of us to see and to act.In the interview that follows the authors discuss the psychological terror of Emmett Till's murder, the politics of Black maternal grief, unmasking the grotesque as a process of truth-telling, bearing witness, and more. Open Caskett honors Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley by inviting us to engage with death and grief as communal, political, and philosophical processes while stirring us toward action.

Kim Wilson: Todd, you write about Mamie-Till Mobley's strength and the unbearable pain that she must have felt when she saw what white racists did to her son, Emmet (aka Bobo, Bo). Can you say more about the collective psychological weight that Emmett's murder has placed on communities that claim him? Relatedly, how does the book help to complicate our thinking about the strength required by Mamie Till-Mobley, and by extension, all Black mothers that have had their children stolen from them by white supremacy? 

A. Todd Franklin: The image chosen for the book's cover speaks volumes about the psychological weight carried in the aftermath of Emmett Till's murder. In one sense, it offers a meditation on erasure. There is a mother, and there are images of a mother and her son; and yet, the son himself is not there — in his stead is a casket. As framed, he has been physically taken from us, much as our children and loved ones are taken from our own communities by the violence of white supremacy.

What remains visible is the pain of such loss. The image also foregrounds the psychological terror of being susceptible to erasure: Insofar as one can look at the images inside the casket and see oneself, one confronts the terrifying prospect of sharing in Emmett's demise. Powerfully, though, the image also frames a refusal to be nullified. Emmett was more than a victim of white supremacist violence — he was a beloved son, and the image viscerally captures and relays his being as such in virtue of both the photographic evidence on display in his casket and the gut-wrenching reaction of his mother as she is forced to grapple with him lying in it.

Such juxtapositions were not there by accident. Mamie Till-Mobley expressly chose to have her son publicly lie in repose in an open casket so as to complicate and confound the white supremacist logics that led to his murder. In doing so, she exemplified an unparalleled strength and determination to refuse to allow that which took his life to rob him of rightful regard for his human dignity. Many Black mothers, yourself included, find similarly challenging ways to complicate and confound the white supremacist logics, practices, and systems that continue to rob us of our children.

This is a book that merits care-full reading. I found myself putting it down every few pages to make room for the feelings that arose. I wanted to honor the space between the task at hand (reading the book), and a mother's piercing call for us to see what they did to her beautiful son. What insights do the contributors offer us into understanding the relationship between private and public grief?

Franklin: I'm grateful that you centered care. Indeed, the call is to read this text with care — not simply with sympathy, but with resolve. Put plainly, it is a call to care enough to act, individually and collectively, in ways that press society to acknowledge and confront anti-Black racism. Many contributors underscore the way the public grief of a racial community besieged by white supremacist violence emerges from a heart-wrenching private grief that extraordinary individuals like Mamie Till-Mobley refuse to be undone by. Instead, she — and others like her — belong to a long tradition of Black maternal figures and other Black folk who rise from the depths of despair to creatively transform their grief into emotionally charged and intellectually compelling airings of their grievances against the subjects and systems that trespass against us.

Black suffering is largely dismissed in the white public imagination. By putting Emmett's battered body on display, Mamie Till-Mobley was able to not only publicly condemn white womanhood, white lies, and whiteness in general — she challenged the nothingness of Black life and rewrote the course of history. We all know who Emmett Till was. Few of us remember the names of the white people involved in his torture and death. We are in a moment in history where we are being politically collectively gaslit by people that want to erase America's history of racial violence (arguably this has always been the case). What does truth-telling look like for us right now in light of Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley?

Franklin: Mamie Till-Mobley made history — she rendered present, and ever-present, both her son and the horror that took him from her. She made Emmett matter in a way that disrupted the callous ease with which Black life, and the taking of Black life, are too often consigned to oblivion.

Following in her wake, truth telling becomes a matter of unmasking the grotesque. Many looked at Emmett and saw a grotesque face. Yet truth be told, there were many white faces — “beautiful” and “manly” — that masked a far deeper grotesqueness. Those hidden behind such faces were grotesque in their very being. Today, there are many like them: Some wear makeup and serve as broadcasters, some wear uniforms and badges, some wear dark suits and red ties, and all impugn and imperil Black people under the guise of serving and protecting what they “rightly,” or rather “whitely,” take to be the nation's interests.

George, in the introduction to the book, you draw a distinction between bearing witness and being a spectator. Can you explain the difference, and help us understand how Mamie Till-Mobley's decision to let the world see what she saw transformed the process of bearing witness into a political act?

George Yancy: That distinction became important to me as I thought about Saidiya V. Hartman's text, Scenes of Subjection, where she warns against confusing indignation in response to seeing brutalized Black bodies with a form of voyeurism or fascination regarding the assault and dehumanization of Black bodies. Spectatorship, for me, can function as a form of voyeuristic pleasure, a form of Black trauma porn. Think here of those white spectators during the lynching of Black bodies. Those sites were treated as picnics, where white people came to “confirm” and “justify” their white being, their “sacred” white humanity. They were sites of a white libidinal economy where forms of white perverse pleasure and white phobias were animated. To truly bear witness to such anti-Black horror, however, is to carry the near impossible weight of that trauma, which involves a profound sense of vulnerability and shared suffering. It is a way of communicating and communing with the Black dead and dying that says, “We see you, we testify on your behalf, and we will help to carry you.” Through the open casket, Mamie Till-Mobley invites Black people to see the grotesquerie of anti-Blackness, while also loving the young beautiful Black boy, Emmett Till. And all of this, for Mamie, had to be done publicly. That public mode of bearing witness implicated and indicted the United States regarding its terrible and ugly history of gratuitous violence against Black people. The power of the collective loving Black gaze, and its refusal to look away from the results of the lie of American white “innocence,” is the political act.

For Black people living in a white supremacist settler colonial heteropatriarchal society, death is always proximate, looming, and ever-present in our lives. The ways that we are socialized to relate to death in the U.S. only reinforce our alienation from death, but not the dead. As a Black mother to Black adult children, two of whom are currently sentenced to life in prison, death is something that I think about often — more than it is healthy to do so, but not more than I believe that we (Black people) think about it, even if we never disclose our fears. Many, arguably most of us, are in a perpetual state of mourning for both the living and the dead. You write, “As I see it, Black death is, as it were, a suture that helps to protect the quotidian health of whiteness.” Can you say more about this? 

Yancy: I appreciate your vulnerability, Kim. I feel you, and I bear witness to your Black maternal love and how it is painfully entangled with both Black physical and social death. I am reminded of Claudia Rankine, who writes, “Dead blacks are a part of normal life here. Dying in ship hulls, tossed into the Atlantic, hanging from trees, beaten, shot in churches, gunned down by the police or warehoused in prisons.” Black people are a death-bound people, but not because we are simply human and finite. It is because death is right there as we jog, as we shop, as we drive, as we sleep in our own homes, and as we attempt to be in a country that is hegemonically white and structurally anti-Black. This is not to deny that white people are not aware of processes of death and dying, but death haunts our Blackness because our “right to life” has never felt like an untarnishable political axiom or an undeniably upheld moral imperative in this country. I am familiar with the powerful and constant sense of mourning that you speak of. It is not enough that we mourn the murder of, say, George Floyd. We also mourn our living Black children who are always on the precipice of being killed, that is, who are always killable because of their Blackness, and whose Black flesh is always exposed to bullets fired from guns in the hands of those who are said to serve and protect. This reality dialectically affirms the existential value of white life. In other words, white people move through the world, because they are white, with effortless grace. They jog, shop, and drive with effortless grace, because death, which always hovers near Black life, secures their life, their very being, and provides for them psychic coherence and protection against the constant anguish that I experience as I fear that my Black children may not return home alive.               

Black suffering has never been enough to persuade white people to dismantle white supremacy. But the power in what Mamie Till-Mobley did was to center Black people in a conversation about Black people, even if white people looked on. Her decision was an act of creative resistance. Can you help us contextualize this within the Black Radical Tradition?

Yancy: Part of the problem is that Black death secures the fiction of white supremacy and white innocence, and yet, paradoxically, Black life also secures the fiction of white supremacy and white innocence. In both cases, Black bodies function as the ontologically abject. This is a case where Black abjection metabolizes whiteness, reinforcing its power, privilege, and mythical standing as the apex of humanity. Hence, whether dead or alive, Black bodies are ungrievable. Part of that dismantlement will begin once white people — as James Baldwin made clear in his interview with Kenneth Clark in 1963 — “try to find out, in their own hearts, why it was necessary to have a ‘nigger' in the first place.” In asking/facing that question, perhaps white people will understand the poisonous emptiness that is whiteness. But that is the responsibility of white people, not ours. However, it is our responsibility, despite the near impossible odds, to resist. In Black Marxism, Cedric J. Robinson points out that indicative of the Black Radical Tradition is the sense that as Black people we obtain freedom on our own terms. This is what Mamie Till-Mobley did according to her own revolutionary love and resistance. This is what Malcolm X did as he spoke truth plainly about anti-Blackness in the U.S. and European colonization in Africa. It is what Ida B. Wells did in her anti-lynching crusade, even though a bounty was placed on her head. Speaking about the logics of the Black Radical Tradition and its resistance to white forms of domination, Robinson points to the importance of “the continuing development of a collective consciousness informed by the historical struggles for liberation and motivated by the shared sense of obligation to preserve the collective being, the ontological totality.” This quote speaks to Mamie Till-Mobley's effort to mobilize a sense of Black collectivity despite the violent effacement (literally, to remove the face) of Till's humanity. As Black people looked at and looked beyond such unconscionable cruelty, they were able to express an ontological totality, a sense of collective humanity, that refused to be limited by the malicious structure of whiteness.    

I'm grateful to you both for taking up the intellectual work of helping us all to see more clearly. I see the emotional labor that went into this volume. That work is visible to those of us who resist, organize, and fight like hell against the dehumanizing systems that want us to believe that we don't matter (ontological nullity). I'll speak for myself, as a Black mother, of Black adult children — who deeply identifies with every Black mother that has lost children (even if they are still living), thank you for this work. You remind us in so many words that our children matter, that we matter, that we have always mattered to each other! What do you want people to think of when they think about Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley?

Franklin: This was a project neither of us wanted to undertake, but both of us recognized that it was one we had to. Socially, politically, and personally, it captures what is most important to us — the affirmation of Black humanity and the effort to build a world consonant with it. Our hope is that through these poignant and wide-ranging philosophical reflections on this fateful Black mother and son, readers will see the power of refusing to be rendered unseen or silent.

To read this book is to engage in an act of collective grief. I was very much aware that I had to attend to the grief that I was feeling, even if that awareness did not shield me from the feelings I held. A therapist friend reminds me that under oppressive systems we don't live dignified lives, and that we deserve dignified deaths. But I wonder, where is the dignity in being unjustly killed? Can we reclaim, or perhaps, less ambitiously, claim dignity in the wake of horror? This book is a good place to contemplate these questions.

Franklin: Far too many Black people, like young Emmett, have been robbed of the opportunity to die dignified deaths. But the manner of death should never be mistaken for a measure of the dignity inherent in being human, or in being interwoven within a community that holds one lovingly. If nothing else, this volume invites readers to contemplate what it means to truly and fully see our own lovingly in what too often proves to be a loveless world. As you rightly note, this work is emotionally taxing — and no less so in moments like this, when we speak about it publicly. For us it is often a matter of trying to steady ourselves and hold enough of our composure to carry the conversation through. Here, however, we both lost it when you said you were shattered.

We are with you!

We both shed tears with you, and we hope readers understand that the work is not simply about claiming those violently claimed by the horrors of white supremacy, but also an act of claiming those shattered by it and left to piece together the shards in ways that forge a mirror that foregrounds a community fully committed to demanding the human dignity we are due against the background of a social world that offers us so little.

The banality of horror in our lives is precisely what obscures those horrors that are closest to us, and renders illegible (and often, invisible) the horrors that are often right under our noses. I draw parallels between the way those men terrorized Emmett that night, and my sons being sentenced to life in prison. I fight the comparisons, and at the risk of being misunderstood for admitting this, I see the way that white supremacy structures all of our lives. When I look at my sons, I see the boys they were, the stolen years that we can never reclaim, and the systematic destruction of their hearts, minds, and bodies. No, it's not the same, but there is a shared horror. I see, in a way that I believe this book wants me to see, the glaring similarities between the slow death of incarceration and the excruciatingly torturous, and not swift enough death of Emmett, Mamie Till-Mobley's son. I'm shattered!!! How does the book help us to understand Black motherhood and the politics of claiming?

Yancy: I think that the book encourages readers to understand that Black pain and suffering are both quotidian (as in anti-Black microassaults and microinvalidations) and spectacular (as in a public lynching). But given the history and pervasiveness of anti-Blackness, perhaps it can all be described as quotidian: routines of white bloodlust. Kim, you're not being misunderstood at all. Black forms of death and dying ravage both the Black body and the souls of Black folk whether this is on the streets (Eric Garner), in a barn (Emmett Till), or in prison (your sons). White supremacy is like a Leviathan, and its monstrous reach is unavoidable. And it existentially and psychically shatters Black lives. The book speaks directly to Black motherhood by focusing on Mamie's courage and daring, but not through the prism of romanticization. Those of us who are cisgender Black fathers, we can't give birth to Black sons. Black mothers feel that ever faint kick of love from the inside, from the matrix of their bodies. It is that mode of intimacy that inflects the pain of loss, the anguish of having one's Black child held captive by systems of oppression. In this case, Black sons are already claimed through the warmth and protection of the Black womb. That is both unspeakably beautiful and yet tragic. Why tragic? Because that intimacy is under threat by an anti-Black system that doesn't give a damn about your womb or the thriving life within it. So, the precarity of Black life begins in utero. In this case, Black women, from the beginning of pregnancy, are intimately and silently laying claim to their Black bodies and their Black babies. Our book honors the revolutionary acts of political claiming enacted by Black women from the past, in the present, and in the future.

I have a confession to make: I wake up with morning stiffness these days. It's not yet a major concern, and I wake up early enough to do some stretches to safely get my day going.

Add in medical considerations such as arthritis, and morning stiffness can be profound.

 Middle East Rivalries Are Turning a Local War Into a Regional Crisis

 Alex de Waal

Last summer, after more than two years of terrible fighting, it looked as though the United States might finally have landed on a viable approach for ending the civil war in Sudan. Since the conflict began in April 2023, Sudan's state has collapsed, and its people have suffered the world's largest humanitarian crisis. The battle lines have moved back and forth across the country, devastating the capital, Khartoum, and a score of other cities. Today, Khartoum and places east of the river Nile are dominated by the Sudanese Armed Forces, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, while the western half of the country is largely controlled by the SAF's enemy, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti.

In June, the Trump administration convened the “Quad”— Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the United States—to discuss a pathway to peace. These countries are more than mediators: throughout the war, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have supported the SAF, while the Emiratis have backed the RSF, although they deny it. Since these regional powers have had an outsize role in the conflict, it was hoped that a strong Quad agreement could produce a lasting cease-fire.

Yet expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump might inject vigor into the Sudanese peace process have until now been unrealized. In September, the Quad announced a plan that involved a cease-fire, access for humanitarian aid, and political negotiations toward a civilian-led government. But a month later, as talks on implementing the plan stalled, the RSF carried out the worst atrocity of the entire war. After a brutal starvation siege that had lasted 18 months, RSF forces overran the city of El Fasher in the Darfur region. As they took the city, RSF fighters massacred at least 7,000 people, many of them civilians. As many as 100,000 people have yet to be accounted for, although some have trickled into towns and villages hundreds of miles away, their faces hollow as they struggle to find words to recount the horrors. Not only did the RSF fighters kill with impunity; they also circulated “trophy” videos of themselves torturing and murdering their victims with glee and denigrating them with dehumanizing epithets.

Despite international outrage, the fighting has not abated in the three months since. Currently, RSF forces are encircling the city of El Obeid in North Kordofan and have struck civilian targets, including a kindergarten. Meanwhile, both sides are continuing to receive weapons from their external backers. Since October, observers have noted an increase in military cargo flights to RSF-controlled airports, and the RSF has been deploying sophisticated Chinese-made drones, as well as Colombian mercenaries. Investigators have tracked the flights to the UAE. With the new supplies, RSF forces may even threaten Khartoum, which they mostly controlled earlier in the war before the SAF pushed them out. At the same time, Egypt and Turkey have been funneling more arms to the SAF.

The longer the fighting continues, the greater the risk that it becomes a regional conflagration. The war is already entangling Sudan's African neighbors. The RSF's supply lines run through Chad, Libya, Somalia, and South Sudan—and may yet involve Ethiopia and Kenya. Its constituency of recruits among rural populations, especially historically nomadic communities, stretches westward across Sahelian Africa. Since the fall of El Fasher, there have been reports of cattle-herding Arab groups crossing the borders from the Central African Republic and Chad, aiming to seize the newly vacated lands. And the Sudanese war is also intermeshed with the volatile situation between Eritrea and Ethiopia, which threatens to devolve into a major war of its own.

By convening the Quad, Washington has correctly recognized that the road to ending Sudan's war runs through the Gulf. But what few have fully grasped is that the conflict itself is international in ways that are new and different from previous Sudanese conflicts. Today, the territorial nation-state in Sudan—and in many parts of Africa and the Middle East—is rapidly being eclipsed by borderless fiefdoms run by warlords who answer to foreign patrons with deep pockets. And that has made this war, despite its deep unpopularity among the Sudanese themselves and the misery and hardship it has brought to tens of millions of people, much harder to contain. Without more decisive engagement from the highest levels of the Trump administration, there is now a serious risk that Sudan's war tips the Horn of Africa, the Nile Valley, and the Sahara-Sahel region into a vast arena of anarchy.

Resolving the war in Sudan would be difficult even under conducive circumstances. The El Fasher massacre in October captivated world attention for its exceptional brutality, but it was only the most conspicuous in a pattern of atrocities that has scarred the entire country since the fighting erupted. What happened in El Fasher echoed the killings in West Darfur that marked the early months of the war—killings that the U.S. State Department labeled a genocide. The takeover of the Darfuri city was also a concentrated version of unspeakable depravities inflicted on the national capital in the first months of the war, when RSF fighters ransacked, murdered, and raped their way through every neighborhood.

Together with his allies, Hemedti, the RSF leader, claims that his project is dismantling the “1956 state”—a reference to the Sudan that emerged after achieving independence on January 1 of that year from British colonial rule. According to the RSF narrative, the Sudanese state was captured by a clique of soldiers, businesspeople, and—from the 1980s onward—Islamists, who ran the government as an elite club that exploited the provinces to enrich themselves. This reached its zenith, the argument goes, with Omar al-Bashir's 30-year rule (1989–2019), and Burhan's SAF is merely a continuation of this “deep state.” It's a message that has resonated among the poor and excluded in rural areas, especially Darfur, even though the RSF's solution is not reforming the state but ransacking it and robbing the citizenry.

After two years of extreme violence, including plunder, rape, and massacre in rural and urban areas alike, the Sudanese people are polarized as never before. The level of venom expressed in rival social media postings and often in personal confrontations between supporters of one side and the other reveals extraordinary bitterness, fear, and hatred, even for a country that has experienced decades of war.

Most Sudanese support the goals of the 2019 revolution, when people across the country came out into the streets in nonviolent protests demanding an end to military rule, corruption, and endless wars. A broad-based coalition of civic groups and political parties hoped they could build a genuine democracy, with accountable institutions and a flourishing economy. But their hopes were dashed when Burhan and Hemedti conspired to remove the civilian leadership and then turned dreams for democracy to ashes when the two generals eventually turned on each other.

Since the war began, half a dozen peace plans have sketched out the ultimate goal of restoring civilian rule, but they all also recognize that the democrats are far weaker than the generals. Indeed, a formal peace process hasn't even begun. A few weeks after the war erupted, Saudi Arabia and the United States invited delegates from the warring parties to Jeddah to try to reach a cease-fire. The two sides signed a Declaration of Commitment to respect civilians and facilitate humanitarian aid, a promise that was honored only in the breach. Since then, mediation efforts have been deadlocked, and each side can count on a foreign backer to provide it with weapons for its next offensive. Even while the country descends into famine, the SAF and the RSF have what they need to fight on.

As the war drags on, the role of the UAE has become particularly fraught. While Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey back the SAF, there is now plentiful evidence that the Emiratis are providing arms to the RSF for its ongoing campaigns. Because Abu Dhabi denies involvement, it has been impossible for mediators to engage Emirati officials in any discussion about the UAE's interests, strategy, and potential compromises.

Analysts and diplomats can only speculate about why the UAE is backing such a murderous force. Most infer that Emirati President Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan (known as MBZ) has a protector-protégé relationship with Hemedti that was cemented ten years ago when the RSF provided troops to Yemen to fight the Houthi rebels. In 2015, when the Houthis mounted a lightning attack that captured Sanaa, Yemen's capital, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS) led a coalition that promised to reverse the Houthi gains and restore the internationally recognized government. The UAE joined, deploying its army and air force. But as the war dragged on without the promised victory, the Emirati-Saudi alliance cracked. Saudi Arabia was ready to make a truce with the Houthis. The Emiratis showed a greater interest in securing key ports and naval facilities in Yemen and to that end backed the separatist Southern Transitional Council. Just last month, the Southern Transitional Council went on the offensive against its ostensible allies in Yemen's internationally recognized government, threatening a new, destabilizing round of conflict and intensifying the rift between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh.

The Emiratis also have a different approach toward Sudan's Muslim Brotherhood, which supports the SAF, than Saudi Arabia does. Although Saudi Arabia follows Egypt in its confidence that Burhan can keep the Islamists in check, the UAE won't tolerate them anywhere near power. There are also business connections between the UAE and the RSF—Hemedti's family company exports Sudanese gold to Dubai—but commercial interests alone cannot explain the UAE alignment.



The key factor in the regional dimension of the Sudanese conflict is the fierce rivalry between the UAE and Saudi Arabia and between MBZ and MBS over who will be the dominant power broker across the Arabian Peninsula and Red Sea. As in Yemen, this competition is now playing out in Libya, Sudan, Syria, and the Horn of Africa, and the previously brotherly kingdoms of the UAE and Saudi Arabia are currently on opposite sides in a host of conflicts.

When the war between Burhan and Hemedti broke out in 2023, it was clear to every analyst of Sudan that the UAE needed to be included in the peace process. It was understood that any road map for ending the war would require high-level American outreach to Abu Dhabi—the secretary of state backed by the president. Yet throughout 2023 and 2024, while Sudan burned, the Biden administration failed to act at the highest level.

After the Trump administration came to office in early 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acted where his predecessor had not. At Rubio's invitation, the Quad met in June and issued a statement in September. A month later, the Quad was supposed to meet again to announce a plan for a cease-fire. But Burhan signaled to his Egyptian sponsor that he was not ready for that step. Most likely, he worried that groups in his fractious coalition wouldn't agree. The RSF took his stalling as a green light to attack El Fasher, which it did the very next day. Hemedti likely thought he could blame SAF intransigence and didn't expect that his fighters' brutality—broadcast to the world through their own shocking videos of torture and execution—would instead bring the war's horrors to the world's attention.

At that moment, a strong private word from Trump to MBZ might have enabled the UAE to make a face-saving compromise, and Trump might have been able to announce a deal backed by both Gulf states. Instead, after meeting with MBS, Trump spoke publicly. “His Majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,” he announced, adding later, “It's horrible what's happening.” At this point, any move by the Emiratis to agree to a joint plan would have been seen as backing down. Instead of reinforcing the Quad plan, Trump jeopardized it.

As Sudan's regional backers dig in, the war poses a growing threat to the entire Horn of Africa. Consider the explosive situation in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where the same regional sponsors of Sudan's war are once again backing different sides. The countries' leaders, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and Eritrea's Isaias Afwerki, were previously allies in Ethiopia's 2020–22 civil war against the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front. But they are now destabilizing each other and may yet go to war. Egypt is deeply worried by Ethiopia's dam building on the Nile and is supporting Eritrea, which is therefore aligned with Sudan's SAF.

Ethiopia, meanwhile, has thus far managed to stay out of direct involvement in Sudan's war, but there are several potential flash points. One is its unresolved dispute with Sudan over the al-Fashaga triangle, a territory on the Ethiopian-Sudanese border claimed by both countries. Another stems from the fact that a division of Tigrayan troops have been fighting alongside the SAF. These highly capable fighters were originally United Nations peacekeepers serving on the boundary between Sudan and South Sudan, but they refused to go home during the war between the Ethiopian government and the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front and have since played a crucial role in defending eastern Sudan against the RSF. They are still deployed near the frontline. If war breaks out between Ethiopia and Eritrea, it is unclear what these forces will do. But if Abu Dhabi decided to double down and use its leverage over Abiy to help the RSF directly—perhaps by pressing the Ethiopian leader to open a base for the RSF inside Ethiopia—this could spark a confrontation.

South Sudan is embroiled in its own political crisis and has tried to balance between the RSF and the SAF. So far it is walking the tightrope. Burhan invited South Sudan's army north of the border to help secure Sudan's largest oil field at Heglig, and when the SAF was forced to withdraw in early December under RSF attacks, the South Sudanese decided to cooperate with the incoming RSF. Egypt and its partners understand the predicament of South Sudanese President Salva Kiir, but if he swings behind the RSF, they could yet move to support any one of that country's many potential rebels.



Cairo, meanwhile, is already squeezed between crises in Gaza and Libya and facing an increasingly stagnant economy; a destabilizing spillover from Sudan would add to its troubles. Egypt is also trying to balance its reliance on the UAE for investment with its long-standing support for the SAF and its antagonism toward Ethiopia, especially over the latter's dam on the Nile. Although Egypt finds itself aligned with Turkey in supporting Burhan in Sudan, it is also wary of Turkish backing for Sudan's Islamists.

And then there's Sudan's Red Sea coast, an increasingly strategic shoreline. The Red Sea is a crucial artery for world shipping and increasingly a geostrategic hot spot. Twenty years ago, the only outside powers with a military presence in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden were France and the United States, which have adjacent bases in Djibouti. Maritime security was taken for granted. Since then, there's been a scramble for military bases: China has opened its first overseas naval facility in Djibouti, at the southern entrance to the Red Sea; the UAE has a string of ports on the strategically located island of Socotra; and Turkey has signed a 99-year lease to develop the Sudanese port of Suakin, possibly with an eye toward building a naval facility. For Israel, the Red Sea is a national security priority: in the early 2000s, Iran smuggled weapons to Hamas through Sudanese territory, and two years ago, when the Houthis started attacking international shipping, they claimed solidarity with the Palestinians.

The stakes in the wider Horn of Africa were raised at the end of December, when Israel recognized Somaliland as an independent country from Somalia. This intensifies the rivalry between the UAE on one side—which brokered the Israeli-Somaliland deal and supports it—and Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey on the other, which oppose it. None of these regional players wants to see a rival, let alone a potential enemy, controlling real estate that could choke this strategic waterway.

As the war reaches its one thousandth day on January 9, tens of thousands of Sudanese have died from violence and many more from hunger and disease. Half of the country's 46 million people need emergency food aid, and a quarter have lost their homes. Entire cities have been destroyed, and the national economy has been set back a generation. All of this devastation is collateral damage from rivalries among Middle Eastern power brokers. In this game for control, Africa is notably absent: Egypt and Ethiopia are merely maneuvering at the margins. It is Saudi Arabia and the UAE that matter. At this point, the likely outcome of any peace process is that Sudan—whether united or divided—will end up as a vassal of the Gulf states.

Further afield, the war implicates not only the United States, which is allied with both Gulf states, but also Russia, which has long sought a foothold in northeastern Africa. When the war broke out, Russia's Wagner paramilitary company had a partnership with the RSF, but Russia has since changed sides. It has commercial investments in gold in SAF-controlled territories, and it is seeking a port on the Red Sea. It has also used its veto at the UN Security Council to assert the Sudanese government's sovereign right to control cross-border aid supplies, blocking humanitarian aid to Darfur.

The Sudanese conflict illustrates a brutal truth: there are no longer local wars in the Horn of Africa. The spark for battle might be a local rivalry, and it may burn fiercely on the fuel of local grievances and antipathies. But civil war is no longer confined within national boundaries, and no settlement can be contrived among national actors. Sudan's earlier civil wars—the two north-south wars, the previous war in Darfur—may have spilled over boundaries and drawn in neighboring states, but the path to a solution was always domestic. No longer. Sudan's peace needs to be negotiated as part of a regional or even a global package.



To their credit, Trump and Rubio have not given up. They are pressing for a cease-fire. It's a long shot. The immediate obstacle isn't the UAE but Burhan, who is struggling to keep his lieutenants in line. This will be a test of whether the White House has the appetite for brokering a deal that brings no immediate payoff, whether Egypt and Saudi Arabia can secure Burhan's compliance, and whether the Emiratis will see virtue in restraint. And if a deal is to be more than a momentary handshake, it will require the traditional skills of patient diplomacy and coordination with multilateral organizations.

The United Nations and the African Union, which once could shape international diplomacy on Sudan, have become all but irrelevant. Nevertheless, one lesson of the recent past is that whatever deal is reached, peacekeepers will be needed to monitor a cease-fire and to protect civilians. For 20 years, the UN and the AU provided this essential service, but six years ago, the UN-African mission in Darfur was closed down. Reconstituting and deploying such a force will be difficult and expensive, but not more so than allowing the fires of war to burn indefinitely. This is how the multilateral institutions—and the African continent as a whole—can make themselves relevant again.

With African peacekeepers on the ground, the peace process could be wrested from the Arab autocrats, and the Sudanese might finally have a real chance at establishing civilian rule and building a democracy. For a country that has had more than its share of wars, the elements required to achieve peace in Sudan are well known. There is, by now, 25 years of experience of what works and what doesn't. What is much harder is getting the international players that are now driving the conflict to apply that knowledge. As Sudan has become a prototype of a new kind of international war, it will also be a crucial test for whether peacemaking in such dire circumstances is still possible.

 Defense Tech Innovation Requires Government Intervention

 Margaret Mullins

In the summer of 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton's secretary of defense, Les Aspin, and William Perry, then the deputy secretary of defense, hosted a dinner at the Pentagon for defense industry leaders. The Cold War was over, they informed the gathering, and the federal budget would not support them all. With no looming Soviet threat justifying ever-rising defense budgets, consolidation would be necessary.

Just after it happened, this meeting was dubbed the “Last Supper” by the CEO of the Martin Marietta Corporation, a major aerospace and defense firm that went on to merge with the Lockheed Corporation in 1995. Other similar mergers would follow. The gathering has since become a convenient origin story for why the U.S. defense industrial base lost the ability to meet the military's needs and the defense acquisition process became so onerous. According to this narrative, the Defense Department simultaneously meddled with and neglected the industry, creating the inflexible behemoths that dominate the sector today while cutting off pathways for emerging technology companies to compete.

Defense acquisition is, indeed, broken. The United States cannot produce critical materiel at speed and at scale in a moment of crisis. Despite spending more on defense than the next nine countries combined, the United States faces a crisis of both modernization and production. Recently, an emergent group of Silicon Valley defense tech leaders and their funders, including Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir; Palmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril; and Katherine Boyle, a co-founder of the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm American Dynamism, have blamed excessive government regulation and interventionism for this unhappy state of affairs. Too much funding, they say, flows to large legacy programs and prime contractors. Some have put a spotlight on the Last Supper, arguing that it marked a turning point after which procurement became too slow, requirements too numerous, and risk-averse contract structures too stifling to innovation.

Their declinist narrative is convenient, but it is inaccurate. The Last Supper did not usher in the industry's dark era. By the time Aspin and Perry held the dinner, the defense industry, like nearly all U.S. manufacturing sectors, had already been weakened by globalization and the financialization of the U.S. economy, drawdowns in the defense budget since 1986, and a broader effort to remake the government in the image of private business. Indeed, after the Last Supper, policymakers repeatedly did exactly what Silicon Valley's tech leaders suggest today as a solution for the department's ills: they deregulated the industry and outsourced production capacity to the private sector. In fact, such strategies helped create the very problems that now plague the industry.

Defense tech leaders' alternative vision for procurement is likely to fail, just as previous deregulatory efforts did. Washington should not rush to accept Silicon Valley's critique as gospel. Instead, it should accept that national defense is not a normal competitive market and never will be and invest in the government's own capacity to oversee military production, incorporate new technology, and manage competition.

The modern U.S. defense industrial base took shape following World War II, benefiting from the enormous investments made by the government and the decimation of foreign production capacity wreaked by the war. Before the war, the government had researched, developed, and produced most weapons in-house, at public arsenals, shipyards, and laboratories. During World War II, the government had enlisted the help of blue-chip companies such as Chrysler and IBM to manufacture a variety of defense-related products, from tanks to engines to rifles. This generally fruitful partnership between the military and industry endured after the war ended, undergirding the early Cold War effort to beat the Soviet Union in a technological competition and sparking innovation in national security with positive spillover benefits to the broader U.S. economy. Government investment and direction, paired with industry expertise, led to the creation and commercialization of inventions such as GPS, the Internet, and semiconductors.

By the 1970s, however, overseas manufacturing and technology markets began to reemerge. Foreign governments subsidized the domestic production of electronics, ships, aircraft parts, and more, and U.S. defense companies were forced to find ways to remain competitive. Taking advantage of lower labor costs overseas, U.S. producers moved parts of their supply chains to Asia and Europe. Then, the 1980s brought “financial engineering” to defense. Threats of hostile takeovers, defensive restructuring, and ruthlessly profit-maximizing executives saddled companies such as Lockheed and Martin Marietta with debt, leaving them weak and increasingly dependent on the Defense Department's largess to stay afloat.

As a result, long before the Last Supper, the U.S. defense industry began to constrict. A defense spending boom at the heart of President Ronald Reagan's hawkish Cold War strategy in the early 1980s masked the damaging effects that globalization and financialization had on the industry, but only temporarily. When Reagan began to draw down defense spending in 1986, the move only hastened the hollowing out of the bloated sector. A 1989 Center for Strategic and International Studies report found that between 1982 and 1987, the number of suppliers in defense subsectors fell by 67 percent.



In several key subsectors, the situation was particularly dire. The top four firms in the submarine business and the space booster business had 99 percent and 97 percent of the market share in their respective subsectors. The top four manufacturers of surveillance and detection satellites had 100 percent of their subsector's market share. Meanwhile, the blue-chip conglomerates, including Chrysler, Ford, and IBM, were getting out of the defense industry. By 1990, all three had largely left the sector, judging that fewer contracts and declining budgets would make defense production less profitable than making automobiles and personal computers.

Instead of compensating for U.S. defense firms' offshoring, consolidation, and constriction by bolstering domestic capacity, the government mimicked the private sector's trends. For the Defense Department, this meant shedding its organic production capacity. Shifting the production of several core military capabilities to the private sector resulted not in a cost-efficient transfer of production but in the outright disappearance of some production capability. Take shipbuilding. Before World War II, public shipyards managed almost half the research, design, construction, and maintenance of the U.S. Navy's ships. From 1953 to 1960, private shipyards' share in new ship construction and repair contracts rose from 55 to 85 percent. But by the 1970s, some large private builders had stopped bidding on navy work. Instead of reinvesting in a public option, the Reagan administration further limited the government's role, eliminating the construction subsidy program that had underpinned the commercial shipbuilding business since the 1930s. Domestic shipbuilding, for the navy or the commercial sector, never recovered.

Washington also privatized services and reduced personnel. Between 1981 and 1987, the Defense Department outsourced almost 40,000 service positions on military installations to private contractors, citing cost-saving concerns. But the contracts tended to be poorly structured and too narrowly defined, and the firms that took over the work often found that the actual cost of implementation was higher than anticipated. Because the contracts held the government responsible for additional costs, Washington frequently ended up paying more to these private firms than it would have paid its own civilian personnel. And by the time the contracts ended, the government, having shed in-house talent, could not revert to in-house provisioning.

In 1989, Jacques Gansler, a defense acquisition scholar and future Defense Department undersecretary, wrote that defense firms and the defense divisions of diversified companies suffered from “heavy debt, difficulty of borrowing, considerable excess capacity, low cash generation, high (and growing) risks, old production equipment, too little capital investment, relatively low productivity, mixed quality, and rapidly rising prices.” During George H. W. Bush's presidency, the Defense Department warned that industrywide restructuring was inevitable.

At the same time, by the early 1990s, it was clear that emerging technologies increasingly developed in the private sector should play an important role in national security. The Defense Department would need a new approach to acquiring and incorporating this technology into the military. But rather than build up the Pentagon's capabilities and invest in in-house talent and research and production capacity, the Clinton administration adopted a policy of “civil-military integration,” to be achieved by deregulating the industry, developing and encouraging the production of dual-use technologies applicable to both military and civilian purposes to create private markets for defense products, and procuring, whenever possible, commercial products rather than items created specifically for the military. With bipartisan congressional support, Clinton signed into law the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act in 1994 and the Clinger-Cohen Act in 1996, which cut military-specific requirements and regulations, established a default preference for commercial technology, and simplified the acquisition of information technology.

Many of these reforms, however, did not have the hoped-for effect. Privatization, force reduction, and deregulation meant that ever-more complicated contracts had to be administered by fewer people and with less guidance. The outsourcing of information technology and data processing positions, cornerstones of the emerging private sector revolution, left the department less capable of understanding and adopting new technology. Reductions in force, which continued under a congressional directive in 1996, hit acquisition personnel especially hard. All told, between 1989 and 1999, the government's defense acquisition workforce shrank by 50 percent.

Subsequent administrations failed to arrest the relative decline of government capacity. Between 2001 and 2015, the defense acquisition workforce increased by 21 percent while defense contract spending commitments increased by 43 percent. Between 2015 and 2020, the workforce grew by just 18 percent, as obligations grew by 41 percent. And although the Obama administration stood up the Defense Innovation Unit, the first Trump administration expanded use of other transaction agreements, and the Biden administration developed programs such as the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve and Competitive Advantage Pathfinders to improve the integration of emerging technology, none made any major reforms to state capacity.

Today, prominent voices in the new defense tech ecosystem and their funders argue that the Clinton-era deregulation simply did not go far enough. They see the government as fundamentally risk averse, beholden to taxpayers, and hostile to new industry entrants. Palantir's chief technology officer, Shyam Sankar, for example, holds the Last Supper responsible for “the decoupling of commercial innovation from defense.” From the vantage point of these relative newcomers to the industry, the Defense Department's byzantine processes, contract structures, and data requirements are shutting the door on a new generation of innovators. They argue that the Defense Department should limit military specification requirements for new technology, reduce compliance requirements for new entrants, and even increase competition within the department by having program offices compete with each other.

On the surface, their diagnosis is compelling. But these leaders ignore that their suite of preferred policies, which some winkingly refer to as a “First Breakfast,” have been tried already—and have failed. Many of the barrier-reducing measures would expose the Defense Department and American taxpayers to increased risk without an outweighing benefit. By easing regulatory and reporting burdens for new and commercial companies, the Defense Department would lose access to key data to determine whether a company's pitch matches its product, whether that company can scale and deliver the product, and whether it is unfairly overcharging for the product. By using more flexible contracting structures for production, the Defense Department would be forced to rely on acquisition officers' general understanding of companies, technology, and the market when they negotiate fair prices and terms, as opposed to direct insight into specific companies. And expanding the definition of nontraditional defense contractors may incentivize some more established legacy and nonlegacy companies to restructure superficially to get access to the department's more flexible processes, meant to ease the entry of industry upstarts.

Defense tech leaders also argue that expanding the use of fixed-price contracts, which transfer cost risk (and upside) to the contractor, would allow firms to innovate faster. Unlike cost-plus contracts, which offer lower profit potential but allow the government to absorb the risk for systems requiring major technological advances or facing significant uncertainty, fixed-price contracts are typically used in deals for well-established and commercial technology with clear requirements. Historically, however, when the department has attempted to rely more on fixed-price contracts to save money and shift innovation risk to the private sector, costs have ballooned, development timelines have slipped, and the government has remained responsible for the risk.



Defense tech companies seem to consider themselves immune to the uncertainty that often compels the government to offer firms cost-plus contracts for emerging technology development because, they claim, their venture backers will absorb the risk, allowing them to achieve innovative leaps under fixed-price contracts. But over the long run, these firms and their funders are more likely to limit their own risk by shifting from defense-specific innovation (which invariably requires high, sustained R & D investment with uncertain outcomes that venture funds are unlikely to provide) to technology with clear commercial potential. Palantir, for example, evolved from an intelligence platform to support analysis for national security agencies to a data company that licenses access to its commercial software to government agencies and private companies. The growth of firms that offer competitive products to both the Defense Department and the commercial sector is, on the whole, positive. But such companies must ultimately answer to their profit-seeking investors and thus are unlikely to meet all of the department's needs.

Furthermore, Silicon Valley's proposed reforms would not guarantee increased competition. In fact, they could help large technology firms gain a foothold in emerging defense areas and then acquire new, smaller entrants. For all the invective against the industry consolidation that took place after the Last Supper, defense tech leaders have no reservations about pursuing consolidation themselves. Anduril, for example, has acquired nine companies since its founding in 2017. Palantir has acquired seven companies since 2013. AeroVironment, which manufactures small drones, has acquired six firms since 2019. Shield AI, which develops autonomous defense systems, has acquired three companies since 2021. Silicon Valley defense leaders argue that these moves are necessary to expand their offerings. In doing so, however, they echo the exact line that their more traditional corporate predecessors used in the 1980s and 1990s.

Finally, the solutions now being championed in Silicon Valley would not necessarily make the defense industrial base any more resilient in the face of a crisis. Often presented as a panacea for procurement modernization and production inefficiency, they would address only a narrow segment of the Defense Department's needs. The capacity to produce less glamorous but strategically essential systems such as ships and munitions will not be solved with software alone, and they will require public investment in the government's own expertise, production, and maintenance infrastructure—much of which has been deliberately dismantled over the past 40 years.

Defense tech leaders are correct that the U.S. military needs a faster procurement process and more agile development. But many of their proposed fixes would create a system that prioritizes speed and flexibility at the expense of fit, need, or cost discipline. Although few would object to a quicker acquisition process, the national defense requires viable, scalable, and surge-ready production, well-managed military-specific technology, and core capabilities resilient to market shifts in addition to speed. By advocating for “dynamism” as a cure-all, advocates distract from the more fundamental requirement to address the modernization and production crises: improving the structural capacity and expertise of the state.

To be sure, defense tech leaders do not totally ignore the need for state capacity entirely, but most treat it as one component among many, substitutable for private sector expertise, research, and production rather than the keystone of the entire system. To truly reform, Washington must defend itself against the false narrative that a lean government is an effective one.

If the Department of Defense wants to build a combined industrial base that can respond to the eruption of a conflict, it will have to pay for it. Washington should be willing to accept the higher costs that come with contracts that include provisions mandating that suppliers are capable of surging production if required. It should also ensure that the arsenals, shipyards, and depots that make up the Defense Department's organic industrial base receive adequate funding. Critics may argue that expanding a near-trillion-dollar defense budget would be irresponsible, but it will cost less to maintain capacity in and outside government than to rapidly build or buy that capacity in a time of urgent need. Rather than relying on episodic crisis spending, Congress and the Defense Department should steadily invest in both the government's and industry's facilities, capital equipment, and manufacturing technology.



The Pentagon also needs a process to assess when certain capabilities would be better developed in-house and when they would be better purchased from the private sector. Acquisition officers and others who must weigh these “build versus buy” decisions and negotiate increasingly complex contracts need more people, resources, and training to support them. To protect against waste and to encourage the responsible development and integration of new technologies in the private sector, the Defense Department should hire more acquisition officers tasked with conducting comprehensive market research and overseeing the adoption of technologies it does acquire, more systems engineers and product managers to help bring acquisition projects to fruition, and more technologists and designers who can smartly build, buy, and integrate cutting-edge technology.

Defense tech leaders often speak about “unleashing” the power of the market by cutting regulations. But the defense sector is an inherently distorted and flawed marketplace. It is defined by a single dominant buyer, significant barriers to access, and large capital requirements; no amount of deregulation or deference to Silicon Valley can correct for that. Rather than cede yet more ground to the private sector or design policy around an unachievable vision of self-administering contracts available to flashy but untested firms, Washington must grab the regulatory and institutional reins to create and manage competition within the limits of a monopsony market. It must negotiate and oversee contracts that extract the best performance from the private sector, encouraging the competition that Silicon Valley rightly claims is currently lacking. And it must decide when public in-house research, development, or production is the better investment for the future.

Further weakening government institutions on the basis of misconstrued history will have devastating long-term costs. The first and second questions in any acquisition decision must always be: Does this choice strengthen the force today and in 50 years? and, Does it respect the taxpayer? Defense tech leaders and the government will not always agree on the answers. But the government's role is to advance the public interest, not to please its contractors. A capable and competent state is not the enemy of innovation and resilience but a precondition for them.

            Saudi-backed forces moved to capture a key southern Yemeni city on Thursday after Riyadh accused the UAE of helping a separatist leader flee.
    


            Citing “reliable intelligence,” the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen said the leader of Yemen's UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), Aidarous al-Zubaidi, left the country by boat “in the dead of night” for Somaliland, before boarding an aircraft to Mogadishu, which later transported him to a military airport in Abu Dhabi.
    


            CNN has reached out to the UAE foreign ministry for comment.
    


            The interior ministry of the Saudi-backed Yemeni government said in a statement that government-allied National Shield Forces (NSF) had “secured” the southern city of Aden and its security situation was “under control.” The NSF posted a video on social media showing a large convoy of military vehicles mobilizing to “secure several provinces” in the south that had been captured by the STC and allied militias. CNN cannot independently verify the claims.
    


            Aden had been the seat of Yemen's government since the Iran-backed Houthi movement took over the capital Sana'a in 2014, prompting a military intervention by Saudi Arabia and the UAE a year later. Last month, government officials stationed there fled to Riyadh when the southern forces, led by Al Zubaidi, launched a military offensive to take over the area last month.
    


            Over the past decade, UAE and Saudi agendas in the country diverged, leading them to support rival factions. In particular, the UAE's backing of southern separatists was at odds with Saudi Arabia's support for a unified and stable Yemen at its border. The UAE pulled most of its troops from Yemen in 2019, but a small contingent of what it called counter terrorism forces remained.
    


Saudi Arabia's dispute with the UAE exposes a deeper regional power struggle



            The advance of STC forces across key southern Yemeni provinces early December infuriated Riyadh and triggered an unprecedented public dispute with its Emirati neighbor, culminating in Saudi airstrikes on UAE shipments and a call by the Yemeni government for the remaining UAE forces to leave the country in 24 hours, which Saudi Arabia endorsed.
    


            Following the UAE's withdrawal, Yemeni government forces, with Saudi air support, launched a counteroffensive that pushed the separatists to their former stronghold in Aden. Under intense military pressure, the STC's leadership agreed to hold talks in Riyadh aimed at de-escalating the conflict.
    


            The Saudi-led coalition said Wednesday that al-Zubaidi was expected to accompany the STC delegation, but instead mobilized “a large military force” to create “chaos and unrest”.
    


            Following the statement, Yemen's internationally recognized government accused al-Zubaidi of “high treason” for “inciting internal strife”.
    


            An STC foreign affairs official, Amr Al-Bidh, said in a briefing on Tuesday that the delegation of more than fifty STC officials had been incommunicado since arriving in Riyadh. A photo posted on X by the Saudi ambassador to Yemen on Wednesday showed him meeting with the officials in the capital.
    


            “The message (from Saudi Arabia) was either you come, or you are an enemy, and that is your last chance,” Al-Bidh said.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Saudi government for comment.

            A regular morning in south Minneapolis turned to horror Wednesday morning as residents of Portland Avenue rushed out of their homes to sounds of commotion and gunshots.
    


            Emily Heller was in the middle of making breakfast when she heard whistles – a signal residents have used to warn their neighbors about the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers – and agents quarreling with protesters on her street.
    


            Without time to put on her shoes, Heller ran outside and saw a convoy of ICE agents on her street, yelling at a woman in an SUV who appeared to be blocking them from passing.
    


            Moments later, the woman, Renee Nicole Good, 37, was fatally shot.
    


            “My life is forever changed from having witnessed this,” Heller said.
    


            Heller told CNN Good “was totally peaceful” before the agents began yelling at Good to move and “aggressively” approached her vehicle.
    


            An ICE agent then tried to open her car door as another stood nearby. “She reversed a little bit,” Heller said, and then turned her wheels to begin pulling away.
    


Another violent death in Minneapolis lays bare the nation's fractured politics



            “An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, ‘Stop!' and then — I mean, she was already moving — and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,” Heller said.
    


            Trevor Heitkamp, another resident, was standing outside of his home when he heard chaos down the street. As he got closer, he saw ICE agents yelling at Good to move.
    


            “The car backed up slowly and proceeded to pull forward pretty slowly,” while witnesses shouted in protest, he said.
    


            “Then the agent who fired the weapon was on the opposite side of the car to me and I heard four, possibly five shots, and then the car sped forward because … this person's injured and their foot went down,” Heitkamp said.
    


            Nearby, Tyrice Jones was in an upstairs apartment when he heard gunshots and a crash, prompting him to go outside and see that the SUV driven by Good had smashed into a streetlight directly in front of his building.
    


What we know about the woman killed in the Minneapolis ICE shooting



            Jones then saw a woman who identified herself as Good's wife and was covered in blood sitting in the snowy front yard of Jones' building, crying alongside a black lab dog.
    


            “You guys just killed my wife!” the woman shouted.
    


            The fatal shooting marks the latest dramatic escalation in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown on cities across the US, which has led to widespread protests and violence. The Department of Homeland Security announced it was deploying roughly 2,000 federal agents to Minneapolis this week in a new enforcement campaign following an alleged fraud scandal involving Somali-run childcare centers in Minnesota.
    


            Simmering tensions quickly ramped up across the city Wednesday as federal and local officials painted opposing narratives of what happened between Good and the ICE agent.
    


            DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said Good was “stalking and impeding” officers' work throughout the day and tried to “weaponize her vehicle” to run over an officer, who she claimed “used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.”
    


            City and state officials, however, blamed the Trump administration's immigration tactics for her death.
    


            Gov. Tim Walz said he has been “warning for weeks” that ICE operations in his state were a “threat to public safety,” while Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey called the DHS account of the shooting “bullshit.”
    


            “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,” Frey said during a news conference, telling ICE to “get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”
    


            Three videos taken of the scene of the shooting and reviewed by CNN show two federal officers in a truck pulling up to Good's car and exiting their vehicle.
    


            “Get out of the car,” the officers approaching the woman's driver-side door can be heard repeatedly saying.
    


            One of the two officers can be seen pulling on the woman's driver-side door as the other officer reaches the front of the car from the other side. The car then starts to move in reverse as one officer continues pulling on the car door, and the other officer is in front of the vehicle.
    


            The vehicle begins to move forward and, at the same time, a third officer who had approached the vehicle pulls out his pistol and points it at the woman while moving away from the front of the car. He then opens fire.
    


DHS said a woman attempted to run over ICE officers before being shot in Minneapolis. Here's what videos show



            As news of the shooting spread, protests quickly broke out near the scene, which is less than a mile from where, almost six years ago, the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer became a flashpoint for national tensions over police use of force and anti-Black racism.
    


            Later Wednesday, demonstrators yelled and lobbed snowballs at federal officers and Minneapolis police in an outpouring of anger and grief.
    


            But by evening, an uneasy calm had settled across the city. The glow of hundreds of candles illuminated the snowy residential street where Good had been killed. A crowd of people stretching an entire city block braved freezing temperatures to lay bouquets of flowers and quietly mourned her life in a vigil.
    


            Good was a US citizen and a mother of three, according to the Associated Press. There were stuffed animals in her car when she was shot, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said.
    


            Frey, the mayor, urged residents to remain calm in the wake of “chaos” in the city.
    


            “This is a moment where all of us in Minneapolis and beyond, we can rise to the occasion,” Frey said. “We can show them who we are. We can show them the kind of courage, bravery, love and compassion that makes Minneapolis and that makes America.”

Live Updates


            • Tensions flared in the Minneapolis area, as protesters and law enforcement clashed this morning after an ICE agent fatally shot a woman yesterday. Pepper balls were fired toward a crowd of demonstrators outside a federal building, with agents also deploying a gas-like substance.
    


• The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it was forced to withdraw from investigating the shooting after the FBI took control of the case. Gov. Tim Walz urged that “Minnesota must be part of this investigation.”
    


            • Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the agent, saying the woman — identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good — tried to run over the officer. State and local officials disputed claims that the shooting was done in self-defense. Homeland Security officials have privately expressed shock over the department's immediate response.
    


            • Multiple videos of the shooting reviewed by CNN show nuance, and exactly what took place before the shooting remains unclear.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke about a person who he said was outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building on Thursday “with the intent to antagonize” protesters and used a bullhorn to “scream at them.”
    


            He urged the community to not “allow that to be a catalyst to create violence.”
    


            “Our respect for the First Amendment means we will expect and respect all opinions. If this individual is there expressing support for ICE? That's their constitutional right to do so, and they need to be protected,” the governor said.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged people protesting to not to “lash out” at protests, and to continue to practice “peaceful civil disobedience.”
    


            “When I saw yesterday some of the anger — whether it's Minneapolis police, Minnesota State Patrol, Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, Minnesota National Guard — they are there to protect and serve, as it's said. They are there to protect Minnesotans,” the governor said at a Thursday news conference.
    


            “Throwing your anger at them only inflames this situation,” he added.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “t feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome” following yesterday's fatal shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.
    


                    “And I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment. From the President to the Vice President, to Kristi Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,” he said.
                





            “When Kristi Noem was judge, jury and executioner yesterday, that's very, very difficult to think that there were going to be fair,” the governor added later.
    


            Vice President JD Vance will join White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt for a briefing on Thursday centered on Wednesday's fatal shooting involving an ICE officer, a White House official told CNN.
    


            In the hours since the shooting, Vance has vehemently defended the federal officer who fired the gun as acting in self-defense.
    


            “This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job,” Vance wrote Thursday on social media, referencing Renee Nicole Good, the 37-year-old woman who was killed when the ICE agent shot into her vehicle during an encounter. “When he approached her car, she tried to hit him. A tragedy? Absolutely. But a tragedy that falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with.”
    


            “Minnesota must be part of this investigation,” Gov. Tim Walz said about the investigation of Wednesday's fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent, referring to state's claim that federal investigators excluded the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from participating in the probe.
    


            The BCA has “non-partisan career professionals that have spent years building the trust of the community,” Walz told reporters in a Thursday news conference.
    


            “There's a BCA force investigations unit that was created by the legislature by the people of Minnesota to provide an independent, consistent, and trusted mechanism for investigating the use of force incidents involving law enforcement officers,” Walz said.
    


            “I will continue to press that we be part of the investigation, that we do the investigation, so that Minnesotans can trust what the outcome is,” Walz said.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is now addressing reporters. His office said this would be a public safety update following the shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a federal ICE agent.
    


 Immigration and Customs Enforcement “took a pause” from operations in Minneapolis yesterday afternoon following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, but the agency is now “back to doing our law enforcement mission,” ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons told Fox News this morning.
    


            “We took a pause yesterday afternoon after that deadly shooting … to check on our staff and our officers (at) the scene, making sure everything was secure. But we were back in the fight more than an hour later,” Lyons told Fox News when asked whether ICE was back on Minneapolis streets.
    


            Lyons expressed sympathy for everyone involved in the shooting, but said it was “avoidable,” and that the public “should not interfere with a law enforcement operation.”
    


            The ICE officer who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good yesterday has 10 years of experience with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's enforcement and removal operations, a senior Homeland Security Official tells CNN.
    


            Enforcement and Removal Operations is the branch of ICE that deals specifically with the arrest and deportation of undocumented immigrants. Of that branch, the officer was part of the special response team, the Homeland Security Official said.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she is “not opposed to sending more” immigration authorities to Minneapolis following yesterday's fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.
    


            “I'm not opposed to sending more, if necessary, to keep people safe,” Noem said  Thursday at a news conference in New York City.
    


            When asked about the ICE agent who shot into the vehicle of Renee Nicole Good, Noem said he is an experienced officer “who served a number of years.” She declined to provide more information.
    


            Officials including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have called for ICE agents to leave the Twin Cities area.
    


            Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told CNN he is trying to figure out who he “can get on the phone with and persuade to reverse this poor decision,” referring to the state's claim that federal investigators excluded a state agency from investigating Wednesday's fatal ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis.
    


            “What I have seen is deeply disturbing and there is sufficient basis for further investigation and potential charges,” Ellison said of the case. “There's basis to move forward. There's basis to, at some point, present it to a prosecuting authority to make it to charging.”
    


            The slain woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was playing the role of “legal observing” and not interfering at the time of her interaction with ICE, Ellison said.
    


            The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said it “reluctantly” withdrew from investigating the fatal ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis after the FBI told the agency the US Attorney's Office “had reversed course” and would no longer allow the BCA “access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews,” BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.
    


            The BCA was initially set to conduct the joint investigation with the FBI after consulting with the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, the US Attorney's Office and the FBI yesterday.
    


                    “Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands.”
                





            “If the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI were to reconsider this approach and express a willingness to resume a joint investigation, the BCA is prepared to reengage in support of our shared goal of public safety in Minnesota,” Evans added in the statement.
    


            Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison just reacted to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension being forced to withdraw from investigating the fatal ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis after the FBI took control of the case, telling CNN it is “deeply concerning, extremely disappointing.”
    


                    “My question is, what are you afraid of? What are you afraid of an independent investigation for?” Ellison questioned.
                





            Before learning of the news, Ellison said he was still trying to reverse the federal government's course.
    


            “I'm still trying to say: Wait a minute, don't do this stupid thing! Do not go forward with an exclusive, which would an inherently untrustworthy investigation. Do what is right, do what is wise, do what is best for this country, and have an inclusive joint investigation that includes cooperation by state and local authorities,” he said.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is expected to provide a public safety update at 12:30 p.m. ET following the shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent on Wednesday, the governor's office said.
    


            The state's Department of Public Safety commissioner, Bob Jacobson, is also expected to speak.
    


            Walz on Wednesday announced he had issued a warning order to prepare the Minnesota National Guard “to be deployed if necessary.”
    


            A counterprotester antagonized some of the demonstrators near the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building on Thursday morning.
    


            “We executed one of you yesterday,” the counterprotester said. “You guys will continue to be killed if you continue to harm these men.”
    


            The protesters' response: “Don't feed the trolls.”
    


            Authorities briefly intervened, and the counterprotester left.
    


            By late Thursday morning, the size of the crowd had dwindled.
    


            Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading the charge on the Trump administration's nationwide immigration crackdown, is outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building right now.
    


            Crowds have thinned and thickened throughout the morning outside the building where protesters arrived as early as 7 a.m. local time today.
    


            While there haven't been any confrontations between Bovino and protesters, according to CNN's Ryan Young, who is on scene, the official's presence reignited the crowd.
    


            As he walked through the group of federal agents on scene, members of the crowd can be heard yelling questions to him, but he didn't stop to answer any of them.
    


            Actions by federal officers outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in the Minneapolis area, residents they have to keep each other safe, demonstrators say.
    


            “We want to keep our people safe. We want to keep everybody safe. We know we don't want anyone else to die here in Minnesota today,” Beth Gendler, the executive director of the National Council of Jewish Women Minnesota, told CNN's Ryan Young on Thursday.
    


            Gendler described the crowd gathered Thursday as “a huge crowd of Minnesotans saying that, ‘You know what? Get ICE out of our town! We're the ones who keep each other safe'.”
    


            “And honestly, the longer that we stay here, the longer that these guys are here, the less time that they're spending in the streets, detaining our neighbors,” Gendler added.
    


            Minneapolis Police Department Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN tensions have been building in the city for several weeks before yesterday's fatal shooting.
    


                    “I have very publicly been saying that I have been concerned, both number one, that a tragedy would occur — that either a federal law enforcement officer or a civilian member of the community would get seriously hurt or killed — and also that such heightened tensions and so many emotions around these issues could lead to civil unrest, which is something that our city was, the center of truly the worst and most destructive civil unrest in our country's history five years ago.”
                





            One question that still exists is whether the officer was wearing a body-worn camera. It's unclear whether the officer who shot the victim was wearing a camera however, ICE officers are not required to wear body-worn cameras while conducting operations in Minneapolis, a law enforcement source told CNN.
    


            When asked if any body-worn camera footage exists from the shooting to illustrate the perspective of the federal agents involved, O'Hara said he didn't have any information about that.
    


            “I can tell you this much, there were not any Minneapolis Police officers on the scene when the use of deadly force occurred,” he said, urging people to consider that with a number of videos circulating from the incident, it's only a matter of time before the full story is sewn together.
    


            “Out of respect for the deceased, we should be willing to go as far as possible to gather all of the evidence and follow the evidence to its logical conclusion,” O'Hara said.
    


            US Border Patrol agents seen at a protest near Minneapolis, Minnesota, appear to be a mix of the agency's special response team and its Border Patrol Tactical Unit, also known as BORTAC.
    


            BORTAC agents are generally trained in crowd control and crowd dispersion, as well as other tactics to protect property. Pepper spray and tear gas canisters are among the tools that agents have relied on for crowd control.
    


            Similar Border Patrol teams have been previously deployed to various civil unrest incidents, including Portland in 2020.
    


            When ICE agents first approached Renee Good's car, cursing at her and yanking on her door, it's understandable why the driver would flee, attorney Raul Reyes said.
    


            “In my view, it is completely reasonable for this young woman – when an agent is approaching her car, (a weapon) drawn, shouting at her, reaching into her car – I think it is a completely reasonable response to attempt to flee the scene, to get out of harm's way,” Reyes said.
    


            Video shows officers approaching Good's car and saying, “Get out of the f*cking car.” The footage shows one officer pulling on Good's driver-side door while another officer walks in front of the car from the other side.
    


            Good's car was parked horizontally across the right lane of a one-way street. She puts her SUV in reverse before moving forward and to the right, toward the direction of traffic.
    


            At the same time, the ICE officer who approached the front of Good's vehicle pulls out his gun while moving away from the front of her car. The ICE officer shoots Good as she is driving away, and her car crashes into a utility pole and a parked vehicle.
    


            “Even if she was potentially disobeying an order to step out of the car,” Reyes said, “that should not be a death sentence.”
    


            Federal officers in fatigues, including those with Border Patrol special response teams, have arrived and positioned themselves in a line outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal building in the Minneapolis area, trying to move protesters across the street.
    


            While some agents interacting with protesters were seen trying to use deescalation, while other agents were heard having conversations antagonizing the protesters, telling them to “bring it if they want to bring it,” and using their body to physically push people down to the ground, CNN's Ryan Young reported from the scene.
    


            The protesters, some directly facing federal officers, have been vocal, cursing and calling officers Nazis and murderers.
    


            Every gate around the federal facility has been cleared of protesters.

            Trump administration officials on Wednesday began outlining a makeshift strategy for taking indefinite control of Venezuela's oil sales, as they race to maintain stability within the nation after overthrowing its leader.
    


            The ambitious, multi-part plan centers on seizing and selling millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil on the open market, while simultaneously convincing US firms to make expansive, long-term investments aimed at rebuilding the nation's energy infrastructure.
    


            The US would maintain control over the initial revenue generated from the oil sales, officials told lawmakers and energy executives, with plans to ensure that those funds “benefit the Venezuelan people.”
    


            Yet just days after President Donald Trump authorized the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and declared the US “in charge,” those scrambling to map out a long-term plan for the country are still facing far more questions than they have answers.
    


            In an interview with The New York Times published Thursday, Trump said “only time will tell” when asked how long the United States will demand direct oversight of Venezuela. He also acknowledged that it would take years to revive the nation's neglected oil sector, according to the publication.
    


            One oil and gas industry source in touch with top Trump officials said, “The United States will have a lot of challenges thinking that they're just going to bring US companies down into Venezuela and they're going to operate and turn this around,” adding, “That's not reality.”
    


            The vision laid out by senior Trump officials, led by Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would represent an unprecedented exertion of control over a foreign country's oil resources with no clear timetable or guarantee of success.
    


            It raises immediate logistical challenges as well as a range of thorny legal and national security dilemmas, according to interviews with a range of industry sources and lawmakers as well as current and administration officials, threatening to entangle the US in a messy foreign policy project that could turn politically disastrous.
    


            Wright and Rubio nevertheless expressed confidence Wednesday in their approach, with Rubio telling reporters after a classified briefing on Capitol Hill that the administration was “not just winging it.”
    


            Wright, who spent the day in Miami meeting with industry executives at a Goldman Sachs conference, told CNN that he was getting “barraged” by companies telling him, “We're interested. How can we get involved?”
    


            But pressed on the specifics of the strategy, they offered only a vague sketch of a monthslong campaign that appeared still very much a work in progress.
    


            Rubio, in private briefings and conversations with lawmakers, has stressed the importance of the next several weeks in managing Venezuela's transition, including cutting off US adversaries like Russia and China from the nation's oil supply and quickly generating revenue that can be used to keep its critical services running.
    


            The administration is planning to oversee the sale of an initial 30 million to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that was already under sanction, generating an initial windfall that Rubio told lawmakers would be funneled back into the country. Over time, the US would sell more oil as it's produced, with the proceeds supporting investments in Venezuela that officials view as crucial to maintaining the interim government's stability.
    


            But the administration has so far declined to lay out a timeline for how long it will keep control of Venezuela's premier export, nor has it officially secured the cooperation of interim President Delcy Rodriguez or Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela.
    


            “The immediate thing that we've got to do is to make sure that this current operational government that's there today has got to have some resources to pay their bills,” said GOP Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Senate's Armed Services Committee. “The intent is to make sure that it doesn't go into chaos.”
    


            Petróleos de Venezuela said Wednesday that it was in negotiations to sell oil to the US, while Wright told oil executives in Miami that the administration was in “active dialogue” with Venezuela's leadership.
    


            Also unclear is the legal authority for such an arrangement, which administration officials have openly acknowledged is being negotiated with Rodriguez under the threat of paying “a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she doesn't agree, as Trump put it.
    


            Trump officials on Wednesday were also still working out how to manage the revenue generated from its sales of Venezuelan oil, telling lawmakers that the US would not rely on the Treasury Department but utilize a collection of international oil traders and offshore bank accounts to sell the oil and manage the resulting cash.
    


            The unorthodox scheme alarmed some lawmakers, raising questions over how the government would manage oversight of the money, as well as decide who gets the funds and track their distribution.
    


            “I have never in my entire life in public service and as a former (Office of Management and Budget) employee, ever heard of anything like this,” said Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico.
    


            One former US diplomat with extensive experience in the region told CNN that it didn't make sense for the Treasury Department to handle the kinds of transactions the administration appears to have in mind.
    


            “The US Treasury is not set up to handle commercial transactions like this,” the former diplomat said. “The Treasury takes in receipts from people who pay taxes, tariffs and fees. They take in money in a way that is consistent with its legally authorized mission and then it disperses those in a way which is governed by law.”
    


            Wright told CNN on Wednesday evening that the administration was “still working out the logistics” of how it plans to sell the oil and deposit the proceeds.
    


            “There's some legal things that are involved in that,” Wright said. “But whichever account this ends (up) in — I'll know in 24 hours — is going to be controlled by the United States government.”
    


            Ahead of a Friday meeting at the White House between Trump, members of his Cabinet and a handful of oil executives, there remain a number of questions about how any of this will work, such as who would control the proceeds, how much say the Venezuelan government would have, and what the visibility into the entire process would look like.
    


            “Right now, the private sector has nothing official to go on to have any sort of assurance, or any sort of confidence that whatever is going to happen, how is it going to be authorized based on US sanctions,” said Roxanna Vigil, who served as a senior sanctions policy advisor at the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    


            “My biggest concern related to all of this is how are the Venezuelan people going to benefit?” said Vigil. “Because the most vulnerable player in all of this and the one that so far has had the least say is the Venezuelan people.”
    


            Within the administration, the push to manage the immediate aftermath of Maduro's ouster has masked another looming problem: Despite Trump's insistence that US oil companies would pour into Venezuela, officials have no ready plan for convincing firms to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in rebuilding the nation's energy infrastructure.
    


            Wright held one-on-one meetings with oil executives on Wednesday after pitching the industry on Venezuela's potential, which he said would require “tens of billions of dollars and significant time.” Trump is set to host the CEOs of several major energy companies at the White House Friday in a further effort to juice enthusiasm within the sector.
    


            One energy lobbyist described frantic outreach from administration officials to the oil industry in recent days, starting with a flurry of calls on Monday aimed at fulfilling Trump's assertion that companies would quickly pledge massive investments toward restoring Venezuela.
    


            But those conversations have been largely one-sided, industry sources familiar with the discussions said.
    


            The administration is “trying to sell us on engaging and getting in,” the energy lobbyist said. “It's, ‘Hey look what we did for you. Now step up.'”
    


            That push has been met with trepidation in public and even deeper skepticism in private, the industry sources said, driven by doubts that Trump can provide the stability and security needed for companies to set up operations — and that the potential profits will be worth the risk.
    


            “Nobody wants to piss off Trump, but he's put them in a difficult position,” said another energy lobbyist, noting that executives have been spooked by reports of government repression and roving militias in the aftermath of Maduro's capture. “No company is going to say, I'll invest $3 billion and I'll go out and do the infrastructure without security.”
    


            Those concerns have extended even to some within the Trump administration, where one official told CNN it wasn't clear in the immediate hours after Maduro's capture who was in charge of coming up with a plan for the oil production — even as Trump publicly promised massive new investments.
    


            The official noted that before anything can happen, the United States will first have to ensure they can work with Rodriguez and her interim government. Wright and other officials in the meantime will have to develop a far more extensive sales pitch to convince companies to sign on to a project that some experts say could take a decade and $100 billion before it pays off in greater oil production.
    


            The Department of Energy has conducted some analysis on what exactly would need to be done in Venezuela to rebuild the oil infrastructure, including on the nation's energy grid.
    


            But industry experts told CNN that the country needed both equipment and expertise, both of which have largely dried up since the former President Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil companies in 2007 and seized their assets.
    


            “They all got screwed,” the administration official said of what, for many companies, was their last experience in Venezuela. “It's not clear yet what we we'll offer them to spend the billions needed to rebuild the infrastructure, and it's clearly a risk.”

            The Trump administration is pulling the United States out of the bedrock treaty that underpins international cooperation on climate change, along with dozens of other global bodies, according to a memorandum released by the White House Wednesday evening and an accompanying social media post.
    


            Such an action, if successful, would leave the US out of international climate change talks and could raise tensions with US allies for whom climate action is a priority.
    


            The agreement in question is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, which the US joined and Congress ratified in 1992, when George H.W. Bush was in the White House. The agreement does not require the US to cut fossil fuels or pollution, but rather sets a goal of stabilizing the amount of climate pollution in the atmosphere at a level that would “prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-caused) interference with the climate system.”
    


            It also set up a process for negotiations between countries that have come to be known as the annual UN climate summits. It was under the UNFCCC's auspices that the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1995, and the Paris Agreement in 2015 — two monumental moments of global cooperation and progress toward limiting harmful climate pollution.
    


            In addition, the agreement requires the submission of an annual national climate pollution inventory, which the Trump administration notably skipped this year.
    


            The exit from the climate treaty, and a slew of other international agencies, is another step back from the US on international cooperation.
    


            “We will not continue expending resources, diplomatic capital, and the legitimizing weight of our participation in institutions that are irrelevant to or in conflict with our interests,” Sec. of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. “We seek cooperation where it serves our people and will stand firm where it does not.”
    


            Former Sec. of State and US climate envoy John Kerry blasted the move as an expected one, yet damaging to American interests globally, calling it “a gift to China and a get out of jail free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.”
    


            President Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement for a second time on his first day in office. With Wednesday's move, the US will now become the first country to withdraw from the climate treaty, since virtually every country is a member, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
    


            Because the Senate ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, it is a legal gray area as to whether President Donald Trump can unilaterally pull the country out of it. However, if Congress plays a role, the Republican majority would presumably back the move.
    


            If successful, the withdrawal would prevent the US from officially participating in subsequent annual climate summits and could call into question the country's commitment to other longstanding agreements to which it is a party. It may also prompt other nations to reevaluate their commitments to the UNFCCC and UN climate talks, risking not just US climate progress but that of others.
    


            A US withdrawal could make it difficult for a future president to rejoin the Paris Agreement, since that agreement was struck under the auspices of the UNFCCC.
    


            The decision came following a review of major international agreements that the State Department had undertaken based on an executive order. In total, the White House directed the withdrawal of the US from 66 international organizations “that no longer serve American interests.”
    


            The list covers a wide swath of organizations and groups, including 31 UN entities, such as UN Water, UN Oceans, UN Population Fund, and the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.
    


            Trump also moved to withdraw the US from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC — a Nobel Prize-winning group that publishes reports on global warming. While the president likely can't bar US scientists from participating in IPCC reports, the move could have ramifications for federal scientists who would otherwise contribute.
    


            The list also included a number of non-UN related groups, including but not limited to the Global Counterterrorism Forum, the Pan American Institute of Geography and History, and the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine.
    


            The Trump administration has long denounced international organizations and has already withdrawn from some, like the World Health Organization.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Protesters confronted federal officers Thursday in Minneapolis the day after a woman was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

The demonstrations came amid heightened tensions after President Donald Trump's administration dispatched 2,000 officers and agents to Minnesota for its latest immigration crackdown. 

The killing of 37-year-old Renee Good on Wednesday set off a clash between federal officials who insist the shooting was an act of self-defense and Minneapolis officials who dispute that narrative.

Here's what is known about the shooting:

The woman was shot in her car in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where police killed George Floyd in 2020. Videos taken by bystanders and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped in the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. 

The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.




It is not clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer. The SUV then speeds into two cars parked on a curb nearby before coming to a stop. Witnesses can be heard shouting in shock.




Good died of gunshot wounds to the head.

She described herself on social media as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” from Colorado. Calls and messages to her family were not immediately returned.

Public records show Good had recently lived in Kansas City, Missouri, where she and another woman with the same home address had started a business last year called B. Good Handywork.

In a video posted from the scene on social media, a woman who describes Good as her wife is seen sitting near the vehicle sobbing. She says the couple had only recently arrived in Minnesota and they have a 6-year-old child.

Her killing is at least the fifth death to result from the aggressive U.S. immigration crackdown the Trump administration launched last year.

The ICE officer has not been publicly identified. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described him only as an experienced officer. She said the officer was hit by the vehicle during Wednesday's shooting and taken to a hospital. He has since been discharged.

“Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he's been taught to do in that situation, and took actions to defend himself and defend his fellow law enforcement officers,” Noem said.

Noem said officers were trying to push a vehicle out of the snow when protesters confronted them. She said the woman was blocking officers with her vehicle and refused to heed their commands before trying to run over one of them.

“This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism,” Noem said.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara gave no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone when he described the shooting to reporters.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called Noem's description of the events “garbage,” saying he had watched videos of the shooting that show it wasn't self-defense and was avoidable.

Meanwhile, the head of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said Thursday that federal prosecutors have barred the state agency from taking part in investigating the shooting.

BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said his agency had planned a joint investigation with the FBI but was later told that state investigators would have no access to evidence, witness interviews and other case materials. As a result, Evans said, the BCA has “reluctantly withdrawn” from the shooting investigation.

Dozens of protesters gathered Thursday morning outside a Minneapolis federal building being used a base for the immigration crackdown. Border Patrol officers fired tear gas and doused demonstrators with pepper spray to push them back from the gate.

Area schools were closed as a safety precaution as Gov. Tim Walz pleaded for calm. 

A vigil Wednesday night for the victim drew hundreds of people. A march through the city concluded without violence.

The United States says it has seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela in back-to-back actions in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday the U.S. has “maximum leverage” over Venezuela's interim authorities and will dictate their decisions, adding that Venezuelan oil marketing is already underway “for the benefit” of both countries.

The Interim President Delcy Rodriguez said on the Government Television that there's a stain on a relationship between Venezuela and the United States.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela's petroleum worldwide.

Trump's administration intends to control the distribution of Venezuela's oil products globally following its ouster of President Nicolás Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid. Besides the United States enforcing an existing oil embargo, the Energy Department says the “only oil transported in and out of Venezuela” will be through approved channels consistent with U.S. law and national security interests. 

That level of control over the world's largest proven reserves of crude oil could give the Trump administration a broader hold on oil supplies globally in ways that could enable it to influence prices. Both moves reflect the Republican administration's determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources after Trump pledged the U.S. will “run” the country.

Vice President JD Vance said in an interview the U.S. can “control” Venezuela's “purse strings” by dictating where its oil can be sold.

“We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime, you're allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America's national interest,” Vance said in an interview to air on Fox News Channel's “Jesse Watters Primetime.”




The vice president added, “And that's how we exert incredible pressure on that country without wasting a single American life.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that the oil taken from the sanctioned vessels seized in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea would be sold as part of the deal announced by Trump on Tuesday under which Venezuela would provide up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S.

Venezuela's interim authorities “want that oil that was seized to be part of this deal,” Rubio told reporters after briefing lawmakers Wednesday about the Maduro operation. “They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States.”

U.S. European Command said on social media that the merchant vessel Bella 1 was seized in the North Atlantic for “violations of U.S. sanctions.” The U.S. had been pursuing the tanker since last month after it tried to evade a blockade on sanctioned oil vessels around Venezuela.




Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revealed U.S. forces also took control of the M Sophia in the Caribbean Sea. Noem said on social media that both ships were “either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it.” 

The two ships join at least two others that were taken by U.S. forces last month — the Skipper and the Centuries.

The Bella 1 had been cruising across the Atlantic nearing the Caribbean on Dec. 15 when it abruptly turned and headed north, toward Europe. The change in direction came days after the first U.S. tanker seizure of a ship on Dec. 10 after it had left Venezuela carrying oil.

When the U.S. Coast Guard tried to board the Bella 1, it fled. U.S. European Command said a Coast Guard vessel had tracked the ship “pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court.”

As the U.S. pursued it, the Bella 1 was renamed Marinera and flagged to Russia, shipping databases show. A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, said the ship's crew had painted a Russian flag on the side of the hull.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said it had information about Russian nationals among the Marinera's crew and, in a statement carried by Russia's state news agencies Tass and RIA Novosti, demanded that “the American side ensure humane and dignified treatment of them, strictly respect their rights and interests, and not hinder their speedy return to their homeland.”

Separately, a senior Russian lawmaker, Andrei Klishas, decried the U.S. action as “blatant piracy.”

The Justice Department is investigating crew members of the Bella 1 vessel for failing to obey Coast Guard orders and “criminal charges will be pursued against all culpable actors,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

“The Department of Justice is monitoring several other vessels for similar enforcement action — anyone on any vessel who fails to obey instructions of the Coast Guard or other federal officials will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Bondi said on X.

The ship had been sanctioned by the U.S. in 2024 on allegations of smuggling cargo for a company linked to Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, is “selectively” removing sanctions to enable the shipping and sale of Venezuelan oil to markets worldwide, according to an outline of the policies published Wednesday by the Energy Department.

The sales are slated to begin immediately with 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil. The U.S. government said the sales “will continue indefinitely,” with the proceeds settling in U.S.-controlled accounts at “globally recognized banks.” The money would be disbursed to the U.S. and Venezuelan populations at the “discretion” of Trump's government.

Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA said it is in negotiations with the U.S. government for the sale of crude oil.

“This process is developed under schemes similar to those in force with international companies, such as Chevron, and is based on a strictly commercial transaction, with criteria of legality, transparency and benefit for both parties,” the company said in the statement.

Acting President Delcy Rodríguez on Wednesday night tried to normalize the latest chapter in U.S.-Venezuela economic relations, calling them “neither extraordinary nor irregular.”

“Venezuela must diversify its relations and have relations with all the countries of this hemisphere, just as it should with Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe,” she said during a televised meeting with lawmakers and senior government officials.

The U.S. plans to authorize the importation of oil field equipment, parts and services to increase Venezuela's oil production, which has been roughly 1 million barrels a day. 

The Trump administration has indicated it also will invest in the electricity grid to increase production and the quality of life for people in Venezuela, whose economy has been unraveling amid changes to foreign aid and cuts to state subsidies, making necessities, including food, unaffordable to millions.

Meanwhile, Trump abruptly changed his tone about Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Trump said Wednesday that they had exchanged a friendly phone call and he had invited the leader of the South American country to the White House. Trump had said earlier this week that “Colombia is very sick too” and accused Petro of ”making cocaine and selling it to the United States.” 

Noem said both seized ships were part of a shadow fleet of rusting oil tankers that smuggle oil for countries facing sanctions, such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran.

After the seizure of the now-named Marinera, which open-source maritime tracking sites showed was between Scotland and Iceland earlier Wednesday, the U.K. defense ministry said Britain's military provided support, including surveillance aircraft.

“This ship, with a nefarious history, is part of a Russian-Iranian axis of sanctions evasion which is fueling terrorism, conflict, and misery from the Middle East to Ukraine,” U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said.

The capture of the M Sophia, on the U.S. sanctions list for moving illicit cargos of oil from Russia, in the Caribbean was much less prolonged.

The ship had been “running dark,” not having transmitted location data since July. Tankers involved in smuggling often turn off their transponders or broadcast inaccurate data to hide their locations.

Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, said his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document that at least 16 tankers had left the Venezuelan coast since Saturday, after the U.S. captured Maduro. 

The M Sophia was among them, Madani said, citing a recent photo showing it in the waters near Jose Terminal, Venezuela's main oil export hub.

Windward, a maritime intelligence firm that tracks such vessels, said in a briefing to reporters the M Sophia loaded at the terminal on Dec. 26 and was carrying about 1.8 million barrels of crude oil — a cargo that would be worth about $108 million at current price of about $60 a barrel.

A series of mild eruptions at the most active volcano in the Philippines has prompted the evacuation of nearly 3,000 villagers in a permanent danger zone on its foothills, officials said Wednesday.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A series of mild eruptions at the most active volcano in the Philippines has prompted the evacuation of nearly 3,000 villagers from a danger zone on its foothills, officials said Wednesday.

Authorities raised the 5-step alert around Mayon Volcano in the northeastern province of Albay to level 3 on Tuesday after detecting intermittent rockfalls, some as big as cars, from its peak crater in recent days along with deadly pyroclastic flows — a fast-moving avalanche of super-hot rock fragments, ash and gas.

Alert level 5 would indicate that a major explosive eruption, often with violent ejections of ash and debris and widespread ashfall, is underway.

“This is already an eruption, a quiet one, with lava accumulating up the peak and swelling the dome, which cracked in some parts and resulted in rockfalls, some as big as cars,” Teresito Bacolcol, the country's chief volcanologist, told The Associated Press.

He said it is too early to tell if Mayon's restiveness would worsen and lead to a major and violent eruption given the absence of other key signs of unrest, like a spike in volcanic earthquakes and high levels of sulfur dioxide emissions.

Troops, police and disaster-mitigation personnel helped evacuate more than 2,800 villagers from 729 households inside a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) radius from the volcano's crater that officials have long designated a permanent danger zone, demarcated by concrete warning signs, Albay provincial officials said.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Another 600 villagers living outside the permanent danger zone have evacuated voluntarily to government-run emergency shelters to be safely away from the volcano, Claudio Yucot, regional director of the Office of Civil Defense, said.




Entry to the permanent danger zone in the volcano's foothills is prohibited, but thousands of villagers have flouted the restrictions and made it their home or maintained farms on and off for generations. Lucrative businesses, such as sand and gravel quarrying and sightseeing tours, have also thrived openly despite the ban and the mountain's frequent eruptions — now 54 times since records began in 1616.

The 2,462-meter (8,007-foot) volcano is one of the Philippines' top tourism draws because of its near-perfect cone shape. But it's also the most active of the country's 24 restive volcanoes.

A terrifying symbol of Mayon's deadly fury is the belfry of a 16th-century Franciscan stone church which protrudes from the ground in Albay. It's all that's left of a baroque church that was buried by volcanic mudflow along with the town of Cagsawa in an 1814 eruption which killed about 1,200 people, including many who sought refuge in the church, about 13 kilometers (8 miles) from the volcano.

The thousands of people who live within Mayon's danger zone reflect the plight of many impoverished Filipinos who are forced to live in dangerous places across the archipelago — near active volcanoes like Mayon, on landslide-prone mountainsides, along vulnerable coastlines, atop earthquake fault lines, and in low-lying villages often engulfed by flash floods.

Each year, about 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines, which lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of fault lines along the Pacific Ocean basin often hit by volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

SCHIPHOL, Netherlands (AP) — More than 1,000 stranded passengers spent the night at Amsterdam's international airport as snow and ice that is pummeling parts of Europe grounded hundreds of flights and choked highways and railroads Wednesday.

In Paris, a skier slid along the snowy bank of the Seine river and roads and parks around the Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum were blanketed in snow, which also snarled traffic in parts of France.

There was good news for some Berlin residents during the cold snap as power was being restored to thousands of households in the German capital that had been without electricity in freezing temperatures for four days following a suspected far-left attack on high-voltage lines, authorities said.

Schiphol Airport, on the outskirts of Amsterdam, set up hundreds of field beds overnight and served breakfast to weary travelers as staff worked to clear snow from runways and deice airplanes. At least 800 flights were canceled Wednesday at the airport, one of Europe's busiest aviation hubs.

Sonja Wurmlingel, trying to make her way home to Argentina, had to endure repeated disappointments and still was not sure how she would get back. She originally was supposed to fly via the German city of Düsseldorf, but that flight was canceled. Then she was rerouted through Paris, but that was canceled, too. The next option was taking a train to Düsseldorf.

“I've come from the train and they told me there's no train,” she said, adding, after a long pause: “I don't know.”




National airline KLM said that lines at the airport were decreasing, in part because passengers were warned on time that their flights were canceled, so they didn't head to the airport.

The Dutch rail and road networks were also hard hit by fresh snowfall during the morning rush hour and more squalls later in the day.

Rail operator NS urged travelers to “delay your journey if possible.” It warned of fewer trains operating as problems caused by the snow and icy temperatures in the Netherlands hit train travel harder than expected. Both domestic and international trains were affected, NS said.

Drivers braving the snowy conditions didn't fare much better, with more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) of traffic jams clogging the country's roads as trucks slid across highways and slow-moving snow plows cleared the roads.

France's national weather service, Meteo France, said large parts of northern and western France, including the Paris region, were on alert for snow and black ice. French authorities advised people to work from home and avoid using their cars in the snow-hit regions. Trucks and school buses were banned from using the roads. Bus traffic was suspended in Paris on Wednesday morning.

Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said that more than 100 flights were canceled Wednesday at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport and about 40 others at Paris Orly airport.

French railway company SNCF warned passengers about disruptions and delays because of weather conditions, saying that “snow on the tracks is forcing us to limit train speed and cancel trains or adjust traffic.” Eurostar trains between Paris, London and Brussels were also being delayed.

Even countries more accustomed to harsh winter weather reported problems as the snowy snap endured over large parts of Europe.

There was heavy snow in western Sweden, and authorities in Göteborg took all the city's trams out of service Wednesday morning because of the weather, broadcaster SVT reported. Snow banks churned up by passing trams posed a risk to other traffic.

In Finland, difficulties starting diesel buses that had been standing in the cold over the holidays and poor driving conditions led to bus cancellations and delays in the Helsinki area, Finnish broadcaster Yle reported.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)












SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Steve Kerr upset his mother. 

Ann Kerr was mortified by the behavior of her 60-year-old coaching son, for the first time in quite a while.

She didn't approve of Kerr's ejection in the fourth quarter of a one-point loss to the Clippers on Monday night, when the Warriors coach was held back from the officials by Gary Payton II, Gui Santos and assistant Terry Stotts.

“All good other than my mom being terribly disappointed in me,” Kerr said of his 91-year-old mom before Golden State's home game Wednesday against Milwaukee. “She was at the game, she looked horrified afterwards. She asked me if I was going to hit the referee. I said, ‘Mom, I've never hit anybody in my life,' and she said, ‘it looked like you were going to hit him, why were all of those men holding you back?' That's all part of the theatrics. She didn't understand. I was a little alarmed that she thought I was actually going to hit somebody, that scared me.”

Kerr received back-to-back technical fouls and his fifth career ejection after becoming angry with official John Collins over a missed goaltending call, according to Stotts.

“I'm happy she got on Steve, that's great,” Draymond Green said.

Two days later, Kerr didn't want to discuss exactly what set him off, saying, “there's a reason Terry did media the other night” after the game.

“I was upset about a couple calls,” he added. 




Stephen Curry appreciated Kerr's outburst, even if it disappointed his mom. And Curry has been scolded by his mom plenty of times, too.

“I've seen worse for sure, I couldn't tell you exactly when but I know it's been worse, but that's a good mother-son relationship and that she's watching every game and locked in and cares as much as she does to call him out,” Curry said. “But we needed that fire, so Mrs. Kerr, we forgive him for sure.” 

Bucks coach Doc Rivers joked he was disappointed in Kerr.

“He acted like a fool, and I'm done with that from Steve,” said Rivers, who upset his late mother, Bettye, a time or two. “My mom was a church-going lady and I wasn't using the right language one game and she called and let me have it. It's interesting ‘cause you say ‘I'm sorry' but do you know the next day you're going to do it again. So it's a tough one.”

Kerr said his mom had questioned him before whether he was going to hit someone, but it had been a while.

“Maybe my little brother,” Kerr said with a grin, making his exit from pregame duties.

Kai Trump may have politics in her family, but do not expect her to get into it.

At age 18, President Donald Trump's granddaughter is set to play college golf next fall at the University of Miami and just recently made her debut on the LPGA Tour in November.

Trump hopes to become a professional one day, but one thing that seems certain is that she will not turn to politics later in life.

""To be honest with you, I stay out of politics completely. I would never run, I don't want anything to do with politics,"" Trump said during an appearance on Logan Paul's podcast. ""I feel like politics is such a dangerous thing, and I think if both sides met in the middle, everyone would be so much more happier.""

Trump said people have gotten ""too extreme"" on both sides of the coin, and social media has driven people to hone in on their beliefs.

KAI TRUMP REVEALS 'AWKWARD' REALITY OF DATING WITH SECRET SERVICE AGENTS WATCHING FROM NEARBY TABLES

""There's not a lot of things on social media where you're very much in the middle. And I think that kind of makes some people crazy and some people buy into it too much,"" Trump added. ""I think that's like the best way to say it. There's no bad blood. I'm very much in the middle and kind of like, it is what it is. They ran against each other [Trump and Kamala Harris]. Obviously, I'm gonna support my grandpa, my family member, but that's pretty much it.""

The closest Trump has dove into the political waters was when she spoke at the Republican National Convention just days after her grandfather was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania.

In an interview with Fox News Digital in October, Trump said she was ""proud"" of her grandfather after he brokered the historic ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Sen. John Fetterman , D-Pa., joins 'Fox & Friends' to weigh in on the arrest and indictment of Nicolás Maduro as Democrats criticize President Donald Trump's action against the alleged narco-terrorist.

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., expressed support for the idea of the U.S. buying Greenland, which is linked to the nation of Denmark.

""I believe Greenland has massive strategic benefits for the United States. I do not support taking it by force. America is not a bully. Ideally, we purchase it — similar to our purchases of Alaska or the Louisiana Purchase. Acquiring Greenland is a many decades-old conversation,"" the senator noted in a Wednesday post on X.

In a Fox News appearance last year, Fetterman had similarly noted that he would not support forcibly seizing Greenland but expressed an openness to the prospect of purchasing the land. He pointed to the Louisiana Purchase and the Alaska Purchase.

President Donald Trump has been eyeing the island, categorizing the U.S. acquiring the territory as a national security matter.

In a 2024 Truth Social post, he asserted, ""For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.""

DEM SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO STOP TRUMP FROM INVADING ‘ANOTHER COUNTRY ON A WHIM' OVER GREENLAND

During a Sunday news gaggle aboard Air Force One, he said, ""We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security. And the European Union needs us to have it.""

Trump has previously floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in the past, but the commander-in-chief spoke about the Artic territory recently when someone brought it up during the gaggle on Air Force One after the U.S. operation in Venezuela that captured Nicolás Maduro. Since then, the president said the U.S. is in charge of Venezuela and will be for the foreseeable future until a secure transition of power can take place.

In a Fox News appearance on Monday, Fetterman described the U.S. capture of Maduro as a ""good thing,"" calling the operation ""surgical.""

""Removing Maduro was positive for Venezuela. As a Democrat, I don't understand why we can't acknowledge a good development for Venezuelans — and how deft our military's execution of that plan was,"" he noted in a Tuesday post on X.

When announcing new dietary guidelines, Health and Human Services Secretary RFK Jr. said U.S. adversaries could strategize to weaken the country by getting Americans addicted to ultra-processed foods.

The Trump administration has taken a new approach to the food pyramid.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced new guidelines on Wednesday with an updated, inverted pyramid. The top of the pyramid, which is now the wider part of the structure, is built on meat, fats, fruits and vegetables, while whole grains are at the narrow bottom.

This follows HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s mission to ""Make America Healthy Again"" (MAHA), aimed at addressing chronic disease, childhood illnesses and ultraprocessed foods.

""The new guidelines recognize that whole, nutrient-dense food is the most effective path to better health and lower health care costs,"" Kennedy said during a press briefing in Washington, D.C. 

""Protein and healthy fats are essential, and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines. We are ending the war on saturated fats.""

The HHS secretary rallied against refined carbohydrates, food additives and added sugar, highlighting the health risks associated with sugar-sweetened beverages. 

Kennedy's main message to Americans was to ""eat real food.""

TRUMP ADMIN'S NEW NUTRITION GUIDELINES TARGET ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS, EASE UP ON RED MEAT AND SATURATED FATS

The announcement triggered reactions from top health and wellness voices, including Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman, host of the ""Huberman Lab"" podcast.

In a post on X, Huberman shared the White House's graphic of the new pyramid, praising the decisions that were made.

""Oatmeal (and I think that's rice and sourdough) made the cut!"" he commented. ""In all seriousness, assuming overall calories are kept in check and people exercise & get sun(day)light, this looks spot on.""

He added, ""Maybe up the veggies a bit, add low-sugar fermented foods like sauerkraut & this is great.""

Huberman said in a thread on the same post that Americans ""don't have to eat all the foods"" shown in the diagram.

""You won't see me drinking milk or eating shrimp,"" he said. ""Nothing against shrimp, I just don't like the taste. Aversion to crustaceans.""

""Maybe up the veggies a bit, add low-sugar fermented foods like sauerkraut & this is great,"" Huberman commented on X. (Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images; iStock)

The new guidelines received praise from other major health figures, including former FDA commissioner Dr. David Kessler.

""There should be broad agreement that eating more whole foods and reducing highly processed carbohydrates is a major advance in how we approach diet and health,"" Kessler told The Associated Press.

""Protein and healthy fats are essential, and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines.""

Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association, shared in a statement that these guidelines ""affirm that food is medicine and offer clear direction patients and physicians can use to improve health.""

""The American Medical Association applauds the Administration's new Dietary Guidelines for spotlighting the highly processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages and excess sodium that fuel heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other chronic illnesses,"" Mukkamala wrote.

But not all feedback was positive.

Some people expressed concern about prioritizing red meat and dairy, while calling for the limitation of saturated fat.

Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, shared in a reaction to STAT that while the guidelines ""do have one or two good points, emphasizing fruits and vegetables and limiting alcohol,"" the guidelines are ""for the most part a strong reflection of industry influence.""

Christopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford University, also spoke out against the new guidelines, as reported by NPR.

""I'm very disappointed in the new pyramid that features red meat and saturated fat sources at the very top, as if that's something to prioritize. It does go against decades and decades of evidence and research,"" said Gardner, who was a member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and former I.C.E. special agent Tim Miller criticize Minneapolis' 'explosive' environment after a fatal I.C.E.-involved shooting on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Democratic lawmakers are increasingly calling to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after a federal agent shot and killed a woman in Minnesota on Wednesday.

The defunding push is creating problems for lead Democrats, however, as they argued earlier this week that any attempt to defund ICE is off the table. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have emphasized that the Affordable Care Act remains their priority.

Nevertheless, Wednesday's killing of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis has galvanized ranks of Democrats.

""Certainly everyone in that room, at least on my side, is livid at what happened to this woman,"" said Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., who has previously called for a government shutdown to defund ICE. ""Not just a resident of Minnesota, a U.S. citizen... a 37-year-old White woman, was shot, and then they lied about it.""

""They're disappearing people off the street, and this has nothing to do with citizenship at all, increasingly, in who they're going after,"" argued Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., said Wednesday that she plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Noem.

""Secretary Kristi Noem is an incompetent leader, a disgrace to our democracy, and I am impeaching her for obstruction of justice, violation of public trust, and self-dealing,"" Kelly said. ""Secretary Noem wreaked havoc in the Chicagoland area, and now, her rogue ICE agents have unleashed that same destruction in Minneapolis, fatally shooting Renee Nicole Good.""

While Kelly's effort is more far-fetched, Democrats seeking to throw a wrench in the legislative process over ICE funding could potentially see some success.

Fox News host Jesse Watters says that the officer who fired in the deadly I.C.E.-involved shooting ‘felt that his life was in danger' on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.' 

Republican lawmakers are urging President Donald Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after the Democrat warned he could deploy the National Guard in response to federal immigration enforcement actions in his state.

""Invoke the Insurrection Act. Arrest Tim Walz,"" Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., said in a post to X on Wednesday evening. 

Miller's calls to apply the law, which gives the president powers to arrest suspects obstructing federal law enforcement, follow Walz's suggestion that he might deploy the National Guard to push back on President Donald Trump's use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

""We do not need any further help from the federal government. To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough. I've issued a warning order to prepare the Minnesota National Guard,"" Walz said in a press event.

Walz's warning on Wednesday came on the heels of a deadly encounter between ICE and a woman. A law enforcement officer shot Renee Nicole Good, 37, when she confronted agents from inside her car in Minneapolis, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

""We have soldiers in training and prepared to be deployed if necessary. I remind you, a warning order is a heads-up for folks,"" Walz said. ""Minnesota will not allow our community to be used as a prop in a national political fight.""

Under Minnesota law, Walz has the power to deploy the National Guard for the ""defense or relief of the state, the enforcement of the law, [or] the protection of persons"" in the state.

Other Republicans reacting to Walz's warning also believe such an action could trigger the use of the act.

""Someone remind him: Donald Trump is the Commander in Chief. And federal authority supersedes state authority. That's not an opinion, that's the Constitution,"" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said in her own post.

Fox News senior foreign policy correspondent Gillian Turner reports on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assessment of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine on ‘Special Report.' 

President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a presidential memorandum directing the U.S. to withdraw from 66 international organizations, ordering executive departments and agencies to cease participation in and funding of entities the administration says no longer serve U.S. interests.

The memorandum follows a State Department review ordered earlier this year under Executive Order 14199 and applies to 35 non-United Nations organizations and 31 United Nations entities, according to the White House.

In the memorandum, Trump said he reviewed Secretary Rubio's findings and determined it is ""contrary to the interests of the U.S. to remain a member of, participate in, or otherwise provide support"" to the listed organizations.

The order directs all executive departments and agencies to take immediate steps to effectuate the withdrawals as soon as possible. For United Nations entities, withdrawal means ceasing participation in or funding to the extent permitted by law.

The administration framed the move as part of Trump's broader ""America First"" agenda aimed at restoring American sovereignty and ending taxpayer support for organizations it views as wasteful, ineffective or contrary to U.S. interests. 

Review of additional international organizations remains ongoing, according to the White House.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the withdrawals fulfill a key commitment of Trump's presidency.

""Today, President Trump announced the U.S. is leaving 66 anti-American, useless, or wasteful international organizations,"" Rubio said in a post on X. ""Review of additional international organizations remains ongoing.""

Rubio said the administration concluded the institutions were ""redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity.""

""It is no longer acceptable to be sending these institutions the blood, sweat, and treasure of the American people, with little to nothing to show for it,"" Rubio said. ""The days of billions of dollars in taxpayer money flowing to foreign interests at the expense of our people are over.""

The list includes organizations involved in areas such as climate, energy, development, governance, migration and gender policy, according to the White House. The White House published the full list alongside the order.

Rubio said the withdrawals reflect a shift in how the administration views international engagement.

""We will not continue expending resources, diplomatic capital, and the legitimizing weight of our participation in institutions that are irrelevant to or in conflict with our interests,"" Rubio said. ""We seek cooperation where it serves our people and will stand firm where it does not.""

President Donald Trump suffered a rare setback Thursday after the Republican-led Senate narrowly advanced a bipartisan measure to restrict further military operations against Venezuela without congressional approval.

The Senate voted 52-47 on a procedural step for the war powers resolution, with five Republicans joining Democrats to support the measure, marking a significant rebuke of Trump's actions in Venezuela after a military operation that deposed former dictator Nicolas Maduro. Republicans were broadly supportive of the operation, but the vote reflects growing unease over the lack of congressional notification and how the administration plans to manage the transition.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a co-author of the resolution, along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins (R-ME), Todd Young (R-IN), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) were the Republicans who crossed the aisle to support the measure.

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was the lone undecided Democrat going into the vote, but he ultimately stuck with his party on Thursday.

The outcome is a shift from two unsuccessful war power votes in the Senate, spurred last year by the Pentagon's campaign against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea. Thursday's vote was on whether to bring the resolution to the Senate floor, meaning it has yet to pass the Senate but likely has the necessary support.

House lawmakers are mounting their own bipartisan effort to pass a war powers resolution, but the efforts have been largely symbolic given Trump's ability to veto. The GOP House narrowly rejected a similar vote in December 2025, keeping all but three Republicans in line with the rest of the party.

Collins, a centrist up for reelection in battleground Maine, said Trump's openness to a drawn-out U.S. presence in Venezuela justifies the need for Congress to reaffirm its authority.

“I believe invoking the War Powers Act at this moment is necessary, given the president's comments about the possibility of ‘boots on the ground' and a sustained engagement ‘running' Venezuela, with which I do not agree,” Collins said in a statement.

Top administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and War Secretary Pete Hegseth, insisted to lawmakers during all-member classified briefings on the eve of the vote that the president's actions have been warranted and properly executed under his constitutional authority.

WHY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS CALLING THE MADURO MISSION A ‘LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATION'

The administration is in the midst of selling off up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that the United States will use to leverage the country's transition of government.

“They are not generating any revenue from their oil right now,” Rubio told reporters Wednesday. “They can't move it, unless we allow it to move because we have sanctions, because we're enforcing those sanctions. This is tremendous leverage. We are exercising it in a positive way. They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The House of Representatives will hold a vote on Thursday to extend government subsidies for the Affordable Care Act for three years. 

The scheduled vote is the work of a bipartisan coalition of representatives who circumvented House Speaker Mike Johnson‘s (R-LA) support, according to Fox News's Chad Pergram. Johnson is believed to be against a vote on the Obamacare subsidies. 

House set to vote on bill to renew Obamacare subsidies for 3 years today. Bipartisan coalition went around the Speaker to put this on the floor to force a vote

“House set to vote on bill to renew Obamacare subsidies for 3 years today,” Pergram said in a post on X early Thursday morning. “Bipartisan coalition went around the Speaker to put this on the floor to force a vote.”

Nine Republicans joined Democrats in a procedural vote on Wednesday to allow Thursday's vote to proceed. It is expected to pass the House on Thursday, but could face significant hurdles in the Senate.

The vote comes after the government subsidies expired at the end of 2025. They were an integral part of domestic policy discussions for the last few months of 2025 and were one of the main reasons for the government shutdown that lasted 43 days, the longest shutdown in the nation's history.

Despite these challenges, a bipartisan group of senators has been working on a deal for the subsidies. Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) has been one of the GOP senators involved in negotiations and expressed cautious optimism at the chances of an agreement moving forward in the Senate. 

“We're in the red zone,” Moreno told NPR on Wednesday. “But that does not mean a touchdown. It could mean a 95-yard fumble.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Senate Democrats spent lavishly on luxury retreats during government shutdown, filings show","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/4410319/senate-democrats-on-luxury-retreats-during-government-shutdown-filings-show/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT","

During the government shutdown of fall 2025, the Senate Democrats' campaign arm went on a spending spree, generously wining and dining deep-pocketed donors at luxury locales across the country, according to recently disclosed expense reports reviewed by the Washington Examiner.

While federal employees were either furloughed or worked without pay, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) splurged on high-end hotel stays, travel, and catering costs, including eye-popping sums spent at an oceanside resort and a retreat in wine country.

Republicans in Congress had blamed the record-breaking shutdown, which marked a period of financial strife for many members of the federal workforce, on the Senate Democrats who repeatedly blocked a short-term funding bill over demands to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies.

Democrats in the Senate, meanwhile, pointed fingers at GOP lawmakers, accusing congressional Republicans of “sending premiums skyrocketing instead of working with Democrats to protect affordable health care.”

However, as the threat of another government shutdown looms, the Senate Democrats' spending receipts from the fall appear to sour their claims that, by filibustering, they were fully focused on fighting financially for the working class.

For instance, on Oct. 2, day two of the shutdown, the DSCC tossed $62,415 toward an apparent fundraising retreat at a five-star resort on Sea Island, a privately owned island part of Georgia's Golden Isles.

The coastal getaway boasts horseback rides along the island's sandy shores, daybeds at the beach bar, and a state-of-the-art spa, with signature services such as Swedish massages, custom aromatherapy, a eucalyptus-infused steam room, and guided meditation labyrinth walks meant to “gently direct you away from the distractions of daily life.”

Around two weeks into the shutdown, on Oct. 13 and 14, the DSCC was slated to host donors at an overnight “Napa Retreat,” featuring a tour of the vineyards, according to an invitation obtained first by Politico.

Despite political opponents warning that the two-day trip reveling in California's wine region would appear wildly out of touch with constituents, the DSCC put money toward the retreat anyway, dropping $10,341.24 on a booking at the Hotel Yountville, the event's originally planned venue.

Located in the “culinary capital of Napa Valley,” the premier hotel is known for its Tuscan-European aesthetic. Guests there can pamper themselves at the estate's oasis and enjoy a glass of wine between “vino therapy,” a full-body exfoliation with Cabernet-enriched salt scrub, followed by Chardonnay grape seed oil.

DSCC's chairwoman, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), told the Washington Examiner in October that their plans could change if the shutdown dragged on.

“Right now, we're focused on getting healthcare restored to millions of people, and I'll make a decision on that later,” Gillibrand said of the respite in paradise.

Reports at the time indicated that the major fundraiser still proceeded as planned. On Tuesday, Gillibrand's office acknowledged but chose to “ignore” the Washington Examiner's latest request for confirmation that Gillibrand attended.

Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), who appeared at the top of the invite, denied that she was one of the hosts and said she would not participate should the shutdown persist.

“I'm not hosting anything,” Alsobrooks previously told the Washington Examiner. “When we have a shutdown, we're not going to be in Napa Valley.” 

A spokesman for Alsobrooks reaffirmed this week that the senator did not attend the event in question.

At the end of October, the DSCC paid Hotel Yountville an additional $1,480.25, although it is unclear if that disbursement is tied to the earlier excursion.

Separately, on Oct. 29, the DSCC issued a $21,964.34 check to the Hotel Bennett in Charleston, South Carolina, reporting the transaction's purpose as a fundraising activity.

Frequently ranked the No. 1. hotel in the city, the boutique hotel received a near-perfect rating from the Michelin Guide. It is known for combining Southern elegance with French-inspired accommodations intended to transport patrons to the streets of Paris.

That month, the DSCC also recorded dozens of travel and meals-related charges to American Express totaling more than $135,000. Earmarked for campaign materials and fundraising purposes, the payments, all occurring on Oct. 27, broadly covered transportation, event expenses, catering services, and venue fees.

When contacted by the Washington Examiner, the DSCC noted that Oct. 27 is the date that the American Express bills were paid, not necessarily the date of each individual charge. According to past filings, the DSCC typically paid off its American Express bills on or around the 27th of each month.

As for when exactly the American Express expenditures occurred, the DSCC did not respond to multiple follow-up requests for comment addressing whether they took place pre-shutdown.

The campaign committee also did not respond to inquiries about its payments concerning the Sea Island Resort and the Napa Valley retreat.

During the historically long shutdown, Republicans had highlighted the optics of Senate Democrats, who refused to extend government spending at current levels over the healthcare dispute, jetting off to luxurious locales to rub elbows with wealthy elites, but both parties had their fair share of hobnobbing at shutdown soirees.

SHUTDOWN SENDS CAMPAIGNS INTO OVERDRIVE TO SEIZE ON GOVERNMENT CHAOS

The National Republican Senatorial Committee spent considerable campaign funds on courting donors during the shutdown.

On Oct. 3 and 4, the NRSC was scheduled to host its own high-dollar fundraising retreat at the Sea Island Resort. Marketed as the committee's “Fall Meeting,” the stay included a weekend of golf, pickleball, fishing, shooting, and afternoon lawn games. Invitees were offered beach club bedroom suites and oceanview rooms at a nearly $600-per-night rate.

However, the committee's Federal Election Commission disclosures that fall did not document payments to the Sea Island Company, other than a mere $45.97 spent on food and beverages in October, as well as $40,000 on facility rental fees in June, and another $40,000 disbursement in July.

According to Axios, the weekend extravaganza was not canceled in light of the standstill on Capitol Hill. Sea Island attendees reportedly received an email from organizers telling them: “These events are reserved and contracted years in advance — beyond even our current term at the NRSC — and both our costs and attendees' rooms are non-refundable.”

The show likely went on at the staff level, Axios speculated, with the 20 or so senators set to attend largely bailing and those who did appear attending incognito. Even when legislators are no-shows at events, senior aides and political advisers typically still get to schmooze with donors.

Sources similarly told Bloomberg Government that the hotel rooms had already been paid for and the retreat itself was booked well before talks of a government shutdown. Lobbyists said the logistics of scrapping a large, long-planned sojourn would be difficult and costly.

The NRSC did not reply to repeated requests for comment.

In the lead-up to the fundraising fete, the NRSC couched it as necessary to build the GOP's base ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

“Schumer continuing to shut down the government because he wants to give free healthcare to illegals only further underscores how essential it is [that] Republicans protect and grow President Trump's Senate majority next year,” NRSC spokeswoman Joanna Rodriguez wrote in a previous statement.

On Oct. 14, the NRSC sent $34,738.60 to the Newport Beach Country Club, although the transaction, categorized under catering and facility usage, was marked as an administrative cost. A frequent gathering spot for fundraisers, the invitation-only California country club has hosted numerous GOP events over the years, primarily for the Republican Party of Orange County.

ISLAND FUNDRAISERS, ROOFTOP SOIREES, AND A BABYDOG BIRTHDAY BONANZA: WASHINGTON SHRUGS AT SHUTDOWN OPTICS

There was also a big Senate GOP bash planned over Columbus Day weekend in Kiawah Island, a barrier island off the coast of South Carolina. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) was initially scheduled to attend but he had pulled out, per Punchbowl News.

That trip, too, had long been on the books, according to fundraising appeals from earlier in the year. Federal Election Commission disclosures show that the Fund for America's Future, a Republican-aligned PAC, gave the Kiawah Island Golf Resort $5,640 on Oct. 3.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A few short years ago, as the Biden administration pushed to redefine Title IX on the (spurious) premise that the word “sex” meant “gender identity.” There was significant reason to fear that gender ideology indoctrination would become a permanent feature of American public education. However, as 2026 begins, the grip of gender ideology in schools is more tenuous than ever; not only because of the Trump administration's actions, but also because the courts have caught up to the constitutional violations inherent in such indoctrination.  

Gender ideology indoctrination in schools is a three-legged stool: (1) teachers directly instruct students in the tenets of gender ideology; (2) schools force students to use “preferred pronouns” when their peers identify as the other sex; (3) schools prohibit staff from telling parents when they socially gender transition their children. 

Three major court decisions this year have taken an axe, respectively, to each of those three legs.  

In June, the Supreme Court ruled in Mahmoud v. Taylor that if schools could not teach lessons endorsing gender ideology, without they must allow offering parents the option of opting their children out of lessons teaching that content. Religious parents in Montgomery County, Maryland — represented by the Becket Fund — claimed their First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion was being violated when the school mandated that the curriculum contain books and lessons promoting gender ideology without providing parents the option to remove their children from these lessons that contradicted their faith. Although the families had different faith backgrounds, their sacred scriptures all teach that God created two sexes: male and female. By undermining that basic teaching, the public schools were undermining the faith formation of religious students. “It is both insulting and unserious,” Justice Alito wrote, “to tell parents that they must abstain from public education in order to raise their child in their religious faith.” 

Last month, the full panel of the Sixth Circuit, sitting en banc, ruled in favor of Parents Defending Education, a parental rights group, over the Olentangy School District of Ohio. The Court required the school district to drop its policy of punishing students who use biologically correct, rather than transgender “preferred,” pronouns was unconstitutional. Schools may still, of course, discipline students who tease or taunt their peers based on appearance or dress; but not for merely referring to a boy as “him.” In his concurrence, Judge John Bush wrote: “This case is about a government attempt to alter traditional grammar. If the issue seems odd, that's because it is.” But perhaps not so odd, because as Judges Amul Thapar and John Nalbandian concurred, “The battle of the pronouns is a matter of serious political and social concern,” on which the school has clearly taken one partisan side.

This constitutes impermissible viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment. Not to mention that, as Judge Bush put it, the “government simply cannot regulate grammar — full stop.” 

And right before Christmas, California parents got a gift from a federal judge: a class action injunction against state and school district mandates that kept social gender transitioning secret from parents. The facts of one of the cases are harrowing: A girl asked the school to socially transition her at the beginning of the 2022-23 school year. The school not only did not tell the parents about their daughter's request but actively deceived them at a back-to-school night; her teachers used her legal name and true sex when talking to her parents. When the parents discovered the school employee's deception, they confronted the principal — who outright lied to them about it.  

“As it turned out,” the court wrote, the girl's “change in gender expression was a tremendously significant sign. The (…) parents did not learn of their child's deteriorated mental health until after she attempted suicide. Adding insult to constitutional injury, California public schools still refuse to use the child's given female name in spite of the … parents' instructions.” 

A doctor who reviewed the girl's medical history stated that if the parents had been informed, there could have been coordinated mental health care “so there would be no September hospitalization, there would be no multiple psychotropic drugs, there would not be a girl who is hallucinating. We could have prevented all of this. We wouldn't be sitting here today.”  

The school's conduct violated the parents' 14th Amendment “fundamental right of [these] parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” that is protected by the 14th Amendment. The court held that parents have a “federal constitutional right to be informed if their public-school child expresses gender incongruence,” a federal right that is “superior to any state or local law … regulation … or policy to the contrary.”  

Of course, just because the courts have declared these practices unconstitutional doesn't mean schools will drop them. In his concurrence in Mahmoud, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that “the courts should carefully police” such “ingenious defiance of the Constitution [in schools] no less than in other contexts.”  

But for the courts to safeguard constitutional protections in schools, parents must bring legal complaints to them. With plenty of federal court precedent now at their disposal, and local trial attorneys eager to do well by doing good, such a prospect is now realistic. 

WYOMING SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN ABORTION BANS

The notion of “parental rights” in schools is no longer oppositional rhetoric but established constitutional reality. If a fraction of the parents who showed up to school board meetings to stand up for their rights in 2021 start filing legal complaints in 2026, we could see a serious and lasting rollback in gender indoctrination in schools across the country.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Two Sides of America's Health Secretary","https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-dietary-guidelines-food-vaccines/685546/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 01:33:00 GMT","

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a very different approach to food than to vaccines.

Since he was confirmed as Health and Human Services secretary early last year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previewed big changes to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans—the government's go-to guide on what to eat, and how much of it. Rewritten only every five years, the dietary guidelines are ubiquitous in American life: The food pyramid, launched in the 1990s, is a result of the document. The guidelines determine what millions of kids eat in school cafeterias every day.



Chief among those supposedly forthcoming changes that Kennedy has promised is a dramatic rethinking of how the United States deals with saturated fat. For decades, the dietary guidelines have recommended that people get no more than 10 percent of their daily calories from these fats because they increase bad cholesterol. But Kennedy is a saturated-fat evangelist. The HHS secretary, who has said that he follows a “carnivore diet,” once famously prepared a Thanksgiving turkey by submerging the raw bird in a vat of beef tallow.



Surprisingly, the new guidelines, which were released earlier today, retain the exact same recommendation about saturated fat that Kennedy seems to loathe. During a press briefing, he declared that the guidelines “end the war on saturated fat.” The guidelines do plug beef tallow as a “healthy fat” and say that Americans should get some of their protein from red meat. (The previous version says that a healthy diet includes “relatively lower consumption of red and processed meats.”) But all of that is hardly a dramatic change in how Americans should approach saturated food.



What happened? Despite all of Kennedy's bluster, the revisions appear to be built much more around incremental change than around any all-out war on established health wisdom. Kennedy and his staff appear to understand that an embrace of saturated fat is controversial. “It was our goal for this report to not be ‘activist'—and only make statements that are widely accepted by the latest nutritional research,” Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told me in a statement. “No universal nutrition recommendation will be agreed on by everyone in the nutrition research field—nor should it,” he added. Indeed, there is little evidence to back up the adoption of an explicitly pro-fat diet. The American Heart Association, for example, recommends that fewer than 6 percent of daily calories come from saturated fat.



Overall, the new dietary guidelines focus on a much less controversial take-home message than “Make Frying Oil Tallow Again.” The takeaway, as Kennedy put it in a post on X, is “EAT REAL FOOD.” One of the biggest points of emphasis is on the importance of eating more protein—which already is a popular message among Americans. The release of the new guidelines was paired with a new inverted version of the food pyramid that's meant to stress that a healthy diet consists of a majority of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and proteins. Few people follow the dietary guidelines to a T, but those who actually want to keep their saturated-fat intake to a minimum while upping their protein consumption will have to look to leaner options, such as beans and tofu. The carnivore health secretary may have inadvertently encouraged more Americans to embrace the “soy boy” lifestyle.



For the first time, the guidelines explicitly recommend against eating ultra-processed foods, which they refer to as “highly processed foods.” An accompanying scientific report that was released today notes that processed foods have been “consistently associated with increased risk” for a number of conditions, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. And the guidelines also take a particularly strong stance against added sugar. Both the 2020 and 2025 guidelines stress the need to limit added sugar, but the new guidelines add that “no amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is recommended or considered part of a healthy or nutritious diet.”



These new suggestions come with some controversy. Ultra-processed foods constitute a broad and amorphous category, as I've previously written, and whether recommending that people stay away from all ultra-processed foods is feasible or desirable remains to be seen. But the guidelines are largely being well received by major health and nutrition groups. The American Medical Association said in a statement that the guidelines “offer clear direction patients and physicians can use to improve health.”

Read: Coke, Twinkies, Skittles, and … whole-Grain Bread?

The average American won't necessarily change what they eat because of these new recommendations, but the guidelines do play a central role in determining what food can be served by a number of programs that provide food to millions of Americans. The lunch menus offered in schools, for example, legally must be “consistent with the goals” of the dietary guidelines. Kennedy has pledged to remove processed food from schools, and these new guidelines could pave the way for this to happen by giving the Trump administration justification for such a ban. That said, doing so would be hard, given the ubiquity of these foods and the limited resources that schools have to make all of their meals from scratch. Any such change would require formal regulation and could take years to finalize, and it's not actually Kennedy's call: The rules for school lunches are set by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.



Regardless of the challenges ahead, the release of the guidelines is a milestone in Kennedy's tenure as HHS secretary, and it's indicative of the way that he's approached food regulation generally. Kennedy came into office pledging radical reform, yet he has seemed content with small steps. Before taking office, for example, he implied that he thought a number of chemical additives in foods should be banned. But so far, he's settled for companies' promises that they will voluntarily phase out certain synthetic dyes over the course of several years.



The strategy marks a sharp departure from Kennedy's willingness to impose his own beliefs on another major priority area: vaccines. On that front, Kennedy initially pledged to be a moderate, although he has been anything but. Just this week, the CDC removed six shots from its list of recommended childhood vaccines—after Kennedy told Congress during his confirmation hearing that he would “support the CDC schedule.” In other words, America's health policy seems like it's being led by two health secretaries with very different approaches.

Europeans and Greenlanders are strongly opposed to an American land grab. But their options to stop it are limited.

The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, along with recent comments from the White House have made clear that US President Donald Trump's ambition to take over Greenland needs to be taken very seriously. European governments are reportedly discussing contingency plans if he makes good on his threats.

A US military attack on the territory of a friendly European country — effectively the end of the NATO alliance — still seems unlikely, though can't be ruled out entirely. While there have been proposals to station more troops in Greenland as a deterrent, for now, European governments seem to view that step as unnecessarily escalatory.

A political and economic campaign to pressure Europe into giving up Greenland seems more likely. The best hope of preventing the US from going farther down this road may be just how unpopular the idea is in Greenland itself and in the United States.

No one is laughing about Greenland anymore.

President Donald Trump's frequently expressed desire for the US to take possession of the world's largest island may once have been treated as a lark, troll, or distraction, but following last week's capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, it's become clear that Trump is increasingly acquiring a taste for military action and that he is even less constrained by international norms than previously thought.

“We do need Greenland, absolutely,” Trump said, shortly after the Maduro raid, describing it as “surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships.” The White House said on Tuesday that Trumpand his senior advisers are discussing options for how to take over the Danish territory and that military force is “always an option.”

Trump's senior adviser, Stephen Miller, dismissed the idea that there was anything stopping the US from pursuing its imperialist visions in the far north, telling CNN's Jake Tapper, “Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland. … We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.” (Secretary of State Marco Rubio took a softer line, saying no invasion was imminent and that the goal is to purchase Greenland. Neither Denmark nor Greenland have indicated any interest in selling.)

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen responded to the threats by saying that Trump's ambitions for the territory should be taken seriously and that “If the United States were to choose to attack another NATO country, then everything would come to an end. The international community as we know it, democratic rules of the game, NATO, the world's strongest defensive alliance — all of that would collapse if one NATO country chose to attack another.”

On Tuesday, the leaders of six European countries along with Greenland issued a joint statement affirming the importance of territorial integrity and stating that “it is for Denmark and Greenland and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.” The French government says it is in communication with partners over plans to respond if Trump makes good on his threats.

Strong words, but can Europe back them up? If we take Trump at his word that he plans to take some action on Greenland “in about two months,” what can Denmark and its European allies do before then to dissuade him? And if he follows through on his threats, what costs are they willing to pay to fight back?

The idea of an actual US vs. Europe military conflict over Greenland still seems outlandish, even after what happened in Venezuela, though European countries aren't discounting it entirely. A global outlook published by Denmark's intelligence service in in December classified the United States, for the first time, as a security risk, writing that Washington “uses economic power, including in the form of threats of high tariffs, to enforce its will and no longer excludes the use of military force, even against allies.” The country's foreign ministry has set up a “night watch” to monitor Trump's activities and social media activity posts while the rest of the country is sleeping.

“I absolutely think there's the political will to protect Greenland.”

Early in 2025, when it first became clear Trump wasn't going to let the issue drop, the French government discussed sending troops to Greenland as a deterrent, though the proposal hasn't gone anywhere since then. The consensus for now among European governments is that a military build-up to counter the United States would risk further inflaming tensions with Trump while still probably not being enough to hold off a (still hard to imagine) US operation to seize the territory by force.

“For all of the military assets that Europe has and that NATO has, the United States still remains the backbone of NATO, and I think that that's why this is also such an unprecedented conversation that we're having,” said Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow focused on transatlantic security at the India-based Observer Research Foundation.

Trump has mocked Denmark's recent moves to bolster security in Denmark by saying they had added “one more dogsled.” In fact, Copenhagen announced a new $4.26 billion arctic security package in November, including two additional naval vessels and 16 F-35 fighter jets. Ironically, this is the sort of spending Trump, who has long accused NATO countries of skimping on their own defense and free-riding on US security guarantees, has called for, though until recently the idea that increased spending would provide security from the United States would have seemed very strange.

Even with a bulked-up military, Denmark and allies may not be a match for the US in a conventional war. Danish commentators calling for more troops to be sent to Greenland acknowledge this would be mostly a symbolic step. Still, it's worth noting that Denmark not only fought alongside the United States in Afghanistan — a major source of frustration now that they're being bullied by its government — but lost around the same number of troops per capita.. Trump and Miller's dismissive comments aside, this is not a country that lacks the will to defend itself.

“I absolutely think there's the political will to protect Greenland,” Rizzo said.

If it's still hard to imagine even Trump militarily invading a friendly European NATO ally, it's much easier to imagine him applying political and economic pressure to get what he wants. European officials interviewed in a recent Atlantic article sketched out a scenario in which Trump simply declares Greenland to be a US protectorate. He could then use various forms of leverage to pressure Denmark and other European governments to accept US control of Greenland as a fait accompli. This could include his preferred economic weapon, tariffs. He could also threaten to pull the United States out of NATO —a scenario that appeared very possible during his first term but that he has spoken less about lately. Finally, he could return to another familiar source of leverage: threatening to withhold ongoing US weapons aid and intelligence support to Ukraine.

What can Europe do to prevent this? The first choice is likely to cut a deal with the notoriously transactional president. It's become clear that Trump's interest in Greenland is not just about leverage or pressure — he sincerely wants the island, either because he's genuinely worried about Chinese and Russian activities in the Arctic or because he's simply interested in territorial expansion as an end unto itself. But could savvy diplomacy turn his obsession into a form of leverage? The question now facing European leaders, says Liana Fix, senior fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, is “is there something that can give Donald Trump a win that does not violate the sovereignty of Denmark?”

One reason Europeans are skeptical of Trump's stated concern about the island's security needs is that the US military already has broad latitude through prior defense agreements to operate in the territory. The Danish government has also made clear it's open to an expanded US troop presence in Greenland and increased US mining activity, so long as it remains sovereign Danish territory, but this was apparently not enough for the Trump administration.

It's possible there may be an unrelated issue Europe could cut a deal on in exchange for Trump backing off, such as the Digital Services Act, which is strongly opposed by US tech companies and has been harshly criticized by Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk, and others in Trump's orbit.

Fix notes that “it's a fine line to walk, not to appear to be appeasing” Trump. This is one case, she notes, where “appeasing is likely to backfire.”

European governments could threaten to sanction US companies or sell off US bonds, but at the end of the day, notes Rizzo, “Europe doesn't have that much leverage economically over the United States,” which has already helped Trump in trade talks this term, and is likely the reason he feels emboldened to treat Denmark this way.

The best weapon the Europeans may have for resisting US pressure may be just how unpopular an idea this is in all corners of the Atlantic. Danish rule is a fraught issue in Greenland and all the island's political parties support eventual independence, albeit on different timelines. But Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, noted that Trump's brute-force approach has offended Greenlanders as well, leading to increased coordination between Nuuk, the Greenlandic capital, and Copenhagen. The Greenland government has refused to engage in bilateral talks with the Americans without Danish involvement, an opportunity they might have jumped at under other circumstances.

Polls show US control of Greenland is deeply unpopular there. “It has been very difficult for the US administration, for the MAGA universe, to tell stories about anyone in Greenland actually wanting to be American,” Gad said. A visit by second lady Usha Vance to Nuuk was scrapped in March amid reports of planned protests, though the administration blamed scheduling issues. The fact that one particularly vocal Greenlandic Trump superfan, stonemason Jørgen Boassen, has become a quasi-celebrity who seems to be interviewed in nearly every article about the topic, indicates that there is probably not a wide base of support for US annexation.

The lack of any popular base of local support would make it difficult for the US to pull off a version of the “little green men” operation Russia carried out in Crimea in 2014, which involved Russian forces taking over the region while presenting it as a local uprising against Ukrainian rule. Whether or not they were actually a majority, there at least was a significant amount of local support for Russian rule in Crimea. That's not the case in Greenland.

Trump prefers quick and overwhelming victories in his foreign policy actions — arresting Maduro, bombing Iran's nuclear sites. Even if he could take over Greenland, and even if he doesn't care about effectively destroying NATO, how much sense does it make for the US to rule long-term over a hostile population in a territory that polls show Americans overwhelmingly don't even want? A YouGov survey released this week shows only 8 percent of Americans support using force to take Greenland and just 28 percent support purchasing it.

All of this is taking place against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire. Just this week, even amid the rising Greenland tensions, France and the UK announced a plan for future security guarantees for Ukraine that envisions the US playing a prominent role in monitoring the ceasefire.

Would European governments really be willing to blow up the transatlantic security alliance over Greenland? 

For all Trump's bluster and surprise tweets, Europeans have been fairly successful at keeping him onside over the past year when it comes to NATO in general and continuing material support for Ukraine in particular. This is likely one major reason why European governments have been reluctant to criticize Trump's Greenland ambitions too strongly.

So the question is, would European governments really be willing to blow up the transatlantic security alliance over Greenland? The answer — particularly from Denmark, as Frederiksen's comments this week indicated, is that by taking Greenland against their will, Trump would have blown it up anyway.

“Basically, all the important European countries understand and agree that Europe will need to be independent from the US in the long run,” said Gad, the Danish analyst. “The basic dynamic is still that we need to make this [alliance ] fall apart so slowly that we don't get in a lot of trouble before the process is over.”

In other words, policymakers in Copenhagen, Paris, Berlin, London, and elsewhere would no doubt prefer the process of weaning themself off dependence on the United States for their security to happen on their own timeline rather than one dictated by Trump, particularly with a major war raging on their doorstep, but they may no longer have that luxury.

“Why on Earth would we want to make a deal with Donald Trump [over Greenland] when the expectation is that he won't keep it anyway?” Gad said. The distrust is likely to outlast this presidency.

“You elected the guy twice; we can't trust you,” Gad added.

What your favorite TikTok influencer gets right — and wrong — about this widespread concern.

A version of this story appeared in Good Medicine, a new Vox newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health. 

Inflammation is on everybody's minds these days, and it seems like wherever you look, someone is telling you how to reduce your inflammation, from influencers on your TikTok feed or Instagram reels to even Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It's the subject of countless papers in scientific journals, and the focus of self-help guides and so many news stories — like the one you're reading right now.

When White House officials announced their new dietary guidelines on Wednesday, they said their approach would help people reduce the “general body inflammation” that they blame for driving America's chronic disease crisis.

You'd be excused for wondering if inflammation is the cause of all our ailments and reducing it is the skeleton key to a healthy life.

But the story is more complicated.

A newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health.

“Inflammation has become a catch-all culprit,” Shruti Naik, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told me. “It's a convenient shorthand, but it flattens a very complex biology.”

Chronic inflammation is indeed on the rise, a phenomenon that researchers have linked to industrialization and modern life. But inflammation isn't all bad — it's actually one of the most important things your body can do to fight infections and repair tissue. It is a flashing signal from your immune system. We just aren't very good at reading it yet.

That uncertainty has created a vacuum, filled by oversimplified advice and dubious cures. In reality, managing inflammation requires far more nuance than a single supplement or a “clean” diet hack.

And today, scientists are starting to figure out that nuance. At major academic medical centers like Stanford and Mount Sinai, new clinics are measuring inflammation in patients over time, trying to define what “normal” actually looks like — and when it becomes dangerous.

Right now, when we go in for a health check-up, we might ask our doctor, How is my blood sugar? What's my blood pressure? But none of us asks, How is my immune system doing? “Even if we did, they would look at us perplexingly,” said Bali Pulendran, an immunologist at Stanford University.

But, Puledran continued, “I think the time will come, not so far in the future…when inflammation will become sort of a vital sign like a blood pressure or glucose.”

That future isn't here yet. And until it is, anyone promising a quick fix for inflammation — especially on TikTok — deserves your skepticism.

Here's what the real experts want you to know about the state of inflammation science right now — and where it's going.

Even though inflammation is a process our bodies have always performed, our current fixation on “chronic” inflammation is new.

For most of our history, physicians focused on what they could see, like the red, puffy skin around an infected wound, the visible side effects of a medical problem.

But the world has changed. Now we can see the invisible processes of our bodies at the molecular level. Thanks to advances in genomics, cell sequencing and imaging, we've learned that inflammation is present within every tissue and every cell.

“Every cell in your body can experience inflammation. That means every cell can remember it,” Naik said.

Our political wellness landscape has shifted: new leaders, shady science, contradictory advice, broken trust, and overwhelming systems. How is anyone supposed to make sense of it all? Vox's senior correspondent Dylan Scott has been on the health beat for a long time, and every week, he'll wade into sticky debates, answer fair questions, and contextualize what's happening in American health care policy. Sign up here.

For most of human history, inflammation has provided vital protection. In the time before modern medicine offered treatments like antibiotics, prescription drugs, medical devices and lifesaving surgeries, the only defense your body really had against outside invaders was its own innate ability to counteract them. Inflammation was the engine for your immune system to fight back.

But now that we do have these things, our bodies exist in a state of evolutionary confusion.

A baseline level of high inflammation may have made sense when life was short and pathogens were everywhere. But today, people live longer than ever and have access to modern medicine. (There is growing evidence, too, that inflammation increases with age; scientists call this “inflammaging.)

“Inflammation is always induced when there is a problem. Sometimes there is nothing to protect from — but it's induced anyway, and then it makes matters worse,” Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunobiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, told me. “For thousands of years, the immune system evolved to deal with infections. Suddenly, the world changed, but the immune system did not.”

At the same time that our inflammatory drive is working overtime, the environment around us has changed dramatically. Studies have found that more industrialized countries tend to have higher rates of chronic inflammation than less developed countries — cultures that are more steeped in environmental pollution and artificial substances that didn't even exist a hundred years ago.

And nothing has changed more in these societies, scientists say, than what we eat.

Foods that interfere with your metabolism can increase inflammation — especially foods high in unhealthy fats and sugar. These are the same types of foods that have contributed to modern health problems like obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure, all of which are linked to higher levels of inflammation.

Ultra-processed foods are also associated with higher rates of chronic inflammation: At its most basic level, inflammation starts when the body detects unusual presences. Processed foods are chock-full of ingredients that our bodies would have considered strange just a few decades ago.

So that inflammation is happening more isn't that surprising. This is our body reacting to new stimuli. But when should we reduce it?

There are at least three different kinds of inflammation — and most of them are actually good. The first, acute inflammation, occurs when you have an illness or an infection and is an important protective layer that your body provides itself. That is not the kind of inflammation that we want to reduce.

And then there is homeostatic inflammation, which keeps your immune system at the ready and allows your tissues and organs to repair themselves — the same process that allows your muscles to rebuild stronger after lifting weights. It's necessary for your body, and it definitely isn't the kind of inflammation we want to get rid of.

The kind of inflammation that scientists are concerned about is chronic low-grade inflammation above those levels that are necessary for a healthy functioning body. This is the kind of inflammation that can be brought on by a poor diet, by environmental pollution, or by an infection that lingers for a long time. (Researchers think that long Covid, for example, may be associated with persistent inflammation even after the acute infection has subsided.) Over just the past decade, investigators have detailed how this low-grade chronic inflammation can cause damage to people's tissue and organs at the cellular level over the long term.

Scientists are still figuring out when this kind of inflammation is the cause of a disease and when it is simply a symptom.

Obviously, when inflammation is a response to an injury, virus or bacteria, it is a symptom. But chronic metabolic diseases and even cognitive problems associated with aging may be the result of persistent and unresolved inflammation: Atherosclerosis, the hardening of arteries that is associated with high blood pressure and heart disease, for example, is one common condition that seems to be caused by long-term inflammation. Researchers are also investigating whether dementia and Alzheimer's disease may be the outcome of an overly inflamed brain.

From person to person, we still don't have the full picture. It's not possible to say that you or I at any given time have too much inflammation. Your individual baseline for a healthy amount of inflammation, and when that crosses over into something unhealthy, is the next frontier of inflammation science.

So what would it take to get there?

First, researchers would need to figure out how to establish personal baselines.

We have only recently identified biomarkers — such as cytokines, the immune-signaling proteins, and metabolites produced by the gut microbiome — that can tell us how much inflammation an individual person actually may have. But as with a lot of things in medicine these days, our ability to measure something does not mean that we necessarily know how to interpret it.

So you might be able to find a doctor willing to order a test that measures your own cytokines. But whether the results are really a cause for concern or simply what's normal for you is not yet clear.

“Biomarkers are always a proxy. Sometimes they're a good proxy, sometimes they're very generic,” Medzhitov told me. “It's a very gray area still. We know the answers at the extremes — but not in the middle.”

“There is no magic bullet. If something sounds too good to be true, especially when it comes to inflammation, it probably is.” 

That's why teams at Stanford, Mount Sinai, and other top academic medical research centers have begun what are called human immune monitoring programs, which will allow scientists to collect the longitudinal data that can start to tell them what is normal for different individuals with different backgrounds and health histories.

If you see a doctor at a major academic research hospital, you can inquire about whether they have such a program and if you could participate. From the patient's perspective, you would be committing to a series of blood draws and possibly providing other types of samples (your saliva and stool) over an extended period of time. The samples would then be measured by new technology that can detect inflammation biomarkers. By collecting data over an extended period of time, scientists can see how your inflammation changes after an infection or after you receive a medical treatment or a vaccine.

That could allow you to play a small part in figuring out what normal inflammation actually looks like and what is actually a cause for concern.

We are inching toward a future in which we can measure and track inflammation in every patient in the same way we measure and track blood pressure and blood sugar at every primary care appointment. It could serve as an early warning system for certain kinds of health conditions that are not always obvious or measurable through other means; Medzhitov told me that we might be able to get to a point where it becomes a diagnostic tool: Once an inflammation metric has reached a certain threshold, it's a clear sign that the patient has a specific health problem.

“I can envision a future where inflammation is a pre-symptomatic warning sign — something you notice before you feel sick,” Naik said.

That is what inflammation care could soon look like — but not yet.

Scientists are investigating the anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1 drugs; their ability to reduce inflammation may explain why they are associated with a wide range of health benefits, such as reducing the risk of dementia and heart disease and more. But proving that effect and establishing the actual biological mechanism that makes it happen is the subject of ongoing research. Is it the result of lifestyle changes and better diet? Or is it the result of how GLP-1 medications affect the brain, which does help to manage inflammation throughout the body? A combination of lifestyle and biological effects?

The future of inflammation care is still in the lab — not on TikTok, where influencers are promoting sea moss as a treatment for inflammation, promising it'll help to clear up your skin and improve your digestion.

“A lot of the remedies that are touted, whether they're natural or not, have not been tested,” Naik said. “Just because someone makes an awesome video…does not mean there is evidence behind it. There is no magic bullet. If something sounds too good to be true, especially when it comes to inflammation, it probably is.”

In the meantime, the best advice from the real experts on how to maintain good health is pretty simple: Don't fixate on the inflammation you can't see, and instead focus on maintaining a healthy diet, low in fats and sugars, with a lot of whole foods and unprocessed ingredients. They also recommend getting regular exercise, which has been shown to reduce chronic inflammation.

The obsession with inflammation is symptomatic of so much of our health and wellness discourse these days: It is a reasonable area of concern, but the messages about what's good and what's bad have become too simplistic — fertile ground for grifters trying to sell you on a cure.

Business Insider is taking on CES 2026.

I'm on the ground in Las Vegas from Tuesday to Thursday, taking in all there is to know about the latest in the driverless space.

Robotaxis and self-driving cars have already had an outsize presence at the tech conference, especially in the previous hype cycle of the late 2010s and early 2020s.

Things have changed since then. The industry has largely moved on from mere concepts and technology validation to: How are we going to realistically scale autonomy?

It's day one of the conference, and there's already a lot to take in.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Alpamayo family, which will serve as an autonomous-driving stack for OEMs to deal with those stubborn edge cases — or the ""long tail"" of self-driving.

Uber and Nuro showed off an early look at the Lucid Gravity SUV that the companies hope public riders will be able to take by late 2026.

I'll be spending less time at keynotes and speaker events and more on real-life demonstrations and meetings with industry leaders and commentators in autonomy

Think of this as my personal notebook, where I jot down everything I've learned and seen at the conference.

Check back in for more updates.

This is the first year Zoox, an Amazon-backed robotaxi company, will be giving live demonstrations of its service during CES.

I got to take a ride in one on Monday night in front of Resorts World. (The company tagline that I saw from an ad at the Harry Reid International Airport was: ""Don't just do the Strip. Zoox it."")

My immediate thoughts were that Zoox feels unlike any other robotaxi or pseudo-robotaxi on the market. It felt more like I was on a theme park ride than in an everyday car we're familiar with.

Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Zoox is not a regular car you could buy that's been retrofitted with sensors. The Zoox car is bi-directional — meaning there's no real front or back of the car — and the inside has no steering wheel, just seats.

The robotaxis were clearly a great tourist attraction from what I saw. My Uber driver wasn't too happy about them.

Uber, Lucid, and Nuro had a swanky cocktail hour at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, where they quite literally wined and dined a room full of reporters, analysts, and investors: endless glasses of wine and an open bar, lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, too many appetizers to count, and a giant charcuterie board — the works.

Maybe understandably so? 2026 will be a big year for the three companies.

Uber's plan is to roll out a robotaxi service by late 2026. The first market is San Francisco, where Uber will directly compete with Waymo. These two companies are partners in other markets, like Austin.

""We've been moving very, very quickly,"" Nuro's co-CEO and cofounder Dave Ferguson said. ""We signed this partnership last July. We're already testing the production-intent vehicles on public roads. And very soon, we're going to have tens of thousands of them worldwide.""

A quick image to get a sense of how big CES's mobility division is at West Hall of the convention center: There's a 60,000-pound combine from John Deere that's sitting in the middle of the showroom.

The combine is one of the world's largest on the market, according to Julian Sanchez, an engineer at the machinery company.

Even so, John Deere doesn't even have the largest footprint on the floor. This year, it's Hyundai.

The combine isn't autonomous in the way we think about self-driving cars, Sanchez told me, but it is self-steering.

There's a lot of talk of self-driving cars in the automotive industry, but the scope of what it can realistically achieve has narrowed down in the last decade or so.

Paul Costa, an ex-Apple veteran of 25 years who worked on the company's abandoned self-driving car project, gave me a bit of interesting color from what he saw at CES in 2015 — when the driverless car hype was reaching its peak — and what's different now.

""My sense at the time was that people really wanted to focus on Level 5 autonomy,"" Costa, who now leads Ford's electrical engineering team, told me. Level 5 is the highest level of autonomous driving set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers. That means full autonomy in all weather conditions and no geofences. Waymo is currently Level 4.

The tone has been brought down to reality, according to Costa. The focus is on highly advanced driver assistance systems and eyes-off driving or Level 3 systems, he said.

""Now, I feel like here in 2026, L3 is extremely interesting,"" Costa said. ""It's interesting for me to see how the industry — its focus has changed over the years.""

AV operators, like Waymo, Uber, or Lyft, need to know the lifespans of their vehicles to determine the true cost of staying in business.

Stephen Hayes, VP of Lyft's autonomous vehicle program, told me that the ""lifetime mileage"" the company can accrue on a robotaxi is still unknown.

""How long will an AV last?"" Hayes said. ""Today, we're in the early innings, obviously, of the autonomous transition and very few AV players have vehicles on the road that have run hundreds of thousands of miles.""

Part of the business proposition for ride-hailing companies like Lyft is reselling its fleet of vehicles, also known as remarketing. Lyft owns a fleet through its subsidiary called Flexdrive. For robotaxis, remarketing remains an ""unknown,"" Hayes said.

""There's no market for it,"" he said. ""There's no secondary market where it's like, 'Hey, I want to go buy a used AV.' Ten years from now, it's going to look completely different, but we don't know in what ways.""

Hyundai Motor Group has the largest footprint at CES this year, showcasing the company's latest in robotics development.

The booth contains Hyundai's Ioniq 5 robotaxi developed through a joint venture between the automaker and Motional.

However, the star of the show is undoubtedly Atlas, the humanoid robot built by Hyundai's Boston Dynamics unit.

I was told by a Boston Dynamics representative on a Wednesday afternoon that the wait-time to step inside the booth was around two hours.

Ford announced on Wednesday that it will be making in-house hardware and software to deploy eyes-off driving capabilities by 2028.

This comes about a month after Rivian announced it would be pursuing fully-autonomous driving by making its own silicon chip.

Ford's rationale is that going in-house is cheaper than seeking outside suppliers and provides greater oversight on how the technology is deployed.

I talked to Chris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, to get some insight behind why automakers might want to pursue an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) on their own instead of licensing software from companies that are ahead of the curve.

Ahn said automakers need to decide what level of autonomy their customer base wants and that won't look the same across the board.

""People who own Fords, own Fords for certain reasons that are probably different reasons on why people who own Mercedes own Mercedes,"" he said. ""And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today, which is a fundamentally different way to think about AV than what we were thinking about three, four, five years ago, which was just level five autonomy everywhere.""

President Donald Trump took executive action aimed at defense contractors after a series of Truth Social posts.

The president signed an executive order on Wednesday that would ban defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends ""until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.""

""Every firm across our economy has a right to profit from prudent investment and hard work, but the American defense industrial base also has the responsibility to ensure that America's warfighters have the best possible equipment and weapons,"" the order said.

Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said he would ""not permit"" stock buybacks or dividends from US defense companies in a post on Truth Social.

In his post, the president blasted defense contractors for issuing ""massive"" dividends and buying back their stock. He said he wouldn't permit such practices until defense firms sped up production.

""Therefore, I will not permit Dividends or Stock Buybacks for Defense Companies until such time as these problems are rectified,"" he wrote. ""MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH!""

Trump also took issue with what he called ""exorbitant and unjustifiable"" compensation packages for industry executives. Until companies build ""NEW and MODERN"" production plants, defense execs should be making no more than $5 million, he said, without providing details on how those guidelines would be implemented.

He later singled out Raytheon in a Truth Social post.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.

Defense stocks fell after Trump's Truth Social post on Wednesday. Notable movers include:

General Dynamics: -4%

Northrup Grumman: -5%

Lockheed Martin: -5%

The defense sector has been a big focus for Trump dating back to his first term as president. In the past year, he's floated projects like creating a Golden Dome missile defense system and signed off on increasing defense spending to a record $901 billion.

Microsoft wants to overhaul GitHub to compete with AI coding rivals and embrace AI agents, and the company has started reshuffling teams to make that happen, according to people familiar with the changes.

GitHub is a leading software development platform that Microsoft acquired in 2018. GitHub had an early lead because of its popularity as a place to store code. Lately, though, GitHub has faced more competition from AI tools such as Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code.

Microsoft in January 2025 formed a new group focused on building AI tools under ex-Facebook engineering boss Jay Parikh. The group, called CoreAI Platform and Tools, combined Microsoft's developer division, AI platform team, and GitHub.

Still, Microsoft and GitHub have remained somewhat separate, and the company has been moving people and resources around over the past few months to better coordinate efforts such as sales, one of the people said. The latest change, happening this week, is moving a small group of Microsoft engineers over to GitHub.

The goal, the people said, is to better compete with AI coding tools that rival GitHub Copilot, while getting in the race to build AI agents and fulfill Parikh's vision to build an ""agent factory.""

In an internal meeting late last year, Parikh spoke about needing to overhaul GitHub to compete with Cursor and Claude Code, according to audio reviewed by Business Insider.

""GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code,"" Parikh said at the time. ""We want it to be the center of gravity for all of AI-powered software development.""

Microsoft wants GitHub's AI tools to be available wherever developers work, not just inside one app, to wants to make GitHub a kind of dashboard for managing multiple AI agents.

The latest changes are also part of what Parikh said would be new investment in improving the basic parts of GitHub. In the meeting, Parikh said those include making improvements to its GitHub Actions tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code, analytics and insights tools so teams can see how their code is performing, security for keeping the code safe, and making sure the company can meet local data storage rules to offer GitHub in new countries.

Ford said it's developing autonomous capabilities, such as eyes-off driving, that will be ready for public roads by 2028.

The legacy automaker said in an announcement on Wednesday that it will be cheaper to develop self-driving technology in-house than to seek an outside supplier.

""Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable,"" Ford announced during CES in Las Vegas.

Chris Morse, a spokesperson for Ford, told Business Insider that the cost is compared to ""the supplier system that we have on-road today."" A specific supplier was not named.

Key team members behind Ford's ADAS ambitions gave Business Insider a broad overview of some of the advantages of an in-house approach.

Sammy Omari, head of ADAS and infotainment at Ford Motor Company, said the company can have greater oversight over how the sensors are utilized and integrated into the vehicles.

""How can we now combine the information from all these sensors in the most cost-effective way to get to the highest performance?"" he said. ""These are some of the key reasons why we can get to that price point.""

Paul Costa, a former Apple employee who now leads Ford's electrical engineering team, told Business Insider that the company can reduce the number of separate computer modules inside its vehicles — an ADAS computer, an infotainment system, an audio system, and a networking computer — into one computer without having to compromise performance.

Costa said Ford has ""great suppliers,"" but seeking third parties doesn't allow for integration of modules, and the size of the computers themselves is larger.

""To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,"" he said. ""We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.""

There are several players in the business of licensing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for car makers, including Nvidia, Waymo, and Wayve, among others. Ford previously announced a partnership with Mobileye in 2020 to develop its ADAS software, called BlueCruise.

A spokesperson for Mobileye declined to comment.

Leading EV companies in the US — namely Tesla and Rivian — have taken an in-house approach to developing their own self-driving technology. Rivian announced earlier in December that it designed its own silicon chip to power the autonomous driving computer inside its future vehicles.

Costa told Business Insider that Ford isn't interested in making its own chip and the automaker is happy with its current suppliers.

""We're not interested in a TOPS war,"" Costa said, referring to a metric chipmakers commonly like to tout.

""Honestly, I don't want custom silicon,"" he later added. ""If I can get other people's volume on silicon that I need, that is good for democratization.""

The Senate on Thursday voted 52-47 to block President Donald Trump from further military action in Venezuela. 

The move came less than a week after Trump authorized a strike that captured the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro.

The measure, known as a War Powers Resolution, only needed a simple majority to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate and would require Trump to seek the approval of Congress before using the U.S. military again in Venezuela. The measure was brought by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. 

The vote in the Senate was procedural, but it indicates that the measure has the votes to pass when it comes to a final vote in the Senate. It would then go to the House, where Republicans have a razor-thin majority.

""Make no mistake, bombing another nation's capital and removing their leader is an act of war plain and simple. No provision in the Constitution provides such power to the presidency,"" Paul said in a statement.

The Constitution vests Congress with the authority to declare war. 

Trump and his allies in Congress have argued he did not need to consult Congress on the strike that captured Maduro, which they say was a law enforcement operation. Maduro is now facing drug-related charges in New York. 

The Senate shot down a similar resolution in November, after only two Republicans — Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska —  joined all Democrats in voting for it. Trump engaged in a months-long military buildup around Venezuela before the action that captured Maduro.

Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, voted for the measure.

""While I support the operation to seize Nicolas Maduro, which was extraordinary in its precision and complexity, I do not support committing additional U.S. forces or entering into any long-term military involvement in Venezuela or Greenland without specific congressional authorization,"" Collins said in a statement.

Thirty million. It's a big number. Maybe not in the context of business news, where we usually talk about company valuations that are in the billions, or even trillions. But when we're talking about people, 30 million is a very big number. 

Thirty million is the number of people that the National Organization of Rare Disorders estimates are living with a rare disease in the United States.

Defining a rare disease can be tricky. In the U.S., a disease is considered rare if fewer than 200,000 Americans are diagnosed with it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that works out to be less than 7 in 10,000 people. In the European Union, a disease is classified as rare if it affects no more than 5 in 10,000 people. In China, it's 1 in 10,000. Any way you define it, patient populations within the rare disease community are smaller than those diagnosed with more well-known diseases like Alzheimer's, which the Alzheimer's Association estimates stood at more than 7 million in the U.S. as of last year. But when you consider that there are more than 10,000 rare diseases, and as many as 400 million people suffering from them worldwide, you start to take notice.

That's why we're launching CNBC Cures, a new initiative to help raise awareness of rare diseases and improve patient outcomes for people living with them. Led by ""Squawk Box "" anchor Becky Quick, the initiative was inspired by her family's own rare disease journey. 

Quick's youngest daughter, Kaylie, was just 7 months old when Becky first suspected that something wasn't right. 

""She was not meeting some of her developmental milestones, and I was worried about it,"" Quick said.

Kaylie visited several doctors, and at first, none of them seemed concerned. But after several months, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician diagnosed Kaylie with global developmental delay, a broad term given to a child that is significantly delayed in hitting developmental milestones, like walking and talking. But the diagnosis didn't point to a cause. 

Her family was left grasping for answers until just before Kaylie's third birthday, when a genetic test revealed the root cause of Kaylie's struggles. She had SYNGAP1, a rare genetic disease that has only been diagnosed in about 1,700 people in the world.

""Our neurologist didn't know what it was,"" said Quick. ""She told us, 'You'll probably know more about this by the end of the weekend than I do.' And we did.""

""We ran to Google and started googling things,"" Quick explained. ""There were researchers who were already doing work, and thank God they had been. That's why we knew as much as we did about SYNGAP1.""

SynGAP is a protein crucial to brain development. It helps with learning and memory, and also with regulating communication in the synapses of the brain. Kaylie has a genetic mutation in her SYNGAP1 gene that causes her brain to get only about half the SynGAP protein it should be getting. That makes it difficult for the neurons in her brain to communicate effectively with each other.

Despite SYNGAP1's small patient population, it is thought to be much more prevalent than it once was. Mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene are surprisingly common and are estimated to account for between 1%-2% of all intellectual disabilities. An article published by CURE SYNGAP1 indicates the figure could be as high as 76,000 in the U.S. alone. But because most doctors don't know the symptoms of SYNGAP1, and the vast majority of newborns aren't screened for genetic diseases at birth, it's believed that most cases of SYNGAP1, like many rare diseases, go undiagnosed.

SYNGAP1 is a spectrum disorder, meaning not all patients are affected the same way or with the same severity. It's common for SYNGAP1 patients to have seizure disorders, intellectual disabilities, autism, motor skill delays, difficulty forming speech, balance and coordination issues, and high pain thresholds. Kaylie has all these symptoms.

As Kaylie grew and became more mobile, dealing with her symptoms became more difficult.

""We have all the doors locked all the time so that she doesn't walk out. She doesn't know to call out if she needs help,"" said Quick. ""She used to fall and hurt herself and not even realize it or say anything. You'd see the blood, or you'd see the bruise,"" Quick added. 

Despite her physical challenges, Quick says Kaylie is still a happy and active kid. ""She can do all of these things that people thought maybe she couldn't. She doesn't just walk. She runs. She runs everywhere, through the house, through the outside. She jumps. She's a daredevil. She loves roller coasters … she loves movement,"" Quick added.

There is no cure for SYNGAP1. There are several treatments in development, though none have yet progressed beyond clinical trials.

Progress has been made in identifying more individuals with SYNGAP1. A 2019 census found just 484 patients worldwide. Shortly after Kaylie's diagnosis, that figure jumped to 1,000. It now stands at more than 1,700 globally. 

Expanded access to genetic screening for newborns, a cause nearly everyone in the rare disease community is rallying behind, could help further identify more SYNGAP1 patients. That's key when dealing with rare diseases because a bigger patient pool can attract more research and funding for treatments. It also helps regulators better understand the scope of a disease, which can ultimately get those treatments to market more quickly.

While there is no treatment that Kaylie can take to reverse her disorder, her parents have put in place a routine anchored by her therapists, her family, and a strong support system to help her battle through the many challenges she faces. 

""She works really hard every day. Every single day Kaylie works harder than any of the rest of us, and that's just who she is,"" Quick said. 

""She loves her sisters and her brother. She loves her cousins and she loves her family. She's got friends at school … she is just happy every single day, and I am grateful for that.""

""I've been amazed at how many people are going through something similar,"" Quick said. ""The idea that this is a universal struggle that so many people are going through … that kind of got the wheels turning for us.""

""We're the lucky ones. We have resources,"" Quick said. She and her family began to think about how they could make a difference for others navigating a rare disease diagnosis.

Rare diseases often go overlooked by investors and pharmaceutical companies. As a result, patients diagnosed with a rare disease usually go underserved by the medical community. Smaller diagnosed patient populations make it difficult to attract funding for research into rare disease treatments. And where promising research does exist, those smaller patient populations make it more difficult for potentially lifesaving treatments to clear regulatory hurdles and get to the patients that need them. 

This is where Quick saw an opportunity to make a difference. 

""We thought, you know, CNBC has a pretty unique audience. It's got an influential audience. It's an audience of people who know how to get things done. Why not tap into what they can bring to the table too?"" she said.

CNBC Cures is teaming up with some of the nation's top researchers, doctors, regulators and patient advocacy groups. 

The initiative's goal is to help build a community that can break down barriers that can limit treatment options and isolate those living with a rare disease. Through our storytelling and live events, we'll work to identify the most innovative scientific developments in the rare disease space and put a spotlight on the bottlenecks preventing them from getting to the patients who need them. 

We'll bring you moving and inspirational stories about the individuals changing the way we think about rare diseases and offer a space where you can share your own rare disease journey with us. And we'll share perspectives from the most prominent investors in the space, highlighting where they see opportunities for healthy returns, and for transforming health care as we know it.

Here's how we'll do it:

The truth is that the term rare disease is misleading. The odds are that almost all of us know someone who is impacted by a rare disease, and the millions who make up this community are more connected than we think. Every week scientists are finding new evidence that shows if you can figure out how to effectively treat one rare disease, there are countless others that can be treated using similar mechanisms. And advancements made in rare diseases are offering new hope for breakthroughs in everything from Alzheimer's, to cancer, and heart disease.

These are just a few of the themes we want to explore with CNBC Cures in the coming year. It's a journey we're on together, and together we can make a difference.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday pressed the administration's desire for lower interest rates, saying they are the key to future economic growth.

In a speech he will deliver before the Economic Club of Minnesota, Bessent backed President Donald Trump's economic agenda and said easier monetary policy will help pave the way for gains ahead.

""Cutting interest rates will have a tangible impact on the lives of every Minnesotan,"" he said, according to excerpts obtained in an official draft from an administration source. ""It is the only ingredient missing for even stronger economic growth. Which is why the Fed should not delay.""

The Federal Reserve approved three consecutive interest rate cuts in the final four months of 2025, totaling 0.75 percentage point and taking the central bank's key interest rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.

However, the pace of reductions is expected to slow considerably this year, with markets pricing in just two cuts and the most recent projections from Fed officials pointing to just one. 

One wild card in that equation is that the Fed will get a new chair this year, a process that Bessent is overseeing. Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May, and the Treasury secretary has whittled down the candidates to five. National Economic Council leader Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are the two betting favorites to get the position.

While lower interest rates carry the threat of reigniting inflation, they also could help support a slowing labor market.

""In 2025, the President laid the foundation for robust economic growth with: the historic passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, trade deals that rewrote decades of global misalignment; and an ambitious deregulation agenda that empowered American entrepreneurs and businesses,"" Bessent said. ""Now, in 2026, we will reap the rewards of President Trump's America First agenda.""

Bessent will deliver the speech at 12:45 p.m. ET.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Kevin Hassett is leader of the National Economic Council.

In this article

Google is adding more Gemini features to Gmail, providing upgrades like artificial intelligence-generated summaries of email threads, the company said Thursday.

The company said its latest updates will be rolled out in phases, and some features will be turned on by default in inboxes, meaning users who don't want them will have to opt out.

""When you open an email with dozens of replies, Gmail synthesizes the entire conversation into a concise summary of key points,"" Google wrote in a blog post.

The company said AI Overviews, which show up at the top of search results, are also being added to Gmail.

The updates come as Google embeds its Gemini AI technology across its wide portfolio of consumer products. Google is counting on its massive customer base to provide an advantage as the company takes on the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic and others in the booming generative AI market. 

Google says Gmail now has more than 3 billion users.

Last year, Google's Gemini integration in Gmail allowed users to do things like search messages, draft emails from prompts, improve grammar and generate custom responses.

One of the new features is ""Suggested Replies,"" which Google says uses the context of a user's emails to create one-click responses. It's an update to a prior tool called ""Smart Replies."" The company is also upgrading a proofreading option for checking grammar and making messages more concise. 

Driven by its rapid advancements in AI, Google parent Alphabet topped Apple by market cap on Wednesday for the first time since 2019, continuing a rally that made the stock the best performer among tech megacaps last year. Meanwhile, OpenAI soared to a private market valuation of $500 billion late last year, and Anthropic said Wednesday that it's valued at $350 billion in a new funding round.

— CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this report.

I've spent the last 25 years in front of the camera here at CNBC, and people have gotten to know a lot about me.

What they don't know, though, is probably the most important part: My family. And our family is a happy one. But we are also unique, and we have our struggles.

Our 9-year-old daughter Kaylie, our youngest child, has a rare genetic disease. Her journey and her battles have changed me in so many ways, all for the better.

Kaylie is a beautiful, happy, loving girl. Those who know us say she's a mini-me. But I know she's better than I've ever been. She is full of light and life and love. And she works harder every day than anyone I know.Kaylie has SYNGAP1, which means she only produces half of the SynGAP protein needed for brain development. Like the other 1,700 or so people around the globe with the same diagnosis, that means she has seizures, developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. And like most other Syngapians, she has autism. Kaylie's autism is severe. 

She has apraxia, which means that even though she struggles to speak, she has very high receptive language and — I think — understands most of what is going on around her. Sometimes people assume that just because Kaylie can't talk she doesn't understand what they are saying. Sometimes they talk about Kaylie right in front of her. Sometimes it's unkind. I've heard people call her retarded, spoiled, or undisciplined. They've said she's too old to be in a stroller, which is where she can feel safest when we are out in the community. Or they've given us disapproving looks and said she shouldn't be allowed to have so much screen time when we let her use an iPad at a restaurant or at her brother's basketball games. I've heard all of that. And so has she.

Having SYNGAP1 and apraxia means that Kaylie often can't control her body. It won't do what she wants it to do, which, as you can imagine, is incredibly frustrating for her. Sometimes she acts out, but she's been working with behavioral therapists for many years. She's getting better at dealing with that.A friend whose son had brain cancer took one look at the image of a Syngapian's brain and said it looked just like the brain of a child who had received radiation for brain tumors. In a neurotypical brain, dendrites — the neural connections that transmit electrical impulses in a brain — look like neatly pruned trees, with clear, defined branches stemming out from a central trunk. People with SYNGAP1 have dendrites with fatter trunks and lots of branches. Those bold trunks of synapses, instead of the sleek connections most people have, mean that Kaylie can be overwhelmed by the flood of input coming her way. Sometimes she bites herself as a result as she tries to manage it all. Sometimes she bites me or her father. She doesn't mean it. We know that. But it's hard to process it and react with grace as it's happening.

When Kaylie was born, everything seemed perfect. She went full term, no problems in the pregnancy. She had 10 fingers and 10 toes. She was happy, all the time. She smiled at less than a month old. Some people said it must be gas, but it wasn't. I took pictures on my cellphone when I held her smiling in my arms because I couldn't believe it myself.

She nursed beautifully. She slept better than my son had. She was content and happy. She did tummy time. Everything seemed perfect.But when she was around 7 months or so, I started to worry. She crossed her eyes too often. She wasn't rolling over. And sometimes, she stared into space. It seemed like she was resetting like a computer on the fritz.By 8 months, I was worried enough to seek help from therapists and doctors. They diagnosed her with global developmental delays. They worked with her. We hoped and prayed.

Kaylie made progress. It was just so slow relative to her peers, and to her cousins born within months of her. That made family functions tough to endure at times … to see how far she was falling behind her cousins, even though our extended family was our greatest support. It was a double-edged sword, and sometimes (often) I broke down at holiday events and family gatherings.We consulted with a neurologist. She prescribed an EEG, which showed unusual brain activity and seizures. Kaylie started on a long and varied road of medications designed to control her seizures. Just before Kaylie turned 3, we got the results of a genetic test that showed Kaylie had SYNGAP1. The diagnosis was devastating, because we knew that even hard work, determination and years of therapies wouldn't be enough to ""fix"" all her symptoms. But it also brought us an understanding of what Kaylie was dealing with, a community of other families dealing with the same issues, and hope that we could eventually find a cure.

Working with dedicated therapists, doctors and teachers helped tremendously. Kaylie continues to make progress, and we have learned a lot about how to best try and help her. But we have a long, long way to go. And we are some of the luckiest ones. We have resources to pay for help and access to the best care and therapists. And doctors and companies call me back because of my public position.Most people aren't so lucky. And that's a big part of the reason we feel like we have to speak up now.It's taken me years to get to this place, emotionally, to even be able to talk about it publicly. After Kaylie's diagnosis, I shut off this part of my life and my brain while I was at work and on air, just so I could function and do my job.But more importantly, it's taken this long for us to feel like we understand enough about rare diseases — the journey and what science is now making possible — to feel like we could make a difference by speaking out.

Every family with a rare disease diagnosis has to navigate a complex path — trying to provide the best care possible for your child on a day-to-day basis, while also seeking desperately for a cure or a therapy to try and improve their long-term diagnosis. It's a very lonely path, and even though there are more than 10,000 rare diseases, those in the communities impacted by them often feel like they're walking it alone.But the truth is, many of those diagnosed with one of those 10,000 rare diseases are walking similar paths. We've realized that ""rare disease"" isn't really all that rare when it's looked at collectively, much like cancer is today. And when you look at the 30 million Americans who are affected by rare disease — and what could be as many as 400 million people globally —  you get a patient population that can be attractive to biotech and pharmaceutical companies. It also makes it appealing to investors who can help fund the search for cures. It's a population in need of both legislative and regulatory attention, to make sure the unique challenges faced by people with rare diseases are addressed, and to help streamline the regulatory process for cures of ""orphan"" diseases.And that's where CNBC Cures comes in. CNBC has a unique audience with all of the constituencies that can make a huge difference in the path for rare disease. That is our goal with CNBC Cures: to bring together those constituencies, highlight what's possible in science right now, identify roadblocks keeping that scientific progress from patients and move them out of the way as quickly as possible.Because for patients with rare disease, time is the enemy.

Technological advances are taking place at a breakneck pace. Artificial intelligence is speeding the progress, and advances in gene therapy and ASO therapies are happening much faster than I believed possible just a couple of years ago.

But for patients and families with rare disease, the pace is never fast enough. Time slowly strips away the ability for some patients to breathe, or for their organs or muscles to function. And for those with chronic conditions, every year that passes without a cure closes the aperture on what quality of life is eventually possible.And that's why the time to act is now. Researchers and investors in this space will tell you the science has never been stronger. We have the ability to change millions of lives. Sign up for the CNBC Cures Newsletter. Attend the first-ever CNBC Cures Summit  in March. Follow the stories we'll bring you in the months ahead to see how you can make a difference. Because it's a long journey for the millions of Americans impacted by rare diseases, and the path will be a lot less lonely if we all walk it together.

This is CNBC's Morning Squawk newsletter. Subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox.

Happy Thursday. If you can't already tell from reading this newsletter, I'm a big cliché user. So with the S&P 500's first losing day of the year, maybe traders can seek solace from the age-old saying: It's a marathon, not a sprint.

Stock futures are lower this morning after a mixed session.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The Trump administration announced a flurry of market-moving policy plans yesterday that could reshape everything from what we eat to the path to home ownership. 

Here's what to know:

As the fallout from the U.S.' overthrow of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro continues, all eyes are on the country's oil. Trump on Tuesday said Venezuela would turn over up to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S., but sources close to the White House told CNBC yesterday that those were only the first barrels and that shipments would continue indefinitely.

The White House said yesterday that Trump reserves the right to use military force to protect U.S. oil workers in Venezuela. The South American country would also use revenue from its oil sales to purchase American products, Trump said on social media.

Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC yesterday that debts owed by Venezuela to ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil were not an immediate priority for the Trump administration. CEOs from both companies, as well as a representative from Chevron, are expected to meet with Trump on Friday.

Moving across the Atlantic Ocean: Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters yesterday that he would meet with Danish officials about Greenland next week. News of the talks comes as Trump reiterates his threats to take over the island to bolster U.S. national security.

But as CNBC's Dan Mangan notes, Denmark's leaders aren't taking these comments on the chin. On Tuesday, Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said the European country would spend the equivalent of $13.8 billion to rearm Greenland given ""the serious security situation we find ourselves in.""

In Washington, some congressional Republicans are brushing off Trump's threats. As Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., put it, Trump sometimes negotiates using an ""everything is on the table"" strategy.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis fatally shot a woman in her car yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Top DHS officials claimed the woman engaged in an ""act of domestic terrorism"" by attempting to run down ICE agents. But Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey both rejected that description of events, with the latter calling it ""bulls---"" and ""a garbage narrative.""

The shooting comes amid increasing tensions in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as more than 2,000 government agents descend on the area for immigration enforcement. Walz and other elected officials called for the agents to leave Minneapolis following the shooting: ""I have a simple message: We don't need any further help from the federal government,"" the governor said. ""To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem: You've done enough.""

Ford is planning to enter the eyes-off driving arena. The Detroit automaker said last night that it will begin rolling out the technology in 2028 with a $30,000 all-electric vehicle.

As CNBC's Michael Wayland notes, Ford joins a bevy of fellow automakers looking to launch similar systems. But Ford's plan to start with a typical electric vehicle, rather than a higher-priced car, is unique. The move is tied to a strategy of ""putting our best and newest technology where the volume is and where the accessibility is,"" Ford executive Doug Field told CNBC.

Alphabet surpassed Apple in market cap for the first time since 2019 yesterday, the latest sign of how the tech giants are diverging on artificial intelligence. See for yourself how the two have stacked up over the years:

CNBC's Dan Mangan, Amelia Lucas, Kevin Breuninger, Yun Li, Sean Conlon, Spencer Kimball, Jennifer Elias, Brian Sullivan, Garrett Downs, Michael Wayland and Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

The U.S. housing market has yet to pick up steam into 2026, but real estate agents say there's been a real shift toward a more balanced market, according to the quarterly CNBC Housing Market Survey.

Mortgage rates didn't move much at all in the last quarter of 2025, but home prices are steadily easing. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage dropped sharply in the third quarter but then stabilized between 6.2% and 6.4% during the fourth quarter, leaving some buyers on the sidelines with no incentive to jump in.

Now, there are early signs of what could be more activity ahead. 

""The buyers I have seen have been buying because of life circumstances, whether it's having a baby or moving for a job or retiring or downsizing,"" said Ashley Rummage, a real estate agent in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Of the real estate agents surveyed by CNBC in the fourth quarter, 37.5% said it was a balanced market, rather than the buyer's market they reported seeing in the third quarter. That is up from 30% as of the third quarter and is likely because consumers became less confident in the economy as job losses grew. 

""The people who had been moving and the momentum that we had were definitely slowed down, far, far less by interest rates than the intrinsic factors, the cost of living,"" said Heather Dell, a real estate agent in Detroit. ""Homeowners insurance, car insurance and utilities and medical insurance are the top objections that I hear when a buyer talks about buying."" 

The CNBC Housing Market Survey is a national inquiry of real estate agents selected randomly across the United States. Responses for the fourth-quarter survey were collected between Dec. 10 and Dec. 17. This quarter, 72 agents shared their insights. 

While the majority of agents said it is still a buyer's market due to easing prices and more inventory for sale, some agents noted that their buyers and sellers still have very different expectations.

""Buyers tend to think that the market is like 2008 and sellers tend to think that the market is closer to 2021, 2022, and those are diametrically opposed markets and diametrically opposed mindsets,"" said John Fragola, a real estate agent in Charleston, South Carolina. 

Of course, 2008 was the start of the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to the Great Recession and housing crash, when the market was flooded with distressed homes, giving buyers all the power. Meanwhile, 2021 came shortly after the start of the Covid pandemic, when there was a buying frenzy and inventory dropped to record lows, giving sellers all the power.

The balance in the market now is likely coming due to easing prices. 

More agents, 92%, reported having at least one seller cut their price in the fourth quarter, compared with  89% in the previous quarter, according to CNBC's survey. Nearly half of respondents said the majority of their sellers cut prices. 

""Concessions have gotten bigger, especially in my market,"" Rummage said. ""At the beginning of the year, unfortunately, a lot of sellers were still stuck in the 2021 mindset, but as the year has gone by and their listings sat, they had to get more comfortable with understanding the fact that they were probably going to have to offer some concessions to get the transaction done.""

While prices are easing, they are still historically high, but buyers appear to be getting used to that as the new normal. 

When asked how affordability is impacting their buyers, agents said fewer buyers left the market in the fourth quarter than in the prior period, and fewer delayed purchases. They also compromised less on things like home size, features and location.

Cutting prices, however, is not all that palatable to sellers, and more agents reported they had to delist properties than during the third quarter. 

""I personally had some clients who said, 'Let's just pause, pump the brakes here and we'll come back on in the spring market when there's more buyers out,""' said Fragola. 

As for the new year, despite the slow end to 2025, 67.8% of agents said they expected sales to improve in the first quarter. Fully 77% of agents said they expect the full year 2026 to be better than last year. 

There is more inventory on the market now, and some agents said they think consumers are getting used to current economic conditions.

""I think a lot of people are feeling a little bit more comfortable with the unknown,"" Rummage said. ""Sentiment has shifted from anxiety to cautious optimism.""

When U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. had to take over Greenland as a matter of national security, saying Chinese and Russian ships were ""all over the place"" in the Arctic region, the comments attracted a swift rebuke from Beijing.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday hit back, accusing Washington of ""using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains.""

Russia, on the contrary, has been notably silent on Trump's Greenland takeover ambitions and his threat to use military force to seize the Arctic island if necessary. 

The silence emanating from the Kremlin on the Greenland matter could partly be explained by the fact that it's been a holiday period for Russians, with Orthodox Christians celebrating Christmas on Jan. 7. Russia's leadership has yet to comment on the capture of Russian ally Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's leader, last weekend.

Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a statement criticizing the U.S.' ""aggressive actions"" in Venezuela, and on the seizure of a newly Russian-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic on Wednesday. But it too has been silent when it comes to Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory belonging to Denmark.

Moscow has arguably far more reason than China to be vocal about any potential U.S. ""takeover"" of a giant Arctic entity like Greenland, as Russia has had a laser-like focus on rising (and rival) geostrategic interests in the Arctic in recent years.

That's with good reason: Russia is the largest Arctic nation by far, spanning 53% of the Arctic Ocean coastline, and it has longstanding geopolitical, strategic and socio-economic interests in the region. 

The Arctic is a strategic driver of jobs, investment, and growth for the Russian economy with oil, gas, and mineral extraction industries based there, as well as fisheries and infrastructure and transportation logistics, particularly related to the Northern Sea Route — a major Arctic shipping route for Russia between Europe and Asia.

In addition, Russia maintains its sea-based nuclear deterrent in the Arctic and has a number of military bases and airfields there, as well as a specialized fleet of icebreakers to facilitate trade, transportation, and resource extraction in the territory.

Russia's Arctic interests could well be impacted by the U.S.' fixation on Greenland, and in particular, any move to take over the island by force. But analysts told CNBC that Moscow was more interested in seeing its ultimate goal — the destruction of NATO — realised.

""The Russian stake in Greenland is tiny,"" Jamie Shea, former deputy assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges at NATO, told CNBC Wednesday. 

""The U.S. would have a larger presence in the North Atlantic [if it increased its presence in Greenland] but NATO is already limiting what Russia can do in the High North with Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the U.K. all increasing their military presence and capability in the region, and Sweden and Finland joining NATO. So not much would change for Russia strategically,"" Shea, an international defense and security expert at think tank Chatham House, added.

However, Russian President Vladimir Putin would be ""delighted to see further divisions and incoherence in NATO and a massive transatlantic crisis that could lead the U.S. to stop its support for Ukraine and withdraw U.S. troops from Europe,"" the analyst noted. 

Furthermore, if the U.S. were ""tied up in the Western Hemisphere,"" that would ultimately give Russia more space to increase its influence in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe. 

""So, on balance, [it would be] a massive win for Putin for which he pays no price,"" Shea said.

Trump's renewed Greenland bid, and the threat that he could resort to using military force to acquire it, have sent shock waves through NATO and its European member states this week. 

Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly told Trump that the island is not up for grabs, or up for sale, and that any military action to seize it would spell the end of the NATO alliance. 

European leaders have also pushed back against Trump, stating that ""it is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.""

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to meet with Danish officials next week. 

The obvious alarm among European leaders, and the growing possibility of NATO's dissolution, are ""an absolute gift to Putin,"" Edward R. Arnold, senior research fellow at RUSI, told CNBC. 

""Putin's always known, and Soviet leaders before him knew, that Russia can't defeat NATO militarily. It's too powerful, so it needs to defeat NATO politically, which is basically to make Article Five out to be hollow [and to] try and move the U.S. away from European interests to the point that they can expose that,"" he added.

If Greenland's annexation did become a more realistic prospect, ""NATO is effectively going to eat itself politically,"" Arnold added.

In this article

CrowdStrike announced Thursday that it is buying identity management startup SGNL in a deal valued at nearly $740 million as the cybersecurity provider beefs up defenses in the age of artificial intelligence cyberattacks.

Shares fell nearly 4%. 

The acquisition will help users of CrowdStrike's Falcon cloud security platform better manage human and AI identity access requests and real-time risks, the company said. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of the 2027 fiscal year.

""This is a massive opportunity for our customers to be able to protect themselves, and a massive opportunity for us to disrupt the identity market,"" CEO George Kurtz said in an exclusive interview with CNBC. 

He said the deal will help advance CrowdStrike's foothold in the multibillion-dollar identity security business, which totaled $435 million at the end of the second quarter and has become one of the most significant attack vectors. 

Companies have been bolstering identity security defenses as AI heightens the sophistication of cyberattacks. 

Last year, Microsoft was hit with a wave of attacks targeting its SharePoint collaboration tool and large language model startup Anthropic disclosed the first documented AI-led cyberattack in November.  

SGNL, which is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, raised $30 million in an early funding round in February. The company's backers include Cisco Investments and Microsoft's Venture Fund. 

The company was founded in 2021 by Scott Kriz and Erik Gustavson, whose previous startup was acquired by Google in 2017. Both founders worked at the search giant for more than four years.

Cybersecurity providers such as CrowdStrike have ramped up acquisitions in recent months to offer a fuller suite of capabilities to customers in an increasingly competitive market. 

Businesses are also leaning into more autonomous agent-powered AI solutions to manage cybersecurity tools. 

Last year, competitor Palo Alto Networks scooped up Israeli startup CyberArk for $25 billion in a big bet from CEO Nikesh Arora and Google landed cloud security startup Wiz for $32 billion.

In 2025, CrowdStrike announced plans to buy AI agentic security platform Pangea and Spanish data startup Onum. 

Kurtz said the company's acquisition strategy is to buy successful teams and innovative technology over legacy tools. 

""We want to offer the most value to our customers where they can consolidate on CrowdStrike — less vendors, less complexities, less cost and with a better outcome of stopping breaches,"" he said.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin mining equities opened in the green on Thursday, as the price of bitcoin slipped below $90,000 at market open, only to quickly regain the crucial support level.

Bitcoin slipped to a 5-day low of $89,538 in early trading hours before rising back above $90,000. At the time of publication, bitcoin is hovering around $90,300 and down 1% over the last day.

Bitcoin mining stocks, particularly those enmeshed in AI expansions, have largely shrugged off the volatility.

IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) and Hut 8 (NASDAQ: HUT) posted gains upon market open, as IREN rose 6% to $46.27 on the day, while Hut 8 increased 2.1% to $59.09.

Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF) registered a 6% surge at market open to $2.96. The company announced its strategic transition to AI and HPC workloads in November.

Pure-play bitcoin miners also faced selling pressure. CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) was up 1% to $12.04 on the day, while Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) was essentially flat at 0.20% to $15.31.

Other operators showed muted volatility. HIVE (NASDAQ: HIVE) climbed 2.5% to $3.14 at market open. TeraWulf (NASDAQ: WULF) rose 4% to $12.98, and MARA (NASDAQ: MARA) edged up 3.6% to $10.44.

About us

Copy link

Since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, Crypto Twitter has been speculating if the country's regime holds a Bitcoin stockpile and how big it is. 

Venezuela has been haunted by hyperinflation for decades, which has forced its citizens to turn to digital assets and made Venezuela the 11th top country for digital-asset adoption in 2025, according to TRM Labs.

But does the country actually own a large stack of Bitcoin or is it just social media conjecture?

Here's everything we know about Venezuela's supposed crypto riches.

While a much circulated newsletter by Bradley Hope's Whale Hunting suggests that the Maduro regime sits on 600,000 Bitcoin worth billions of dollars, it is just hypothetical and not based on any hard evidence. 

Blockchain forensics firms told DL News that they've struggled to find any Bitcoin at all held by the regime.

“We have not identified any such holdings at present,” Matteo Colledan, VP of business development at blockchain surveillance firm Arkham, told DL News. “We are still assessing whether any holdings exist.”

Global Head of Policy at TRM Labs, Ari Redbord, added that while the firm was looking for a centralised government stockpile, the country's crypto exposure was more “fragmented, opportunistic, and adaptive, rather than the deliberate accumulation of a sovereign crypto reserve.”

Redbord told DL News that while they continue to investigate all credible angles, “we are not currently seeing onchain data that supports the existence of a large, centrally managed Venezuelan state Bitcoin treasury anywhere near the scale being suggested.” 

Venezuela's ties to crypto are real, however. 

In 2018, the government launched the Petro, an oil-backed digital currency that was widely criticised as a sanctions evasion tool that largely failed to gain traction.

TRM Labs said in a December report that state entities were directed to use digital-asset payment mechanisms for oil-related and cross-border transactions. 

Then there's citizen adoption. Venezuela's hyperinflation — the country recorded a 500% inflation rate in 2025 — has driven the local population to stablecoins and Bitcoin as a hedge against the collapsing bolívar. 

Bitcoin mining has also flourished due to the country's cheap energy, although the government has cracked down on unauthorised operations and seized equipment.

Nobel peace prize winner and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who is hoping to lead the country, even spoke in September 2024 of how Bitcoin is a “vital means of resistance” for the Venezuelan people.

But grassroots adoption by desperate citizens scrambling for financial stability is not the same as a secret government Bitcoin treasury. 

The former is well-documented. The latter remains speculation — or an enviable effort in camouflage. 

“If they do have 600,000, then they are really really good at hiding it,” Frank Weert from Whale Alert told DL News.

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered three malicious npm packages that are designed to deliver a previously undocumented malware called NodeCordRAT.

The names of the packages, all of which were taken down as of November 2025, are listed below. They were uploaded by a user named ""wenmoonx.""

""The bitcoin-main-lib and bitcoin-lib-js packages execute a postinstall.cjs script during installation, which installs bip40, the package that contains the malicious payload,"" Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Satyam Singh and Lakhan Parashar said. ""This final payload, named NodeCordRAT by ThreatLabz, is a remote access trojan (RAT) with data-stealing capabilities.""

NodeCordRAT gets its name from the use of npm as a propagation vector and Discord servers for command-and-control (C2) communications. The malware is equipped to steal Google Chrome credentials, API tokens, and seed phrases from cryptocurrency wallets like MetaMask.

According to the cybersecurity company, the threat actor behind the campaign is assessed to have named the packages after real repositories found within the legitimate bitcoinjs project, such as bitcoinjs-lib, bip32, bip38, and bip38.

Both ""bitcoin-main-lib"" and ""bitcoin-lib-js"" include a ""package.json"" file that features ""postinstall.cjs"" as a postinstall script, leading to the execution of ""bip40"" that contains the NodeCordRAT payload.

The malware, besides fingerprinting the infected host to generate a unique identifier across Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, leverages a hard-coded Discord server to open a covert communication channel to receive instructions and execute them -

""This data is exfiltrated using Discord's API with a hardcoded token and sent to a private channel,"" Zscaler said. ""The stolen files are uploaded as message attachments via Discord's REST endpoint /channels/{id}/messages.""

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) retreated from recent highs on Thursday as institutional investors locked in profits after a strong start to the year. Over the past 24 hours, the price eased from around $93,000 (£69,175) to just above $90,000, representing a roughly 2.5% pullback, coinciding with notable outflows from major US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Data from SoSoValue shows US spot bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs registered $486m in net outflows on Wednesday. Outflows also hit ether (ETH-USD) ($98.45m) and XRP (XRP-USD) ($40.80m) spot ETFs.

BlackRock's (BLK) IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC products saw the most redemptions, with roughly $129m and $247m in outflows respectively.

Even with the setback, bitcoin (BTC-USD) remains up more than 3% over the past week, while ether (ETH-USD) is still 6% higher over seven days despite falling 3% on the day, according to CoinGecko.

As of publication, bitcoin (BTC-USD) spot ETFs collectively hold $118.36bn in net assets, representing around 6.5% of the total bitcoin market capitalisation.

Read more: Will bitcoin price sink to $50k or soar to $125k in 2026?

Analysts argue the latest dip is more about positioning and profit-taking than any deterioration in bitcoin's (BTC-USD) underlying trend.

Wenny Cai, COO of SynFutures, told Yahoo Finance UK that bitcoin (BTC-USD) has entered 2026 with a “more complex setup than in prior cycles” as the asset recovers from a turbulent end to 2025. She noted that after slipping from its October highs near $126,000, price action in early January has shown “renewed momentum” with markets firming across major exchanges.

Cai said the near-term picture suggests a range-bound market, pointing to resistance in the $95,000–$98,000 band. This reflects, she said, a mix of profit-taking and selective re-risking as investors wait for a clearer catalyst.

She also argued that structural forces such as ETF development, digital-asset corporate treasury strategies, and the rise of real-world asset-linked products mean bitcoin's (BTC-USD) trajectory is increasingly tied to macroeconomic dynamics rather than pure speculation.

She added that institutional interest remains a “persistent source of demand” that can support more stable capital flows, even as volatility persists.

Longer term, Cai views fundamentals for the digital asset as still intact, citing bitcoin's (BTC-USD) capped supply, growing institutional adoption, and “digital scarcity” narrative. However, she cautioned that risks around macro conditions, regulation, and shifting risk appetite could amplify volatility. Market participants, she said, should balance optimism with “disciplined risk management.”

Brickken market analyst Enmanuel Cardozo described bitcoin's (BTC-USD) current positioning as a phase of recalibration rather than weakness. Speaking to Yahoo Finance UK he described the current price action as reflecting a market that “has reset after an extended period of risk reduction,” with excess leverage cleared, volatility compressed and ETF flows stabilising.

Cardozo argued that bitcoin (BTC-USD) is behaving less like a speculative trade and more like a “maturing strategic allocation” tied to global liquidity trends and evolving capital market structures. He added that the asset's recent consolidation may be forming a base for the “next leg higher,” supported by steady structural demand.

Oops, something went wrong

Blockchain security platform Cyvers flagged a suspicious on-chain transaction involving the Truebit Protocol, with an estimated loss of roughly $26 million.

Cyvers said its real-time monitoring systems detected an anomalous transfer in which a single address received around 8,535 ETH, labeled on-chain as “Truebit Protocol: Purchase.”

Based on current market prices, the transaction value is estimated at approximately $26 million.

According to Cyvers, the activity triggered alerts due to unusual behavioral patterns and elevated risk indicators identified by its detection models.

The firm described the transfer as inconsistent with typical transaction flows associated with the protocol.

As of publication, Truebit has not publicly disclosed any security incident or confirmed a loss, and no official explanation has been provided regarding the nature or purpose of the transaction.

It remains unclear whether the funds were moved as part of an exploit, an internal operation, or a misconfigured contract interaction.

Truebit is a blockchain protocol that focuses on verifying complex computations without running them directly on-chain.

Instead of executing heavy calculations on Ethereum, Truebit allows them to be processed off-chain and later checked for correctness using cryptographic and economic safeguards.

The protocol was created to help smart contracts handle tasks that are too expensive or technically difficult to run on a blockchain, such as large data processing or advanced logic.

Meanwhile, Cyvers said it continues to monitor the address and related transactions for further movement of funds.

The firm did not attribute the activity to a confirmed exploit but emphasized that the transaction met its internal criteria for anomalous behavior.

This is a developing story.

Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,300 resistance and dipped. ETH is now showing a few bearish signs and might decline toward $3,080.

Ethereum Price Trims Gains

Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,300 and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH price dipped below $3,240 and $3,220 to enter a short-term bearish zone.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $3,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even dipped below $3,150. A low was formed at $3,123, and the price is now consolidating losses. It tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,308 swing high to the $3,123 low.

Ethereum price is now trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls can protect more losses below $3,120, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $3,180 level.

The first key resistance is near the $3,200 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,220 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,308 swing high to the $3,123 low.

A clear move above the $3,220 resistance might send the price toward the $3,250 resistance. An upside break above the $3,250 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,300 resistance zone or even $3,320 in the near term.

More Losses In ETH?

If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,220 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,120 level. The first major support sits near the $3,080 zone.

A clear move below the $3,080 support might push the price toward the $3,020 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,000 region.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC) fell back below $90,000, dropping sharply from a local high of $91,570 at 01:15 UTC to trade at its lowest level in five days.

The drawdown follows a third failure to break through $94,500 after attempts on Dec. 4 and Dec. 10, with price action mirroring that of the past six weeks.

Bitcoin's trading range is now well defined between $85,000 and $94,500, with the zone providing some stability in recent weeks after prices tumbled on Oct. 6 from a record high of $126,220 to $80,600 by Nov. 21.

Altcoins underperformed on Thursday as privacy coin zcash (ZEC) plunged by more than 16% between midnight UTC and 10:00. PUMP also suffered a double-digit decline over the same period.

U.S. equity index futures also fell. Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures are trading 0.27% and 0.29% lower, respectively, since midnight while the dollar index (DXY) continues its ascent. It has now risen by more than 1% since Dec. 24.

Over $400 million in leveraged crypto futures bets have been liquidated in 24 hours, with bullish bets accounting for most of the tally, a sign that the leverage was skewed bearish.

Overall open interest (OI) in crypto futures has pulled back to $140 billion from more than $141 billion Wednesday, which was the highest in nearly two months.

OI in bitcoin futures increased by 2% alongside positive funding rates. Some traders seem to be buying the price dip.

OI in ETH, SOL, XRP, ZEC and SUI, in contrast, dropped, indicating capital outflows.

Funding rates for most major cryptocurrencies, except BNB, remain positive, indicating dominance of bullish long positions. In altcoins, LINK, XLM, AVAX and CC stand out with negative rates.

On Deribit, BTC and ETH puts continue to trade at a premium to calls, indicating persistent downside bias. The put bias, however, stands notably weakened in short-dated options compared with last month.

Block flows show strong investor bias for volatility strategies such as straddles and strangles in both bitcoin and ether. Ether flows also featured put spreads.

Altcoins suffered one of the most grueling selloffs of recent weeks with ZEC, PUMP and DASH leading the way with drawdowns of above 10%.

DeFi was the worst performing sector, according to CoinDesk Indices data, with the DeFi index (DFX) posting a loss of 3.12% since midnight, closely followed by the memecoin index (CDMEME), which fell 3.09%.

The CoinDesk 20 dropped 2.23%, indicating larger market cap tokens fared better than the more speculative sectors.

This can be attributed to a continued void in liquidity and market depth across the altcoin ecosystem following a liquidation cascade in early October that evaporated $19 billion worth of derivatives positions.

The lack of liquidity was prevalent on Thursday as a $12 million long position was liquidated on zcash (ZEC), causing exaggerated losses compared with the wider market as the order books lacked sufficient bids to absorb the position.

ZEC faces uncertainty after members of its development team quit following a clash with a nonprofit organization created to support the network.

CoinMarketCap's ""altcoin season"" indicator remains firmly in a bearish zone at 23/100, a far cry from in September when it topped 78/100.

Geneva, Switzerland, January 8th, 2026, FinanceWire

TRON DAO, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), welcomes the recognition of the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU) in a recent report published by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). As a global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, FATF helps set international standards and drive policy aimed to prevent these illegal activities and the harm they cause to society through national legislative and regulatory reforms. In its latest publication, FATF recognized the T3 FCU as a prime example of an effective public-private collaboration to combat illicit activity on the blockchain, highlighting the initiative's comprehensive monitoring capability, which enables T3 FCU to work across borders, identifying and disrupting criminal operations in real-time, making it an invaluable resource for law enforcement agencies worldwide.

T3 FCU is a first-of-its-kind public-private initiative launched by TRON, Tether, and TRM Labs in September 2024 to combat illicit activities on the blockchain. This groundbreaking public-private partnership works directly with law enforcement agencies around the globe to identify and disrupt criminal networks. Since its inception, and in just over one year, T3 FCU has frozen more than $300 million in criminal assets across five continents, established rapid response capabilities to address threats, and demonstrated how industry collaboration can effectively combat financial crime while supporting blockchain innovation. 

In its report, the Financial Action Task Force noted that the T3 FCU “is designed to expand public-private collaboration to combat illicit activities on the blockchain” and highlighted the unit's role in supporting law enforcement efforts across multiple jurisdictions. The report further detailed that, since its launch in September 2024, T3 FCU has analyzed millions of transactions globally, monitored more than $3 billion USD in total volume, and supported the freezing of over $250 million USD in illicit assets.

In a recent blog post examining the FATF's asset recovery guidance and best practices, TRM Labs notes a shift toward real-time interdiction, observing that traditional post-investigation recovery models are increasingly ineffective for fast-moving virtual assets. It emphasizes the importance of coordinated public-private action, supported by blockchain intelligence and close collaboration among law enforcement, virtual asset service providers, and stablecoin issuers, to identify, restrain, and disrupt illicit funds before they can be dispersed, underscoring the growing role of operational models that enable timely cross-border enforcement.
		



The FATF's recognition affirms T3 FCU as an industry-first model of how blockchain-based systems can reinforce global financial integrity through structured collaboration with public authorities. It further reinforces TRON DAO's commitment to responsible blockchain adoption and effective financial crime prevention, serving as meaningful validation of coordinated, cross-sector efforts to address illicit activity at scale as regulators continue to evaluate the role of public blockchains in the global financial system.

NFT Paris and its sibling summit, RWA Paris, have cancelled this year's events due to market uncertainty. Organisers say the numbers stopped working. Simple as that.

NFT Paris had grown used to calling itself a fixture. Launched in 2022, it quickly became Europe's most visible Web3 gathering, drawing crowds from digital ownership, culture and currency. Twenty thousand visitors were not unusual. There were hundreds of speakers and late-night panels promoting decentralisation.

This year was meant to be bigger than ever. Instead, Alexandre Tsydenkov, the founder and constant presence behind the event, announced the cancellation on LinkedIn. stating, “The crypto and NFT downturn hit hard. Too hard.” 

In its early editions, NFT Paris leaned heavily into visual art. Digital galleries. Over time, the tone changed. Less art. More infrastructure. More talk of chains, platforms, scaling up. The sponsor lists reflected that drift. John Karp, who runs Lisbon's Non Fungible Conference, has pointed out that art made up a sliver of the ecosystem, probably under five per cent of sponsors. From that angle, the cancellation is a verdict on NFT art more than on the machinery built around it.

RWA Paris was meant to steady things. A pivot toward real-world assets. Property, luxury goods, commodities. The promise of bridging traditional finance and decentralised systems. It sounded like an exciting prospect to many. Institutional money hesitated. Compliance costs climbed. Ticket sales never materialised.

Tsydenkov's note to his team carried weariness. “Thank you for everything. You deserved better. Four years. Tens of thousands through the doors. Hundreds of speakers. Connections made, then scattered. Endings are tough. No attempt to dress it up.”

All ticket holders will be refunded. Around $230 for general admission. Just over $1,100 for VIP access.

Nike (NKE) has confirmed that it sold its digital product subsidiary RTFKT in December last year, marking a strategic retreat from the NFT space. The company stated that the sale represents an adjustment toward a new chapter and that it will continue to invest in innovative experiences that blend physical, digital, and virtual environments. However, specific transaction terms and buyer information were not disclosed.

In December 2021, Nike acquired RTFKT, known for virtual sneakers and NFTs, to accelerate its digital transformation and expand its virtual product portfolio. The brand, through its CloneX collaboration with artist Takashi Murakami, was seen as a key lever for entering Web3 during the NFT boom at the time. However, as the overall NFT market declined, demand and pricing power for RTFKT significantly contracted. In 2024, Nike gradually scaled back related investments, halted new NFT production, and ultimately shut down RTFKT operations by the end of the year.

The termination of RTFKT sparked a class-action lawsuit from NFT holders. Plaintiffs accused Nike of failing to register the NFTs as securities and inadequately disclosing project termination risks, violating consumer protection laws in multiple jurisdictions and causing investor losses. While the exact claim amount was unspecified, it exceeded $5 million. Nike's situation is not an isolated case; traditional companies such as Starbucks (SBUX) and Disney (DIS) have also faced setbacks in their Web3 ventures due to market volatility and business model challenges.

Behind the market frenzy lie deeper issues of trust and regulation. Persistent problems include difficulties in verifying ownership, ambiguous rights definitions, and a lack of consumer protection mechanisms. Many NFTs contain only hyperlinks that can easily become invalid, confer no substantial rights, and vary widely in quality. Fraud and theft are frequent, while trading platforms often rely on “buyer beware” principles with insufficient oversight. Even during the market downturn, some industry participants remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of NFTs, with projects by brands like Louis Vuitton and organizations like the NBA still moving forward. However, such practices often depend on the credibility of centralized institutions, diverging from the early vision of decentralization.

The journey from Nike's acquisition to the sale of RTFKT reflects the cyclical shift of the NFT market from hype to rationality. Finding a sustainable balance between technological innovation, business models, and regulatory frameworks remains a core challenge for industry participants.

Our new report released today shows how the rise of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the way we live our lives, with personal shopping ‘AI-gents' potentially arriving within the next five years. 

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence that allows for more activities to be automated - making decisions, interacting with its environment, solving problems in real time and mimicking some types of reasoning and planning. 

So-called agentic commerce is set to become a mainstay of people's busy lives, with customers' personal AI-powered agents anticipating shopping needs and making proactive purchases based on learned and defined preferences or behaviours, along with knowledge of upcoming plans, rather than needing specific prompts.   

This means that digital shopping companions could soon check personal bank accounts to ensure a purchase is within monthly budget, assess how it will affect other spending plans, schedule purchases around seasonal sale events such as the January sales and even negotiate a price directly with sellers.   

This might even extend to agents seeking out tailored financing options to present to their human shopper for agreement.    

William Malcolm, Executive Director of Regulatory Risk and Innovation, said:  

“Agentic AI will have the capacity to make decisions and take actions independently. Our own personal AI agents could be paying for goods, booking flights and helping with household finances.  

“While the potential benefits could be transformational, the public needs assurances their personal information is secure and well managed before placing their trust in agentic systems.  

“Strong data protection foundations can help build that public trust and can help scale the fast and safe adoption of AI. Throughout 2026 the ICO will actively monitor advancements and work with AI developers and deployers to ensure they are clear on what the law requires of them.”

The development of agentic artificial intelligence could give rise to personal shopping ‘AI-gents' within the next five years, according to a new report from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

The data regulator explores how agentic commerce could become the norm, with customers' personal agents anticipating shopping needs and making proactive purchases based on learned and defined preferences or behaviours along with knowledge of upcoming plans - rather than having to have specific prompts.  

This means that personalised digital shopping companions could soon have the ability to check personal bank accounts to ensure a purchase is within a monthly budget, assess how it will affect other spending plans, schedule purchases around seasonal sale events like the January sales and even negotiate a price directly with sellers. Agents may also seek out tailored financing options to present to their human shopper for agreement.  

The ICO is reminding retailers wanting to interact with customers through their own agentic AI systems that they are obligated to make sure data privacy is embedded from the start. It adds that retailers cannot rely on developers alone to do this and cautions against implementing off the shelf or one size fits all agentic solutions which could cause privacy problems in the future. Organisations are encouraged to refer to the ICO's AI guidance. 

William Malcolm, Executive Director of Regulatory Risk and Innovation, ICO, says: “Agentic AI will have the capacity to make decisions and take actions independently. Our own personal AI agents could be paying for goods, booking flights and helping with household finances. While the potential benefits could be transformational, the public needs assurances their personal information is secure and well managed before placing their trust in agentic systems.”  

He adds: “Strong data protection foundations can help build that public trust and can help scale the fast and safe adoption of AI. Throughout 2026 the ICO will actively monitor advancements and work with AI developers and deployers to ensure they are clear on what the law requires of them.”

New ICO Report Urges Caution on Agentic AI


                                                                                Graham Turner

The regulator warns that responsibilities around data protection compliance do not just rest with agentic AI developers but also those who are adopting the technology.




                                                                                Graham Turner

A new report from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) describes the transformative ways in which agentic AI could change our lives within the next five years – including personal shopping agents that have the potential to make proactive purchases on a consumer's behalf using their payment details.

However, the data regulator is urging both developers and adopters to be aware of the new data protection challenges that the advent of agentic AI presents: the processing of personal information beyond what is necessary; issues around determining controller and processing responsibilities throughout the agentic AI supply chain and new threats to cybersecurity.

Findings from the latest Tech Futures report go on to emphasise how the design and architecture of agentic systems are critical. Poorly implemented systems – such as those with unclear purposes, unnecessary database connections, or weak governance – could heighten risks.

The report also suggests that developers and adopters will find it useful to familiarise themselves with the differences in agentic AI compared to more traditional models – including the extent to which its capabilities and limitations meet the needs of the purpose it is being developed for.

Conversely, privacy by design offers opportunities for innovation, including data protection-compliant agents, agentic controls, privacy management agents, and benchmarking tools.

William Malcolm, Executive Director of Regulatory Risk and Innovation, ICO said:  “Agentic AI will have the capacity to make decisions and take actions independently. Our own personal AI agents could be paying for goods, booking flights and helping with household finances.

“These systems can handle vast amounts of personal information, so both developers and adopting organisations must ensure transparency, security, and compliance is built in from the start.

“While the potential benefits could be transformational, the public needs assurances their personal information is secure and well managed before placing their trust in agentic systems.

“Strong data protection foundations can help build that public trust and can help scale the fast and safe adoption of AI. Throughout 2026 the ICO will actively monitor advancements and work with AI developers and deployers to ensure they are clear on what the law requires of them.”

Organisations in the process of developing products and services using personal information and agentic AI in the public interest are encouraged to explore the ICO's range of innovation services including its Regulatory Sandbox. ICO guidance for developers of AI solutions can be found here.

The regulator will also be launching a consultation on its new draft guidance on Automated Decision Making (ADM) in 2026. The ICO continues to liaise with other regulators and government bodies, including the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum, on issues related to data privacy and the development of AI.

Oops, something went wrong

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is pointing to China as a model for US stablecoin policy. The timing raises questions about his motives.

Armstrong's defense of China's central bank digital currency interest payments comes as his company fights to preserve a key revenue stream under threat from the US banking lobby. The GENIUS Act, passed last July, allows platforms like Coinbase to share yields with stablecoin holders — a provision that banking groups are now pushing to eliminate.

Armstrong took to X on January 8 to praise China's approach to its digital currency. ""China has decided to pay interest on its own stablecoin, because it benefits ordinary people, and they recognize it as a competitive advantage,"" he wrote. ""I worry we are missing the forest through the trees in the US.""

He argued that allowing rewards on stablecoins would benefit ordinary Americans without disrupting bank lending, and called for letting ""the market do both.""

But from China, the reaction was bemusement. Crypto analyst Phyrex pointed out a fundamental error in Armstrong's framing: the digital yuan is not a stablecoin.

According to Phyrex, the interest payments are not a sign of competitive strength but a response to persistently low adoption. Yuan held in WeChat Pay and Alipay, China's dominant mobile payment platforms, earns interest, while the digital yuan previously offered none, creating little incentive for users to switch. The interest program that took effect January 1 is subsidized by commercial banks, not the central bank, and rates are likely below standard demand deposit rates.

Armstrong's comments landed amid an intense lobbying war over US stablecoin regulation.

The GENIUS Act, passed in July 2025, prohibited stablecoin issuers from paying interest directly to holders but allowed third-party platforms, such as exchanges, to share yields through ""rewards"" programs. This compromise favored platforms like Coinbase.

The banking industry has pushed back hard. In November, the American Bankers Association and 52 state banking associations sent a letter to the Treasury Department urging regulators to close this ""loophole."" They argued that stablecoin platforms offering high-yield rewards could trigger deposit outflows, threatening up to $6.6 trillion in lending capacity.

The lobbying continued this week. On January 7, more than 200 community bank leaders sent a letter to the Senate asking lawmakers to extend the GENIUS Act's interest prohibition to issuers' affiliates and partners.

Armstrong fired back on December 26, calling any attempt to reopen the GENIUS Act a ""red line."" He criticized banks for earning roughly 4% on reserves parked at the Federal Reserve while paying depositors near zero, and accused them of ""mental gymnastics"" in framing yield restrictions as safety concerns.

Armstrong's invocation of China appears designed to construct a competitive narrative: if China is doing it, why can't America?

The comparison invites scrutiny. A CBDC and a private stablecoin are different instruments — the digital yuan is legal tender issued by China's central bank, while USDC and USDT are dollar-pegged tokens from private companies. Critics like Phyrex argue the digital yuan's interest program reflects adoption struggles, not competitive strength.

But Armstrong's broader point — that yield-sharing benefits ordinary people and shouldn't be restricted — may resonate regardless of whether his China example holds up. The US debate ultimately centers on a different question: how much room private platforms should have to compete with banks for deposits.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has praised China's central bank digital currency (CBDC) policy, sparking debate during an ongoing regulatory fight. He supported China's move to offer interest on its digital yuan while defending U.S. stablecoin rewards threatened by banking lobby pressure. His remarks drew criticism and raised questions about timing and motives.

On January 8, Armstrong posted on X, praising China's interest model for its digital yuan, calling it a “competitive advantage.” He argued that allowing interest-like rewards on U.S. stablecoins would support consumers and promote innovation. “We are missing the forest through the trees in the U.S.,” he wrote.

China has decided to pay interest on their own stablecoin, because it benefits ordinary people, and they recognize it as a competitive advantage.

I worry we are missing the forest through the trees in the U.S. Rewards on stablecoins will not change lending one bit – but it does… https://t.co/nrpa8eSKUs

— Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 7, 2026



Armstrong said these rewards help regular people and don't harm traditional lending, urging regulators to let markets decide freely. However, Chinese analysts dismissed the comparison, stressing that China's digital yuan is a central bank instrument, not a private stablecoin. They noted that China's interest program responds to low adoption, not competitive strength.

Crypto commentator Phyrex clarified that interest on the digital yuan is subsidized by commercial banks, not China's central bank. He said that the interest rates remain below demand deposit levels and are intended to boost digital yuan usage. Armstrong's interpretation, according to critics, misrepresents the policy's true purpose and context.

The GENIUS Act passed in July 2025 allows platforms to offer yield-sharing on stablecoins, though it bars issuers from direct interest payments. This exception benefits companies like Coinbase that offer “rewards” without violating interest bans. However, U.S. banking groups now seek to eliminate this flexibility through new regulatory proposals.

In November, the American Bankers Association and 52 state associations sent a letter asking the Treasury to close what they call a “loophole.” They claimed that stablecoin rewards could drain bank deposits and risk up to $6.6 trillion in lending. Banks want restrictions extended to platforms partnering with stablecoin issuers.

More pressure followed on January 7, when over 200 community bank leaders wrote to the Senate with similar demands. They asked lawmakers to apply the same rules to affiliates and partners of stablecoin issuers. These efforts challenge Coinbase's ability to maintain a key revenue stream under the current rules.

Armstrong responded sharply on December 26, warning against any rollback of the GENIUS Act's protections for platforms. He said banks earn about 4% on reserves at the Federal Reserve while offering near-zero to customers. He accused them of “mental gymnastics” for framing rewards programs as financial risks.

His comparison to China, though challenged, appears aimed at showing global momentum for digital currency incentives. Armstrong suggests the U.S. should not fall behind on offering consumer benefits. The appeal to China's policy positions Coinbase in opposition to traditional banking power.

While Armstrong's framing of China CBDC policy faces scrutiny, his broader argument remains directed at preserving platform-level stablecoin rewards. The debate now shifts to lawmakers considering whether platforms should retain this exemption. Discussions continue as the Senate reviews the latest letters from banking leaders.

As of January 8, 2026, the financial world stands at a crossroads. China's digital yuan, officially termed the e-CNY, is rapidly gaining ground as a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) with the potential to challenge the US dollar's long-standing reign as the world's reserve currency. With over 140 million users already testing the digital yuan in China, according to recent People's Bank of China data, this isn't just a technological experiment—it's a geopolitical maneuver that could reshape global trade, influence cryptocurrency markets, and alter the balance of economic power. Why does this matter to you? Whether you're an investor, a business owner, or simply someone with a stake in the global economy, the rise of the digital yuan could impact everything from the value of your savings to the cost of international transactions. Let's dive into what this means for the future and why the stakes have never been higher.

The digital yuan's ascent is no longer a distant possibility—it's happening now. Launched as a pilot in several Chinese cities over the past few years, the e-CNY has seen remarkable adoption. By late 2025, transaction volumes using the digital yuan surpassed $14 billion, as reported by the People's Bank of China. This isn't just about domestic use; China is aggressively pushing the digital yuan into international trade through initiatives like the Belt and Road, which spans over 140 countries.

Recent developments paint a vivid picture of accelerating momentum. In December 2025, China announced partnerships with several Asian nations to integrate the digital yuan into cross-border payment systems. Meanwhile, the US dollar, which currently accounts for about 58% of global foreign exchange reserves per IMF data, faces growing diversification as countries explore alternatives. The digital yuan's instant transaction capabilities and state backing make it an attractive option for nations looking to reduce reliance on the dollar.

But it's not all smooth sailing. Regulatory hurdles and concerns over privacy—given the Chinese government's ability to monitor transactions—have sparked skepticism. Still, the sheer scale of China's economic influence means this CBDC cannot be ignored. The question isn't if the digital yuan will impact global finance, but how profoundly.

For investors, the rise of the digital yuan is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it signals a potential decline in the US dollar's dominance, which could devalue dollar-denominated assets. If the digital yuan captures even a fraction of global trade—say, 10% by 2030, as some analysts predict—it could trigger a seismic shift in currency markets. This might push investors toward alternative stores of value, like cryptocurrencies or gold.

On the other hand, the digital yuan's expansion could create new opportunities. Countries adopting the e-CNY for trade may see increased economic activity, opening doors for savvy investors in emerging markets. Additionally, the digital yuan's rise could legitimize digital currencies as a whole, potentially driving more institutional interest into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

So, what's the play? Diversification is key. Consider exploring assets outside the traditional dollar system, and for deeper insights into crypto markets, you can get AI-powered insights to guide your decisions. Staying ahead of these trends could mean the difference between safeguarding your portfolio and being left behind.

To grasp the digital yuan's potential, we need to rewind a bit. China began developing the e-CNY in 2014, motivated by a desire to modernize its financial infrastructure and counter the growing influence of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which operates on a permissionless blockchain, the digital yuan is centralized, controlled by the People's Bank of China. This allows for faster transactions and tighter oversight—but also raises questions about privacy and state control.

China's ambitions extend far beyond domestic efficiency. The Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project connecting Asia, Africa, and Europe, serves as a testing ground for the digital yuan. By integrating the e-CNY into trade settlements, China aims to reduce dependence on the US dollar and the SWIFT payment system, which the US can influence through sanctions. If successful, this could position the digital yuan as a viable alternative for international trade, especially in regions wary of US financial dominance.

The US dollar isn't invincible. Its strength relies on trust—trust that has been tested by rising US debt levels (over $35 trillion as of late 2025) and geopolitical tensions. Countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia have already begun exploring de-dollarization strategies, per Bloomberg reports. The digital yuan offers a state-backed digital alternative at a time when trust in traditional systems is wavering, making its timing almost perfect.

BTC Crypto Chart

Industry leaders and analysts are split on the digital yuan's trajectory. Michael Pettis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has noted that while the digital yuan won't displace the dollar overnight, its integration into global trade could ""chip away at the dollar's dominance over a decade."" On the flip side, some skeptics argue that technological barriers and international resistance to China's influence will limit the e-CNY's reach.

The impact on industries is already visible. Payment giants like Visa and Mastercard are monitoring CBDC developments closely, as digital currencies could disrupt their cross-border transaction models. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency platforms see an opportunity—rising interest in digital assets as a hedge against dollar devaluation has boosted trading volumes. For a deeper dive into market signals, check the AI analysis to stay ahead of the curve.

In the real world, small businesses in Belt and Road countries are beginning to accept digital yuan payments for trade with Chinese firms, as reported by Reuters. This grassroots adoption could snowball, creating a network effect that's hard to reverse.

If the digital yuan gains significant traction—say, capturing 15% of global reserves by 2030, as some projections suggest—the US dollar could face a sharp decline in demand. This would raise borrowing costs for the US government and potentially weaken the dollar's purchasing power. For investors holding dollar-denominated assets, this is a wake-up call to reassess exposure.

Cryptocurrencies stand to benefit from this uncertainty. Bitcoin, often dubbed ""digital gold,"" saw its market cap climb to $1.2 trillion in early 2026, per CoinGecko data, as investors sought alternatives. Stablecoins tied to non-dollar assets could also gain traction. Curious about Bitcoin's next move? See AI price prediction for data-driven insights.

For those willing to take calculated risks, emerging markets adopting the digital yuan could offer high-growth potential. Infrastructure projects tied to the Belt and Road Initiative are likely to drive economic activity, creating opportunities in sectors like construction, logistics, and technology. Keeping a pulse on these trends is crucial—consider tools that offer AI fair value estimates to identify undervalued assets.

Let's zoom into the data. The cryptocurrency market, often a leading indicator of shifts in financial sentiment, has shown mixed reactions to the digital yuan's rise. Bitcoin's Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovered around 60 in early January 2026, suggesting bullish momentum without overbought conditions, per TradingView metrics. Ethereum, meanwhile, saw a 12% price increase in the last quarter of 2025, reflecting growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) as a counterbalance to CBDCs.

Here's a snapshot of key market metrics:

These figures suggest a market leaning toward optimism, possibly driven by investors hedging against dollar uncertainty. For more granular data on crypto trends, view AI signals for Bitcoin and other major coins.

On the macroeconomic front, watch for shifts in global reserve compositions. If central banks increase digital yuan holdings, as hinted by recent IMF discussions, expect ripple effects across forex and crypto markets.

ETH Crypto Chart

What does the future hold? Analysts at Goldman Sachs project that by 2030, over 50 countries could adopt the digital yuan for at least some portion of their international trade, potentially accounting for 20% of global transactions in high-adoption scenarios. This would mark a historic shift, though it's contingent on China overcoming technological and diplomatic challenges.

In a bullish scenario, widespread adoption of the digital yuan could drive a 30% surge in cryptocurrency market cap as investors diversify away from the dollar. In a bearish case, if regulatory pushback or tech failures stall the e-CNY, its impact might remain regional, with minimal disruption to global markets.

For now, the trajectory leans toward gradual but meaningful change. The US is responding—talks of a digital dollar gained traction in late 2025, per Federal Reserve minutes. But will it be enough to counter China's first-mover advantage? Only time will tell.

The digital yuan, or e-CNY, is a Central Bank Digital Currency issued and controlled by the People's Bank of China. Unlike Bitcoin, which is decentralized and operates on a public blockchain, the digital yuan is centralized, meaning the government oversees transactions and data. This offers stability and state backing but raises privacy concerns due to potential surveillance.

Yes, but not immediately. The US dollar's dominance stems from its role in global trade and reserves, backed by decades of trust. However, if the digital yuan gains traction through initiatives like the Belt and Road, it could erode the dollar's share over time—potentially by 15% by 2030, according to some projections.

The impact is twofold. On one hand, the digital yuan could compete with stablecoins by offering a government-backed digital alternative. On the other, it may drive interest in decentralized cryptocurrencies as investors seek hedges against dollar devaluation. For detailed forecasts, see what the AI predicts for major coins.

While cryptocurrencies could serve as a hedge against dollar uncertainty, they come with high volatility and risks. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals before diving in. Diversifying your portfolio might be a prudent move, and tools offering professional AI analysis can help inform your strategy.

Since the digital yuan is controlled by the Chinese government, every transaction can be tracked and monitored. This lack of anonymity contrasts sharply with decentralized cryptocurrencies, raising concerns among users and international observers about data security and state overreach.

Follow reports from credible financial news outlets and monitor announcements from the People's Bank of China. Additionally, tracking cryptocurrency market reactions can provide indirect insights into the digital yuan's impact. Platforms offering AI analysis for crypto can also keep you informed on related market shifts.

Digital asset custody and infrastructure firm Fireblocks Inc. has acquired Tres Finance Ltd., a leading provider of crypto accounting, reconciliation and financial management suite for digital assets.

Fireblocks said Wednesday that for years, the cryptocurrency industry has grown from facilitating global payments using digital currency such as stablecoins and generating value using tokenized assets to create a financial ecosystem using the blockchain. With these evolutions, business opportunities continue to grow, creating new operational overheads.

Amid these new needs are tax compliance records for financial operations, and this led the company to ink the deal to buy Tres Finance to build financial controls directly into its infrastructure and virtual asset management platform.

The digital asset regulatory landscape is quickly crystallizing, especially in the United States and the European Union. The U.S. recently passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act in October, providing a framework for banks and businesses to interact with digital assets permissively and the EU passed Markets in Crypto-Assets in 2022, providing a focus on stablecoins.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that maintains parity with another currency, such as the U.S. dollar. This makes stablecoins ideal for retail exchange or as a bridge to more volatile currencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum.

Traditional financial institutions continue to expand their adoption of digital assets and provide them to both businesses and consumers. Banks now tokenize deposits, companies such as PayPal Inc. and Square Inc. offer stablecoin and crypto payments, and neobanks have begun to open treasury and wallets using cryptocurrency and stablecoins.

Blockchain enthusiasts tout that this enables faster settlements, lower costs and the ability to provide payments across borders with less challenge than traditional payment rails.

However, the current cryptocurrency token and cryptocurrency management services lack built-in accounting and reporting systems that interconnect well with existing traditional finance. Fireblocks said this is a gap that Tres Finance will help solve.

The Polymarket account that profited on Nicholas Maduro's capture and ouster as president is inaccessible, adding to concerns over insider trading allegations on prediction markets.

 Cointelegraph in your social feed 

A Polymarket account that earned about $400,000 from a controversial and well-timed bet on the capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is no longer accessible on the platform.

The Polymarket page for account “0x31a56e,” which placed about $32,000 on Maduro's removal as president just before news emerged of his capture by US military and law enforcement, now returns a dead link, Cointelegraph has confirmed.

As of Thursday about 1:00 p.m. UTC, the page showed an error saying “Oops… we didn't forecast this,” while other users' pages remain accessible.

The development comes amid growing concern in the crypto community over high‑profile bets and unusual trading activity on prediction markets.

The Polymarket account in question placed a series of related wagers on Polymarket, according to data available on Wayback Machine.

Along with the bet on Maduro's ouster, the user placed bets on US forces being in Venezuela by Jan. 31, the US “invading Venezuela” by Jan. 31 and on whether US President Donald Trump would “invoke War Powers” against Venezuela by Jan. 31.

The account's corresponding address on the Polygon blockchain received about $436,700 in USDC (USDC) from the Polymarket CTF Exchange on Jan. 3 at 1:41 pm UTC. Hours later, $437,800 of USDC left the address at 11:54 pm UTC.

Polymarket did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment on whether the account had been deliberately deactivated, if the issue was a platform glitch or if the user had deleted their profile. The company has not issued a public statement on the matter.

Polymarket's privacy policy says users can request that the platform delete or return all personal data, including copies and backups.

As mentioned, there are growing concerns over insider trading and transparency in prediction markets, even beyond the crypto community.

Some US lawmakers, including Representative Ritchie Torres, have backed legislation aimed at curbing insider trading on such platforms.

The news comes as a separate trader with an account boasting a reported 100% win rate placed bet on the US striking Iran by the end of January on Polymarket, further fueling scrutiny of insider activity among industry observers.

Jellyfish and Sea Anemones Sleep Just Like Us

Sea anemones and jellyfish don't have brains, but the way their neurons behave during sleep shows some surprising similarities to humans

Jellyfish and sea anemones are curious creatures: these organisms evolved without a brain and, as scientists discovered only in the past few years, don't need one to sleep. The animals do, however, have neurons—nerve cells that appear interconnected throughout their body. And now a new study shows that how these animals sleep is surprisingly similar to humans, suggesting that sleep may have evolved before even the most primitive brains.

The findings, published on Tuesday in Nature Communications, also help answer one of science's prevailing mysteries: Why do animals sleep? They add to past evidence from other animals and humans that sleep provides a “window” for maintenance on the brain and body, helping to repair DNA damage and maintain neuronal health.

“This confirms that sleep allows a window for key housekeeping tasks,” says Philippe Mourrain, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, who studies sleep. Mourrain was not involved in the new study.

The new work shows this function of sleep has been conserved across evolution, he says, from the animals, such as primates, that have one of the most complex brains to cnidarians, such as jellyfish, which have none.

Curiously, the study finds that jellyfish appear to enter a sleeplike state for around eight hours a day and generally at night—a schedule many humans might recognize. Sea anemones also appear to sleep for around a third of the day.

The researchers also showed that when these animals' neurons incurred additional damage induced by the team they slept more, a finding that Mourrain says gives clues to what makes us fall asleep in the first place.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Your Consciousness May Emerge From a Mysterious Quantum Field, Radical New Theory Suggests","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69813565/human-consciousness/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:30:00 GMT","

This interaction could help explain both why quantum processes can occur within environments like the brain and why we lose consciousness under anesthesia.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the mid-1990s, cognitive scientist David Chalmers pondered what he referred to as the “hard problem of consciousness,” which (to put it simply) asked why humans have subjective experience—a far cry from the integration of information that can be described by modern neuroscience. In the ensuing three decades, scientists and philosophers alike have developed numerous theories that are a possible answer to this “hard question,” with names like Global Workspace Theory and Integrated Information Theory. 

However, there are a subset of scientists and thinkers who think that the true answer lies in the quantum realm—more specifically, in our anatomical mind's interaction with that realm. Nobel Prize-laureate Roger Penrose believed that these quantum interactions could explain consciousness, and the resulting theory (along with his work with Stuart Hameroff) eventually became Orchestrated Objective Reduction. 

Now, a new study is proposing its own answer to the problem, but similarly relying on the quantum realm for its explanation. In the study published in the journal Frontiers of Human Neuroscience, Joachim Keppler (research director of the DIWISS Research Institute in Germany) suggested that macroscopic quantum effects could be at play in our minds. Specially, Keppler said, neurological circuits known as cortical microcolumns could be coupling directly with the zero-point field—the lowest-state of quantum fields, whose existence helps explain certain phenomena like the Casimir effect and why helium doesn't freeze even at absolute zero. 

“In this theory, the vacuum is not empty but filled with a fluctuating ocean of energy known as the electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF),” Keppler wrote for Phys.org. “Quantum Electrodynamics-based model calculations demonstrate that specific frequencies (modes) of the ZPF can resonate with glutamate, the brain's most abundant neurotransmitter.”

According to Keppler, glutamate-ZPF coupling answers a few outstanding questions about quantum interactions and consciousness. It's been long stated that the brain is too “warm and wet” for quantum coherence, which (at least in quantum computers) requires extremely cold temperatures—though, thinkers like Hameroff dispute this point. But because a large number of molecules vibrate in unison in this model, coherence domains are protected by large energy gaps, which resist decoherence even in environments like the brain. 

This coupling could also explain the effects of anesthesia, which can pretty effectively sever a human's subjective conscious experience. According to Keppler, anesthesia disrupts the brain's self-organized criticality, which would explain why we experience unconsciousness. 

In response to Penrose's own quantum theory, the great physicist's collaborator Stephen Hawking once wrote that “his argument seemed to be that consciousness is a mystery and quantum gravity is another mystery so they must be related.” Could it be that quantum theories of consciousness are examples of some kind of Holmesian fallacy? It's certainly possible, but until we do finally answer that ever-elusive “hard problem,” all ideas are on the table.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This brain trick makes exercise feel easier","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260107225519.htm","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 07:15:48 GMT","

Why does a brief jog leave some people winded while others seem to glide along with ease?

Training, fitness level, and muscle strength clearly matter. But researchers are finding that the brain also has a powerful influence, especially in how hard physical effort feels.

Why effort feels different from person to person

Effort refers to the energy we use to perform activities like running, cycling, or lifting weights. While this energy use can be measured physically, the experience of effort is not purely mechanical. It is also shaped by perception, which can differ widely from one individual to another.

That perception plays a major role in whether people stick with exercise. When a workout feels overwhelming, people are more likely to stop or avoid it altogether. When the same activity feels manageable, it becomes more enjoyable and easier to continue over time.

This raises an intriguing question. What if the feeling of effort itself could be reduced, helping people push past the sense that exercise is simply too hard?

Benjamin Pageaux, a professor in the School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences at Université de Montréal, is investigating that idea alongside three researchers from Université Savoie Mont Blanc in France as part of an international research project.

Testing vibration during cycling

In a recent study, the research team examined whether vibrating specific tendons could lower the perceived effort of cycling. They used a wearable vibrating device designed to stimulate tendons before exercise.

Volunteers took part in laboratory tests on a stationary bicycle. Each participant completed two conditions: one session after tendon vibration and another without any vibration beforehand.

For the vibration condition, the device was strapped to the Achilles and knee tendons and activated for 10 minutes before cycling began. After that, participants cycled for three minutes at a pace they perceived as either moderate or intense, adjusting their effort to match the target level.

The outcome was striking. After tendon vibration, participants produced more power and showed higher heart rates compared with sessions without vibration. Even though their bodies were working harder, their sense of effort did not increase.

How vibration may alter brain signals

The researchers are now trying to understand how tendon vibration changes the brain's interpretation of effort. While the precise biological mechanisms are still being studied, Pageaux has proposed several possible explanations.

""Depending on the amplitude and frequency of the vibration, we can either excite or inhibit neurons in the spinal cord,"" he said. ""Also, prolonged vibration changes the reactivity of the neuromuscular spindles and alters the signal sent to the brain.""

By changing the information traveling from the muscles to the brain, vibration appears to reshape how movement and exertion are perceived. As a result, exercise can feel easier, even though the muscles are generating more force.

Encouraging people to stay active

Although the findings are encouraging, the research is still in its early stages. The testing so far has been limited to brief cycling sessions under controlled conditions.

""It hasn't been tested in a marathon, only during a short, three-minute cycling exercise,"" Pageaux cautioned. ""Still, this is the first time it's been shown to work with this type of exercise.""

Next, the team plans to examine brain activity more closely during exercise. They intend to use tools such as electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging to see how tendon vibration influences neural activity while people are exerting themselves.

The researchers are also studying the reverse process. They want to better understand how pain and fatigue amplify the feeling of effort and make physical activity feel more difficult.

Ultimately, the goal is to develop strategies that lower perceived effort and help more people become physically active, especially those who are currently sedentary.

""By gaining a better understanding of how the brain evaluates the link between effort and perceived reward during exercise, we hope to promote more regular physical activity,"" Pageaux said. ""And we all know how essential staying active is for our health and well-being!""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists are closing in on the Universe's biggest mystery","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260107225530.htm","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:47:26 GMT","

Scientists have learned a great deal about the universe, yet that knowledge represents only a small fraction of the full picture. Roughly 95% of the cosmos is made up of dark matter and dark energy, leaving just 5% as the familiar matter we can see around us. Dr. Rupak Mahapatra, an experimental particle physicist at Texas A&M University, is working to uncover this hidden majority by designing advanced semiconductor detectors equipped with cryogenic quantum sensors. These technologies support experiments around the world and are helping researchers push deeper into one of science's greatest mysteries.

Mahapatra compares humanity's limited understanding of the universe -- or lack thereof -- to a well-known parable. ""It's like trying to describe an elephant by only touching its tail. We sense something massive and complex, but we're only grasping a tiny part of it.""

Mahapatra and his co-authors recently had their work featured in the respected journal Applied Physics Letters.

What Are Dark Matter and Dark Energy?

Dark matter and dark energy are named for what scientists do not yet know about them. Dark matter makes up most of the mass found in galaxies and galaxy clusters, playing a major role in shaping their structure across vast cosmic distances. Dark energy refers to the force behind the universe's accelerating expansion. Put simply, dark matter acts like cosmic glue, while dark energy drives space itself to expand faster and faster.

Although both are abundant, neither dark matter nor dark energy gives off, absorbs, or reflects light, which makes direct observation extremely difficult. Scientists instead study their influence through gravity, which affects how galaxies move and how large-scale structures form. Dark energy is the dominant component, accounting for about 68% of the universe's total energy, while dark matter contributes roughly 27%.

Detecting Whispers in a Hurricane

At Texas A&M, Mahapatra's research group is developing detectors with extraordinary sensitivity. These instruments are designed to detect particles that interact with ordinary matter only on rare occasions, interactions that could provide critical clues about the nature of dark matter.

""The challenge is that dark matter interacts so weakly that we need detectors capable of seeing events that might happen once in a year, or even once in a decade,"" Mahapatra said.

His team played a role in a leading global dark matter search using a detector known as TESSERACT. ""It's about innovation,"" he said. ""We're finding ways to amplify signals that were previously buried in noise.""

Texas A&M is among a small group of institutions participating in the TESSERACT experiments.

Pushing the Limits of Detection

Mahapatra's current efforts build on decades of experience in advancing particle detection methods. For the past 25 years, he has contributed to the SuperCDMS experiment, which has conducted some of the most sensitive dark matter searches in the world. In a landmark 2014 paper published in Physical Review Letters, Mahapatra and his collaborators introduced voltage-assisted calorimetric ionization detection in the SuperCDMS experiment -- a breakthrough that made it possible to study low-mass WIMPs, a leading dark matter candidate. This advance significantly improved scientists' ability to detect particles that had previously been beyond reach.

In 2022, Mahapatra co-authored another study examining multiple approaches to finding a WIMP, including direct detection, indirect detection and collider searches. The work highlights the importance of combining different strategies to tackle the dark matter problem.

""No single experiment will give us all the answers,"" Mahapatra notes. ""We need synergy between different methods to piece together the full picture.""

Understanding dark matter goes far beyond academic curiosity. It could reveal fundamental principles that govern the universe itself. ""If we can detect dark matter, we'll open a new chapter in physics,"" Mahapatra said. ""The search needs extremely sensitive sensing technologies and it could lead to technologies we can't even imagine today.""

What Are WIMPs?

WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) are considered one of the most promising possibilities for dark matter. These hypothetical particles would interact through gravity and the weak nuclear force, which explains why they are so difficult to detect.

As people return to gyms or start new fitness routines in the new year, new research suggests that even a short burst of intense exercise could play a role in protecting against cancer. Scientists report that as little as 10 minutes of hard physical activity may help slow cancer growth.

The study found that brief, vigorous exercise quickly changes the mix of molecules circulating in the bloodstream. These rapid shifts appear to suppress bowel cancer cell growth while also speeding up the repair of damaged DNA.

How Exercise Changes the Bloodstream

Researchers at Newcastle University discovered that exercise raises the levels of several small molecules in the blood. Many of these molecules are known to reduce inflammation, support healthy blood vessels, and improve metabolism.

When scientists exposed bowel cancer cells in the lab to blood containing these exercise-driven molecules, they observed widespread genetic changes. More than 1,300 genes shifted their activity, including genes involved in DNA repair, energy production, and cancer cell growth.

Published in the International Journal of Cancer, the findings help clarify how physical activity may lower bowel cancer risk. The research shows that exercise sends molecular signals through the bloodstream that influence genes controlling tumor growth and genetic stability.

The results add to growing evidence that staying physically active is an important part of cancer prevention.

New Possibilities for Cancer Treatment

Dr. Sam Orange, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Exercise Physiology at Newcastle University and lead author of the study, said: ""What's remarkable is that exercise doesn't just benefit healthy tissues, it sends powerful signals through the bloodstream that can directly influence thousands of genes in cancer cells.

""It's an exciting insight because it opens the door to find ways that mimic or augment the biological effects of exercise, potentially improving cancer treatment and, crucially, patient outcomes.

""In the future, these insights could lead to new therapies that imitate the beneficial effects of exercise on how cells repair damaged DNA and use fuel for energy.""

The research team found that exercise increased the activity of genes that support mitochondrial energy metabolism. This helps cells use oxygen more efficiently.

At the same time, genes linked to rapid cell division were turned down, which may make cancer cells less aggressive. Blood collected after exercise also boosted DNA repair, activating a key repair gene known as PNKP.

The study included 30 volunteers, both men and women between the ages of 50 and 78. All participants were overweight or obese (a risk factor of cancer) but otherwise healthy.

Each volunteer completed a short but intense cycling test that lasted about 10 minutes. Researchers then collected blood samples and examined 249 proteins. Thirteen of those proteins increased after exercise, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which plays a role in repairing damaged DNA.

Why Even One Workout Matters

Dr. Orange, a Clinical Exercise Physiologist at The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""These results suggest that exercise doesn't just benefit healthy tissues, it may also create a more hostile environment for cancer cells to grow.

""Even a single workout can make a difference. One bout of exercise, lasting just 10 minutes, sends powerful signals to the body.

""It's a reminder that every step, every session, counts when it comes to doing your best to protect your health.""

Bowel Cancer Rates and Physical Activity

Bowel cancer is the 4th most common cancer in the UK, after breast, prostate and lung cancer.

In the UK, one person is diagnosed with bowel cancer every 12 minutes, adding up to nearly 44,000 cases each year. Someone dies from the disease every 30 minutes.

Researchers estimate that regular physical activity lowers bowel cancer risk by about 20%. Exercise does not have to mean gym workouts or sports. Walking or biking to work, along with everyday activities such as gardening or cleaning, can also contribute.

Looking ahead, the research team plans to examine whether repeated exercise sessions lead to long-lasting biological changes. They also aim to study how exercise-related effects interact with common cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find exercise rivals therapy for depression","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260107225516.htm","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 08:30:55 GMT","

Regular physical activity may ease symptoms of depression about as effectively as psychological therapy, according to an updated Cochrane review. When researchers compared exercise with antidepressant medication, they found similar benefits, although the certainty of that evidence was lower.

Depression remains a major global health challenge, affecting more than 280 million people worldwide and contributing significantly to disability. Exercise stands out as a low cost and widely accessible option that also improves physical health, making it appealing to both patients and healthcare professionals.

Inside the Cochrane Review

The analysis was led by researchers at the University of Lancashire and drew on data from 73 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 5,000 adults diagnosed with depression. These studies examined how exercise compared with no treatment or control conditions, as well as with psychological therapies and antidepressant drugs.

Overall, the findings showed that exercise led to moderate reductions in depressive symptoms compared with no treatment. When measured against psychological therapy, exercise produced similar improvements, based on moderate certainty evidence from ten trials. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested comparable effects, but the supporting evidence was limited and considered low certainty. Few studies tracked participants after treatment ended, leaving the long-term impact unclear.

Safety and Side Effects

Reported side effects were uncommon. People in exercise programs occasionally experienced muscle or joint injuries, while those taking antidepressants reported typical medication-related issues such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems.

""Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression,"" said Professor Andrew Clegg, lead author of the review. ""This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important.""

What Kind of Exercise Works Best

The review found that light to moderate intensity activity may be more helpful than vigorous workouts. Greater improvements in depressive symptoms were linked to completing between 13 and 36 exercise sessions.

No single form of exercise clearly outperformed others. However, programs that combined different types of activity and resistance training appeared more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Some activities, including yoga, qigong and stretching, were not evaluated in this analysis and remain areas for future study. As with other findings, long-term benefits are still uncertain due to limited follow-up.

Why Conclusions Remain Cautious

This update added 35 new trials to earlier versions of the review published in 2008 and 2013. Even with the expanded evidence base, the main conclusions changed little. Many of the included studies were small, often involving fewer than 100 participants, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions.

""Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar,"" said Professor Clegg. ""Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each.""

Anecdotal evidence suggests that households burn plastics to manage waste and help satisfy their energy demand. To examine the prevalence, extent, and reasons for using plastic waste as household fuel, we report on a survey with 1018 key informants from cities in 26 countries in the Global South. Informants were purposively selected due to their familiarity with the living conditions in their communities. One-third of respondents reported being aware of plastic waste burning, with some reporting that their households engaged in this practice. Analyses of the data reveal significant correlations of plastic waste burning with both supply factors, such as, the massive amount of waste generated (p = 0.000), expensive clean fuels (p = 0.004), and demand factors, including self-management of waste (p = 0.000). Expanding essential public waste management services and implementing programs that enhance the affordability of clean energy technologies, especially among marginalized and low-income communities, could reduce this health- and environment-damaging practice.

The management of plastic waste, with over half a billion tons of plastic produced annually and rising, is a major global environmental challenge1,2,3. Meanwhile, in cities across much of the Global South, waste management systems are grossly inadequate, with the quantity of unmanaged plastic waste therefore increasing4,5. The term Global South, as used in this study, refers to the low- and middle-income countries in the regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania6. These trends are thought to contribute to the increased burning of plastic waste. While some governments are now introducing policies and regulations to limit plastic use and disposal, including targeting its combustion, the gap between policy formulation and effective enforcement, especially in marginalized areas, is substantial7. Most mitigation efforts have thus far proven ineffective or inadequate. Plastic continues to accumulate in many settings8, and households need to find new ways to manage the waste surrounding them.

At the same time, clean fuels and technologies whose emissions meet the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide(CO) levels recommended in the World Health Organization's (WHO) global air quality guidelines9, such as electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, natural gas, and ethanol, remain largely unaffordable for people living in extreme poverty. This compels them to depend on traditional solid biomass fuels such as firewood, charcoal, crop residues, and animal dung10. However, many urban residents with lower socioeconomic status in the Global South are finding biomass fuels to be increasingly scarce, due to population growth and limited access to these traditional fuels11.

Thus, there are growing concerns that energy-poor, solid fuel-dependent households who must self-manage their own and their communities' plastic waste may turn to burning plastic waste as a no or low-cost alternative for cooking and heating12. For instance, Nigeria's Multi-Tier Framework for Energy Access survey data reveals that roughly 13% of 3511 surveyed households reported garbage as one of their household fuels over the prior 12-month period13, and similar practices have been reported in other locations14. While it is generally believed that plastic is used primarily to ignite cooking fires15,16,17, households living through humanitarian crises and in urban settings more generally, have reported burning plastic waste as a primary cooking fuel18,19.

Despite the considerable potential health, environmental, and socioeconomic risks associated with plastic waste burning4,19,20, the extent and prevalence of its use as a household fuel remain poorly understood12. The scarcity of data and evidence limits a comprehensive understanding of the issue, complicating the design of effective strategies to mitigate its impacts21. To address this gap, we conducted a primary survey among purposively selected key informants across 26 countries in the Global South. All participants were familiar with urban living conditions, particularly those of low-income communities, where the practice of burning plastic waste is suspected to be most common. Although this approach does not yield a population-representative sample in the settings considered, the survey does reveal that the burning of plastic waste is widespread. It offers a starting point for future research on the underlying drivers and impacts of this behavior21. As such, it represents a crucial step towards developing targeted programs to counteract the harmful effects of global plastic waste burning.

The Global South is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate, creating an urgent demand for rapid expansion of infrastructure, services, and economic opportunities. However, many low-income countries face acute resource constraints that hinder their ability to keep pace with this growth22,23. By 2050, an estimated two-thirds of the global population is expected to reside in urban areas, with much of this growth occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)24. Historically, this rapid urbanization has led to the proliferation of informal settlements within these nations. Access to reliable energy, effective waste management systems, and modern water and sanitation services remains very low in some cities in the Global South25,26. These infrastructure deficiencies pose serious health and environmental risks and exacerbate social inequalities and unrest27. In response to these systemic gaps, informal solutions, such as plastic waste burning, have emerged as a means to address the lack of proper waste management and energy access needs28.

Continued use of traditional stoves enables the burning of waste plastic as fuel. Low-income households migrating to informal settlements to escape high rental costs often face barriers in accessing affordable, clean fuels. Moreover, the rapid growth of densely populated settlements intensifies pressure on local forests and other natural resources, driving up the costs of traditional fuels such as wood and charcoal29. One notable consequence is the increased scarcity of biomass fuels, which has become a contributing factor to accelerating the energy transition in many urban environments. This transition is occurring at a highly unequal rate30. However, it is leaving lower socioeconomic status and marginalized communities behind31, and exacerbating energy insecurity for those least able to afford clean commercial fuels10 and forcing them to look for no- or low-cost fuels, which can include unmanaged solid waste.

As a readily available waste product that combusts easily, plastic is a potentially attractive fuel source for low-income households struggling to meet their energy needs. Plastic waste is difficult to manage as it does not decay like organic waste, nor does it have the resale value that metals have; this makes burning or incineration a widely accepted method of management1,28. Unfortunately, burning waste, particularly plastic waste, releases many harmful toxins that negatively affect household environments and spill over to contribute to poor urban air quality20,32. The harms from plastic burning extend beyond direct human exposure to toxic emissions via inhalation. Secondary impacts, including ingestion of contaminated food, documented in environmental analyses, underscore additional risks associated with plastic combustion33. For example, chicken egg samples from an electronic waste site in Ghana, where plastic and cables were burnt in an open fire, have been found to contain toxins34,35. Additionally, the technologies and tools used to burn plastic waste, along with how individuals interact with these tools, likely play a critical role in influencing the environmental and health impacts of this practice, both within households and across broader communities.

While systematic evidence on the prevalence and extent of plastic waste burning as a household fuel remains limited, anecdotal and localized studies indicate that the practice could be widespread15,16,36. Systematic and comprehensive data gathering on this topic, including results from this survey, is needed to advance understanding of the complex dynamics of plastic waste burning and to inform policies and targeted programs aimed at mitigating its risks21.

Responses were obtained from 1018 key informants familiar with the context of their cities were analysed in this study; see Table 1 for sample summary statistics (and “Methods” for additional details). Respondents were asked about the general prevalence of plastic waste burning in their city. Among 931 responses for this question, 22% indicated that plastic burning was slightly prevalent, 35% reported it was moderately prevalent, 26% responded it was very prevalent, and 8% described it as extremely prevalent (Fig. 1a).

a Reported prevalence of burning plastic waste; b Agreement that plastic waste is used as a cooking fuel; c Agreement that plastic waste is commonly burned in traditional stoves; and d Awareness of burning plastic waste as a fuel. The numbers above the bars indicate the percentages for each response. Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding.

Respondents were also asked about the use of plastic waste as a household fuel through three questions. Among the 989 respondents who answered a first question on burning of plastic cooking fuel as a replacement for other fuels, 19% somewhat agreed and 8% strongly agreed, indicating notable agreement to this practice (Fig. 1b). Meanwhile, 22% neither agreed nor disagreed, while the remaining respondents either disagreed (21%) or strongly disagreed (30%) with the statement.

In a second question, 32% of participants somewhat agreed, and 24% strongly agreed that burning plastic waste in traditional stoves is common practice (N = 985). By contrast, 16% disagreed, and 13% strongly disagreed (Fig. 1c). These responses suggest a higher prevalence of plastic waste burning compared to the first survey question, which may indicate that plastic burning is used primarily to manage household plastic waste, rather than as a primary or preferred energy source for cooking.

The third question asked respondents whether they were aware that plastic waste was used as a household fuel in their cities, with three response options: yes, unsure and no. Affirmative answers to this question appear to lie between those on the two other questions: out of 998 respondents who answered the question, 37% reported being aware of this practice, 37% were unsure, and 27% were unaware (Fig. 1d).

The 365 respondents who indicated awareness of plastic waste burning for energy purposes in their city, from the final question ‘Are you aware of burning waste plastic as fuel', were also asked follow-up questions regarding the specific purpose of this practice. Out of the total respondents, 16% reported burning plastic for at least one purpose, 10% reported using it for two purposes, and 5% for three different purposes.

Nearly half (48%) reported witnessing others burn plastic waste as a cooking fuel, while 14% responded that they had done so themselves. Another 13% indicated they had heard about the practice but had not seen it firsthand (Fig. 2a). Regarding the burning of plastic waste for heating purposes, 37% had seen others doing it, 12% had done it themselves, and 18% had only heard about it being done (Fig. 2b). A smaller proportion of respondents were aware of plastic being burned to prepare cattle feed: 12% had witnessed it, 11% had heard about it, and 4% had engaged in the practice (Fig. 2c). The lower awareness of the latter likely reflects the relatively limited cattle ownership in the urban areas that were the focus of our survey.

Percentage of respondents aware of plastic waste being burnt and used as (a) cooking fuel, (b) heating, (c) heating cattle feed, (d) by mixing with other fuels like firewood, (e) deter pests, (f) fire starter. This is a follow-up question asked only to respondents who indicated they were aware of burning plastic (Fig. 1d) waste as fuel (N = 365). The numbers above the bars indicate the percentages for each response. Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding.

Fuel stacking, the use of multiple fuel types to meet household energy needs, is a well-documented practice in low-income settings37. However, this behavior can contribute to increased toxic emissions, especially when polluting fuels such as plastic are mixed with other materials38. To explore this further, the survey examined the extent to which plastic is combined with other fuels in household fires. Among those aware of plastic burning, 22% reported burning plastic with different fuels, 46% had witnessed this practice, and 14% had heard about it (Fig. 2d). Integrating plastic waste into household fuel use for multiple purposes appears to be relatively common among respondents familiar with plastic combustion.

The survey also investigated whether burning plastic waste is employed to deter pests and insects, as smoke emissions from polluting energy sources are sometimes considered effective in doing so39. While only 6% of respondents reported burning plastic waste for this purpose, 17% had witnessed it, and 19% had heard about it (Fig. 2e). The survey also investigated whether plastic waste is used for lighting fires. The survey found that 38% of respondents had used plastic as a fire starter, 40% had witnessed this use, and 13% had only heard about it (Fig. 2f).

The extent to which plastic waste is used as a household fuel varies by country, with patterns that correlate with regional and national income levels. Figure 3 show the proportion of respondents who agreed that plastic waste is used as a fuel substitute, acknowledged plastic burning to be a common practice, and reported awareness of plastic waste combustion for energy purposes according to country income (Fig. 3a, c) and by region (Fig. 3b, d). The measures were converted from a Likert scale – previously discussed in Fig. 1—to a binary variable indicating some or strong agreement. Plastic waste combustion is more prevalent in low-income countries, except for heating purposes (Fig. 3b), which likely reflects differences in climate. Regional differences are also notable, with respondents in Sub-Saharan Africa reporting a higher prevalence of these practices compared to those in other regions, for all purposes (Fig. 3d). Additionally, the disaggregated data suggest that fuel substitution with plastic (the first measure) may be somewhat over-reported in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and Southeast Asia (SEA). This is indicated by higher rates of agreement (represented by the orange bars) compared to direct awareness of plastic waste combustion for energy needs (green bars).

a Proportion of respondents who somewhat or strongly agree that plastic is burnt as a fuel (blue bar); somewhat or strongly agree that it is common practice to burn plastic waste in traditional stoves (orange bar); and report being aware of burning of plastic as a household fuel (green bar) across LIC = low-income country; LMC = lower-middle-income country; and UMC = upper-middle-income country categories. b Same variables as panel a, by region LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; SEA = South Asia SA = South Asia; SAF = Southern Africa; WAF = Western Africa; EAF = Eastern Africa; MAF = Middle Africa. The MAF and LAC numbers are based on responses from a single country in each region, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, respectively. c Proportion of respondents reporting having seen or burnt plastic themselves for various purposes, among those aware of plastic waste burning (the green bars in Panels (a, b)), by country income category and (d) region.

Respondents who reported awareness of burning plastic waste as a household fuel (N = 366) were asked additional questions about the specific types of plastic materials being burned, the product(s) they originated from, and the stoves used for their combustion. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE) is the most frequently reported type of burned plastic waste, followed by low-density Polyethylene (LDPE). PET and LDPE are common single-use plastics found in beverage bottles (e.g., water and juice bottles) and bags (Fig. 4a). They are the most common plastic materials found in household waste and accumulating in the oceans bordering Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia40,41,42. The third most frequently reported plastic being burned is high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a material frequently used for chemical containers. The fifth most frequently used plastic material is polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is mostly used in plastic plumbing pipes, and is a major cause of dioxin emissions43.

a Mean of the rank value of plastic materials. The y-axis indicates the mean rank value, where 7 is the most frequently burned and 1 is the least frequently burned plastic material (the rank value flipped from the original scale), as reported by those aware of plastic burning for fuel (N = 306). b Relative frequency of plastic products burned for fuel among those aware of plastic burning (N = 318). c Percentage of responses by stove type most commonly used by households to burn plastic (N = 323). A 3-Stone (Three-Stone) stove is a primitive traditional stove where three stones are arranged to support a pot; a mud stove is an enclosed stove built from mud; an improved cooking stove (ICS) is a more efficient, safer and less polluting stove; and a charcoal stove is designed to use charcoal as fuel.

In terms of product origin, nearly two-thirds of respondents reported burning food wrappers, followed by chemical packaging materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and cleaning liquid containers (Fig. 4b). Food wrappers, made from polypropylene (PP), account for the largest share of waste generation by polymer type14,44,45, and are reported as the most frequently burned plastic product. Other commonly burned plastic items included non-food household plastics like buckets and plastic bags (35%), construction materials such as pipes (32%), and components from tyres and white goods, i.e., household electrical appliances (26%). Traditional cooking stoves such as those using 3-stone and charcoal are among the most widely used stoves for burning plastic waste (Fig. 4c).

Energy consumption is influenced by household socio-demographic characteristics. To better understand the socio-demographic factors associated with burning plastic waste as a fuel, respondents were presented with a set of factors and asked to rate the likelihood that individuals with these characteristics could burn plastic waste as fuel, on a scale from −10 (not likely) to +10 (most likely).

Households that include people with disabilities—with the term ‘disabilities' left undefined in the survey question—were seen as less likely to burn plastic waste, possibly due to their limitations in collecting plastic waste (Fig. 5a). By contrast, respondents indicated that households in areas excluded from waste management services could be most likely to burn plastic waste, followed by those experiencing poverty and those living in informal settlements. Additionally, households with members working at waste sites, such as waste pickers, were perceived to be more likely to burn plastic waste as fuel. The regionally disaggregated results highlight variations in the perceptions of these socio-demographic correlates with the burning of plastic waste as fuel.

Overall (bar graph) and disaggregated by region (heatmap). a Percentage of respondents who believe burning plastic waste is positively associated with various socio-demographic groups. Responses were measured using a scale ranging from −10 to +10 (where −10 indicates a strong and negative association, i.e., low likelihood of burning plastic waste as household fuel; and +10 indicates a strong and positive association, i.e., high likelihood of burning plastic waste), converted binary variable that takes value of 1 for respondents with positive response (1 to 10) otherwise zero. b Percentage of respondents who somewhat agree or strongly agree about the reasons for burning plastic waste overall (bar graph) and disaggregated by region (heatmap). Responses measured using a scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree rescaled as a binary that takes the value of 1 for respondents who select somewhat agree or strongly agree, otherwise 0. LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; SEA = South Asia SA = South Asia; SAF = Southern Africa; WAF = Western Africa; EAF = Eastern Africa; MAF = Middle Africa. The MAF and LAC numbers are based on responses from a single country in each region, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, respectively.

In compact neighborhoods lacking waste management services, some residents may be concerned about the open burning of plastic waste. In such instances, households may choose to burn plastic waste in their traditional indoor stoves to avoid drawing concern. Respondents were asked to indicate why households might burn plastic waste as a household fuel, based on their levels of agreement with the question “Below are some reasons why households might burn plastic waste for household fuel. Please rate the extent to which you agree with these statements”. Respondents indicated strong agreement that a lack of awareness of the health impacts of burning plastic was a reason for burning plastic waste, a finding that is also consistent across regions (Fig. 5b). The second highest level of agreement was for two other reasons: to “manage waste” and cope with “expensive clean fuel”. Respondents expressed lower agreement on the role of low availability of traditional fuels as a reason for burning plastic. They generally disagreed that plastic is a versatile fuel or that the burning of plastic waste as a fuel is socially acceptable. In the regionally disaggregated results, respondents from Latin America and the Caribbean tended to highlight a lack of waste management and a lack of awareness as the main reasons for burning plastic. In contrast, respondents from Asia, Southern Africa, and West Africa also tended to emphasize the role played by the low availability of traditional fuels.

Awareness of these risks was assessed, for four different types of risks, based on agreement with the statement “What do you believe are the major risks of burning plastic for households?” (the level of agreement was recorded on a Likert scale ranging from extremely unlikely (1) to extremely likely (5)). Respondents strongly agreed on the risks and impacts of toxic emissions inhalation, fire hazards, and food contamination, with results also consistent across regions (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). While a detailed understanding of the risks from burning plastic waste to the environment and human health is limited, there was a high degree of awareness that these impacts could be harmful, with both direct and indirect consequences.

More specifically, out of 936 respondents, 40% indicated that they thought burning plastic was extremely likely to contribute to fire hazards, and 40% stated this was somewhat likely. Regarding the risk of toxic emissions and air pollution from burning plastic, 62% indicated that this was extremely likely, and 26% indicated that it was somewhat likely. Roughly 6 in 10 respondents thought it was extremely likely that toxic chemicals from burning plastic waste could contaminate food and water, while 29% indicated it was somewhat likely.

Given the higher exposure rates for household members who spend more time indoors, respondents were also asked to indicate the likelihood of greater risks of exposure for females, children, people living with disabilities, and senior citizens. Forty-six percent of respondents reported that increased risk of exposure was extremely likely, and 34% reported that it was somewhat likely (See Supplementary Fig. 1).

Energy use, including the burning of plastic waste, is contextual, and addressing energy poverty requires localized solutions that are appropriate to their specific context46,47. Respondents were asked to rank what they believed was the most important solution to the issue of burning plastic waste as household fuel in their city. As shown in Fig. 6, the average rankings (where lower values indicate higher effectiveness) suggest that improved and expanded solid waste management services for informal settlements (waste management) are seen as the most effective solution to the problem, followed by increased access to clean energy technologies and raising awareness about the negative effects of burning plastics for fuel. Bans on the use of plastic were also ranked as having high importance, whereas the supply of traditional fuels and the conversion of plastic to a safe fuel were among the lower-ranked solutions. There are regional variations in perceptions of these solutions. Respondents from South Asia and Southern Africa ranked a ban on plastic use as the most effective solution, possibly due to plastic ban policies. Respondents in Latin America and the Caribbean considered waste management and clean cooking to be more important than awareness. In East and Central Africa, access to clean energy was ranked as the most important solution among low-income households. While these results are subjective and may be subject to differing interpretations of this question, the result underscores the need for contextual strategies.

Mean value for the ranked relative importance of possible solutions. a Energy access-related solutions for the whole sample, and by region. b Waste management and awareness-related solutions for the whole sample, and by region. Responses were ranked in order of importance (1 = the most effective solution and 7 = the least effective solution) (N = 832). LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; SEA = South Asia SA = South Asia; SAF = Southern Africa; WAF = Western Africa; EAF = Eastern Africa; MAF = Middle Africa. The MAF and LAC numbers are based on responses from a single country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, respectively.

Individuals active in socially engaged professions, e.g., community-based organization personnel, community workers, or teachers, were significantly more likely to agree that plastic waste burning occurs in their communities (p = 0.003). However, they did not report direct awareness of others or themselves engaging in it (Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 4). Respondents who perceived municipal solid waste management fees as unaffordable (p < 0.007, Column 1; p < 0.019, Column 2) were also more likely to report that plastic burning occurs and that they engage in it. A perception of clean fuels as expensive was also positively correlated with these outcomes (p < 0.000, Column 1; p < 0.000, Column 2; p < 0.004, Column 3). Meanwhile, city-level factors such as quantities of plastic waste (p < 0.023, Column 2; p < 0.008, Column 3), and population without waste collection services (p < 0.000, Column 2; p < 0.000, Column 3) were positively correlated with direct awareness of others' or individuals' own plastic waste burning for energy purposes. The insignificant correlations between the volume of mismanaged plastic waste in the city and the population without waste collection, on one hand, and respondents' general agreement that plastic is burned for energy purposes, on the other, may be related to overreporting of general awareness compared to direct awareness.

Agree (green) shows the odds ratios from the logistic regression for respondents' agreement on the use of plastic as fuel. The dependent variable is binary, converted to indicate if respondents somewhat or strongly agreed with the statements “It is common practice to burn plastic waste (like polythene bags) in the fire of traditional stoves,” as 1, and otherwise 0. Aware (purple) presents the odds ratios for the dependent variable for awareness of plastic waste burning based on the third question in Fig. 1, which takes the value of 1 if respondents answered ‘yes' to the question: “Are you aware of households burning plastic waste as fuel to meet their household energy needs (e.g., fire starters and for cooking and heating)?”, otherwise 0. Used (lavender) shows the odds ratio of respondents' own burning plastic waste for various purposes, where the dependent variable takes a value of 1 if respondents reported burning plastic themselves (yes, I have done it) for cooking, heating, mixed energy use, preparing cattle feed, deterring pests, or starting fires. To improve the readability of coefficient estimates and odds ratios in the coefficient plot, variables measured in percentages (no waste collection and basic sanitation services) and grams (total waste and plastic waste generation) were rescaled (robust 95% confidence interval in bar). Errors are clustered at the city level. See Supplementary Table 3 for summary statistics of variables and Supplementary Table 4 for full results).

Fuel supply factors (availability and accessibility to clean fuels), urban waste management (linked to economic development), and demand drivers (e.g., higher development and income levels reducing reliance on polluting fuels) all influence plastic burning practices. Interpreted together, they highlight the link between inadequate waste management systems, expensive clean cooking fuel, and reliance on plastic waste as a household fuel. A perception that waste management services and clean fuels are expensive highlights and reiterates the vital importance of affordability. Reliance on traditional fuels and stoves also contributes to household vulnerability, which in turn facilitates the domestic burning of plastic as a fuel. While open burning of plastic waste is a well-known and common waste management strategy in many cities in the Global South, the widespread prevalence and correlates of domestic burning of these materials have not previously been documented. These results reinforce the importance of cross-cutting programs to improve waste management systems (SDG11.6) and expand access to affordable, clean cooking solutions to low-income households (SDG7).

The energy sources used by households are determined by the context in which they live, as well as the availability and affordability of alternative options. Given the combustible nature of plastic, the increasing volumes of this material in waste, and the reality that many households in the Global South must self-manage their waste, the use of plastic as a domestic fuel may be on the rise. However, a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the scale and distribution of plastic waste burning has heretofore been missing, impeding efforts to plan and develop effective strategies to mitigate the problem.

The results of this study lend stronger credence to this conjecture; a survey of key informants from 26 countries in the Global South reveals that plastic waste has been integrated into household energy practices in numerous and diverse ways in many urban communities. Four key insights emerge from this study. First, the use of plastic as a household fuel is prevalent in cities of the Global South. Though the study statistics should not be interpreted to be representative at the population level in the survey locations, owing to the purposive sampling strategy that was utilized to select knowledgeable community informants as respondents, 16% of respondents reported burning plastic as a fuel in their own households, and awareness of such practices was much higher. Importantly, key community informants are likely to have a higher local socioeconomic status, and their reported rate of burning plastic as fuel be lower than less advantaged groups. Nonetheless, the reported prevalence of this practice is comparable to that found in the World Bank's Multitier Framework Survey conducted in Northwest Nigeria, where 13% of surveyed households reported burning waste, including plastic, as a household fuel, or in smaller-scale surveys in Eswatini and Guatemala15,19.

Second, the reported burning of plastic waste was found to be prevalent in many countries and cities in this study, suggesting that this practice does not result solely from energy poverty, but also represents a vital informal solution in many settings to cope with systemic municipal service gaps and a high rate of mismanaged plastic. Low-income households living in precarious urban conditions are often forced to self-manage waste21, and frequently rely on low-cost and easily accessible methods for disposal of accumulating and non-biodegradable waste. The risk that more households will resort to burning plastic waste as fuel could increase unless these service gaps are addressed. Third, combustion of waste, including plastic, can help households living in extreme poverty to satisfy their energy needs in the face of growing scarcity of other traditional low-cost fuel sources. The survey results help illustrate how burning plastic waste emerges as such a zero- or low-cost option and the challenges in deciding between cooking a meal for the family and exposure to potentially hazardous emissions. Poverty, deep inequality and unmanaged urbanization within cities, reduced availability of traditional fuels, and increasing plastic pollution could intensify such practices.

Fourth, our analysis serves to underscore the synergistic relationship between United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): making cities more sustainable (SDG11) and access to clean energy (SDG7). Efforts to achieve SDG11, through the provision of adequate housing and improved and inclusive waste management in other cities, will weaken the supply driver of highly available plastic waste and the need for self-management of that waste. SDG11.6 specifically targets increased waste collection services, management of waste in controlled facilities, and reduction of fine particulate matter concentrations in cities. Reducing the burning of waste plastic as fuel is thus a potential channel and area of action to lower emissions through improved waste management. Meanwhile, on the demand side, willingness to burn plastic waste as a fuel or use a traditional stove to manage it is limited if viable and affordable alternatives are present. At the core of this practice is the necessity to satisfy energy demands and to eliminate plastic pollution, at low or zero financial cost. Therefore, progress towards achieving SDG7, which has been greater in urban than in rural settings48,49,50 but has largely overlooked the persistent deprivation of low-income neighborhoods in cities in low- and middle-income countries, will weaken the demand element of this practice.

The design of practical solutions to tackle this complex problem requires a deep and contextual understanding of the interlinked problems of household energy poverty and inadequate waste management services, coupled with a willingness to test programs or policies that address those problems. For example, improved solid waste management, specifically waste collection, could decrease the need for burning of plastic as a waste management strategy, but effectively delivering such services in crowded, low-income areas, where collecting waste management fees is difficult and trust in formal government institutions is low, remains a challenge. Similarly, addressing energy insecurity requires new, low-cost clean energy innovations or well-targeted financial support that renders existing solutions more affordable. Moreover, tackling each of these problems in isolation—or incompletely—risks failure. Restrictions on open burning alone, for instance, could push households to burn even more plastic waste inside their homes.

This study took an initial step toward filling critical knowledge gaps in this domain; however, three main limitations should be addressed in future work to enhance understanding and inform decision-making. First, as noted above, the study used a purposive sampling strategy to select knowledgeable community informants as respondents and thus does not provide a population-representative understanding of the scale and distribution of plastic waste burning to meet households' waste management and energy needs. Such respondents may have a biased view of practices in their communities. To build on and validate this work, further investigation is recommended using representative household samples from across the Global South, including plastic waste hotspots and notspots, underserved communities, and informal settlements. This investigation should incorporate plastic as a fuel category and consider local waste management and settlement contexts. Such work could also investigate these practices in rural areas, which our study did not consider. Second, and relatedly, this study employed a relatively short, internet-based survey due to resource and logistical constraints, which limits the extent to which we could more fully investigate the nature and drivers of this practice. Third, the study does not identify the impacts of these practices on household health and well-being, as well as environmental quality, nor is it suitable for identifying practical strategies to mitigate harmful effects. Work on the former requires attention to research designs that allow valid inferences on the specific impacts of plastic waste burning, which typically co-exists with many other harms, on individuals' and overall social welfare20,51. The latter, meanwhile, requires careful impact evaluations of pilot and scaled-up efforts—combining improved energy access and waste management elements—to reduce the prevalence of this practice. Such studies must devote attention to measuring emissions, food contamination risks, and health and welfare endpoints, to provide deeper insights into the behavioral, economic, and systemic drivers compelling households to use plastic waste for fuel.

Indeed, key factors identified in this study—such as inadequate waste management, energy poverty, limited accessibility and affordability of clean and alternative fuels, cultural norms, and systemic deficiencies in waste management, inclusive urban governance, sustainable human settlement and energy infrastructure—warrant closer examination. A thorough understanding of the prevalence and behavioral aspects of this issue can inform the development of targeted, context-specific programs. These may include educational campaigns highlighting the health and environmental hazards of burning plastic, improving access to clean and affordable energy alternatives, strengthening waste management systems, introducing cost-effective technologies for cleaner plastic combustion, and other viable strategies. As rapid urbanization continues to outpace the expansion of essential services in many regions, the urgency of implementing these measures will only intensify.

The analysis presented in this paper draws on survey data collected from key informants purposively recruited by the research team, which included researchers based in each of the 26 study countries. These informants provided diverse perspectives on plastic waste burning practices in urban areas across 11 countries in Asia, 1 in Latin America, and 14 in Africa. In each country, efforts were made to survey expert individuals from seven groups that included: a) researchers affiliated with universities or research institutes; b) local government officials or civil service personnel; c) socially engaged professionals, such as doctors and lawyers; d) community leaders (e.g., ward leaders or traditional leaders); e) personnel from NGOs or community-based organization (e.g., cooperatives); f) private sector representatives, such as waste collection managers; and g) other knowledgeable individuals who, while not belonging to the above groups, possess valuable insights into urban realities. The sample is not nationally representative; however, the perspectives of these knowledgeable and community-engaged informants capture a broad range of practices across surveyed countries. (Refer to Supplementary Table 1 for a full list of study countries).

The survey was conducted between July and November 2024. Country collaborators distributed the survey via email or by sharing flyers containing links and QR codes to an online Qualtrics form. These flyers were circulated through personal connections and during seminars, conferences, and community meetings to target respondents with relevant knowledge of local urban realities and the survey topics. A survey guideline provided potential respondents with an overview of the study and instructions for completing the questionnaire. Respondents also had the option to request in-person support from a local collaborator for completing survey questions if needed, e.g., for language interpretation or if they were unable to read the questions in the instrument. In such cases, a collaborator or trained enumerator conducted the survey in person or via phone and recorded the responses using the online survey platform.

The survey was implemented in two languages: French and English. The French version was used in Togo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while the English version was used in all other participating countries. The study was approved by the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (approval number HRE2024-0177). Where required, a reciprocal ethics application was used by a country collaborator.

The questionnaire was structured into multiple sections covering waste and plastic pollution management, cooking fuel use, and the practice of burning plastic (Supplementary Data 1). It included questions on respondents' awareness of direct observations of plastic burning in their communities for household energy needs. Additionally, respondents were asked to rank potential solutions to address plastic burning. The final section gathered information on respondent characteristics and socio-demographic details. The full survey instrument is provided in the Supplementary Information.

Respondents were asked to respond to “In your opinion, how prevalent do you think burning waste plastic is in your city?” on a Likert scale (Not prevalent at all (1) to extremely prevalent (5)) (Q8.1) to understand the general prevalence of burning plastic waste in their local community.

There were three questions in different sections of the survey about the burning of waste plastic by households for fuel, which were designed to triangulate on perceptions of this practice within each study location.

The first question asked respondents to indicate their level of agreement, on a Likert scale (1 to 5), with the statement “Plastic is used for cooking fuel as a replacement for other fuels.” (Q3.1.6). This question sought to assess whether respondents believed that some households in their city burn plastic, at least partially, to meet cooking fuel needs beyond simple ignition.

Second, participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement, using a Likert scale (Strongly disagree (1) to Strongly agree (5)), with the statement: “It is common practice to burn plastic waste (like polythene bags) in the fire of traditional stoves” (Q3.3.2). This question aimed to evaluate the prevalence of burning plastic waste in household stoves, in a way that might also capture burning for purposes of igniting the fire or simply to eliminate plastic waste.

The third question, “Are you aware of households burning waste plastic as fuel to meet their household energy needs (e.g. fire starters and for cooking and heating)?” (Q5.1), with responses of no, unsure/maybe and yes, was aimed to understand respondent awareness about the practice of burning waste plastic as fuel in their locality.

A follow-up question was asked to the respondents who selected yes to the third question to capture more directly their source of awareness on various purposes of burning waste plastic as fuel. The follow-up question asked “Please indicate whether you are aware of the following scenarios occurring” (Q5.2) where respondents selected among several options—‘No'; ‘Unsure'; ‘Yes; I have done it; ‘Yes, I have seen it'; and ‘Yes, I have heard about it'—for a) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fuel for cooking / preparing food (Cooking); b) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fuel for heating (Heating); c) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fuel for cattle feed preparation (Cattle feed); d) Plastic waste is burnt alongside other fuels like firewood (Mix fuel); e) Plastic waste being burnt and used to produce smoke that will deter pests e.g. mosquitos (Deter pest); and f) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fire starter (Fire starter).

Respondents were also asked about the type of waste plastic burned (Q5.5 and Q5.6), the type of stove used for burning (Q5.7), the reason for burning waste plastic as fuel (Q6.1), perceptions of likelihood of burning by different socio-demographic characteristics (Q7.1), and associated risks (Q7.2) and solutions (Q8.2).

A total of 1188 respondents started the survey, but 170 (14% of the sample) responses were not usable (Supplementary Fig. 2). Among these unusable responses, 26 were from individuals who did not consent to participate, 26 came from non-sample countries (likely provided through email referrals), and the remaining responses were from individuals who initially agreed to participate but abandoned the survey after answering only a few questions. This drop-off may have been caused by challenges encountered while completing the survey on some types of mobile devices. After data cleaning, 1018 responses were finally retained for analysis (86% of total responses), though some of these responses contained missing data for specific questions. The lowest number of responses came from South Africa (15 responses), while the largest number was from Indonesia (132 responses). The median number of responses in each country is 34, with a mean of 39 responses.

Of the 904 respondents with fully complete survey data, 35.5% were researchers at universities or research institutes, 20.8% were affiliated with local government or civil service, 6.8% were socially engaged professionals (e.g., teacher, health care provider), 1.9% were community leaders, 9.4% worked for NGOs or CBOs, and 11.6% were employed by private operators and companies (Table 1, Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Data 2). The remaining 14% were from other categories such as consultants, politicians, contractors and animal scientists.

The coverage of respondents' work organizations included: 18% in multinational organizations, 45% in national organizations, 20% at municipal or city-level structures, and 17% working at the sub-municipal or community level. Slightly less than half (43%) of the survey respondents were female, and the mean respondent age was 33 years (s.d. = 10.4 years). Most respondents (85%) held a bachelor's degree, while 13% had attained a Doctoral or equivalent degree, and 33% held a Master's or equivalent degree. In terms of primary domains of expertise, 16% of respondents reported specializations in the natural sciences, 25% in engineering, 10% in agricultural sciences, and 8% in medical/health sciences. Finally, regarding experience, 43% of respondents reported having more than five years' experience in their field.

We employed logistic regression for all models reported in Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 4. The first model reported as green points with horizontal confidence interval bars in Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 4 (Column 1) examines the correlation between respondents' perceptions of burning plastic waste in general and for energy purposes and various demographic, institutional, and city- and country-level variables. Odds ratios were estimated for agreement and awareness regarding the use of plastic waste as household fuel. The first variable focuses on respondents' subjective agreement, where the dependent variable reflects respondents' agreement that plastic waste is burned in household fires, based on Fig. 1b. Specifically, the dependent variable is assigned a value of 1 if the respondent somewhat or strongly agreed with the statement “It is common practice to burn plastic waste (like polythene bags) in the fire of traditional stoves.”

The purple points with horizontal confidence interval bars in Fig. 7 examine the correlation between respondents' awareness regarding the burning of plastic waste as fuel and various demographic, institutional, and city- and country-level variables. Specifically, the dependent variable is assigned a value of 1 if the respondent selected yes to the question “Are you aware of households burning waste plastic as fuel to meet their household energy needs (e.g., fire starters and for cooking and heating)?”.

The dependent variable in lavender points with horizontal confidence interval bars in Fig. 7 takes the value 1 if the respondent selected ‘Yes, I have done it' for any of the six different purposes of burning plastic waste as fuel and otherwise is 0. In our dataset, 16% of respondents reported their own burning of plastic waste as fuel.

All models use the same set of independent variables. The independent variables include respondent demographics and respondent subjective perceptions of the cost of clean fuel and solid waste management. City-level independent variables include the waste generated per capita, plastic waste generation and percentage of population without waste collection services28. Country-level data includes basic access to sanitation services (% of urban population)52. These variables represent both supply- and demand-side factors that may influence the prevalence of plastic waste burning while controlling for respondent characteristics. For variables with missing data, we imputed a country median where applicable and controlled for missing data in the regression model. Standard errors in all regression models are clustered at the city level.

We note that the survey is not representative of the population in the study locations, and that all responses should be interpreted as being based on respondents' subjective views of the practice and implications of burning plastic waste as a fuel in their cities. Though these respondents are knowledgeable about the contexts they live in, they may nonetheless have a biased view of practices in their communities. The core objective of the study—understanding the prevalence of burning plastic waste as fuel at the Global South scale—should be kept in mind when interpreting the results presented in this research.

This collaborative study consists of local researchers from survey countries, multidisciplinary experts and early career researchers. All members of the research team – representing the various included study countries (see authorship list)—met during a series of collaborative planning meetings to discuss the survey objective and agree on the framework for the survey design and flow to ensure that the questions asked and answered were locally relevant. A core subset of those researchers contributed directly to drafting the survey questions, designing the survey guidelines, translating study materials, analysing the data, and writing the draft manuscript. All co-authors were given the opportunity to comment on the questionnaire, the survey guidelines, and the draft manuscript.

More specifically, the draft survey was circulated for comments and improvement and revised before formatting in Qualtrics. In response to collaborator feedback, the survey was translated into the French language, and a survey implementation guideline was prepared to facilitate the process. The survey question was then piloted, and we discussed the implementation plan several times to ensure it was easy and smooth for both researchers to disseminate and for respondents to answer.

Local researchers were responsible for local distribution of the survey and were given discretion in deciding whether to implement the survey or not, and where to focus the data collection in each of their countries to ensure the survey does not involve risk to health, safety, security or other risks to researchers and also the research is locally relevant. Contributors from different countries also helped distribute the survey link where relevant. In several countries, for example, Benin and Mongolia, the local researchers could not implement the survey due to a number of reasons, such as difficulty in translation of questions and time constraints.

We collected responses using an online format designed in Qualtrics. Each researcher was provided with an email template, flyer and QR code for respondents to use in accessing the survey. Risks to respondents were negligible. First, it focused on subjective perceptions of respondents regarding plastic pollution and the burning of plastic waste as household fuel, which are not particularly sensitive topics. Second, the survey did not involve animals or pose a bio-risk. Third, the survey did not ask for personal identifiers: name, phone number, email or postal address. Respondents were only asked to write their city name and select the name of their country. Thus, the survey was fully anonymised; we could not track who responded. Fourth, respondents were free to ignore the request to respond to the survey, could decline participation on the consent form, or could halt the survey at their will. Finally, the survey did not collect any biological materials, cultural artifacts or associated traditional knowledge.

We obtained overall ethics approval for the study from the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number HRE2024-0177), with all team contributors included as co-PIs. All local researchers were requested to consult their institutions and comply with local regulations before starting the survey. Where appropriate, an ethics application was filed by the in-country collaborators to ensure local compliance, but in many cases, the anonymous nature of the survey and the approval from Curtin University meant that additional approvals were not required. This was true for the researchers affiliated with partner institutions in Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, India, Lao PDR, Thailand, DR Congo, Eswatini, Rwanda, Botswana, Vietnam, Uganda, the Gambia and India. Other partner institutions do not have an ethics committee and instead defer to the judgment of ethics review teams at the PI institution (e.g., at Curtin University). In such cases, the local researcher obtained permission from their institution before implementing the survey without carrying out a full review by a formal ethics board. Local researchers, such as in Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana, applied for and received full ethics approval, whereas a researcher from Sri Lanka applied for ethics approval at their institution and received an exemption. Note that the surveys were undertaken at different times, as some of the collaborators had to go through the ethics approval process, while others did not.

After the collection of data, we analysed the results and presented them to the research team members. All contributors were included as contributors of the paper and have access to the dataset. Results are disaggregated at the regional level to ensure that they are not stigmatizing or pose a risk to the researchers or participants. The manuscript has used localized evidence and has taken local research relevance into account to build its arguments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Is the Blood Glucose Monitor We've Been Waiting For","https://www.wired.com/story/blood-glucose-monitor-preevnt-isaac/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:30:00 GMT","

The wearables industry has solved the relatively easy stuff: step counting, sleep tracking, fitness coaching. It has also solved more complex things like detecting atrial fibrillation and sleep apnea. While all of these biometrics are useful, the continuous tracking of blood sugar in a way that's noninvasive (meaning it doesn't involve needles) has eluded the makers of fitness tracking devices.

Diabetics need to monitor their blood sugar constantly to make sure it doesn't go too high and damage their organs. This is especially hard for elderly people and small children, since monitoring blood sugar usually requires a pinprick blood test or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which also reaches under the skin.

CGMs have also become hugely popular among non-diabetics as the popularity of GLP-1s has skyrocketed. Eating like a diabetic—lots of protein and fiber, minimal sugar and carbs—is a great way to lose weight. Apple, among other companies, has spent years, and millions of dollars, trying to introduce a no-prick blood glucose monitor to the Apple Watch, but the feature hasn't arrived yet.

All this is to explain why I could scarcely believe that the PreEvnt Isaac was real when I saw it here at CES 2026 in Las Vegas. The Isaac is a small device, about the size of a quarter. Instead of tracking blood glucose optically through the skin, it measures volatile organic compounds in your breath to detect biomarkers like acetone that can be correlated with rising blood glucose levels.

You might not be able to wear it in a smart ring or watch, but a small device that you can wear around your neck or keep in your bag without having to retreat to the bathroom to prick your skin is a huge step up in quality of life for many, many people.

The Isaac is named after the inventor's grandson, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 2 years old. A 2-year-old doesn't want to get pricked constantly. Bud Wilcox realized that “acetone breath”—that sweet, fruity breath that is a common diabetic symptom—could be used to check for blood sugar events.

PreEvnt and Wilcox showcased the concept at CES 2025 (it didn't seem real then, either). Later that year, the device entered active human clinical trials at Indiana University. The study is comparing Isaac's performance with monitoring blood sugar levels as compared to traditional blood sugar monitoring, starting with adolescents with type 1 diabetes and then expanding to adults with type 2 diabetes.

The trials are being conducted with an eye toward regulatory review by the US Food and Drug Administration in the upcoming year.

“This is a de novo application, so we're educating the FDA as we're working with them,” says Fredrick Brooks, PreEvnt's director of health technologies, referring to the FDA's pathway to getting a device to market while it's still being assessed. “They've been very interested and understanding.”

I got to try out the Isaac at CES. It's a small disc, with a loop at the top so that you can wear it around your neck (a key feature if your market includes small children). When you breathe onto it, the device computes your blood sugar and logs it into the companion smartphone app.

The app is still in the final stages of development, but as it currently stands, you can reach out to your emergency contacts for help if you need it. (Diabetics can often become incapacitated when they're hypoglycemic.) When PreEvnt demoed it for me, the app included a log so users can note what they're eating on a timeline.

Metabolic tracking has become such a craze that I have begun to be mildly concerned that companies are trying to give us all food anxiety. Garmin recently introduced the AI-powered Nutrition feature in its Connect+ subscription plan; Oura's smart ring platform lets you take pictures of your meals and analyze them with its Meals feature; Amazfit's prototype V1tal camera not only records your food but also how long it takes you to eat it and how much you left on your plate.

In a sea of companies monitoring your food intake and blood sugar for peak performance or weight loss, the Isaac is a nice reminder that these technologies were initially developed to help make a difference in someone's quality of life. I'm an adult and can barely stand to prick myself; there are a lot of diabetic kids whose lives are going to get much easier.

It might not be in a premium device that you already own quite yet, like an Apple Watch or a Garmin, but at least noninvasive blood sugar tracking is on the way.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Google Is Adding an ‘AI Inbox' to Gmail That Summarizes Emails","https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-inbox-gmail/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:00:00 GMT","

Google is putting even more generative AI tools into Gmail as part of its goal to further personalize user inboxes and streamline searches. On Thursday, the company announced a new “AI Inbox” tab, currently in a beta testing phase, that reads every message in a user's Gmail and suggests a list of to-dos and key topics, based on what it summarizes.

In Google's example of what this AI Inbox could look like in Gmail, the new tab takes context from a user's messages and suggests they reschedule their dentist appointment, reply to a request from their child's sports coach, and pay an upcoming fee before the deadline. Also under the AI Inbox tab is a list of important topics worth browsing, nestled beneath the action items at the top. Each suggested to-do and topic links back to the original email for more context and for verification.

Despite the continued spread of generative AI features, the underlying reliability of these tools remains iffy. Back in 2023, when Google's chatbot was still called “Bard,” I tested the company's nascent Gmail extension that tried to summarize my messages and search through the inbox for insights. At the time, this extension was a complete bust, with a bevy of incorrect responses.

Since then, Google has worked to better its base AI model, called Gemini, and integrate those improvements into its suite of existing software services, including Gmail as well as Search. Despite the company's advances in AI, current Gmail users are still shown a disclaimer stating that Gemini “can make mistakes” when attempting to search an inbox and answer questions.

For users who are concerned about their privacy, the information Google gleans by skimming through inboxes will not be used to improve the company's foundational AI models. “We didn't just bolt AI onto Gmail,” says Blake Barnes, who leads the project for Google. “We built a secure privacy architecture, specifically for this moment.” He emphasizes that users can turn off Gmail's new AI tools if they don't want them.

At the same time Google announced its AI Inbox, the company made free for all Gmail users multiple Gemini features that were previously available only to paying subscribers. This includes the Help Me Write tool, which generates emails from a user prompt, as well as AI Overviews for email threads, which essentially posts a TL;DR summary at the top of long message threads.

Subscribers to Google's Ultra and Pro plans, which start at $20 a month, get two additional new features in their Gmail inbox. First, an AI proofreading tool that suggests more polished grammar and sentence structures. And second, an AI Overviews tool that can search your whole inbox and create relevant summaries on a topic, rather than just summarizing a single email thread.

For the past few years, email providers and other software services have attempted to improve on the inbox experience using generative AI, with varying levels of success. The pitch from companies is often that large language models are allegedly better at deciphering user queries and crafting summaries, compared to traditional search methods and can generate more personalized outputs.

When you have a Gmail account that's over a decade old, like I do, there are gobs of data sitting there, ready to be sifted through. While generative AI is potentially helpful at wading through the murky bogs of mail and calendar events growing stale in my inbox, I need almost guaranteed accuracy for AI truly to be able to help streamline the day-to-day logistics and scheduling of my life. And that's not something LLMs provide to users. I mean, the software literally comes with a baked-in accuracy disclaimer.

I'll be testing these features out, for sure, but at the same time confirming the contents of each task or suggestion and seeing what it might overlook. Can't be missing those dentist appointments!

A supply shortage is the last thing tech companies want to talk about at CES. The annual trade show is their chance to promote new products and drum up excitement for what's coming, not discuss the one thing that could make selling new products in 2026 an uphill battle.

But I've read the reports. I've seen the RAM kits selling for thousands of dollars. I've heard the statements from laptop suppliers and part manufacturers warning investors about what's coming. You probably have too. The memory chip shortage is already dire for companies and for individuals who build their own PCs. But don't think because you only use a laptop and a phone you're going to get out of this so easy.

While the situation remains grim, I met two companies who have engineered ways out. Their plans aren't guaranteed to work, and they won't be easy to pull off. But they just might be our only hope.

Dell COO Jeff Clarke.

“We're waiting for the AI bubble to pop,” a spokesperson from a small PC manufacturer who wished to remain anonymous told me when asked about how they were handling the memory shortage.

None of the big laptop manufacturers or PC builders would say something quite that direct, but actions speak louder than words. While happily selling “AI PCs,” Lenovo, Dell, Asus, and HP have all stated that they'll be doing everything in their power to secure their supply of DRAM for the foreseeable future.

“I've been at this a long time. This is the worst shortage I've ever seen.”

DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is the kind of memory used in laptops and phones, and it's what the three main memory manufacturers are now turning their backs on in favor of high-bandwidth memory for AI data centers. Lack of memory is the main reason you can't run ChatGPT on your PC and have to outsource every prompt to the cloud.

I spoke to Dell COO Jeff Clarke in December about what his company was doing to remedy the situation. “Our focus has been to secure the supply. That has always been the number one rule of our supply chain—to never run out of parts. We've been at this for a while. This just didn't show up. So we've been out there for a while securing our supply.”

It's a sentiment similar to what competitors like HP and Asus have told shareholders. But hoarding memory will only have two effects: It will raise prices even more or further tighten supply. Rumors of higher prices on electronics have begun to flood the internet. On the last day of 2025, Asus went first, officially announcing that it would be raising prices and tweaking configuration options on existing products. This was the follow-up to a leaked internal document from Dell stating that prices could rise by as much as 30 percent in 2026.

When I asked him how bad things really were, Clarke looked at me with a sigh. ""Look, I've been at this a long time. This is the worst shortage I've ever seen. Demand is way ahead of supply. And it's driven by AI. It's driven by infrastructure. You've seen the spot market price—it's up to five times from September. That will manifest. It already has in contract pricing.”

While the average person can buy straight from a retailer, laptop manufacturers have to negotiate contracts on DRAM. According to an analyst from Citrini Research, prices on DRAM increased by around 40 percent in the final quarter of 2025. It's not slowing down; it's escalating. Prices will be up to 60 percent higher in the first quarter of this year. From everyone I talked to this week, I got the impression that the memory shortage would last not months but years.

So, if waiting this one out isn't the solution, what is? As it turns out, there are some very clever people in the world with some incredible ideas, all based around reducing our dependency on AI in the cloud.

You may not have heard of Phison, but the multibillion-dollar Taiwanese company has been building critical controllers for NAND flash memory chips for decades and even claims to be the inventor of the original removable USB flash drive. The founder and CEO of the company, Pua Khein-Seng, has been outspoken for months about warning about the coming memory shortage.

Pua explained to me that the current storage shortage isn't necessarily about revenue. It's about storytelling. “Every CEO, every company—they want to increase valuation,” he says. “Stock price is storytelling. Memory companies need a story.”

From his perspective, that's how we ended up where we are. But at CES, Pua didn't just bring more concern and warnings. He brought a solution. The product is called aiDAPTIV, an add-in SSD cache for laptops that can “expand” the memory bandwidth of your PC's GPU. Flash memory, such as what's found in an SSD, is typically used for long-term storage, leaving the DRAM for the fast, temporary storage that your system needs to function. AiDAPTIV, which is built using a specialized SSD design and an “advanced NAND correction algorithm” can, Phison claims, effectively expand the available memory bandwidth for AI tasks, which are currently bottlenecked.

What does all that have to do with solving the memory shortage issue? Well, while enabling more AI is what aiDAPTIV was originally developed for, Pua also positioned it as a solution to the DRAM shortage. As he explained, manufacturers could lower the DRAM capacity of laptops, going from 32 GB to 16, without reducing the PC's capabilities. That sounds like a great deal, especially since it's what Dell, HP, and Lenovo were planning to do anyway.

One of the great advantages of aiDAPTIV is that it doesn't require any internal changes to the existing hardware. It just slots into an open PCIe slot. MSI and Intel have announced early support, and theoretically, things could begin to shift rather quickly. We might all have to accept laptops with less DRAM, but if Phison's claims are true, that might not matter in practice as much as we used to think.

Ventiva's cooling design.

I also spoke to Carl Schlachte, the CEO of a company called Ventiva, which has invented a novel thermal approach that replaced laptop fans with a specialized iconic cooling engine. No fans, just a solid-state thermal solution that ionizes air to create a silent way of moving air. That's fascinating on its own, but again, there's a way this new technology also addresses the long-term problem of the memory shortage. Once you remove fans from a system, it opens up lots of extra space for other things, such as extra memory.

“The holy trinity of memory is capacity, bandwidth, and topology,” Schlachte says. Topology is the distance the RAM modules are from the CPU. While this isn't a huge concern in data centers, it's a severe limitation when it comes to the allocated space for more memory on laptops. By designing a smaller motherboard, freed from the clutter of cooling fans, more physical space for DRAM suddenly becomes possible. Schlachte believes this is the piece of the puzzle that memory manufacturers are missing.

“High-bandwidth memory is solving for bandwidth in the data center in a space where the need is so great that they'll pay anything,” he says. “Not sure that makes a lot of economic sense for the long haul.”

As Schlachte explains, making memory for AI data centers isn't actually cost effective; it's far more difficult to manufacture compared to DRAM. Given the proper incentives and signals from the market, there's no reason memory makers wouldn't return to pumping out DRAM again.

Training foundational AI models will always need the cloud, but if AI PCs could handle the vast majority of how people use AI today, specifically with running large language models, it'll make less and less sense for memory manufacturers to be solely focused on the data center. In other words, if you build it, they will come. That's both Phison's and Ventiva's theory, at least.

This whole rescue plan hinges on building enough demand on the PC side for on-device AI processing—enough demand that it makes an impact on the bottom line for memory makers. And to do that, individuals and corporations need to be persuaded not only to fully embrace AI but also to want to do their computations on-device. Schlachte pointed to Goldman-Sachs and similar institutions that buy laptops and require private, secure AI that doesn't send sensitive data to the cloud.

By putting more AI performance in the hands of PC buyers, the hope is to wean us off our reliance on the cloud. But these players won't be able to turn this ship on their own. They'll need to convince laptop manufacturers, who need to talk to Intel and AMD, who then all need to tell a concerted, unified story to memory manufacturers. It's a big lift. But if all these companies want to avoid ta serious drop in PC sales as a result of increased prices, it's an effort that needs to happen.

I ended my interview with Schlachte by asking him what he thought might happen if none of these ideas go as planned and we decide to just wait it out—beyond just having to pay more for worse laptops.

“We blow our inheritance money on the data center,” he said. “And in order to pay for it, we enshittify the whole thing. We take this opportunity to literally lift people up, and we turn it into another vehicle for advertising. It stays in the data center, because a limited number of companies control your access to and from it. They're going to rent this back to you. I'm passionate about this, because think I could actually have a hand in switching the powers back to you and I, the human beings.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Is Craigslist the Last Real Place on the Internet?","https://www.wired.com/story/is-craigslist-the-last-real-place-on-the-internet/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT","

The writer and comedian Megan Koester got her first writing job, reviewing internet pornography, from a Craigslist ad she responded to more than 15 years ago. Several years after that, she used the listings website to find the rent-controlled apartment where she still lives today. When she wanted to buy property, she scrolled through Craigslist and found a parcel of land in the Mojave Desert. She built a dwelling on it (never mind that she'd later discover it was unpermitted) and furnished it entirely with finds from Craigslist's free section, right down to the laminate flooring, which had previously been used by a production company.

“There's so many elements of my life that are suffused with Craigslist,” says Koester, 42, whose Instagram account is dedicated, at least in part, to cataloging screenshots of what she has dubbed “harrowing images” from the site's free section; on the day we speak, she's wearing a cashmere sweater that cost her nothing, besides the faith it took to respond to an ad with no pictures. “I'm ride or die.”

Koester is one of untold numbers of Craigslist aficionados, many of them in their thirties and forties, who not only still use the old-school classifieds site but also consider it an essential, if anachronistic, part of their everyday lives. It's a place where anonymity is still possible, where money doesn't have to be exchanged, and where strangers can make meaningful connections—for romantic pursuits, straightforward transactions, and even to cast unusual creative projects, including experimental TV shows like The Rehearsal on HBO and Amazon Freevee's Jury Duty. Unlike flashier online marketplaces such as DePop and its parent company, Etsy, or Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist doesn't use algorithms to track users' moves and predict what they want to see next. It doesn't offer public profiles, rating systems, or “likes” and “shares” to dole out like social currency; as a result, Craigslist effectively disincentivizes clout-chasing and virality-seeking—behaviors that are often rewarded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X. It's a utopian vision of a much earlier, far more earnest internet.

“The real freaks come out on Craigslist,” says Koester. “There's a purity to it.” Even still, the site is a little tamer than it used to be: Craigslist shut down its “casual encounters” ads and took its personals section offline in 2018, after Congress passed legislation that would've put the company on the hook for listings from potential sex traffickers. The “missed connections” section, however, remains active.

The site is what Jessa Lingel, an associate professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has called the “ungentrified” internet. If that's the case, then online gentrification has only accelerated in recent years, thanks in part to the proliferation of AI. Even Wikipedia and Reddit, visually basic sites created in the early aughts and with an emphasis similar to Craigslist's on fostering communities, have both incorporated their own versions of AI tools.

Some might argue that Craigslist, by contrast, is outdated; an article published in this magazine more than 15 years ago called it “underdeveloped” and “unpredictable.” But to the site's most devoted adherents, that's precisely its appeal.

“ I think Craigslist is having a revival,” says Kat Toledo, an actor and comedian who regularly uses the site to hire cohosts for her LA-based stand-up show, Besitos. “When something is structured so simply and really does serve the community, and it doesn't ask for much? That's what survives.”

Toledo started using Craigslist in the 2000s and never stopped. Over the years, she has turned to the site to find romance, housing, and even her current job as an assistant to a forensic psychologist. She's worked there full-time for nearly two years, defying Craigslist's reputation as a supplier of potentially sketchy one-off gigs. The stigma of the website, sometimes synonymous with scammers and, in more than one instance, murderers, can be hard to shake. “If I'm not doing a good job,” Toledo says she jokes to her employer, “just remember you found me on Craigslist.”

But for Toledo, the site's “random factor”—the way it facilitates connection with all kinds of people she might not otherwise interact with—is also what makes it so exciting. Respondents to her ads seeking paid cohosts tend to be “people who almost have nothing to lose, but in a good way, and everything to gain,” she says. There was the born-again Christian who performed a reenactment of her religious awakening and the poet who insisted on doing Toledo's makeup; others, like the commercial actor who started crying on the phone beforehand, never made it to the stage.

It's difficult to quantify just how many people actively use Craigslist and how often they click through its listings. The for-profit company is privately owned and doesn't share data about its users. (Craigslist also didn't respond to a request for comment.) But according to the internet data company similarweb, Craigslist draws more than 105 million monthly users, making it the 40th most popular website in the United States—not too shabby for a company that doesn't spend any money on advertising or marketing. And though Craigslist's revenue has reportedly plummeted over the past half-dozen years, based on an estimate from an industry analytics firm, it remains enormously profitable. (The company generates revenue by charging a modest fee to publish ads for gigs, certain types of goods, and in some cities, apartments.)

“It's not a perfect platform by any means, but it does show that you can make a lot of money through an online endeavor that just treats users like they have some autonomy and grants everybody a degree of privacy,” says Lingel. A longtime Craigslist user, she began researching the site after wondering, “Why do all these web 2.0 companies insist that the only way for them to succeed and make money is off the back of user data? There must be other examples out there.”

In her book, Lingel traces the history of the site, which began in 1995 as an email list for a couple hundred San Francisco Bay Area locals to share events, tech news, and job openings. By the end of the decade, engineer Craig Newmark's humble experiment had evolved into a full-fledged company with an office, a domain name, and a handful of hires. In true Craigslist fashion, Newmark even recruited the company's CEO, Jim Buckmaster, from an ad he posted to the site, initially seeking a programmer.

The two have gone to great lengths to wrest the company away from corporate interests. When they suspected a looming takeover attempt from eBay, which had purchased a minority stake in Craigslist from a former employee in 2004, Newmark and Buckmaster spent roughly a decade battling the tech behemoth in court. The litigation ended in 2015, with Craigslist buying back its shares and regaining control.

“ They are in lockstep about their early '90s internet values,” says Lingel, who credits Newmark and Buckmaster with Craigslist's long-held aesthetic and ethos: simplicity, privacy, and accessibility. “As long as they're the major shareholders, that will stay that way.”

Craigslist's refusal to “sell out,” as Koester puts it, is all the more reason to use it. “Not only is there a purity to the fan base or the user base, there's a purity to the leadership that they're uncorruptible basically,” says Koester. “I'm gonna keep looking at Craigslist until I die.” She pauses, then shudders: “Or, until Craig dies, I guess.”

Open-source database software support firm Percona is refocusing its business on structured, services-led engagements aimed at solving performance and AI-readiness challenges for enterprise database teams.

Last month, the company announced the launch of Percona Packages, a suite of structured consulting and support offerings for enterprise IT and DBA teams. The initial offerings — Quickstart, Performance Optimization, and AI Readiness — target critical database challenges with structured, time-bound engagements.

The new packages address the accelerating adoption of AI as enterprises face a critical talent bottleneck. McKinsey reports that 77% of companies lack the data engineering, architecture, and data management skills required to scale data transformations. Meanwhile, IDC estimates that the IT skills gap could cost organizations $5.5 trillion by 2026, driven by shortages in data management, cloud, and AI talent.

According to Percona, this talent crunch leaves teams overstretched, slowing database modernization and increasing the risk of costly downtime, inefficient operations, and stalled AI initiatives. The company's latest release helps database users eliminate performance roadblocks through optimization and future-proofs databases with AI readiness.

Percona's new Packages release returns the company to its roots of empowering organizations with database services, CEO Peter Farkas noted.

“Our goal is to be a one-stop shop for open-source database technology, providing support across MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Valkey/Redis, and beyond. These packages tackle the most urgent database challenges while delivering fast, measurable results, so our customers can focus on innovation, not infrastructure headaches,” he explained.

One of the primary benefits is the specific, measurable results customers see within the first 30 days, depending on the package and the business problem being addressed, according to Nick Herring, SVP of global services at Percona. Fast results apply to scalability, performance, AI readiness, and overall environmental stability.

“In all cases, these engagements are designed to deliver fast, actionable outcomes,” he told LinuxInsider.

Herring reported that a SaaS provider joined Percona last year due to long-standing performance issues stemming from instability. The company's staff worked on the problem independently and with other vendors for months without resolution, resulting in a significant impact on customers. Within 30 days, Percona identified a specific bug and solved a recurring issue that others had failed to resolve.

Performance Optimization does not lend itself to a single, universal percentage reduction in query latency. Instead, improvement depends on the customer's goals, workload characteristics, architecture, and how the application interacts with the database layer, according to Herring. It can address a wide range of performance issues, including slow queries, recurring outages, and failover instability.

“We have eliminated or significantly reduced these problems for customers across on-premises and cloud environments, spanning all major verticals,” he said.

One core challenge is insufficient tuning of the underlying database infrastructure before introducing AI workloads, which compounds the problem. A second hurdle is a lack of familiarity with AI database tooling that leads to configuration problems at the critical intersection of AI workloads and the data they depend on, he explained.

“Our AI Readiness package is designed to proactively address both challenges, helping customers move faster while avoiding costly rework and downstream performance issues,” Herring added.

However, the AI Readiness package is currently limited to PostgreSQL and the pgvector extension. He sees customers most often using PostgreSQL for AI workloads. Thus, Percona is meeting customers where they are.

“We don't have anything to share yet about our future roadmap to bring AI-ready packages to MySQL or MongoDB. We will continue to evaluate our customers' and potential customers' needs, as well as the success of the PostgreSQL AI offering, to inform future plans,” Herring said.

Well-known AI companies, gaming companies, financial institutions, and SaaS providers come to Percona to assess the health of their environment after experiencing difficulty scaling with their customer base and new application functionality. Such scaling trouble puts additional strain on their database environment.

“This is where Percona shines, and after these initial engagements, most ultimately become long-term customers of our various services,” he said.

Herring shared that some customers plan to handle their own cloud-to-on-premises migration, a MySQL 5.7-to-8.0 upgrade, or a new Valkey deployment. They look to Percona to reduce risk through expert guidance and validation.

“In these cases, Quickstart is a good fit. However, if customers want a turnkey solution for an upgrade, migration, or new deployment, all but the simplest scenarios demand a greater level of hands-on execution and customization,” he advised.

Except for the PostgreSQL AI Readiness package, the other Percona Packages apply to all technologies Percona supports: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, and Valkey/Redis.

These packages were specifically designed to solve common business challenges our customers face, regardless of technology.

                                What happens here matters everywhere                                


by Alan Boyle on Jan 7, 2026 at 4:41 pmJanuary 7, 2026 at 4:41 pm

Astronomers say they've found an asteroid that spins faster than other space rocks of its size.

The asteroid, known as 2025 MN45, is nearly half a mile (710 meters) in diameter and makes a full rotation every 1.88 minutes, based on an analysis of data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. “This is now the fastest-spinning asteroid that we know of, larger than 500 meters,” University of Washington astronomer Sarah Greenstreet said today at the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting in Phoenix.

Greenstreet, who serves as an assistant astronomer at the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab and heads the Rubin Observatory's working group for near-Earth objects and interstellar objects, is the lead author of a paper in The Astrophysical Journal Letters that describes the discovery and its implications. It's the first peer-reviewed paper based on data from Rubin's LSST Camera in Chile.

2025 MN45 is one of more than 2,100 solar system objects that were detected during the observatory's commissioning phase. Over time, the LSST Camera tracked variations in the light reflected by those objects. Greenstreet and her colleagues analyzed those variations to determine the size, distance, composition and rate of rotation for 76 asteroids, all but one of which are in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. (The other asteroid is a near-Earth object.)

The team found 16 “super-fast rotators” spinning at rates ranging between 13 minutes and 2.2 hours per revolution — plus three “ultra-fast rotators,” including 2025 MN45, that make a full revolution in less than five minutes.

Greenstreet said 2025 MN45 appears to consist of solid rock, as opposed to the “rubble pile” material that most asteroids are thought to be made of.

“We also believe that it's likely a collisionary fragment of a much larger parent body that, early in the solar system's history, was heated enough that the material internal to it melted and differentiated,” Greenstreet said. She and her colleagues suggest that the primordial collision blasted 2025 MN45 from the dense core of the parent body and sent it whirling into space.

Astronomers have previously detected fast-spinning asteroids that measure less than 500 meters wide, but this is the first time larger objects have been found with rotational rates that are faster than five minutes per revolution. The Rubin team's other two ultra-fast rotators have rates of 1.9 minutes and 3.8 minutes.

What would it be like to take a spin on 2025 MN45? Imagine riding on a Ferris wheel — say, the Seattle Great Wheel, which typically makes three revolutions in 10 to 12 minutes. Now make the wheel more than 10 times taller, and make the rotation rate at least twice as fast. It'd feel as if you were going more than 40 mph.

“If you were standing on it, it would probably be quite the ride to be going around on the outside edge of this thing that's the size of eight football fields,” Greenstreet said.

But the significance of the study goes beyond imagining an extraterrestrial amusement ride.

“This is only the beginning of science for the Rubin Observatory,” Greenstreet said. “We are already seeing that we can study smaller asteroids at farther distances than we've ever been able to study before. And being able to study these fast rotators further, we're going to learn a lot of really crucial information about the internal strength, composition and collisional histories of these primitive solar system bodies that date back to the formation of the solar system.”

The study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, “Lightcurves, Rotation Periods, and Colors for Vera C. Rubin Observatory's First Asteroid Discoveries,” lists 71 co-authors. Authors from the University of Washington include Greenstreet as well as Zhuofu (Chester) Li, Dmitrii E. Vavilov, Devanshi Singh, Mario Jurić, Željko Ivezić, Joachim Moeyens, Eric C. Bellm, Jacob A. Kurlander, Maria T. Patterson, Nima Sedaghat, Krzysztof Suberlak and Ian S. Sullivan.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. The University of Washington was one of the founding members of the consortium behind the project, which benefited from early contributions by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and software executive Charles Simonyi. The observatory's Simonyi Survey Telescope was named in honor of Simonyi's family.

Seattle startup Avalanche Energy is raising new funding to develop its compact fusion energy devices. A new SEC filing reveals a fresh $14.9 million round. 

A company spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by GeekWire.

Avalanche and dozens of companies around the world are vying for scientific breakthroughs that would allow them to generate electricity from fusion reactions on a commercially viable scale. The sun and stars are the masters of fusion, smashing together light atoms under high-pressure, super hot conditions to produce energy.

Avalanche is pursuing a different strategy than many of its competitors, building desktop-sized energy devices and working multiple angles for revenue generation. That includes:

Avalanche had previously raised $50 million from investors that include Chris Sacca's Lowercarbon Capital, Founders Fund, Toyota Ventures, Azolla Ventures and others.

The fusion industry produced surprising headlines shortly before Christmas with the announcement of a $6 billion planned merger between Trump Media & Technology Group and California fusion company TAE Technologies. 

The partnership aims to site and begin building what it calls the world's first utility-scale fusion plant this year, with Trump Media committing $300 million in near-term funding. President Trump is the largest shareholder of Trump Media, the publicly-traded parent company of the social media platform Truth Social.

Avalanche is part of a fusion hub in the Pacific Northwest that includes two additional Seattle-area companies working to harness fusion power.

A Bellevue, Wash.-based startup is moving closer to commercialization of a handheld scanning device that it says could change one of the most dangerous and controversial procedures in policing: the physical pat-down for weapons.

Lassen Peak‘s radar-based imaging system allows officers to detect concealed guns, knives and other weapons from several feet away, without touching a person. The technology — similar to full-body scanners used in airport security checkpoints — is built around a custom-designed semiconductor chip that operates at extremely high radio frequencies, enabling detailed imaging through clothing.

Intended for use by law enforcement, military, and private venues, the device could help reduce use-of-force incidents during pat-downs — known as Terry frisks — while addressing long-standing concerns about privacy, bias and officer safety.

“We want to reduce the use of force. That's our goal,” Lassen Peak Chairman and CEO Hatch Graham told GeekWire. “And to help build trust between society and law enforcement. Hopefully this does that. That's our mission.”

Graham, a longtime inventor, engineer and entrepreneur, co-founded the company in 2019 alongside Chief Scientist Dr. Ehsan Afshari, a professor at the University of Michigan and an expert in ultra-high frequency microelectronics.

The company announced $10 million in debt and equity financings this week led by Menlo Park, Calif.-based Structural Capital. Lassen Peak, which was a finalist for Innovation of the Year at the 2025 GeekWire Awards, is also backed by Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group, among others, and has raised about $40 million to date.

At the heart of Lassen Peak's system is a proprietary imaging radar chip that operates in the so-called “terahertz gap,” at frequencies around 300 gigahertz — far higher than conventional radar used in autonomous vehicles or wireless communications.

At those frequencies, the wavelength of the signal shrinks to about a millimeter, allowing dozens of antennas to be integrated directly onto a standard chip.

The current chip integrates 24 receiver antennas and eight transmit antennas, enabling the system to capture multiple perspectives of an object simultaneously. The approach works similarly to human vision, using triangulation to infer shape and location.

“You close one eye and somebody hits you a baseball, it'll hit you in the forehead,” Graham said. “But by having two eyeballs, you can triangulate.”

Raw radar data is processed using a combination of digital signal processing and artificial intelligence software that reconstructs images and highlights suspicious objects, such as the outline of a handgun or a knife. The system is designed to show only abstract shapes and bounding boxes, rather than anatomical details.

The system also includes a cloud-based backend that stores scan data, images and metadata such as time and location. That data can be retained for evidentiary purposes, similar to body-camera footage.

The Terry stop and Terry frisk, named for a 1968 Supreme Court case, are brief detentions and pat-downs that allow officers to conduct an outer-clothing search for weapons when they have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.

The frisk has long been criticized as invasive and is widely regarded by officers as one of the most dangerous moments in an encounter.

It's when officers and those being detained can get hurt, according to Carl Rushmeyer, Lassen Peak's vice president of public safety and a former law enforcement officer.

Instead of putting hands on a detainee, an officer standing six or eight feet away can remotely scan and verify an individual using the Lassen Peak device.

“You're still going to do a secondary search before you get them in a patrol car,” Rushmeyer said. “But this is a very, very good initial search without having to contact or touch somebody.”

Graham said Lassen Peak has been endorsed by a number of law enforcement professionals as well as rights advocates. The scanner has generated interest from law enforcement agencies across the U.S. and internationally, especially in the U.K. and countries where knife violence is a rising concern.

The company has focused on large police departments with more than 1,000 sworn officers, narrowing its initial target market to about 160 agencies nationwide. Graham said Lassen Peak has met with 62 of them in the past year.

The company has about 15 employees and another 10 consultants and is not generating revenue yet, but expects to do so through a subscription model. Lassen Peak plans to conduct demonstrations and beta testing with police departments in early 2026, with initial shipments targeted for midyear.

While the first commercial product is a handheld scanner, Lassen Peak's long-term vision centers on the chip itself, which can be embedded into multiple platforms. These include drones that could assess a potentially dangerous situation from the air or ceiling-mounted dome cameras with “eyes” on a hospital, school, courthouse or other sensitive location.

“It has to be a product that goes out into the world and does not come back,” Graham said. “And that's as difficult in these life-and-death applications as anything. We're heading into 2026 and we believe we're in the final stages of commercializing.”

Google has unveiled a new AI Inbox for Gmail that's designed to provide a personalized overview of your tasks and keep you informed about important updates. Gmail is also launching AI Overviews in search and a Grammarly-like “Proofread” feature. Additionally, Gmail is bringing to all users several AI features that were previously available only to paid users.

The new AI Inbox tab features two sections: “Suggested to-dos” and “Topics to catch up on.” The first section displays summaries of top priority emails that require an action, such as a reminder that you have a bill due tomorrow or that you need to call your dermatologist to confirm your mailing address so they can ship your prescription refill.

Under the “Topics to catch up on” section, you'll see updates such as “Your Lululemon return is being processed, and your order of Metal Vent Tech shirts has been delivered” and “Your end-of-year statement is now available from Wealthfront.” These different updates are grouped into different categories, such as “Finances” and “Purchases.”

“This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back, showing you what you need to do and when you need to do it,” said Blake Barnes, VP, Product at Google, in a briefing with reporters. “Don't worry, the traditional inbox will remain available. This is simply a new view you can toggle in and out of as you please to cut through the noise of your incoming mail.”

Google is rolling out the AI Inbox feature to trusted testers before making it more broadly available in the coming months. 

With the new AI Overviews in Gmail search, users can now search their inbox using natural language questions to get a quick answer instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information.

For example, you can ask “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” You will then get an AI Overview that pulls answers from your emails and highlights the key details you need.

“We scour every email in your inbox, and we give you the answer to your questions right at the top,” Blake said. “So just like AI Overviews in Google Search, you can ask natural language questions to get an AI-powered response. However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.”

This new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. 

Google says all of Gmail's AI features are optional, that it doesn't use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment.

As for the new Proofread feature, Google says it's designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure. It offers one-click suggestions for word choice, conciseness, active voice, and splitting complex sentences. 

For instance, if you write something like “might inflict disturbance,” Gmail will suggest changing it to “might disturb.” It'll also flag instances where you use the wrong word, like “weather” instead of “whether.” It's essentially similar to popular proofreading services like Grammarly.

By rolling out its own proofreading tool, Google likely hopes people will stop turning to third-party tools or plugging their emails into ChatGPT to fix them.

Proofread is rolling out to subscribers of its paid subscription tiers Google AI Pro and Ultra.

While these new features are only launching to select users, Google announced that Gmail's “Help Me Write,” AI Overviews for threaded emails, and “Suggested Replies” are rolling out to all users. These features were previously only available to paying subscribers.

Help Me Write can help you compose an email from a single prompt, while AI Overviews for threaded emails provide summaries of longer email threads with multiple replies. Suggested Replies use the context of conversations to offer relevant responses that match your tone and style.

The BlackBerry is back, sort of. Mobile keyboard maker Clicks Technology last week announced its debut phone, the $499 Communicator, which sports a physical keyboard. The company is also offering a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that fits on any device.

At CES, TechCrunch chatted with Clicks' chief marketing officer and co-founder, Jeff Gadway, and went hands-on with the latest prototype of the upcoming smartphone.

The device offers a BlackBerry-like keyboard and messaging-focused touchscreen, and runs Android 16 under the hood, which means the Communicator can run any Android app. The company has partnered with the minimalist launcher, Niagara Launcher, to display apps on the homescreen. Other apps are within easy reach via a scrollable list.

Reception for the new devices has been better than expected, Gadway told TechCrunch. Although he declined to share sales numbers, he said that over the past week, the company was making a sale every 6.5 seconds between both devices.

While the prototype we tried was not a fully functional phone, it's the same size and weight as the device that's preparing to ship later this year, giving an initial feel for what it would be like to use the Communicator. Onboard storage lands at 256 gigabytes, with expandable microSD storage of up to 2 terabytes of data. The device will also sport a 4000mAh silicon-carbon battery and is currently weighing in around 170 grams (or 6 oz). Underneath the back is where your nano-SIM card will go. 

The phone also comes with interchangeable back covers that you can pop off to change its look. While not present on the prototype, the cover will have a small notch at the top and then a little finger pick at the bottom.

In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device's final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.

The device's screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.

That's where the device's light-up side button can help. Called the “Signal Light,” the button can be configured to glow with different colors or patterns when you receive messages from certain people, groups, or apps. So you can be sure to respond if it's your boss or the kids contacting you and ignore less important notifications.

The tactile, physical keys feel good, though the prototype's version may actually be a little less “clicky” than the final product. (There's a debate on whether the keys should have 110 grams of pressure or 120 or 130 grams, and feedback so far is that the latter figures are winning.)

With less pressure, the keys feel softer, which could be more accessible for those who haven't used a BlackBerry before. But people who type fast tend to prefer more clicky keys because there's more feedback.

“This is the stuff that Michael Fisher and myself and Kevin Michaluk fight over all the time,” said Gadway, referring to his co-founders. “We're fighting over grams.” 

The keys and the screen are also at the same vertical height, so you can seamlessly move from the keyboard to the touchscreen. 

The Clicks Communicator comes with a fixed-focus, hole-punch front camera that can capture 24-megapixel photos. The rear camera features optical image stabilization and electronic image stabilization for video, and can capture 50-megapixel images.

The phone runs on a 4-nanometer, MediaTek 5G IoT processor, with 8 gigabytes of RAM.

The Communicator will have a 4.03-inch AMOLED display at 1,080 x 1,200 resolution. Wired charging is supported at up to 18 watts, and wireless charging at up to 15 watts. The device is also Qi compatible and Android Strongbox-ready, which will appeal to security-minded customers.

The phone has other standard features too, like GPS and NFC, and will offer five years of security updates as well as Android updates through Android 20.

The device is expected to ship in the second half of 2026.

Spangle, an AI e-commerce startup founded by former Bolt CEO Maju Kuruvilla, has raised $15 million in a new funding round, valuing the company at $100 million after the investment.

Led by NewRoad Capital Partners, the all-equity Series A round comes over a year after the Seattle-based startup raised a $6 million seed round at a $30 million pre-money valuation. Madrona, DNX Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and strategic angel investors also participated, bringing total funding to $21 million, according to the startup.

Retailers are facing changes in how consumers discover products online, as AI tools, social platforms, and recommendation engines increasingly influence buying decisions before shoppers reach a brand's website. Kuruvilla (pictured above) aims to address this with Spangle — positioning it as software that helps retailers personalize shopping experiences based on that context as shoppers move through their sites, using real-time, AI-generated product recommendations and layouts.

Since emerging from stealth in March of last year, Spangle has signed nine enterprise customers, including fashion retailers Revolve, Alexander Wang, and Steve Madden, whose combined online sales total about $3.8 billion, Kuruvilla said in an interview.

Traffic flowing through Spangle's platform has grown about 57% month-on-month, with all customers expanding their use of the software, and the startup said it quadrupled its annualized revenue in the fourth quarter, though it did not disclose revenue figures.

At the core of Spangle's approach is a simple idea: Instead of sending shoppers to pre-built product or category pages, brands route traffic to what is essentially a blank page. Spangle's AI fills that page in real time using a proprietary model called ProductGPT, drawing on signals such as where the shopper came from, what they searched for or clicked on, and how similar visitors have behaved, to surface products, recommendations, and content tailored to that moment.

Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that brands using Spangle are seeing close to a 50% increase in revenue per visit, a doubling of return on ad spend, and a 15% increase in average order value.

“We are future-proofing the brand,” Kuruvilla said, adding that Spangle trains its AI model on each retailer's catalog and performance data, allowing shopping experiences to adapt automatically.

Spangle's software has helped Revolve adapt shopping experiences in real time, driving about a 60% improvement in return on ad spend and a 50% increase in revenue per visit, said Ryan Pabelona, the retailer's vice president of performance marketing.

Before starting Spangle in 2024, Kuruvilla served as CEO of the one-click checkout company Bolt and earlier spent more than a decade at Amazon, where he worked on large-scale commerce and AI systems. He founded the startup alongside CTO Fei Wang, a former Amazon principal engineer who worked on Alexa and customer service technologies and later served as CTO at Saks Off 5th.

Kuruvilla said their experience running commerce and payments platforms shaped Spangle's focus on building infrastructure rather than incremental fixes. Some, he added, view the startup as a kind of Shopify for AI-powered commerce.

Spangle's approach also aligns with a shift toward shopping mediated by AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and several browser-based agents. As consumers increasingly rely on chatbots and automated agents to search for and compare products, Kuruvilla said brands will need software that can respond dynamically to both human shoppers and machines, rather than serving the same static pages to every visitor.

Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that Spangle became viable only in the past two years as three major shifts converged: consumers growing comfortable discovering products through AI tools, a rapid proliferation of discovery channels beyond Google and Meta, and advances in AI technology that have sharply lowered the cost and latency of generating real-time experiences. Together, he said, those changes made it possible to replace incremental fixes with an AI-native commerce system that can adapt instantly as shopping behavior evolves.

Currently, Spangle has six full-time employees, underscoring how AI tools are allowing startups to scale enterprise software with relatively small teams.

With the fresh funding, Kuruvilla said Spangle plans to invest further in research and development, expand its engineering team, and build out its sales organization.

""Bose blows"" is a popular comment amongst the audiophile community but, to me, it seems like they don't blow at all[0]. In fact quite the opposite: this is a fantastic example for other companies to follow. Top marks, Bose![0] What is actually true is that they are opinionated about sound reproduction in ways that a bunch of people don't agree with but which in the right context are often effective and enjoyable to listen to.

That comment is not wrong, you are imo just not making an important distinction that the criteria on which audiophiles judge Bose as “blowing” (which is almost purely the sound profile + a few other smaller things like physical comfort/connectivity/price/etc.) vs. what you judge it on (which is more in the long-term technical user/community product support, idk how to describe that area much better) are almost entirely disjoint.It is perfectly fine and valid for an audio product to “blow” from an opinionated audiophile perspective, while being exceptionally great from the long-term product/user/community product support perspective.I heavily agree with you btw, Bose should be heavily lauded for making a decision to open-up their speaker firmware after it reaches  the official end of support deadline. The fact that this is an exceptional practice is imo, a little bit sad, because I believe that it should be way more common.

The most amusing anti-example of this was the Switch generation: $60 for a cartridge, or $60 for a digital license. Guess which is actually more valuable? Guess which you were more likely to find discounted, even if only by a marginal amount, by some store desperate to move stock out of the way?By contrast, I'm not worried about the fact I can't resell my copy of Game X I got on Steam when I only paid $5 for it in the first place.

If a speaker reproduces some music with 100% accuracy and the result is unpleasant, doesn't that just mean the original music—as created by the artist—is unpleasant?Where possible, I'd prefer a speaker that respects the artist's decisions instead of inserting itself into the creative process.

Hi-fi speakers, tube amps, and other accessories generally ""degrade"" the sound with added harmonics and natural smile EQs. That's what makes them sound more pleasing.(I'm not disagreeing with you, just adding more color.)

Maybe the general rule should be like, if something isn't in the users control and the user doesn't want it anymore or can no longer function despite not being damaged, then the company should take back the hardware and refund the user.So the company still have two options, either refund or open-source the systems needed for the device so that the user or third-party can continue supporting it.

The open source community will happily reverse-engineer the protocol and clean-room develop their own server code.

The same can be said about a lot of games, and should be the case with them as well. Big MMOs for example. See the plethora of WoW private servers as an example of how it can be done.I think the stop killing games initiative in the EU was pushing for it but not sure how far they've gotten, but like with hardware, once a game studio no longer wants to run the servers for their game, they should be forced to turn it over to the community so the players can continue playing long after the studio is gone.

No, the law must mandate that. You either provide active support, or if you end it you must open-source all tools necessary to perform maintenance.

Then we could add and maintain music service playback for the community. But there is no open sourcing of any actual code here and this soundtouch web api cannot change the URLs on the existing firmware of the user management service or the music service registry.So to my eye this story seems misleading and just some PR nonsense. It's a little frustrating reading all of the ""great job, Bose!"" comments here like anything was actually done... Disclaimer: I used to work at Bose.

This API just allows you to make basic requests to do things like change volume on the speaker.To support the smart features of the SoundTouch speakers, we would the soundtouch user management service.

That's when I discovered stories of people whose used Snoos had been bricked by the company. For such an expensive product, that is such a waste. If I'd known about this beforehand, I never would have made the purchase in the first place.

Secondly, these devices are basically one step above embedded. It's highly unlikely you can load and run anything custom on them.Since they are opening up the API, you can keep using them for what they were made for, which is at least a solid basic liberty

Seeing that, I expected the ability to build and run a custom firmware, like with an Android device with its bootloader unlocked. But it is not that, and they didn't open source their app either.What they did is that they removed dependence on their servers, and opened their device to be controlled by third party apps. That is, they let users use their device past its end of life, including when the first party app will stop being maintained, but not to the point of letting user add features.In understand why they would do that, they don't want users to backport features only available on their latest models that are sold at a premium, therefore competing against themselves. After all, the value in smart speakers is not the sound producing device, which I think is a problem that has been solved more than a decade ago at the consumer level, it is all about software features.

One time I got a free Harman Kardon bluetooth speaker from Microsoft (the Invoke from 2017). They were $100* but went on sale for $50 and I snagged one.Then Microsoft discontinued Cortana for it, but they didn't kill the speaker. They released firmware that turned it into a perfectly good bluetooth speaker (which I still use today.) And they sent me a $50 gift card* to buy something else from Microsoft. Good will! I was a big fan of Microsoft hardware. Shame about the software...* Apparently $200 initially but they had some steep sales because Cortana as a voice assistant wasn't reviewing well. Reviews are a bit negative on the sound quality. Probably true enough at $200, but for $0-50, I think it's actually really good sound quality.* https://news.harman.com/releases/releases-20200730

I was the engineering lead on that product, and built a SW platform from scratch for it (Microsoft provided an SDK to Cortana which they developed in parallel.)The internal build could actually run Cortana, Alexa and Google Assistant simultaneously and you could e.g. set an alarm with one of them and query it with another, and they could interrupt each other based on priority. Obviously nobody wanted that feature, but it was hella cool that it worked. Oh, and you could make Skype calls from across the room, and the microphone array lived up to Skype's tough certification requirements which took weeks of testing in Microsoft's anechoic chamber for the DSP/algorithm team to fine tune.I tried to push for open-sourcing the platform but it was tricky because 1) the director of engineering in Harman didn't know what open source meant and for a hardware focused business to understand the value was a hard sell, 2) it used a HW module that came with a SW stack I mostly got rid off but a few parts were remaining that would need to be replaced which would require additional resources, 3) I was burned out at that point and had limited energy left to fight the good fight. Really too bad, it could have been a cool voice agent development platform, and I honestly think it would have sold in large volumes as a developer-friendly device.Glad you like it, sorry about the remaining Bluetooth bugs nobody got around to fix, since it basically flopped instantly.

Real resistance to authoritarianism has never come from isolated individuals using violence. It requires organized collective action where people stand together and refuse to comply. History shows that meaningful resistance often begins with simple nonviolent acts like refusing unjust rules or asserting basic dignity rather than a lone person reaching for a gun.Owning a gun by itself does not meaningfully protect anyone from government overreach. Organization solidarity and collective action do.

I have absolutely no clue how I got the idea, other than the fact that I grew up in the Orthodox Church and all my other coding projects have been faith-related (a terrible mobile app (1) and slightly broken Byzantine chant website (2) ). I'm a relatively new developer and I've been hungry for a project to build that people will actually use and share around, so I hoped this would fit the bill.Sure enough, friends and family have been making it part of their daily routine. When priests AND my nonreligious college friends started sending me their results every day, I knew I had something. It was really exciting.------When the idea popped into my head, I started working on it right away. I created the project at 1AM and had a MVP/SLC version done a few hours later. That was a few weeks ago.I am using SvelteKit, no external APIs, and SQLite for the database. It's hosted on an Ubuntu machine in my living room. Coding agents like Roo/Kilo Code assisted heavily in the development, but after I had already decided on the overall architecture and how I wanted things to work together.The game is free, has no signup, and I'm not running any ads. I'm looking for any and all feedback, and especially suggestions for how I can make the game more interesting, fun, and/or educational.Thank you HN!

    Do not trust in a friend;
      Do not put your confidence in a companion;
    Guard the doors of your mouth
      From her who lies in your bosom.
    For son dishonors father,
      Daughter rises against her mother,
    Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
      A man's enemies are the men of his own household.
    Therefore I will look to the Lord;
      I will wait for the God of my salvation;
        My God will hear me.

Tried [redacted] and [redacted] first, turns out to be [redacted]. I would literally never have guessed that. It genuinely could have been from any [redacted] book at that point. Maybe if I could just give up with a button.Also yeah it's weird that I have to wait a day to do the next one. I get the appeal of having a daily routine fun site, but why not also let me do a random one each time I pass/fail if I want?

Perhaps I should make it clearer that correctly identifying the book on the first try is not the expectation. Maybe I will add a clarification that the goal is ""as few guesses as possible"" or maybe ""as few guesses as you can"".It's quite a variable challenge. Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not.

It's not quite true that ""it genuinely could have been from any OT book"". First, when you make a guess it doesn't just tell you whether you got the book right, it also tells you whether you got the right section (major prophets, gospels, etc.). So if you guess that something's from Isaiah, after that you will at least know whether it's from Ezekiel or not.I agree that this one could be from almost-but-not-quite anywhere in the OT, but bear in mind that the target audience (1) may well have read the whole thing multiple times and (2) may well have a good idea of the ""tone"" of various different books.(I've been a godless heathen for many years, though I was a Christian for many years before that. In the present case my first guess was the same as yours but I didn't try your second guess, not only because of the can't-be-in-that-section thing but because I have a pretty good idea what sort of thing is in that book and I don't think there's much there that reads like this verse. It did, none the less, take me quite a lot of guesses. If I were still in the habit of reading the Bible a lot I expect I'd have done better. Which is kinda the point.)

I spent a decent amount of time trying to add the Deuterocanonical books. Ultimately I put it on hold, because I was worried that adding those books would make a challenging game even harder (at least for my initial audience of 20 family and friends). I also wondered if adding those books would put off any Protestant visitors... but I see their omission has caught your attention, that's Orthodox 1, Protestant 0. I'll find an elegant way to work them in.And I never thought of adding an RSS feed! I'll add that to the todo!

It's pretty easy to tell that something is old or new testament based on the writing styles.  What's hard is the OT has a fair number of similar writers and a lot of books.  The first question I got was [redacted] (lol) which is really hard to track down as they all sound the same to me.Edit I didn't realize everyone had the same question.  So pulled out the hint.

Personally, I know Genesis/Exodus, Psalms, and the Gospels well. I can recognize Epistles on sight, but identifying the exact one is really just a guessing game. Most everything else I am not familiar with and will take me a while to guess.I think that's why people have enjoyed it so far, because of the tradeoff of getting a verse you recognize (so you can guess the book quickly) or getting an unfamiliar verse (so you get to expand your familiarity with the Bible).

I do not know the Bible particularly well compared to many other people, and I know the New Testament better than the Old (not uncommon - its both smaller and more important to Christians).

OT is a lot harder simply because of the number of writers and how boring/similar a lot of the writing is.  To be successful you'd need to have something pulled from like the pentateuch.  Maybe psalms or something like Kings/Chronicles.

It also, of course, only contains the protestant canon.There are more free translations. Not knowledgeable enough to recommend one. Mostly there is no significant difference, but of course there are passages and translations which are contested.There are Bible apps which will let you install multiple translations and read them side by side. That plus a paper Bible (a good translation such as NRSV) goes a long way.

The new king james translation is better.  As is NIV.If you are really up for studying the bible, then you can't do much better than getting the Oxford annotated bible (which is based on the NRSV).  That has all the footnotes pointing out translation choices and giving historic context to passages based on the current best biblical research.

What translation is this? What part of the religion (Maccabees, Mormons)? Is there Ge'ez portions (46 book in OT!)? How about the dead sea scrolls?I think, if it takes off with some of the probing from here, then adding in a harder mode with larger apocrypha or duterocanonical texts would be great. Maybe make a section where you can select the translation and sect you want to learn about.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

If you were hoping to see a grand spectacle, we hate to tell you, but there weren't really any surprises at CES 2026. Pretty much everything that Gizmodo expected to see—mainly AI shoved into every gadget imaginable, for better or worse—was on exhibit in Las Vegas.

While it was impossible for us to meet with the more than 4,500 exhibitors that attended the massive tech event this year, we did get to see our fair share of useful, delightful, and outright bizarre gadgets. Was there a breakout product that was the talk of CES 2026? Not really. That might have made the show floor vibes feel a bit mid, but there was still tons of hardware that got us excited for the year ahead.

Where else but CES can you see giant wireless TVs that are nearly as thin as a phone, gaming laptops with screens that roll out horizontally, endless amounts of smart glasses of every shape and size, holographic AI waifus, robot vacuums with legs that can climb stairs, humanoid robots doing kung fu and imitating TikTok dance videos, and robotaxis?

After a week of crawling the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center, hotel ballrooms, and suites in search of the very best and most innovative devices, we're recognizing the following as winners in Gizmodo's Best of CES 2026 Awards. Cue the digital hand claps. After checking out hundreds—maybe even thousands—of products over these past few days, these gadgets truly did steal the show.

Open wireless earbuds are great, but if there's one thing people miss when they wear them, it's noise cancellation. Shokz may be here to save the day, though. Its OpenFit Pro have a “noise reduction” feature that cancels out environmental noise when you want it and lets your ears breathe when you don't. To top it all off, they're comfy, they look nice, and the battery life is sturdy on paper.

Fender is officially in the over-ear headphones game and its first entrant has a lot to love. This pair of headphones is modular, allowing you to swap ear cups and headbands and pull the speakers off. It also comes with a USB-C dongle for lossless streaming. On top of all that they sound pretty darn good.


        IKEA Kallsup
      

The Kallsup sounds way better, and is far more adorable, than it feels like it should be for just $10. You can connect and synchronize up to 100 of them. That's not new in the Bluetooth speaker world, but it's the first time we've ever felt like we could almost afford to buy enough of them to try it out.

Crowning a best TV at CES is always hard. How do you choose between so many beautiful and bright flatscreens? However, LG's OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV had our jaws on the floor for longer than we'd have liked. It's only 9mm thick (barely thicker than most flagship smartphones) and is wireless—yes, you can beam 4K video and audio to it from 33 feet away without an unsightly HDMI cable hanging out the backside. 


        Govee Ceiling Light Ultra
      

Govee's new ceiling light lets you put pretty pictures on your ceiling, though it offers more detail than other similar products made by the company, like its Curtain Lights. That's thanks to its array of 616 LEDs, which give it enough granularity to make images visible even under the bright lights on the CES show floor. Also, it's Matter-compatible, so any old smart home platform will do.

There was a quite a bit of smart bird feeder competition at this year's CES, and the Birdfy  Feeder Vista with its 360 camera bird feeder stood on top of all of them.

CES 2026 was filled with more big and high-refresh-rate gaming monitors than we could lay our eyeballs on. However, LG's monstrous 52-inch UltraGear evo G9 52G930B easily stood out with its extra-wide 12:9 aspect ratio, bonkers-sharp 5K2K resolution, and more-than-fast-enough 240Hz refresh rate for competitive gaming.

        GameSir Swift Drive
      

This controller is built for racing and racing only. Still, even if you don't play many racing games, the GameSir Swift Drive feels excellent with the force feedback in its built-in steering wheel. It may be the best alternative for a full-sized, expensive racing yoke.

        Cerence AI
      

Everyone wants us to chat with our cars, but the AI assistants can't keep up. That's where Cerence AI shines. The company's newest Cerence xUI platform is integrated with Microsoft 365 and works with several music, mapping, and other car applications. In a demo, we confirmed that speaking naturally and colloquially doesn't trip up the system. None of this is surprising, Cerence AI has offered car voice control on its platform since at least 2019, well before it was popular.


        Sony Honda Afeela 1
      

Screens are everywhere in cars, but at least the Sony Honda Mobility's Afeela 1 connected EV makes good use of them on its touchscreen dashboard. The Afeela 1 features a panoramic screen that's actually two screens side by side, a smaller 12.3-inch screen and a massive 28.5-inch screen. The long, narrow dashboard upfront houses the many apps for movies, games, and music that passengers can enjoy. Passenger-side apps include a privacy filter to avoid causing distractions for the driver. Back seat passengers can also get in on the Sony-enabled fun with PlayStation Remote Play, which connects wirelessly to the back screens.

        Waymo
      

Waymo is the only Level 4 driverless car company that is actually operating in many cities, completing 14 million trips with its Jaguar I-Pace robotaxi service in 2025. Its new sensor-filled Zeekr minivan, dubbed the Ojai, will soon hit the streets, too. While many others at CES want to someday reach that level of autonomy, none of them are there yet. Waymo is the clear winner of this race, and it's an open question whether another company can catch up to it anytime soon.


        Handy 2 Pro
      

Handy's latest male stroker is ludicrous enough on its own, until you learn you can configure it to hit 1,200 strokes per minute. The Handy 2 Pro also sports a larger battery and multiple new attachments.

If you had “holographic anime girlfriends” on your CES 2026 bingo card, congratulations; you are both unhinged and correct. I personally did not see this trend coming, but after walking the show floor and getting briefed by Razer on its waifu-coded Project Ava, the proof is in the pudding—and the pudding this year is otaku-flavored.

As I mentioned, the splashiest of the waifu holograms comes courtesy of Razer, which ported its AI gaming assistant into a desktop hologram. I got a chance to see and interact with the newly anime-ified Project Ava myself, and it's, uh… interesting. The holographic chamber comes with a camera, which allows you to interact with your waifu avatar, and, in turn, it can lay “eyes” upon you and bestow you with AI-generated style tips. To be clear, there are other avatars you can choose to populate the Project Ava chamber, but Kira, the waifu one, feels like the star of the show.

So, that's it, right? Thus concludes the CES list of holographic AI girlfriends? Wrong. So wrong. There's one from a company called Dipal, for example, that is a lot like Proejct Ava, but not at all geared toward gaming. I reluctantly stepped into a booth and chatted with “Pearl,” the AI companion trapped inside Dipal's holographic chamber, and, yup, it's a waifu hologram, alright.

We talked about anime, sports, her name… then anime again. Pearl was super into everything that I was into—what a perfect match. Loves, One-Punch Man. I think we're going to get married! Hopefully that's not paywalled by some kind of monthly subscription or something (tear drop anime face).

But that's it, no more waifu hologra—just kidding! There are waifu holograms everywhere I looked. The marketing department for this one, called Lepro Ami, takes the weirdness of virtual companionship even further by calling the gadget your “AI soulmate.” I didn't get a chance to see or try Lepro Ami myself, but I'll give you one guess what some of the avatars look like. I'll wait.

On one hand, I'm caught off guard by the number of options for holographic anime girlfriends, but it also makes a lot of sense. AI-powered chatbots are more pervasive than ever, and they're getting crammed into pretty much any gadget that can accommodate one. And if there's one thing they're kind of good at, it's being mindless sycophants, which I guess is exactly what quite a few companies think you need in a virtual companion.

So, here we are. Mark this one down, folks. This is the year of the waifu hologram.

A dose of the gym might do wonders for both an ailing body and mind. A report out today finds that exercise can provide similar benefits for depression as other widely used treatments.

Scientists in the UK reviewed the medical literature on exercise and depression, examining dozens of clinical trials. They found convincing evidence that exercise can reduce depression symptoms, at least in the short term, as well as evidence that its effects match that of therapy or antidepressants. Though more research is needed to fully quantify these benefits, exercise should be considered part of the toolbox used to help treat depression, the researchers say.

“Exercise provides an option for people experiencing depressive symptoms, along with pharmacological treatments or psychological therapies,” lead study author Andrew Clegg, a professor at the University of Lancashire, told Gizmodo.

Clegg and his team's study was conducted on behalf of the Cochrane Library, a British-based research organization known for its comprehensive reviews of clinical trial data related to important public health topics.

They examined 73 randomized trials that collectively involved almost 5,000 adults with depression. Fifty-seven trials directly compared exercise to either no treatment or a control; ten trials compared exercise to therapy, and five compared exercise to antidepressants.

All in all, Clegg's team determined that exercise is reliably better at reducing depression compared to no treatment, though this reduction is likely modest on average. That said, the long-term benefits of exercise for depression are less clear.

This Is How Long Your Walks Should Be to Keep You Healthiest, Study Finds

They also concluded there is “probably little to no difference in depressive symptoms” among people who regularly exercise compared to people taking therapy. The same seems to be true when comparing exercise to antidepressants, but the evidence there is less certain.

The team's findings also suggest that light or moderate intensity exercise might be more effective for depression than vigorous exercise. And though no single form of exercise seemed to be substantially better than others, a mixed exercise program or resistance training might be better than aerobic exercise alone, according to the researchers.

The Cochrane review is the latest research to indicate that exercise can reduce depression symptoms at least as well as other conventional treatments. But the authors say there are still important aspects that could be understood better with larger, higher-quality randomized trials.

Outdoor Exercise Might Be Better Than Hitting the Gym—at Least for Your Brain

“If additional research were to be funded, it should consider which type of exercise is most effective in the long-term, how much exercise should be undertaken and for how long. Also, to look at who benefits from exercise, as it may benefit some people but not others,” explained Clegg.

Exercise is undoubtedly one of the best things you can do for your overall health, however, and it's likely to come with few side effects (the review noted that reported “adverse events” from exercise were uncommon). Some research has also suggested that combining exercise with other interventions like therapy can be even more effective than either alone.

People dealing with depression should ultimately be encouraged to pursue the treatments they're most comfortable with, Clegg says. But that list of options can certainly seem to include exercise.

Depending on how “hardcore” you want to be, an entire apparatus for a full-fledged gaming racing wheel and pedals is a must for any racing aficionado. Nothing will come close to a simulationist setup, but GameSir may have the answer to make racing with a controller feel far more tactile and, dare I say it, more enjoyable.

The GameSir Swift Drive, announced during CES 2026, is a surprisingly complete controller by itself. You've likely already noticed the giant steering wheel stuck into the center of the controller. When I first wrapped my hands around it, I expected to thumb a loose-feeling circle laid awkwardly in the middle of the device. In reality, the wheel hums with force feedback you usually get with high-end racing wheels. When a car rolls over gravel or rocky terrain, you'll feel the push and pull of the wheel under your thumbs. That's due to the miniaturized drive motor and an additional three haptic motors to offer a visceral feel. No, you won't be tricked into imagining you're driving a real Ferrari at 200 mph. It's simply a more enjoyable way to take your digital car out for a drive.

I spoke with GameSir's CEO and the controller's lead designer, Betta Core. He told me his initial concept for the device came from his youth as a racing game player. He said he wished he could have a full-feedback racing device without the massive haul of simulationist controls you need to get there.

For the sake of that feel, the controller has to make a few sacrifices. Chief amongst those is the right thumbstick. Instead of the usual flat lily pad for your thumb, there's a right nub you'll use for checking your six o'clock when in a car's cockpit. The stick and nub are both Hall effect to reduce the chance of stick drift, but you won't use this controller for anything but racing.

The controller won't be available until the second half of this year. The initial iteration of the design still needs a few tweaks and finishing touches. Core told me he and his team had only finished the prototype shortly before coming to CES. As for price, the designer told me GameSir was targeting a price of somewhere north of $200.

Even if you're not a racing fan, I can imagine this controller would make dodging cops in Grand Theft Auto VI feel extra visceral. We'll know how well both the controller and game perform when they (hopefully) launch later this year.

Alphabet's market capitalization was $3.88 trillion at the close of trading on Wednesday—just a tiny bit higher than Apple's $3.84 trillion. According to CNBC, it was the first time this happened since 2019.These companies were not in a steel cage with one another. Wall Street trading is not like dropping coins in a pair of coffee shop tip jars labeled “Chappell Roan” and “Taylor Swift.” Nonetheless, the timing makes it hard not to ignore the symbolic power of this milestone. After all, Apple is in the middle of a predictable stretch—on the verge of, well, releasing a lot of iPhones, including, reportedly, a long-awaited foldable iPhone that, if the newly leaked information is accurate, meets or slightly exceeds years of hype. Looking for surprises from Apple? 2026 may not be your year. But may I interest you in Apple's updated smart home hub called a HomePad, or perhaps the AirTag 2?Meanwhile, what has Alphabet been up to lately? For what it's worth, unexpectedly body slamming OpenAI in the frontier AI model race. And on the transportation side, Alphabet earned a whole lot of press by filling San Francisco with disabled Waymo robotaxis. Hey, no publicity is bad publicity. I don't mean to create a dichotomy where Apple sounds wholesome and Alphabet/Google sounds scary—tech companies this size are all scary from a certain perspective. But this is a business environment where Apple, the company famous for making familiar physical objects that people exchange money for (often too much money) feels like more of an underdog than Google, the company famous—currently—for investing in speculative and risky new tech that the public, broadly speaking, isn't stoked about.

It's no surprise to see investors favoring the latter over the former, but it's also not comforting.

A medical issue affecting a Crew-11 astronaut aboard the International Space Station (ISS) has forced the agency to postpone Thursday's spacewalk indefinitely and consider bringing the crew home early.

In a statement issued Wednesday, NASA said the agency is monitoring a health concern affecting a member of Crew-11 that arose Wednesday afternoon aboard the orbital laboratory. An emailed update to Space.com received early Thursday morning stated that NASA is “actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11's mission.” The agency has not disclosed what the health issue is nor which crew member is affected out of respect for their medical privacy.

“These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely,” the statement to Space.com reportedly reads. “We will provide further updates within the next 24 hours.”

Crew-11, which consists of space station commander Mike Fincke (58), flight engineer Zena Cardman (38), Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui (55), and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov (39), launched to the ISS aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on August 1. The four astronauts are in the final weeks of their mission, scheduled to return to Earth in mid-February. As of now, that's still the official plan.

NASA has never returned an astronaut from the ISS early due to a medical issue, but the agency is always prepared for the unlikely event it needs to do so. In this case, bringing Crew-11 home early would be relatively straightforward, as their Crew Dragon spacecraft is still docked to the ISS.

All four of the crew members would board the Dragon capsule and likely head for reentry and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, as they would have in February. A SpaceX recovery vessel based in Southern California would then retrieve the spacecraft and crew.

Crew-11's early departure would not leave the ISS uncrewed. NASA astronaut Chris Williams and two Russian cosmonauts—Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergey Mikayev—who launched to the space station in November aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft would remain on the space station.

It is unusual for NASA to postpone a spacewalk due to a medical issue, but they have previously been pushed back due to minor concerns, such as a pinched nerve or spacesuit discomfort.

NASA's Fincke and Cardman were supposed to emerge from the space station's Quest airlock at approximately 8 a.m. ET on Thursday. It would have been Cadman's first spacewalk and Fincke's 10th, tying him with Peggy Whitson for the most spacewalks by a NASA astronaut.

Their primary task was to prepare the 2A power channel for future installation of a roll-out solar array. This array will provide additional power to support the last few years of operation and, ultimately, the lab's deorbit. Cardman and Fincke would have also installed jumper cables, photographed station hardware, and swabbed the exterior of the ISS to collect potential microorganism samples, according to NASA.

Another spacewalk is scheduled for 7:20 a.m. ET on Thursday, January 15, sending another pair of NASA astronauts outside the space station to replace a high-definition camera, install a new docking aid for visiting spacecraft, and relocate several cooling hoses. The names of the participating astronauts were supposed to be announced after the January 8 spacewalk. It's currently unclear whether this medical issue will force NASA to postpone the January 15 EVA.

Tom's Hardware sat down with AMD's SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Nevada, to get AMD's response surrounding Intel's new speedy Panther Lake mobile CPUs. Tikoo revealed that AMD is not afraid of Intel's new chips, claiming its lineup of high-performance Ryzen AI Max (Strix Halo) APUs and mainstream Ryzen AI series chips fulfill the market's needs more effectively.Tikoo said that Intel's Panther Lake competition isn't anything for AMD to worry about. ""Strix Halo, or Ryzen AI Max will kill it. [...] It's not even a fair fight at that point, because it's discrete-level graphics."" the exec remarked. He said that AMD is in the most optimal position possible in the market, and that the company is meeting market demands better by providing two distinctly different lines of chips that provide very specific performance requirements for the demands of power users/prosumers and mainstream consumers. ""...And then, our strategy, okay, Strix Halo [and] Ryzen AI Max competes against that (Panther Lake 12 Xe), and it's better than that in terms of graphics performance, all of that. And then, for the mainstream of the market, that don't value that much graphics [power], because honestly, most of the people that are using Notebooks, that are outside of the creator or gaming spaces are, you know, they don't need that graphics performance.""Tikoo clarified that he believes shoppers will make decisions based on their needs, rather than looking for a chip that can do a little bit of everything. ""...So, like, people make choices, right? When they go into this space, they're like, Okay, here's the applications I'm using... or here's the gaming I'm doing.""The AMD lead also didn't miss the chance to jab Intel a bit, noting how Intel did not add any Strix Halo APU models into its benchmark comparisons — limiting its benchmarking runs strictly to its lower-end Ryzen AI series chip and its own previous-generation chips.""There's a reason why they didn't compare it right there. [...] they compared their highest-end to our midpoint."" He also subtly exposed that Intel's pricing for Panther Lake won't be pretty: ""And, oh, by the way, that 12 Xe [Panther Lake]... Wait until you see the price point on that. It's gonna be, you know. Enough said."" Panther Lake is Intel's latest and most powerful mobile CPU platform to date, built on its new 18A process node, with high-performance Cougar Cove P-cores, Darkmount E-cores, and Intel's highly potent Xe3 integrated graphics engine. The flagship Core Ultra X9 388H comes with 16 cores in total (four P-cores, eight E-cores, and four LP-cores), 18MB of L3 cache, Arc B390 iGPU with 12 Xe cores, and support for up to 96GB of LPDDR5x-9600 memory.Intel's slides claim that the X9 388H packs 10% more performance for the same power as the previous-gen Arrow Lake-H Ultra 9 285H, and 60% more performance in the same metric as Intel's Lunar Lake Ultra 9 288V. Intel claims the Arc B390-equipped X9 388H is 77% faster on average than the Ultra 9 288V in gaming tests. Intel's new Xe3 iGPU flagship is so fast, in fact, that Intel claims the X9 388H gets roughly similar performance to an Nvidia RTX 4050 laptop GPU in most games at a 60W sustained power envelope, with the X9 388H operating at just 45W sustained.If you want a better perspective, Intel's Xe3 B390 iGPU was able to pull off 80 FPS in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p high settings with XeSS set to Balanced mode in our hands-on testing.

A major Japanese PC and electronics store is pleading with customers to sell their old PC gear. “As a favor, if you buy a new one, please sell your gaming PC to our company,” begged the X-account of Sofmap Gaming in Akihabara, the Electric Town district of Tokyo (machine translation, h/t PC-Watch). The store shared a photo of some almost barren shelves, presumably taken at its triple-floor retail establishment.

ゲーミングPC、中古も本当に在庫なくて今これあの、お願いなので買い替えたらぜひ弊社にゲーミングPCを売ってください...結構高く買い取っていますので...ゲーミングのデスクでもノートでも、もちろんゲーミングじゃない普通のでもPCなら大体買い取っているので... pic.twitter.com/IinBuGgRV7January 7, 2026

“Gaming PCs, even used ones, are really out of stock right now,” wrote Sofmap, as an explanation for its call for old rigs. In the above Tweet, it asks customers to come in and sell their old PCs, highlighting that “We buy them back at pretty high prices...”

Moreover, the company underlined that it wasn't going to be fussy. “Whether it's a gaming desktop or a laptop, or even a regular non-gaming one, we pretty much buy any PC...”

These are clearly the words of a PC retailer facing consumer demand that it just can't meet. We reported on Akihabara store trying to limit new RAM, SSD, and HDD sales back in November.

The memory supply crunch impacted the PC industry faster and more deeply than many would have predicted. The insatiable demand for memory from AI data center makers, with their deep circular-funded pockets, caused the first pricing jolts in the PC memory market. That's reasonable, as consumers and industry both need to be fed product from the same big-three memory makers.

Consumers saw the first impacts on modern DDR5 pricing. Some DDR5 kits, if you can find them in stock, like this Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-5200 16GB (2x8GB) on Amazon is now $235. That price is more than 3.5X what it cost last October ($66).

However, there remains some hope that DDR4 pricing and availability, thanks to old stocks and upgraders already having DIMMs, could provide a safe haven for continued PC building. This perception even seems to permeate PC component makers, with more DDR4-supporting motherboards being manufactured, plus hints about new processors for DDR4 platforms.

However, we are continuing to feel RAM crunch aftershocks. Prices of pre-built PCs were the next market affected. Graphics cards with more generous VRAM quotas are also strongly rumored to be facing constraints. We should at least expect a price rise for GPU-restocks, with next-gen GPUs rumored to be delayed…

Now, underlined by this Japan retail report, it even seems like stocks of old used PCs are being snapped up by consumers.

 




Of course, some old PCs are too old for retailers like Sofmap, even during today's PC drought. We'd expect retailers that dabble in used PCs for non-enthusiast users to limit their purchases to DDR4 platforms, with hardware support that slots above the Windows 11 minimum requirements (Intel 8th Gen, AMD Ryzen 2000).

There's an entirely different market for really old PCs, though. Vintage computers of certain eras have been increasingly pricey for quite a long time now. I was in Japan this time last year and astonished by the bountiful supplies of old PCs at used electronics retailers like Hard-Off. Hopefully, these computing gems (see the above picture), many of which live in the awkward zone between vintage and modern, will remain plentiful and affordable for PC retro-fans and tinkerers alike.

Patriot just dropped a plethora of new memory modules and SSDs, as well as several storage solutions for mobile devices and gaming handhelds. Despite the ongoing DRAM and storage pricing squeeze, the Tom's Hardware team checked out Patriot's booth at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Nevada, to check out 15 new DDR5 RAM kits, as well as a DDR5 SODIMM with a maximum capacity of 48GB (1x48GB).

Out of all the displayed modules, the company's Viper Xtreme 5 Aurum stood out with its delightfully opulent, flashy exterior. The company said that it designed the color specifically to blend well with both light and dark builds, ensuring that it wouldn't stand out as either too bright or too dark. But, you might need to wear a pair of gloves to not litter it with pesky fingerprints. Patriot also showed off a prototype with the same eye-catching heat-spreader, running in a 2x24GB configuration, at speeds of up to 10,000 MT/s.

There are also four Viper-branded SSDs — the Viper VP4300 Lite PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD available in 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities, and the Viper PV563 PCIe 5.0 x4 SSD, which you can get in either 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB capacities. Additionally, the PV563 can be had with either a graphene strip or a full heatsink. Lastly, there's the top-of-the-line Viper PV593, offering up 14,000 and 13,000 MB/s sequential read and write speeds, plus a random read speed of up to 2,000K IOPS, Patriot claims. We have no word on how much the memory or storage might cost you; however, as pricing for both DRAM and NAND storage remain extremely volatile. An IDC report suggests that PC prices may jump as much as 8% as a result.

Aside from these PC components, it also released a wide range of USB flash drives and enclosures for those that need portable memory on the go. The company also introduced a Storage Hub designed for mobile devices. This plugs in to your gear via a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 connector, giving you one HDMI port capable of 4K@60Hz and a USB-C PD 3.0 port that accepts up to 100 watts of power. More importantly, it will give you extra storage options in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB capacities, allowing you to turn your phone or tablet into a proper productivity tool.

Nintendo Switch 2 owners are also getting another microSD Express option with the Patriot EP Express. This PCIe 3.0 x1 expansion card delivers sequential read and write speeds of up to 800 MB/s and 600 MB/s, allowing you to quickly load games directly from it. Aside from that, it also supports 4K and high-bitrate video recording, allowing you to use it with video recording and photography equipment as well, available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB capacities. The company also showed off a DDR5-10000 engineering sample with a 48GB (2x24GB) capacity. While this is still being tested, it gives us a glimpse of what Patriot has in store for us in the future. But you might want to start saving up now if you have your eye on any of the new products.

First-degree relatives of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) had nearly threefold higher odds of developing the condition than relatives of matched control individuals from the general population, with markedly higher odds among patients with early-onset PHPT. Although certain cancers were slightly overrepresented in relatives, the associations were weak.

“The results underscore the importance of family history, genetic screening, and counseling in selected patients with PHPT, particularly those diagnosed at or before age 40 years, to identify a potential hereditary form of the disease,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by David Thorsteinsson, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online in the Journal of the Endocrine Society.

The inclusion of only patients who underwent parathyroidectomy likely introduced detection bias and limited generalizability to the general PHPT population. Because coverage of tertiary care visits in the National Patient Register was incomplete before 2001, PHPT among relatives was probably underreported. Additionally, because PHPT diagnosis relies on laboratory testing and health-seeking behavior, which may run in families, this could have resulted in earlier detection and overrepresentation of malignancies among relatives of these patients.

The study was supported by Region Stockholm and the Karolinska Institutet. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

A 2-week course of auricular acupressure, a traditional therapy targeted at stimulating the central nervous system, in adults with functional dyspepsia and insomnia was associated with improved sleep and dyspepsia symptoms and was well tolerated with sustained benefits maintained over 8 weeks.

“These results suggest that [auricular acupressure] may be a safe and effective [treatment] for patients experiencing [functional dyspepsia] with insomnia,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Meng-Yuan Shen, MD, and Ze-Jiong Li, MS, both from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University in Hangzhou, China. It was published online in December 2025 in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.

Researchers did not use prokinetics or antidepressants; thus, any synergy with auricular acupressure remained unknown. Small subgroup sizes limited generalizability. All participants were Chinese, which may have introduced cultural or placebo bias and may have underestimated efficacy.

This study received support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Zhejiang Provincial Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine major project. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

The federal government wants Americans to eat more protein, specifically meat and whole-fat dairy products, putting them at the top of a new “upside-down” food pyramid, along with a message encouraging the consumption of “real food.”

Vegetables and fruits are also placed at the top of the pyramid, along with an expected emphasis on consuming saturated fats. The new 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans — stripped down to a lean 10 pages compared to the prior iteration's 164 pages — debuted at a White House press briefing on January 7.

“Protein and healthy fats are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines,” said Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, at the briefing. “We are ending the war on saturated fats.”

Added FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, MD, “For decades, we've been fed a corrupt food pyramid that has had a myopic focus on demonizing natural, healthy saturated fats, telling you not to eat eggs and steak and ignoring a giant blind spot: refined carbohydrates, added sugars, ultraprocessed food.”

The recommendation of keeping saturated fat to less than 10% of daily caloric intake was unchanged from the previous guidelines, even though the agency's own scientific analysis concluded there was no evidence that the 10% threshold had any impact on cardiovascular disease or mortality.

The guidelines, updated every 5 years, are widely relied upon by clinical organizations, policymakers, and the general public and are used to set standards for federal child and adult nutrition programs, such as school lunches, military meals, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

The new recommendations are a stark departure from the 2025 Scientific Report, which was supposed to provide foundation of the guidelines and had urged a move toward plant-based foods.

Kennedy took over the guideline writing process, labeling the previous work “corrupt.” He appointed a new group to craft recommendations. Most members of that panel had ties to the beef, dairy, and supplement industries.

The new guidelines urge Americans to avoid highly processed foods and added sugars and limit sodium intake to less than 2300 mg/d.

In a change, the guidelines suggest consuming “less alcohol.” The previous recommendation was to avoid alcohol or limit daily intake to one drink or less for women and two drinks or less for men.

“Alcohol is the social lubricant that brings people together,” said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz, MD, who claimed there was “never really good data” supporting daily limits. “I don't think you should drink alcohol, but it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize. And there's probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way,” he said.

Kennedy, Oz, and Makary said the new guidelines would help reduce chronic disease and save the federal government — and individual Americans — millions of dollars.

“The best way to reduce drug spend in America is to not need the drugs in the first place,” said Oz.

“We are going to finally address the root causes of our broken health care system — insulin-resistance and general body inflammation — advanced by the protein-poor, micronutrient-poor, ultraprocessed, refined carbohydrate diet that kids are addicted to,” said Makary.

Kennedy thanked the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for working with HHS on the guidelines.

In a statement, AMA President Bobby Mukkamala, MD, said the organization applauded the recommendations to avoid highly processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages and limit sodium. The “guidelines affirm that food is medicine,” he said. The AMA has committed to improving “clinical competency,” educating physicians, and working with Congress “to enact meaningful, lasting nutrition change that can improve lives.”

AAP President Andrew Racine, MD, PhD, said in a statement that the guidelines “are an opportunity to clearly explain to parents what a healthy diet for their children should look like: rich in whole, nutrient-dense foods and low in added sugars and refined carbohydrates.” Racine said AAP commended the “inclusion of the Academy's evidence-based policy related to breastfeeding, introduction of solid foods, caffeine avoidance, and limits on added sugars.”

But Racine also said the reality for many Americans is that “access to nutritious food is often unavailable or unaffordable and highly processed foods fill the void.”

The American Heart Association (AHA) welcomed the emphasis on increasing vegetable, fruit, and whole-grain consumption while limiting added sugars, refined grains, and highly processed foods.

But the organization, which recommends a daily caloric intake of less than 6% from saturated fat, expressed concern about the emphasis on red meat. Salt and saturated fats “are primary drivers of cardiovascular disease,” said the AHA in a statement. It also said that while protein is essential, “we urge more scientific research on both the appropriate amount of protein consumption and the best protein sources for optimal health.”

Until there is more evidence, “we encourage consumers to prioritize plant-based proteins, seafood, and lean meats and to limit high-fat animal products, including red meat, butter, lard, and tallow, which are linked to increased cardiovascular risk.”

In a statement, American College of Cardiology President Christopher M. Kramer, MD, said, “We welcome the inclusion of several important science-based recommendations, including a focus on eating whole fruits and vegetables, limiting added sugars, highly processed foods, saturated fats, and sugary drinks.”“We are closely reviewing the recommendations and encourage clinicians to discuss practical, culturally appropriate healthy eating options with their patients,” Kramer added.

Among nearly 1000 patients with breast cancer, 76% reported encountering misinformation about breast cancer. Despite the pervasiveness, exposure to misinformation did not appear to increase patients' fear of recurrence or affect treatment adherence, a recent survey found.

“We found no correlation between awareness of misinformation and cancer recurrence fears or treatment adherence,” possibly because patients don't internalize all the misinformation or have competing beliefs about health and medicine that influence behavior more, the study authors explained. But given the rise in cancer misinformation, “strong survivorship education and communication is vital.”

The study, led by David Gibbes Miller, MD, and Kaitlyn Lapen, MD, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, was published online in JAMA Network Open.

The study's recruitment through Breastcancer.org may not reflect individuals with less access to or interest in online communities. While the survey assessed exposure to misinformation, it did not evaluate information sources, participant beliefs, or intentions to act on misinformation. Unmeasured confounding factors, including health literacy, digital information health-seeking behaviors, and baseline anxiety levels, could have influenced the findings. Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form scores were only available for 70% of participants, potentially limiting the ability to identify associations between misinformation exposure and fear of recurrence.

Edward Christopher Dee, MD, disclosed receiving grant funding from the Prostate Cancer Foundation Young Investigator Award during the study. Junzo P. Chino, MD, reported consulting fees from Merck, Teleflex, and Stryker, along with personal fees for data and safety monitoring board work from Kortuc LLC and LadeRx LLC. Fumiko Chino, MD, disclosed receiving grants from Merck and advisory board work from AJMC. The study was supported through the Cancer Center Support Grant from the National Cancer Institute. The funder had no role in the design, conduct, analysis, or publication decisions of the study.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended eight digital platforms for people with asthma to use on phones or tablets to help manage their condition.

The move follows warnings that preventable asthma deaths continue to rise and that routine care remains substantially inadequate.

Each platform includes a personalised digital asthma action plan, setting out what to do when symptoms change. Features include symptom and medication trackers, reminders on inhaler use, and educational content such as videos explaining inhaler technique.

In draft guidance, NICE said that the tools could be used in the NHS while further evidence is collected over the next 3 years. It stressed that the apps and online tools are intended to complement regular healthcare appointments, not replace them.

The technologies aim to help people manage their asthma more confidently by keeping action plans accessible, supporting correct inhaler use, and improving medication adherence.

Early evidence suggests improvements in asthma control scores, fewer hospital visits, and more effective use of medication. Users reported that the tools were easy to use and helped build confidence in managing their condition.

Different versions are available for adults, children and young people, parents, and carers. Some platforms allow information sharing with GPs or nurses.

Asthma affects about 5.4 million people in the UK — around 1 in 12 adults and 1 in 11 children. It accounts for 2%-3% of primary care consultations.

Each year, poorly controlled asthma leads to about 60,000 hospital admissions in England, using around 200,000 bed-days. 

The UK's asthma death rate is among the worst in Europe and continues to rise. More than 1400 people died from asthma in 2022, up from 1151 in 2010. An estimated two thirds of asthma deaths over the past decade were preventable.

Key risk factors include poorly controlled asthma, shown by overuse of reliever inhalers and underuse of preventer inhalers.

British asthma care is ""at a standstill,"" according to a 2024 report by Asthma + Lung UK, which has called for the NHS to adopt digital solutions for more than a decade. 

Its 2024 survey found that 69% of patients were still not receiving basic recommended asthma care. About 31% relied heavily on reliever inhalers, while 82% did not receive a recommended appointment with a GP or asthma nurse within 48 hours of an emergency admission.

A University of Birmingham review published in 2024 showed that 40% of patients had no follow-up within 28 days of discharge. 

Postdischarge care was also poor. Only 13.2% received an asthma review, 8.4% were given an asthma management plan, 57.3% received asthma medication, and 8.6% were shown correct inhaler technique. Just 1.2% of patients who smoked received smoking cessation counselling.

Patients from Black ethnic minority groups received lower levels of care, and care varied widely between regions. 

Dr Anastasia Chalkidou, HealthTech programme director at NICE, said: ""We know that people from deprived areas are three times more likely to have asthma, and experience worse outcomes.""

She said digital tools could help address these inequalities by offering personalised support in formats that work for more people and empower patients to take a more active role in managing their condition.

NICE's independent committee concluded that digital technologies showed ""real promise in helping people better manage their asthma,” Chalkidou said. Earlier access to these innovations could drive ""transformational care"" more quickly while ensuring value for the NHS.

The eight recommended digital technologies are Asthmahub, Asthmahub for Parents, AsthmaTuner, Digital Health Passport, Luscii, myAsthma, RDMP (Respiratory Disease Management Platform), and Smart Asthma.

After the 3-year evidence generation period, NICE will review the data to decide whether to recommend routine NHS use.

NICE said that four other technologies — EasyOne Connect, GoSpiro, LungHealth, and MIR Spiro — require further research before they can be recommended.

NICE has also published draft guidance on digital technologies that support spirometry diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

One technology, ArtiQ.Spiro, was recommended for use in GP surgeries and community diagnostic centres during an evidence generation period.

NICE said this could bring spirometry testing closer to patients' homes and allow less experienced staff to perform and interpret tests. This could help reduce the current testing backlog, increase access, and ease pressure on hospital services.

Both sets of draft guidance are open for consultation until 21 January 2026.

Weaker and fragmented circadian rest-activity rhythms (RARs) and later peak activity timing were associated with an increased risk for dementia in older adults, a new study showed.

Authors of an accompanying editorial noted that although “causality remains to be elucidated, this study suggests that RAR measures — particularly those reflecting rhythm strength, fragmentation, and timing — may serve as important prodromal markers of dementia and hold promise for early detection in older adults.”

They added that as wearable technology use continues to grow, “these findings highlight the potential of multidimensional RAR metrics as tools for personalized risk prediction and as targets for intervention.”

This study was led by Wendy Wang, PhD, UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. The editorial was led by Yi Fang, MD, University of California, San Francisco. Both articles were published online on December 29 in Neurology.

The study population consisted of older adults, which limited the generalizability of the findings to middle‑aged or younger populations. Dementia subtypes could not be distinguished because data on dementia etiology were not available. Additionally, the actigraphic-based results might not be directly comparable with previous studies.

The current research was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; and the National Institute on Aging. One investigator reported a number of various disclosures, which are fully listed in the original article. The other investigators and the editorialists reported no relevant financial relationships.

New research provides more evidence that dried blood samples collected from a simple finger prick can be used to measure key biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In a multicenter study of more than 300 participants, levels of p-tau217 in finger-prick samples closely matched results from standard blood tests, and they could identify AD-related changes in spinal fluid with an accuracy of 86%.

“These findings underscore the potential of dried blood collection and capillary blood as a minimally invasive, scalable approach for AD biomarker testing in research settings. Yet, further refinement of collection and analytical protocols is needed to fully translate this approach to be viable and useful as a clinical tool,” the investigators cautioned. 

For now, “what we have shown is that it's an extremely useful research tool, and we already have large scale research studies going on, but we don't envision this anytime soon to be a clinical test,” Nicholas Ashton, PhD, senior director of the Banner Fluid Biomarker Program, Banner Sun Health Research Institute in Sun City, Arizona, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online on January 5 in Nature Medicine. 

Blood biomarkers, p-tau217 in particular, have emerged as accurate tools for detecting AD pathology, offering a minimally invasive alternative to PET or lumbar puncture. Yet, standard blood testing still depends on venipuncture, controlled processing, and trained personnel, limiting scalability.

The DROP-AD project is evaluating whether AD biomarkers can be reliably measured from dried blood spot or dried plasma spot, derived from capillary blood obtained via finger prick, for detecting AD biomarkers, including p-tau217, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL).

The current study included 337 participants recruited across seven European centers, spanning cognitively normal individuals, patients with mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia, non-AD dementias, and individuals with Down syndrome. A total of 304 participants provided paired capillary dried plasma or blood spot samples, as well as venous plasma samples.

Levels of p-tau217 in the finger-prick samples closely matched results from standard venous blood samples (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.74; P < .001).

Dried plasma spot p-tau217 levels increased progressively across clinical disease stages and showed “good accuracy” in predicting CSF biomarker positivity, with an area under the curve of 0.864.

The investigators also successfully detected GFAP and NfL from dried blood and plasma spot analysis.

“Both GFAP and NfL showed high concordance between capillary and venous samples, and were similarly associated with cognitive performance and age, reinforcing the validity of these remote sampling methods,” the authors reported.

Notably, the study also demonstrated feasibility in individuals with Down syndrome, a population at high genetic risk for AD for whom venipuncture can be particularly challenging. 

In the subgroup with Down syndrome, capillary biomarker concentrations were higher in those with dementia than in asymptomatic individuals and showed strong agreement with venous plasma levels.

The study also found “high concordance” between supervised and unsupervised blood collections, suggesting that remote or home-based sampling may be feasible.

The findings build on earlier data from the DROP-AD project, as reported by Medscape Medical News.

“Despite the promise shown, we do not currently recommend the use of dried blood analysis for clinical use, decision-making, or patient management because of observed differences in analytical performance and diagnostic accuracy between capillary-derived and venous blood samples,” the authors cautioned.

Further methodological refinement, standardization, and validation in larger cohorts are required before this approach can be translated into routine clinical practice, they concluded.

Once that happens, Ashton said he could envision a “scenario in the future” where elderly asymptomatic individuals could be sent a dried blood spot card as a “first step in triage.”

“Especially if we get a readout next year, or even this year, that antiamyloid drugs are beneficial to people without symptoms because these individuals are not going to be walking into our clinics in primary care or specialty services because they don't have objective memory concerns,” Ashton said.

Having an at-home test could help engage asymptomatic people with positive biomarkers in early treatment, he added.

Reached for comment, Maria C. Carrillo, PhD, Alzheimer's Association chief science officer and medical affairs lead, said blood-based biomarkers are “reshaping how we identify, diagnose, and understand Alzheimer's disease, especially in research settings.”

“Currently, the evidence supports the use of blood biomarkers as one tool of many in a multi-phase diagnostic process in people experiencing changes in memory and thinking abilities. The science is not yet strong enough to recommend blood tests as a standalone diagnostic, nor for their use in people without symptoms,” Carrillo told Medscape Medical News.

The association's clinical practice guideline provides clear, evidence-based recommendations for when and how blood-based biomarker tests can be responsibly integrated into diagnostic workflows in specialty care, she noted.

Carrillo said the Alzheimer's Association “agrees with the authors that more research is needed before this [finger-prick] technique can become a suitable tool for clinicians.”

However, the finding that the biomarker results were very similar between the supervised and self-collected blood samples “shows that the idea has merit and is worth further investigation — in a variety of locations and situations, and with much larger and more representative populations — to help ensure that the test results are credible and consistent wherever they are done.”

Summing up, Carrillo said, “The approach described in this new paper points to a future where Alzheimer's biomarker testing is simple, minimally invasive, widely available, and potentially even self-administered.”

Patients diagnosed with cancer had a 53% increased risk of presenting to the hospital with major bleeding in the first year after a myocardial infarction (MI), and the risk persisted into the second year. Among all cancers, bladder cancer was associated with the highest risk.

“Balancing ischemic and bleeding risk is challenging in patients with cancer, as contemporary risk scores used are not validated in patients with cancer,” the researchers wrote.

“Characterizing bleeding risks based on different malignancies may allow for a more personalized assessment of risk, potentially enabling future optimization of antiplatelet strategies in patients with cancer, including a shorter duration of antiplatelet use,” they added.

The study was led by Kok Weng Ow of University of Leicester in Leicester, England. It was published online on December 30, 2025, in Heart.

The linked database lacked prescription data; thus, the study could not assess the effects of antiplatelet treatment effects. Data on the use of cancer therapies or follow-up tests around MI were not captured. Researchers may have included some patients with cancer outside the 1-year window in the comparison group.

The study received support from the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands, and Leicester NIHR Biomedical Research Centre. One author disclosed receiving funding as a NIHR Academic Clinical Fellow in cardiology. Several authors reported research support, consulting honoraria, royalties, patents, leadership roles, or other financial ties with public funders and industry including cardiovascular and pharmaceutical organizations.

Patients who underwent lower limb orthopedic surgery and received a single-shot femoral nerve block had an increased risk for falls during the early postoperative period.

“[A]longside the numerous potential benefits, certain forms of [peripheral nerve blocks] may also have detrimental effects,” the researchers reported. “A brief discussion of leg weakness alone, without a full disclosure of the potential repercussion of falling after” a single-shot femoral nerve block, is insufficient, they added.

The study was led by Matthew J. Billingham, of University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust in Coventry, England. It was published online on December 31, 2025, in the British Journal of Anaesthesia.

The sample size in individual trials was small, with most having fewer than 100 participants per group. The focus on the analgesic effects of single-shot femoral nerve block may have led to less thorough reporting of fall outcomes. The study faced challenges in assessing the experience level of those administering the single-shot femoral nerve block, which may affect the applicability of the findings.

This study did not receive any financial support. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Cell division is an essential process for all life on earth, yet the exact mechanisms by which cells divide during early embryonic development have remained elusive – particularly for egg-laying species. Scientists from the Brugués group at the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) at TUD Dresden University of Technology have revealed a novel mechanism that explains how early embryonic cells may divide without forming a complete contractile ring, traditionally seen as essential for this process. The findings, published in Nature, challenge the long-standing textbook view of cell division, revealing how parts of the cytoskeleton, and material properties of the cell interior (or cytoplasm) cooperate to drive division through a 'ratchet' mechanism.

In most species, cells divide by forming a contractile ring from a structural protein known as actin at the cell equator. This ring contracts like a purse-string, pinching the cell's contents to result in two new cells. Although the 'purse-string' model of cell division is observed in many organisms, this is not the case for species with very large embryonic cells such as sharks, platypus, birds and reptiles. In these cases, the actin ring cannot fully close due to the cell's immense size and large yolk sac. How exactly cell division takes place in these organisms remained an open question in the field, until now.

""With such a large yolk in the embryonic cell, there is a geometric constraint. How does a contractile band, with loose ends, remain stable and generate enough force to divide these huge cells?"" asked Alison Kickuth, a recently graduated PhD student from the Brugués group at the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) and lead author of the study. Their experiments, published in a seminal new study in Nature, have found an answer to this question.

The scientists studied zebrafish embryos, which divide rapidly and share the characteristic of having large, yolk-filled cells during early development. By precisely cutting the actin band with a laser, Alison observed that the band continued to ingress despite being severed, suggesting that anchoring points were distributed along the band, rather than at the ends. In addition, it seemed that microtubules, another essential part of the cytoskeleton, appeared to bend and splay in response to the laser cuts, and had a critical role in stabilizing the band during contraction.

To clarify the role of microtubules in this process, the authors disrupted them in two separate experiments: by chemically inducing depolymerization (effectively stopping new microtubules from forming), and by physically disrupting them using an obstacle, in the form of a microscopic oil droplet. Without microtubules, the actin band collapsed, proving that microtubules are essential for holding the band in place, and provided both mechanical support and signaling during its formation.

Changes in the cytoskeleton are known to happen in other species as cell cycles progress. Importantly, the cell cycle is separated into distinct phases of activity; a mitotic phase (M-phase) where the DNA is divided, and an interphase, where a typical cell grows and replicates its DNA. After DNA has been divided, large structures made of microtubules called asters grow to span the entire cytoplasm. These asters are essential during interphase for deciding where the actin band will form and start contracting, marking the future cleavage plane.

Given that microtubules are known to stiffen the cytoplasm in various cellular contexts, the authors sought to explore if asters would contribute to stiffening to help anchor the actin band. To investigate, the authors employed magnetic beads and observed their displacement under magnetic forces. These experiments allowed the scientists to measure changes in cytoplasmic stiffness during cell cycle stages.

They found that the cytoplasm becomes stiffer during interphase, acting as a scaffold to stabilize the actin band. In turn, it becomes more fluid during M-phase, allowing the band's ingression between the two future cells. These dynamic changes in stiffening and fluidization play a key role in the division process.

Only one question remained: How did the band remain stable throughout M-phase despite the cytoplasm becoming more fluid-like? By imaging the ends of the actin band over time, the team observed that although the band is unstable during M-phase while contracting, it did not collapse fully. Instead, this retraction is ""rescued"" due to the fast cell cycles in these early stages. In the following interphase when the cytoplasm stiffens again due to the asters reappearing, the band becomes re-stabilized. Then, the actin band continued ingressing during the next fluid-phase.

These cycles of instability during M-phase and stabilization during interphase repeated over several cell cycles until division was complete. This alternating pattern acts like a 'mechanical ratchet', driving cell division without needing a fully-formed contractile ring. In this case, division is possible through the alternating material properties of the cytoplasm, and takes place over multiple cell cycles instead of just one.

""The temporal ratchet mechanism fundamentally alters our view of how cytokinesis works"", emphasized Jan Brugués, corresponding author of the study. This finding provided an effective solution for early cell divisions in cells that were too large for conventional cell division, and have rapid cell cycles.

Zebrafish are a fascinating case, as cytoplasmic division in their embryonic cells is inherently unstable. To overcome this instability, their cells divide rapidly, allowing ingression of the band over several cell cycles by alternating between stability and fluidization until division is complete.""

Alison Kickuth, Technische Universität Dresden

This discovery represents a novel paradigm for understanding cell division in large embryonic cells and may apply broadly across species with yolk-rich embryos. Additionally, this study highlights temporal control of material properties in the cytoplasm as an important contributor to cellular processes, a role that may be expanded in future studies. Understanding these mechanisms will open new perspectives for studying development in different species.

The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT), the leading professional organization for the advancement of cell and gene therapies (CGTs), and the Orphan Therapeutics Accelerator (OTXL), a non-profit biotech focused on completing development and enabling access to stalled rare disease treatments, today announced a partnership to establish CGTxchange, a jointly owned entity that will serve as a clearinghouse and marketplace for deprioritized CGTs.

The new joint venture will address a growing and urgent challenge facing the CGT field: policy and economic shifts in recent years have led biopharma sponsors to halt development of hundreds of CGTs no longer considered commercially viable by traditional industry standards, including many that delivered clear benefits to patients in trials.

CGTxchange leverages the combined capabilities of the organizations in an unprecedented way to engage a broad array of potential partners and funders to efficiently identify, evaluate, finance, develop, and provide sustainable, reliable, and scalable access to potentially transformative CGTs for ultra-rare diseases.

At ASGCT, we have observed that a host of cell and gene therapies are being set aside not because they lack clinical merit, but rather due to the challenges of commercializing these therapies once approved. In partnership with OTXL, we are creating an entirely new way to ensure these CGTs find their way to organizations – whether companies, non-profits or academic institutions – that are ready to take on the challenges of development and commercialization so patients may ultimately benefit.""

David Barrett, CEO of ASGCT

Using OTXL's AI-based platform, CGT assets and related information can be input into a secure, searchable database and analyzed, generating listings and profiles of shelved therapies and providing risk-based assessments. From there, listed assets can be matched with prospective investors or partners in the marketplace, thereby expanding the potential to secure funding and new clinical sponsors.

""Typical venture capital and biopharma expectations for returns are set well above what most CGTs for ultra-rare diseases can meet in light of recent policy and market shifts,"" said Craig Martin, CEO of OTXL. ""Yet many of these shelved therapies can still offer meaningful returns to the right partners, as well as tremendous benefits to patients. This partnership allows us to surface high-quality, clinical-stage CGT programs to investors and organizations whose missions, timelines and objectives align with what these therapies can deliver.""

Within the partnership, ASGCT will convene and engage its extensive network of CGT leaders, experts, donors and investors, while helping establish CGTxchange as the leading solution for currently 'pre-viable' CGT programs. OTXL will develop the platform for the clearinghouse and marketplace, contributing resources from its AI-based infrastructure and partner network to continue to build, adapt and scale the platform for CGT community adoption and use.

ASGCT and OTXL will initiate development of CGTxchange in early 2026, with a targeted mid-year launch and rollout.

Despite the immense amount of genetic material present in each cell, around three billion base pairs in humans, this material needs to be accurately divided in two and allocated in equal quantities. The centromere, located in the middle of each chromosome, is known as the site where cellular equipment attaches to divide chromosomes successfully, but the specific mechanisms behind this remain unknown.

In a major new study reported in The EMBO Journal, researchers at The University of Osaka have identified an additional pathway by which the DNA-packaging histone CENP-A associates with and specifies the location of the centromere. This process is vital for ensuring chromosomes are structured and genes are expressed appropriately.

The study was based around the Holliday Junction Recognition Protein (HJURP), a so-called chaperone protein that ushers centromere-identifying cell components to the correct site on chromosomes. They found that HJURP did not localize at the centromere when the expression of both of two cell components, CENP-C and Mis18C, were eliminated following a double knockout process.

Although it was known that Mis18C recognizes the chaperone HJURP to enable CENP-A's deposition onto centromeres, we found that CENP-C can actually occupy Mis18C's role in this process, providing a parallel pathway that helps ensure successful and timely mitosis or meiosis. We also identified the particular residues of HJURP that enable its binding to CENP-C.""

Tatsuo Fukagawa, senior author

The team then built on these findings through analyses in DT40 chicken cells, confirming that these interactions are essential for centromere function during cell division. These analyses showed that when HJURP and CENP-C did not interact, this led to errors in mitosis, slowing cell growth. The combination of no interaction and the removal of Mis18C meant that CENP-A could not be incorporated into chromatin, preventing cellular machinery from knowing the supposed location of the centromere.

""Our work reveals that this sequence-independent epigenetic mechanism of centromere specification has greater diversity than previously thought,"" explains lead author, Tetsuya Hori. ""Given how biologically fundamental the processes of mitosis and meiosis are, our finding that the cell has independent pathways for flagging the location of each chromosome's centromere is valuable.""

The key findings of this work, regarding the existence of dual pathways for recruiting HJURP for CENP-A deposition, can provide a solid foundation for future studies on the mechanisms behind centromere functioning and on diseases involving errors of cell division.

Exercise may reduce symptoms of depression to a similar extent as psychological therapy, according to an updated Cochrane review. When compared with antidepressant medication, exercise also showed a similar effect, but the evidence was of low certainty. 

Depression is a leading cause of ill health and disability, affecting over 280 million people worldwide. Exercise is low-cost, widely available, and comes with additional health benefits, making it an attractive option for patients and healthcare providers. 

The review, conducted by researchers from the University of Lancashire, examined 73 randomized controlled trials including nearly 5,000 adults with depression. The studies compared exercise with no treatment or control interventions, as well as with psychological therapies and antidepressant medications. 

The results show that exercising can have a moderate benefit on reducing depressive symptoms, compared with no treatment or a control intervention. When compared with psychological therapy, exercise had a similar effect on depressive symptoms, based on moderate-certainty evidence from ten trials. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested a similar effect, but the evidence is limited and of low certainty. Long-term effects are unclear as few studies followed participants after treatment. 

Side effects were rare, including occasional musculoskeletal injuries for those exercising and typical medication-related effects for those taking antidepressants, such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems.

Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression. This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important."" 

Professor Andrew Clegg, lead author of the review

The review found that light to moderate intensity exercise may be more beneficial than vigorous exercise, and that completing between 13 and 36 exercise sessions was associated with greater improvements in depressive symptoms.

No single type of exercise was clearly superior, although mixed exercise programmes and resistance training appeared more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Some forms of exercise, such as yoga, qigong and stretching, were not included in the analysis and represent areas for future research. Long-term effects are unclear as few studies followed participants after treatment.

This update adds 35 new trials to previous versions published in 2008 and 2013. Despite the additional evidence, the overall conclusions remain largely unchanged. This is because the majority of trials were small, with fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

""Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar,"" said Professor Clegg. ""Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each.""

Higher intake of food preservatives, widely used in industrially processed foods and beverages to extend shelf-life, is associated with a modestly increased risk of cancer, finds a study from France published by The BMJ today.

While further research is needed to better understand these links, the researchers say these new data call for the re-evaluation of regulations governing the use of these additives by the food industry to improve consumer protection.

Preservatives are substances added to packaged foods to extend shelf life. Some experimental studies have shown that certain preservatives can damage cells and DNA, but firm evidence linking preservatives to cancer risk remains scarce.

To address this, researchers set out to examine the association between exposure to preservative food additives and risk of cancer in adults, using detailed dietary and health data from 2009 to 2023.

Their findings are based on 105,260 participants aged 15 years and older (average age 42 years; 79% women) enrolled in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study who were free of cancer and completed regular 24 hour brand-specific dietary records over an average 7.5 year period. Health questionnaires and official medical and death records were then used to track cancer cases up to 31 December 2023.

A total of 17 individual preservatives were analysed including citric acid, lecithins, total sulfites, ascorbic acid, sodium nitrite, potassium sorbate, sodium erythorbate, sodium ascorbate, potassium metabisulfite, and potassium nitrate.

Preservatives were grouped into non-antioxidants (which inhibit microbial growth or slow chemical changes that lead to spoilage) and antioxidants (which delay or prevent food deteriorating by removing or limiting oxygen levels in packaging).

During the follow-up period, 4,226 participants received a diagnosis of cancer, comprising 1,208 breast, 508 prostate, 352 colorectal, and 2,158 other cancers.

Of the 17 individually studied preservatives, 11 were not associated with cancer incidence, and no link was found between total preservatives and cancer incidence.

However, higher intakes of several preservatives (mostly non-antioxidants including potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, and acetic acid) were associated with higher risk of cancers compared with non-consumers or lower consumers.

For example, total sorbates, specifically potassium sorbate, was associated with a 14% increased risk of overall cancer and a 26% increased risk of breast cancer, while total sulfites were associated with a 12% increased risk of overall cancer.

Sodium nitrite was associated with a 32% increased risk of prostate cancer, while potassium nitrate was associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (13%) and breast cancer (22%).

Total acetates were associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (15%) and breast cancer (25%), while acetic acid was associated with a 12% increased risk of overall cancer.

Among antioxidant preservatives, only total erythorbates and specific sodium erythorbate were found to be associated with higher incidence of cancer.

While more studies are needed to better understand these potential risks, the researchers note that several of these compounds can alter immune and inflammatory pathways, possibly triggering the development of cancer.

This is an observational study, so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and the researchers can't rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results.

However, they say this was a large study based on detailed dietary records linked to food databases over 14 years and results are consistent with existing experimental data suggesting adverse cancer related effects of several of these compounds.

As such, they conclude: ""This study brings new insights for the future re-evaluation of the safety of these food additives by health agencies, considering the balance between benefit and risk for food preservation and cancer.""

In the meantime, they call on manufacturers to limit the use of unnecessary preservatives, and support recommendations for consumers to favour freshly made, minimally processed foods.

From a policy perspective, preservatives offer clear benefits by extending shelf life and lowering food costs, which can be particularly important for populations with lower incomes, point out US researchers in a linked editorial.

However, they say the widespread and often insufficiently monitored use of these additives, with uncertainties of their long term health effects, call for a more balanced approach.

Findings from NutriNet-Santé may prompt regulatory agencies to revisit existing policies, such as setting stricter limits on use, requiring clearer labeling, and mandating disclosure of additive contents, while collaborative global monitoring initiatives, similar to those implemented for trans fatty acids and sodium, could also support evidence based risk assessments and guide reformulation by the food industry, they write.

""At the individual level, public health guidance is already more definitive about the reduction of processed meat and alcohol intake, offering actionable steps even as evidence on the carcinogenic effects of preservatives is evolving,"" they conclude.

New research from the University of Minnesota Medical School offers a new view of how the immune system responds to organ transplants. The findings, published today in Science Advances External link that opens in the same window, show that T cell exhaustion – traditionally viewed as a pathological failure of the immune system - can instead play a protective role by helping the body tolerate a donated organ.

The study identifies the spleen as a key control center for transplant tolerance. Researchers found that administering apoptotic donor leukocytes (ADLs) triggers the expansion of donor-specific regulatory T cells, known as Tr1 cells. These cells help calm the immune response by limiting the activity of T cells that would otherwise attack the transplanted organ, using a signaling pathway called Areg–EGFR. This targeted process allows immune tolerance to be established without broadly suppressing the immune system.

Most transplant patients need lifelong drugs that suppress their entire immune system. What we found is that the spleen can act like a training center - but only when it's properly instructed. By programming the immune system to accept a transplant rather than suppressing it indefinitely, this approach has the potential to reduce long-term complications and meaningfully improve quality of life for transplant recipients.""

Amar Singh, PhD, assistant professor, University of Minnesota Medical School

Rather than weakening the immune system overall, the approach induces a controlled, donor-specific state in the T cells most likely to cause rejection. This spleen-based regulatory circuit preserves the body's ability to fight infections while still supporting long-term graft acceptance.

""Long-term immunosuppression carries significant risks, often compromising the benefits of a transplant. Insights on the mechanisms of operational tolerance identified in this study could eliminate the need for prolonged immunosuppression, thereby improving the quality of life of transplant recipients,"" said Sabarinathan Ramachandran, PhD, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School. 

""Tolerance - often regarded as the Holy Grail of transplantation - has been the central focus of our research, aiming to ensure that patients with diabetes can benefit from islet transplantation without the burden of chronic immunosuppression,"" said Bernhard Hering, MD, professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

Future studies will focus on leveraging spleen-centered immune programming to promote durable transplant tolerance and to explore broader applications in immune-mediated diseases where selective immune regulation, rather than suppression, is needed.

In the battle against type 1 diabetes (T1D), one researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) is leading a bold new front. With $1 million in funding from Breakthrough T1D, the leading global T1D research and advocacy organization, Leonardo Ferreira, Ph.D., assistant professor of Pharmacology and Immunology, and his collaborators at partnering institutions will explore a new approach to treating – and potentially curing – the disease.

The team aims to reimagine how the immune system interacts with the pancreas by combining stem cell biology, immunology and transplantation science. The project's goal is deceptively simple: to restore beta cell function and insulin production in people with T1D without the use of immunosuppressive drugs.

These awards support the most promising work that can significantly advance the path to cures for type 1 diabetes. This is what Breakthrough T1D believes is the next wave in type 1 diabetes therapy.""

Leonardo Ferreira, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina

Ferreira brings to the T1D field his expertise in engineering the immune system by creating chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, that help regulatory T-cells Tregs, to find their targets. Tregs are key players in regulating the body's natural immune response as well as the autoimmune process in T1D. They act as bodyguards, keeping the response in check and ensuring that it doesn't go too far and cause tissue damage and autoimmune diseases. Ferreira is joined by two renowned collaborators. His co-principal investigator, Holger Russ, Ph.D., associate professor of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Florida, is a leading expert in stem cell research in T1D – an area many consider the future of all transplantation as it provides an unlimited source of islet cells for manufacturing and clinical use. Completing the trio is Michael Brehm, Ph.D., of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, a pioneer in humanized mouse models used to test and predict human immune and metabolic responses in human T1D.

T1D is an autoimmune disease in which the body's own immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Without these cells, the body cannot regulate blood glucose levels, forcing people to rely on constant blood sugar monitoring and insulin injections. The disease affects approximately 1.5 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and can lead to nerve damage, blindness, coma and even death.

The Breakthrough T1D award builds upon a 2021 Discovery Pilot grant from the South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research Institute (SCTR), which first enabled Ferreira and Russ to collaborate. That early funding helped to establish the foundation for the current project – one that could reshape how T1D is understood and treated.

Beta cells, which serve as the insulin factory of the pancreas, are depleted in people with T1D because their immune systems fail to recognize them as self and target them for destruction. Currently, patients with severe, difficult-to-manage T1D with exogenous insulin can receive a transplant of islet cells, which include beta cells.

While islet cell transplant therapy replenishes beta cells, it's not without challenges. First, as they rely on human donors, it's difficult to find enough beta cells for transplant. The team has tackled this issue by generating and producing its own stem-cell derived islet cells.

The second setback with this approach is that the transplanted beta cells, like any other organ/tissue/cells foreign to our self-body, are vulnerable to rejection by the immune system. This is where Ferreira's expertise becomes critical. Because immune Tregs naturally help to restore and balance the immune system during and after immune activation, he engineers them with a CAR that can recognize a surface protein placed on the beta cells, acting like a GPS system that can be directed to reach a specific site. This allows the Tregs to act as targeted ""bodyguards,"" homing in on and protecting the beta cells, thereby creating a lock-and-key mechanism that does not occur in nature. When the receptor on the Treg – the ""key"" – fits into the protein on the beta cell – the ""lock"" – it sends a powerful message to the immune system to stand down. Working together, the beta cell and the Treg form a symbiotic partnership and protect the beta cell from immune attack after transplantation.

What's the advantage of this approach? This combination cellular therapy – lab-produced beta cells that can make insulin along with their bodyguard Tregs to protect them from the immune response – would not require patients to take immunosuppressive drugs, which carry significant long-term risks, particularly in pediatric patients.

Moreover, the lab-grown cells could solve a longstanding logistical challenge in beta cell transplantation: the shortage of donor cells. Currently, a single transplant often requires beta cells from three or four donors, while most organ transplants need only a one-to-one match. The team's engineered beta cells, by contrast, can be manufactured in the laboratory, frozen and stored for extended periods without losing quality. This could ensure a reliable, scalable source of donor material for future treatments.

The ultimate goal is to generate a complete off-the-shelf therapy, melding the engineered Tregs with the novel beta cells to create a ready-to-use treatment that can be distributed widely and administered through transplantation.

""We're trying to develop a therapy that would work for all people with type 1 diabetes at every stage, even people who have had the disease for many years and have no beta cells left,"" said Ferreira.

Getting these therapies into clinics will take time. Ferreira and his team have a number of questions and obstacles to overcome before treatments can be offered to the public. For example, one of the key questions this study aims to answer is how long the treatment remains effective. In preclinical models using humanized mice, the effects last for up to a month, the longest time assessed. The new Breakthrough T1D grant will allow the team to investigate ways to extend this window, refine delivery methods and evaluate whether combining multiple doses might yield more durable results.

By merging the disciplines of stem cell biology, gene editing and immunoregulation, Ferreira's team is creating not just a therapy but a model for how science can reprogram the body's natural systems to heal itself. Their work may one day mean freedom from daily insulin injections and a future where type 1 diabetes is not just managed but cured.

If successful, this work could mark a turning point in regenerative and immune-based medicine.

""I think this can change how medicine is done,"" Ferreira said. ""Instead of treating symptoms, we can actually replace the missing cells. By doing this work, we are likely to further understand how T1D starts, how it develops and how it can be treated.""

An artificial saliva in the form of a mouthwash, produced with the CANECPI-5 protein extracted from sugarcane and modified in a laboratory, can aid in treating teeth in patients with head and neck cancer. In these cases, radiotherapy very close to the mouth can destroy salivary glands and compromise saliva production, which is essential for controlling bacteria and disease.

According to research conducted at the Bauru School of Dentistry at the University of São Paulo (FOB-USP) in Brazil, CANECPI-5 forms a protective ""shield"" for the teeth, guarding the enamel against weakening acids found in juices, alcoholic beverages, and even stomach acids. The results were published in the Journal of Dentistry. 

The study was conducted during Natara Dias Gomes da Silva's doctoral studies at FOB-USP. She collaborated with researchers from the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), also in Brazil; the University of California in San Francisco, in the United States; and Yonsei University College of Dentistry, in South Korea.The work is part of the Thematic Project ""Modulation of acquired pellicle to control dental mineral loss: unveiling mechanisms to make therapies possible"", which is coordinated by Professor Marília Afonso Rabelo Buzalaf from FOB-USP. 

We tested the mouthwash developed with CANECPI-5 by applying this solution to small pieces of animal teeth once a day for one minute. Based on these results, we'll conduct further research so that we can think about applications of this product.""

Natara Dias Gomes da Silva, first author of the article

""This is the first product that uses the concept of acquired pellicle [a thin protective layer that quickly forms on the tooth surface] to treat xerostomia, which is the sensation of a dry mouth caused by a lack of saliva. We use substances that will reformulate the composition of the proteins that bind to the teeth,"" explains Buzalaf.

""We've developed a process in which CANECPI-5 binds directly to tooth enamel, helping to make teeth more resistant to the action of acids produced by bacteria,"" Silva points out.

The data published in the article showed that the CANECPI-5 protein is most effective when combined with fluoride and xylitol. In these tests, the artificial saliva spray significantly reduced bacterial activity and tooth demineralization – the process by which teeth lose calcium and phosphate, making them more susceptible to cavities. 

This discovery is significant because patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer do not yet have access to a specific product on the market that can help combat and treat the most aggressive cavities that develop after radiation therapy.

""Artificial saliva improves the sensation of dry mouth and sores. This helps with discomfort and also combats bacteria. In some cases, the use of this type of product is only for a short time. In others, it's permanent, because many individuals lose the ability to produce saliva,"" adds Buzalaf.

The patent for the CANECPI-5 protein was filed a few years ago. According to the researchers, the challenge now is to scale up in partnership with companies interested in the technology so that the artificial saliva can be produced.

""We've already tested the solution as a mouthwash, gel, and orodispersible film, which is a type of plastic that's placed on the tongue and dissolves, releasing the protein. We've tested it in several vehicles and found that CANECPI-5 works very well in all of them. We'll continue testing other technologies within the Thematic Project to use not only this protein, but others as well,"" says Buzalaf.

According to Flávio Henrique Silva, a professor in the Department of Genetics and Evolution at UFSCar, who worked on developing the CANECPI-5 protein, the work with cystatins (a family of proteins involved in various biological processes) is linked to research carried out under the Sugarcane Genome Project (SUCEST, FAPESP). His laboratory is part of that project.

""At that time, our group identified and produced, in a recombinant form in bacteria, the first cystatin from sugarcane. We named it CANECPI-1. We then identified and produced five other cane cystatins, including CANECPI-5, which had potent inhibitory activities against cysteine peptidases, which are its target enzymes. Throughout our work, we noticed that this protein bound strongly to smooth surfaces, such as the quartz cuvettes used in activity measurements. This led us to conduct tests in partnership with Professor Marília Buzalaf on the binding of the protein to tooth enamel.""

According to the researchers, the discovery that CANECPI-5 protects tooth enamel while also regulating the oral microbiota makes it a highly promising molecule for dentistry research.

""CANECPI-5 has also been used in the work of other colleagues in the field of dentistry, particularly involving periodontitis. We also have a collaborative project with a colleague from the Federal University of Uberlândia, using subcutaneous sponge implants in mice, which has shown that it's capable of reducing inflammation and promoting angiogenesis [the formation of new blood vessels] and fibrinogenesis [the formation of fibrin, a protein essential for blood clotting], important processes in tissue repair, making it a candidate molecule for use in wound healing,"" Silva points out.

Within the Thematic Project, the researchers will continue trying to understand how CANECPI-5 interacts with other substances. 

According to Buzalaf, one possible avenue is to study CANECPI-5 fused with a peptide derived from statherin, a protein found in saliva, to see if the new hybrid protein is more effective against the acids that weaken teeth when they come from the stomach. Another possible avenue is to try to understand how to combat periodontal disease.

""Another aspect of the Thematic Project is to associate CANECPI-5 with vitamin E because this vitamin acts as a carrier, bringing the protein into contact with the tooth. We imagine that this could facilitate the application of the product directly by the patient at home,"" says the researcher.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study highlights prevalence of GLP-1/GIP medication use for weight loss in UK","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260108/Study-highlights-prevalence-of-GLP-1GIP-medication-use-for-weight-loss-in-UK.aspx","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:20:00 GMT","

In early 2025, around 4.9 million British adults - almost one in ten - are estimated to have recently used, or expressed interest in using, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist medications to support weight loss. The findings, which are based on a nationally representative household survey of 5,260 British adults, are published in BMC Medicine.

GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP medications help lower blood sugar, support weight loss, and reduce the risk of heart and kidney complications. The GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP medications liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide are licensed for weight loss in the UK but only around 220,000 people will be eligible for treatment with these on the NHS between 2025 and 2028.

Sarah Jackson and colleagues investigated the prevalence of use and interest in GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP medications among British adults - with an average age of 49 years - using survey data collected between January and March 2025 as part of the Smoking Toolkit Study. The authors found that 2.9 % of participants reported using GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications within the previous year to support weight loss. Of those who had not recently used these medications for weight loss, 6.5 % were interested in doing so within the next year. Extrapolating from these figures, the authors estimate that around 1.6 million British adults may have used GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications to support weight loss between 2024 and early 2025 and that a further 3.3 million were interested in doing so at the start of 2025. Among those who used a GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medication to support weight loss within the previous year, 15 % reported using a medication that was not licensed for weight loss in the UK. The authors speculate that this could be due to off-label prescribing or individuals acquiring medications through non-medical routes such as online purchases.

The authors found that GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medication use and interest was more prevalent among women, those aged between 45 and 55 years, and those who reported experiencing moderate to severe levels of psychological distress within the previous month. Interest in GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications was also higher among individuals reporting difficulties with their finances, and who were not in work due to long-term illness or disability.

The findings highlight substantial demand for GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications to support weight loss in Britain. The authors recommend regular monitoring of their use, health outcomes, and broader impacts on the British healthcare system, and to ensure that they are provided safely, appropriately, sustainably, and fairly.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","ICSA 2025: Infection's role in cellular senescence, inflammation, and aging","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260108/ICSA-2025-Infections-role-in-cellular-senescence-inflammation-and-aging.aspx","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:32:00 GMT","

A new meeting report was published in Volume 17, Issue 12 of Aging-US on December 23, 2025, titled ""Cellular senescence meets infection: highlights from the 10th annual International Cell Senescence Association (ICSA) conference, Rome 2025.""

Led by Stefanie Deinhardt-Emmer from Jena University Hospital and Marco De Andrea from the University of Piemonte Orientale and the University of Turin, the report summarizes key discussions from the 10th International Cell Senescence Association conference held in Rome in September 2025. It focuses on how infections can trigger cellular senescence, a state in which cells stop dividing and release inflammatory signals. This link is important since it connects infectious diseases with aging, chronic inflammation, and lasting tissue damage.

Although cellular senescence is best known for its role in aging and cancer, the meeting highlighted its emerging importance in infection biology. Researchers described how viruses and bacteria can induce senescence in infected cells and spread its effects to nearby tissues. This process, known as infection-driven senescence (IDS), can help limit pathogen replication but may also prolong inflammation and slow recovery, particularly in older adults and during chronic infections.

Several sessions focused on respiratory viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Researchers showed that these viruses can promote senescence in lung cells, contributing to persistent inflammation and reduced healing. Experimental models suggested that decreasing the amount of senescent cells improved lung repair, even after the virus was cleared, offering insight into why some patients experience long-lasting respiratory symptoms.

Chronic viral infections were another major theme. Human cytomegalovirus and HIV were shown to drive senescence in immune and vascular cells. In people with HIV, viral proteins were associated with biological changes resembling accelerated aging, despite effective antiviral therapy. These findings help explain why age-related conditions occur earlier and more frequently in this population.

In the meeting, it was also demonstrated that senescence is not limited to viral infections. Researchers reported that the bacterium Mycobacterium abscessus induces senescence in immune cells during chronic infection. These senescent cells increased inflammation and susceptibility to further infection. Removing them reduced bacterial levels in experimental models, suggesting new directions for treating persistent bacterial disease.

""Mechanistically, IDS integrates DNA damage responses, inflammatory signaling, and metabolic stress, with consistent activation of p16INK4a, p21, and NF-κB pathways.""

Across the conference, speakers discussed therapies that either remove senescent cells or reduce their harmful inflammatory signals. These approaches, known as senolytic and senomorphic strategies, showed promise in preclinical studies as potential tools to limit infection-related tissue damage and chronic inflammation.

Overall, the meeting report presents infection-driven senescence as a unifying concept linking infection, immunity, and aging. The discussions at ICSA 2025 highlight a growing field with important implications for understanding chronic disease and the long-term health effects of infections.

A controlled crossover study shows that simply working in natural daylight, rather than standard artificial lighting, can stabilize daily glucose swings, boost fat oxidation, and subtly tune the body's metabolic clock in people with type 2 diabetes.

In a recent study published in Cell Metabolism, researchers investigated whether spending office hours in natural daylight, rather than artificial office lighting, can improve health indicators in people with type 2 diabetes.

They found that exposure to natural light shifted metabolism toward greater fat oxidation, modulated select circadian outputs, and altered molecular metabolic signatures. People with greater natural light exposure also experienced a modest but statistically significant increase in the time when their glucose levels remained in the normal range.

The human circadian system synchronizes metabolism and physiology to the day–night cycle, with light acting as its most powerful regulator. The central biological clock in the brain coordinates peripheral clocks in organs, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, influencing glucose metabolism, energy use, and insulin sensitivity.

Disruptions to circadian rhythms, which are common in modern lifestyles dominated by indoor living, have been strongly linked to metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes. Individuals typically spend 80 % to 90 % of their time indoors, where lighting is dimmer, spectrally static, and poorly aligned with natural daylight patterns.

Previous studies suggest that artificial light exposure can influence glucose and lipid metabolism; however, these studies rarely reflect real-world daylight conditions and often focus on short-term or isolated metabolic outcomes.

Researchers aimed to comprehensively assess metabolic, circadian, and other physiological responses to natural daylight exposure. They used a randomized crossover trial that included 13 older adults with type 2 diabetes who completed two 4.5-day intervention periods. One period involved exposure to natural daylight while indoors through large windows, and the other involved exposure to constant artificial office lighting intentionally low in melanopic and short-wavelength content.

There was a washout period of four weeks or more between interventions. During each intervention, participants stayed continuously in a research facility, followed standardized sleep schedules and meal timings, and maintained consistent medication use.

Natural daylight exposure occurred during office hours (08:00–17:00), while artificial lighting provided 300 lux at eye level. Evening light exposure was tightly controlled in both conditions, and glasses that blocked blue light were used when participants left the controlled environment.

Continuous glucose monitoring was used throughout the intervention to assess glycemic control. Whole-body energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were measured using indirect calorimetry, which included assessments in a respiration chamber and ventilated hood.

Blood samples were collected over a 24-hour period for metabolic profiling, and a mixed-meal tolerance test assessed postprandial metabolism. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained to examine clock gene expression and circadian properties in cultured muscle cells. Multi-omic analyses, including lipidomics, metabolomics, and monocyte transcriptomics, were performed in an exploratory, hypothesis-generating framework to capture systemic molecular responses.

Exposure to natural daylight did not alter average glucose levels but resulted in a greater proportion of time spent within the normal glucose range, indicating improved glycemic stability.

Computational modeling showed that natural light reduced the amplitude of daily glucose fluctuations, which was associated with better glucose control. Whole-body energy expenditure was similar between lighting conditions. However, natural daylight consistently shifted metabolism toward greater fat oxidation and lower carbohydrate oxidation throughout the day and following a mixed meal, reflecting improved metabolic flexibility, or the ability to switch efficiently between fuel sources.

Although 24-hour levels of plasma glucose, triglycerides, and free fatty acids did not differ significantly between conditions, postprandial metabolic dynamics differed, with natural light promoting a metabolic profile consistent with enhanced lipid utilization. Evening melatonin secretion was higher following natural daylight exposure, suggesting subtle circadian effects, although the timing of melatonin onset remained unchanged.

At the molecular level, biopsies of skeletal muscle showed increased expression of specific clock genes following natural light exposure. Primary muscle cells cultured from these biopsies exhibited a phase-advanced circadian rhythm, suggestive of persistent alterations in peripheral clock properties, as observed ex vivo under controlled laboratory conditions, indicating a potential cellular-level memory of prior light exposure.

Multi-omic analyses revealed consistent daylight-associated patterns in circulating metabolites, lipid classes, and immune-cell gene expression, particularly involving lipid metabolism pathways. However, most individual molecular features did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing.

These findings demonstrate that exposure to indoor natural daylight favorably influences glucose regulation, metabolic flexibility, circadian biology, and molecular metabolic signatures in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

This study suggests that chronic lack of natural light may be one contributing factor to poorer metabolic health in people with type 2 diabetes.

Compared with standard artificial office lighting, exposure to natural light increased the time that participants showed glucose readings within a normal range and promoted greater fat oxidation, indicating improved metabolic flexibility.

These benefits were accompanied by reduced daily glucose fluctuations, higher evening melatonin levels, suggestive advances in skeletal muscle circadian phase, and exploratory changes in circulating metabolites, lipids, and immune-cell gene expression linked to insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism.

A key strength of the study is its randomized crossover design, which features tightly controlled light exposure, meals, and activity. However, the small sample size, short intervention duration, older study population, seasonal restriction, and reliance on subjective sleep measures limit generalizability and warrant cautious interpretation of causality.

Overall, the findings highlight natural daylight as a potentially modifiable environmental factor that may support metabolic control in type 2 diabetes and warrant longer, larger, and more naturalistic real-world studies, particularly in working-age populations and real office environments.

Researchers at the University of Southampton have developed a promising new way to bolster the body's immune system response to cancer.

In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers used specially engineered multi-pronged antibodies to better activate cancer-killing T cells.

The antibodies work by 'grabbing' and 'clustering' multiple immune cell receptors – boosting the signal which tells the T cell to attack the cancer.

The team from the University of Southampton's Centre for Cancer Immunology focused their efforts on an immune receptor called CD27. CD27 needs a matching key (ligand) to activate T cells. This ligand is produced naturally in response to infection, but cancers lack this signal and T cells can only elicit a weak response against the cancer cells.

Antibodies can work a bit like a master key, but most commonly used antibodies are Y-shaped molecules with two prongs, meaning they can only engage two receptors at the same time.

While antibodies have revolutionised cancer treatment, some cancers don't respond because T cells don't receive all the signals they need to become fully active. 

The antibodies developed by the researchers have four prongs, allowing them to grab onto more receptors. They also enlist the help of a second cell, forcing all the CD27 receptors they are holding to clump together. This amplifies the signal and mimics the natural way CD27 is activated in the body.

Professor Aymen Al‑Shamkhani at the University of Southampton, who led the study, explains: ""We already understood how the body's natural CD27 signal switches on T cells, but turning that knowledge into a medicine was the real challenge. Antibodies are reliable molecules that make excellent drugs. However, the natural antibody format was not powerful enough, so we had to create a more effective version.""

In lab studies using mice as well as human immune cells, the new antibodies were more effective in switching on CD8⁺ T cells – the 'special forces' of the immune system, than standard Y-shaped antibodies, delivering a more robust anti-tumour response.

By making CD27 more responsive to therapeutic targeting, the findings provide a blueprint for developing next‑generation immunotherapies that harness the immune system to fight cancer more effectively.

This approach could help improve future cancer treatments by allowing the immune system to work closer to its full potential.""

Vaccinating women during pregnancy leads to the transfer of antibodies to their newborns. These antibodies were detected not only in blood, but also in the nasal mucosa, the site where whooping cough bacteria enter the body. This has been shown by international research led by Radboud university medical center. 'The fact that these antibodies reach the nasal mucosa has not been demonstrated before and highlights how effective this vaccination is'.

Since 2019, pregnant women in the Netherlands have been offered a vaccination against whooping cough (pertussis) for their unborn child, known as the 22-week shot. 'We give this vaccine to protect babies from whooping cough right after birth. In the first weeks of life, babies are extremely vulnerable and too young to be vaccinated themselves. That's why we vaccinate the mother during pregnancy,' explains immunologist Dimitri Diavatopoulos of Radboudumc. Antibodies from the mother are transferred to the baby through the placenta. This study now shows that these antibodies also reach the nasal mucosa – exactly where whooping cough bacteria enter the body.

Whooping cough is well controlled in Europe but remains a deadly disease in many parts of the world. Each year, between 200,000 and 300,000 people die from it, mostly young infants in low- and middle-income countries, where good vaccines are not always available. In the study conducted by Radboudumc and the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia, 343 mothers and their babies participated, with half of the pregnant women receiving the whooping cough vaccine. 'Mothers who were vaccinated during pregnancy passed on antibodies through the placenta that were subsequently detected in the baby's nasal mucosa,' says Diavatopoulos.

The study also shows that babies who received a whole-cell whooping cough vaccine at 8, 12, and 16 weeks developed, on average, a stronger immune response than those who received an acellular vaccine. 'The difference is that a whole-cell vaccine contains the complete, but inactivated, whooping cough bacterium, whereas an acellular vaccine contains only a few purified components of the bacterium,' Diavatopoulos explains. 'Acellular vaccines usually cause fewer side effects but often also provide shorter-lasting protection. Our findings suggest that whole-cell vaccines may support longer-term immune protection', says Janeri Fröberg, postdoctoral researcher at Radboudumc.

In Europe, the acellular vaccine has been used since 2005, while most low- and middle-income countries still use the whole-cell vaccine. The researchers emphasize that further studies are needed to determine what these results mean for clinical protection and vaccination policies in different settings.

For the Netherlands, this study underscores the importance of the 22-week shot, which gives babies immediate protection during their most vulnerable period. For lower-income countries, where most deaths occur, the results show that implementing whooping cough vaccination during pregnancy could save lives. And for countries that continue to use whole-cell vaccines, the findings support the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to maintain their use, as they may provide longer lasting immunity.

The Latest | Jan 08, 2026

KANSAS CITY (Jan. 8, 2026) — Four Kansas City Current players have been called up to the first United States Women's National Team (USWNT) training camp of 2026, as announced by U.S. Soccer on Thursday. Midfielders Claire Hutton and Lo'eau LaBonta, defender Izzy Rodriguez and forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor are on the 26-person roster.

The camp will run Jan. 17-27 at Dignity Health Sports Park (DHSP) in Carson, Calif., and two international friendlies will be played. The first will be at DHSP against Paraguay on Saturday, Jan. 24, at 4:30 p.m. CT while the second will take place at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara at 9 p.m. CT on Tuesday, Jan. 27. The Paraguay contest will air on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English while the match vs. Chile will broadcast on TBS and HBO Max. Both games will be on Universo, Peacock and Futbol de Primera radio in Spanish as well as Westwood One radio in English.

After featuring in the Futures Camp a year ago, Hutton received her first senior national team call-up for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup and has since appeared in all five subsequent camps. This marks the third senior team invitation for both LaBonta and Rodriguez. Sentnor's initial USWNT call-up was in November 2024 and she has been called into all but one senior camp since.

Hutton's first USWNT appearance was in the SheBelieves Cup last year when she started against Australia and played 70 minutes, and she has seen significant minutes in each call-up since. She logged a full match against Ireland on June 26 before she registered her first career assist in another friendly with the Irish on June 29. Three days later, the 19-year-old notched her first international goal in the 36th minute in a 3-0 rout of Canada. She most recently played every minute in both friendlies with Italy during the final camp of 2025.

LaBonta's first appearance for the Stars and Stripes was on May 31, 2025, when she came on as a substitute in the 70th minute to help the team to a 3-0 win against China PR. She became the oldest player to debut for the USWNT in the program's 40-year history at 32 years old. She then subbed in during the 58th minute in a 4-0 shutout over Jamaica on June 3. During her second camp, she entered the match vs. Portugal on Oct. 26 in the 86th minute before playing 23 minutes against New Zealand at CPKC Stadium a few days later.

Rodriguez's consistent performances during the 2025 NWSL season prompted her to receive her first senior team call-up during the summer FIFA window. She made her debut on June 29 in a 4-0 shutout over Ireland, finding the back of the net in the 42nd minute to become the 23rd player in the USWNT's 40-year history to score in their first cap. She was part of the starting lineup in that match and logged a full 90 minutes. The defender was also called into the final camp of 2025 but did not see action in either friendly.

Sentnor earned her first senior team cap in November 2024 vs. England at Wembley Stadium. Her breakthrough came at the 2025 SheBelieves Cup where she finished the tournament with two goals and an assist, including a goal in her first start on Feb. 20 against Colombia to become the first U.S. player to score her first USWNT goal in the SheBelieves Cup Tournament. Her first brace in a U.S. uniform was in a friendly with Jamaica on June 3. Sentnor was named the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","USWNT January Camp roster released","https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/football-frenzy-2025/42012/uswnt-roster-january","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 16:11:28 GMT","

Our first roster of the year.

The United States Women's National Team have their first roster of the year. Today, U.S. Soccer announced the 26-player roster who will head to California next week for the team's annual January Camp. They will play two matches during this camp against Paraguay on January 24th and Chile on January 27th.

The roster features the return of Trinity Rodman, who only featured in one match in 2025 before a back injury ruled her out for a large portion of the summer. She is currently a free agent and has not yet announced where she will be playing club soccer in 2026, but is now healthy enough to be in camp.

The January Camp occurs outside of a FIFA international window, so clubs were not required to release their players. As a result, no player based in Europe were called into this camp. Emma Hayes combined experience along with giving some younger players an opportunity to train and play with the team in a year that will see the USWNT compete in the Concacaf W Championship in November, which serves as Women's World Cup qualifying.

“Once again, our roster presents opportunity, for the coaching staff to evaluate players and for some NWSL players we haven't seen as much in the National Team environment, as well as for some first-time call-ups, to show they can contribute in 2026, 2027 or beyond,” USWNT head coach Emma Hayes said in a press release. “We're looking forward to having a few more training days than usual in this camp as well as getting two matches to see this part of the player pool in game action and hopefully add even more depth and options for our 2026 SheBelieves Cup roster.”

The 26-player USWNT roster:

GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals), Jordan Silkowitz (Bay FC)

DEFENDERS (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash), Izzy Rodriguez (Kansas City Current), Tara Rudd (Washington Spirit), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave FC), Kate Wiesner (Washington Spirit)

MIDFIELDERS (8): Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit), Hal Hershfelt (Washington Spirit), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current), Sally Menti (Seattle Reign FC), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC)

FORWARDS (7): Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC), Jameese Joseph (Chicago Stars FC; 1/0), Trinity Rodman (Unattached), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville FC), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current), Reilyn Turner (Portland Thorns FC)

The USWNT take on Paraguay on January 24th at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California. They then move onto Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara to face Chile on January 27th.

HERRIMAN, Utah (Thursday January 8, 2026) - U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player January training camp to be held at the Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif that includes Utah Royals starting goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn. As the January training camp falls outside a FIFA competition window, Hayes named a roster made up entirely of players from the National Women's Soccer League.

McGlynn was selected for multiple rosters with the U.S. Women's National Team throughout the 2025 season and continues that streak, selected for the 26-player roster by Head Coach Emma Hayes. Through consistent excellence at the club and international levels, McGlynn has secured regular selection to the U.S. Women's National Team, continuing to influence the program both on and off the pitch as the 2027 FIFA World Cup approaches.

The USWNT squad is set to play two matches in California against Paraguay on Saturday January 24th at 3:30 pm MT on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo and Peacock in Spanish before taking on Chile Tuesday January 27th at 8 pm MT on TBS and HBO Max in English, Universo and Peacock in Spanish.

World Cup

U.S. Soccer will reserve most of its 2026 World Cup ticket allotment for paying “Insiders” and other stakeholders, but will allocate all of FIFA's scarce $60 tickets to members of three independent supporters groups, including the American Outlaws.

After months of uncertainty, the U.S. federation informed fans this week that it will run multiple random draws for tickets to the U.S. men's national team's World Cup games. It controls 8% of the tickets for each USMNT match, and is allowed to distribute those tickets via distinct processes separate from FIFA's broader lotteries, which are open to the general public. Most, though not all, of the 8% allotment will be sold to fans.

Prices are set by FIFA — and have been roundly criticized by supporters.

U.S. Soccer's lotteries, however, add additional layers of fees and financial burden.

A majority of the U.S. Soccer tickets made available to fans — likely around 80% of those available in lotteries — will go to fans who pay between $45 and $10,000 per year for an “Insiders” membership. The $45 members get one entry into a random draw. An $85 member gets two entries; a $185 member gets three entries; a $500 member gets four entries; a $1,000 member gets five entries; and a $2,500 member gets six entries. (Those who pay $5,000 or $10,000 annually “have the right to purchase tickets and don't need to enter the lottery,” a U.S. Soccer spokeswoman told The Athletic.)

There are also rewards for loyalty. Those who've been “Insiders” for five-plus years get two additional entries, and those who've been members for 2-5 years get one additional entry. But anyone can pay for an entry, or additional entries, via an Insiders membership, until the ticket application window closes on Jan. 13.

Non-paying “Standard Insiders,” meanwhile, will be entered into a separate draw for 10% of U.S. Soccer's Insider allotment. The paying Insiders get the other 90%.

In outlining the rules, the federation explained: “We believe every fan should have a chance to be there for the World Cup, regardless of membership level. For fans whose long-term commitment enables U.S. Soccer to remain in service to the game, we've designed a draw that recognizes and rewards that support.”

Separately, there will be a third random draw for the $60 tickets that FIFA re-priced amid backlash. FIFA has said these represent 10% of each team's supporter ticket allotment. These have been offered, per U.S. Soccer, “exclusively to members of American Outlaws, Barra76 and Sammers,” three recognized supporters groups that are not governed by U.S. Soccer but frequently work with the federation and coordinate chants at games. (Each group charges its own $30 or $25 annual membership fee.)

In an email to those members, U.S. Soccer said that granting them the $60 tickets would “recogniz[e] the passion and commitment of our most dedicated fans.”

All Insiders and members of the three groups are eligible to apply for tickets in a supporters section at any of the USMNT's World Cup matches, though there are some caveats:

U.S. Soccer will first sort through applications from supporters group members. (Those who also pay for an “Insiders” membership get an extra entry.) The federation will randomly select a few hundred per game for the $60 tickets, then put the rest into one of the two Insiders lotteries, depending on their membership tier — standard (free) or paid.

The $60 ticket allotment is seemingly around 500 per game, and there are over 20,000 members of the three supporters groups. The American Outlaws, by far the largest of the three, boast around 25,000 members alone.

All three sent membership lists to U.S. Soccer in December. (Opportunists, therefore, cannot join now solely for access to $60 World Cup tickets). Each member may apply for two tickets per match.

“Insiders” who aren't supporters group members, meanwhile, cannot apply for the $60 tickets. When they unlock their access code and log on to FIFA's ticketing portal, they have three options, which are priced exactly in line with FIFA's standard Category 1, 2 and 3 tickets.

For the USMNT's opener, at SoFi Stadium in Southern California on June 12 against Paraguay, their prices are:

The USMNT's second match, at Lumen Field in Seattle on June 19 against Australia, is the cheapest of the three group matches:

Prices for the third match, back at SoFi Stadium on June 25 against a to-be-determined European opponent, are:

FIFA has said that the Premier and Standard tiers each represent 25% of supporters tickets, while the Value tier is now 40% and the $60 “Entry Tier” is 10%.

Fans must choose which matches and categories to apply for. Via the weighted random draws, in February, U.S. Soccer, in partnership with FIFA, will grant them all, some or none of the tickets they applied for.

As of 2023, there were around 300,000 “Insiders,” according to a then-coordinator of the program.

Many of them were non-paying Standard Insiders. Many more have likely joined in recent months at this entry level in hopes of securing World Cup tickets. Given the ticket prices, not all will apply for every match, or even any match; but with less than 10% of U.S. Soccer's tickets allocated to the free tier, each fan's chance is likely slim.

Paying Insiders, on the other hand, have better odds — though not necessarily good odds. U.S. Soccer is allowing fans to join or upgrade to more expensive tiers before the Jan. 13 application deadline, “at which point Insider tiers will be locked for the draw,” the federation says.

Winners of the Insiders draws will be seated in the sections designated for supporters on color-coded stadium maps released by FIFA. In Seattle, for example, those who pay the most will be directly behind one goal, while those who pay the $265 “Value Tier” price will be in a corner of the upper deck.

Those stadium maps, though, have been changing since FIFA initially showed them to ticket buyers in October. And they do not include the $60 entry tier. Craig Hahn, a Sammers board member, told The Athletic that he's unsure where supporters group members who win the $60 tickets will be placed. U.S. Soccer is also unsure. Much of that will be up to FIFA.

The $60 tickets — announced by FIFA on Dec. 16, five days after this current ticket phase opened — were welcomed by supporters, but also complicated decisions for national federations trying to balance access and fairness.

Federations around the world have taken a variety of approaches. Canada Soccer, for example, allocated its $60 tickets to the Voyageurs supporters group, and ran a lottery this week that did not require Voyageurs members to also apply for more expensive tickets.

England, meanwhile, gave priority to so-called “Top Cappers” — fans who've attended the most national team games (friendlies, qualifiers, etc., home and away) in the recent past.

In U.S. Soccer's Insider lotteries, there are improved odds but no guarantees for longtime members. In the supporters lottery, no preference will be given based on seniority or longevity. And in both, nothing is based on previous match attendance.

Hahn, the Sammers board member, said he was reasonably satisfied with U.S. Soccer's approach. American Outlaws leadership said that news of the separate supporters lottery for the $60 tickets was “music to our ears,” but they were less pleased when they found out that members would also have to apply for more expensive tickets to be eligible. Multiple fans, in messages and calls with The Athletic, bemoaned this aspect of the scheme, calling it “problematic” and “a huge catch.”

AO leaders wrote in response: “We hear you, and we'll keep raising all our voices the way we do in the streets, bars, and stands to continue to fight for access to this beautiful game we love.”

AO leaders also lamented the complexity of the entire process, which has been tardier and more opaque than ever before. “We understand this process has been confusing for a lot of members and for that we're sorry,” they wrote. “This is the first World Cup that AO has not been able to control an allotment for our members so it's also been confusing for us as well.”

The United States men's national team is set to dress at the 2026 World Cup in a way that will pay tribute to the last tournament held on American soil in 1994.

Leaks of the new primary jersey to be worn by Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Folarin Balogun and co. have emerged. It's a move away from the typical white shirt that is synonymous with the team, instead putting forward abstract red and white horizontal stripes.

Leaked by FootyHeadlines, the wavy stripes designed by Nike, making USMNT jerseys since 1995, is directly inspired by a fluttering American flag and brings a patriotic feel as the U.S. proudly co-hosts the single biggest sporting event on the planet.

In 1994, it was wavy vertical red and white stripes, but the 2026 vibes are certainly similar and immediately evoke memories of players like Alexi Lalas, Cobi Jones, Eric Wynalda and Marcelo Balboa. Horizontal stripes also made an appearance in 2012.

Complementing the red and white, navy blue on the collar and sleeve cuffs adds even more to it.

The expected secondary jersey also draws more subtle inspiration from 1994.

That iconic blue shirt with white stars from 32 years ago is considered by many to be among the all-time great soccer kits, worldwide. The 2026 edition, also leaked before its scheduled release by FootyHeadlines, will not look the same, but bears clear tribute.

Minimalist overall, the carbon colorway will feature a star pattern, while the Nike swoosh and USA crest finish the classy kit in metallic silver.

The USMNT begins the World Cup in Group on June 12, facing Paraguay at SoFi Stadium. The red and white primary jersey is likely to be the team's uniform that day, and again a week later against Australia in Seattle.

The carbon secondary jersey could be seen at the World Cup in match three of the group stage. Despite obviously playing at home—back at SoFi Stadium—the USMNT are the designated away team against the as yet undecided UEFA Path C play-off winner. That will be one of Slovakia, Kosovo, Türkiye or Romania, with the latter two's jerseys perhaps prompting a kit change for the USMNT.

FrontRowSoccer.com Editor

Few U.S. men's national team players, current or former, are better qualified to talk about the World Cup than Clint Dempsey.

After all, he is the only American player to have scored in three tournaments. Deuce, as he is known by friends and teammates, is second only to Landon Donovan in career goals in the world's great spectacle (five to four).

So, when Dempsey, who has become a spokesman for Unilever for the World Cup, talks about the greatest show on earth, we should listen.

In the two of the three World Cups that the 42-year-old forward appeared in, the U.S. men's national team qualified for the knockout round. After failing to move on in 2006, the Americans reached the Round of 16.

In 1994, the U.S. registered a 1-1-1 mark and four points to keep its hopes alive, avoiding becoming the first host side to fail to get out of the group stage in one piece. Eight years later in 2002, South Africa made history by not booking a spot beyond the first round.

 Defining success

The USA cannot afford not to duplicate what the South African team accomplished, the National Soccer Hall of Famer said.

“I'm not going to put a ceiling on what is going to be success for them, but I will put a floor in terms of what will be a disaster,” Dempsey said in a recent interview. “There's more national teams, more teams being in this World Cup. I think it's diluted the quality of the World Cup. In my opinion, it's made the group stage not as exciting. You're having eight third-place teams being able to get out of the group. So, if you're not able to get out of the group in this World Cup, I think that that would be a failure, for sure.

“So, I'm not going to put a ceiling on it. I hope they catch fire at the right time. The last six games, you've kind of seen the improvements. They're undefeated in the last six games, especially with the last result against Uruguay, winning, 5-1. You're seeing more that they're adding to the attack, and you got some exciting friendlies coming up potentially, against Portugal and Germany. I'm looking forward to seeing how they catch fire and get this country believing. Maybe it can be something like what we saw in South Korea [in 2002] from what from the U.S. team in terms of getting to the quarterfinals. But also, what we saw from South Korea in terms of South Korea's being the host country and getting everybody behind him and going on a great run.”

Korea reached the semifinals on its home soil in 2002, losing to Turkey in the third-place match. Still, it was a great run that many U.S. Soccer officials would love to see.

 World Cup effects

There are some soccer officials in this country who feel just hosting the World Cup will boost the sport into a high orbit in this country. Hosting the World Cup in 1994 certainly lifted the U.S. from nothing to something. Two years after welcoming the world, Major League Soccer was born. It just celebrated its 30th season last year.

“I don't know how it's going to transform the sport in the U.S.” Dempsey said. “I mean, I look back at '94. We didn't have the professional league, and it wasn't how the U.S. performed, and the excitement that was around the game because of them getting out of the group with Colombia in it, and the way that they played against Brazil, only losing 1-0. [Brazil] went on to win the World Cup. We were starting to believe again and have a professional league. It gave kids hope that maybe one day they could play soccer professionally and maybe try to play in a World Cup and do what they were able to see.”

A 13-year-old Dempsey was one of those kids in 1994.

“I think having something on home soil right in front of your eyes really inspires the youth, and it inspired me in terms of what this World Cup can bring,” he said. “Hopefully. it's not waiting every four years to move the needle for the game here in the States, I would like to see it every year. It looks like there's more Copa Americas that are starting to be played here. There are talks of it in 2028 maybe being here as well.

“I got to play in one of those. I wish I had had the opportunity to play in more. It's a huge tournament, and it helps bring excitement to the game. So, I just hope that maybe, in terms of domestically, it inspires more kids to take their game to the next level and take it further than the current players have been able to take it. I hope that it moves the needle, and it's more of a mainstream sport every single year.

“Maybe with MLS, it gets rid of the salary cap. Because we see that we're going on the same schedule as the European schedule in terms of dealing with transfers and transfer deadlines, maybe it's a situation where, long as you're within the FIFA financial fair play, then you're able to strengthen your team as much as you want to because of their your ability to be able to do so. So, I think that will allow more players to come to this league in their prime.”

 Big expectations of Pulisic

Speaking or players in their prime, at the age of 27, Christian Pulisic will be in his prime this June. He needs to have a big tournament if the U.S. wants to acquit itself well.

Dempsey has no worries whether Pulisic will excel because he has come through in just about every competition in which he plays.

“One off, I want to say it's a team effort,” he said. “You need a good team behind you to be successful. But what I will say about Christian in big moments, whether it was World Cup qualifying or we're playing in World Cup or playing in Copa America, he's someone that that steps up and scores your goals and gets you assists. So, I'm not worried about what he'll be able to do on the pitch as long as he's healthy. I think he's one of those difference makers. We were lucky to have him; I've been really impressed with what he's been able to do at A.C. Milan in Serie A. So, I hope he keeps, keeps on doing what he's been doing.”

With five months until the U.S.'s opening match against Paraguay at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. on June 12, it will come down to every player keeping fight and healthy, like any other national team.

“I just hope our players stay fit,” Dempsey said. “We have our best, 18, best 11 players to go out there and show what we're capable of.”

 Looking at the USMNT

Dempsey was encouraged that Antonee Robinson, an attacking left back who has set up goals for Fulham in the Premier League, returned from a knee injury.

He said that Robinson “will be huge, something that we could definitely use. It's good to see [Folarin] Balogun's fit and playing really well in the Champions League, and also what he's been able to do in the league and also with the national team. And just that competition for spots in that position with Haji Wright and now [Ricardo] Pepe being more fit again. Then you got the likes of Tyler Adams and what he's doing in the Premier League, and Chris Richards as well at Crystal Palace, winning trophies with them and the confidence he's getting. So I'm really excited about this team and what they can do.”

Years ago, American soccer fans were spoiled by the one-two punch of Landon Donovan and Dempsey in the Starting XI. It was pretty devastating as both players are tied for the all-time U.S. men's goal-scoring lead with 57 goals apiece.

Since both retired it, however, it has been difficult to find a consistent partner for Pulisic. You might even liken the search by whoever is the USMNT head coach, to Diogenes walking through the streets of Athens, Greece, searching for an honest man.

“I think Balogun is going to be the number nine that starts, but he does have competition for that spot with Haji Wright and Pepe,” Dempsey said. “But the reason why I like Balogun is just he's the complete player. He can score with both feet. He's good in the air. Can create goals for himself, create goals for others. He has the pace to be able to stretch the field and bring [the ball] when he gets possession, bring others into play. I just think he's someone who has it all. He has confidence. He's playing really well at Monaco in the league and Champions League, getting goals. Most importantly, when he's with the national team, he's getting goals. That's what's exciting to see. I think there's more depth now than there has been in the past in that number nine position. But for me, he gets the nod as being the number nine, but I'm not the coach, and I don't make the decisions, but it feels up to me. That's the guy I would run with.”

Dempsey's legacy

 Playing in three World Cups is a big deal. Becoming the first American to score in three consecutive tournaments is even a bigger deal.

“I'm really proud of it,” Dempsey said. “I'm proud that any tournament that I was in with this national team. If I look back, I think I scored in it, whether it was every [Concacaf] Gold Cup I was a part of, whether it was Copa America, whether it was [FIFA] Confederations Cup, whether it was World Cups. Almost someone that could stand up and be counted. So that's something that's always meant a lot to me. I took take a lot of pride in.”

Dempsey's first taste of the World Cup came at the age of 13, when he watched Mexico 86 and highlights of the competition on a VCR tape, Hero.

“Seeing players like Diego Maradona, [Michel] Platini, seeing Hugo Sanchez, watching Zico, all these different players from these different teams, and seeing the crowds and seeing how passionate they were for their country, that was pretty cool for me to see that people were as passionate about the same sport as me,” he said. “Which was weird growing up in Texas, because I didn't really feel like I related with a lot of people. Most people they're like, ‘Why aren't you playing baseball, basketball or American football?' It wasn't one of those things that people really believed until after you saw the '94 World Cup and saw this country kind of get behind that team that, hey, there's more people in this country that are like you.”

Regardless of what level Dempsey played for his country, he was going to make the most of it. He made his World Cup debut at the 2006 tournament in Germany.

“I remember like it was yesterday,” he said. “If I'm being honest with you, I remember playing in the U-20 World Cup and not getting much playing time. I remember playing in the World Cup in 2006 the first game, not getting any playing time against the Czech Republic, and thinking to myself, is this going to be another World Cup like the U20s, where a tournament goes by and I really don't have much of a say.”

Then he got an opportunity to play for Italy, which went on to win its fourth World Cup. The U.S. managed a 1-1 draw with the future champions. In the Americans' 2-1 loss to Ghana in their final group stage match, Dempsey found the net for his first World Cup goal.

Dempsey said that the goal “gave us a little bit of a lifeline, because if we beat Ghana, that we would be able to get out of the group, but we came up short. But it was dream come true for me, it's what I dreamed about as a kid, playing in a World Cup, score in the World Cup, and by being able to do that. It's exactly what I just talked about. I was in January camp in 2006, no one would have bet that I'd have been in the starting lineup for any of those games. And because of hard work and determination and taking advantage of the opportunities I had when I got them, that's what allowed me to do that. So, I hope that there's going to be one or two surprises like that that shake this team up and make a real impact.”

The partnership

Dempsey also talked about his partnership with Unilever.

“What drew me to partnering with Unilever was the opportunity to help fans prepare for FIFA World Cup 26,” he said. This tournament is set to be the biggest yet, and with my home country hosting, it makes this a special moment for me, and so many fans. 

“Unilever helps people feel confident, fresh, and ready for the moments that matter most, especially on game day. Having experienced the FIFA World Cup firsthand as a player, it's exciting to now be part of something that helps fans feel closer and more focused on the action.” 

And there is an opportunity for fans to win World Cup tickets through Unilever.  

“Fans can enter for a chance to win FIFA World Cup 26™ tickets, and other prizes, by purchasing gift packs from Dove Men+Care, Degree, or AXE at major retailers or by visiting UnileverWorldCup26.com,” Dempsey said. “They can win things like watch party experiences, home entertainment upgrades, gaming packages and more. It's a fun and easy way to stay fresh while getting ready for the excitement of the FIFA World Cup 26. 

“This is something fans really don't want to miss. With three countries hosting, FIFA World Cup 26 is going to be incredible. It's more than just the game — it's about the energy, culture and bringing people together around their love of soccer. It's an unforgettable experience.”

The U.S. men's national soccer team is now in a World Cup year, which means players are angling for a place on Mauricio Pochettino's 26-man squad. First, though, they will aim to get themselves on the roster for the March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta.

A call-up to the last training camp before Pochettino selects his World Cup team in late May will not come with summer guarantees. Nor will missing out in March preclude selection to the tournament.

Over the next two-plus months, though, Pochettino and his staff will keep a close eye on club performances before sending out invitations. Barring injury, most of the regulars are assured of making the list. Several candidates, however, would bolster their case with strong recitals in European leagues, Major League Soccer and Mexico's Liga MX.

Here are 10 players with the most to gain:

Back in PSV Eindhoven's starting lineup and bubbling with confidence, the Texas-born striker is poised to move up the U.S. depth chart. With Pepi out of the U.S. picture until the end of 2025 — due to injuries and club playing time — Monaco's Folarin Balogun strengthened his top-man status and Coventry City's Haji Wright proved a worthy back-up.

Pepi, who will turn 23 on Friday, is in great form with goals in five of his past six PSV appearances and five goals and two assists in the seven matches before the winter break. Across all club competitions, he has 10 goals and three assists in 21 games. He is also a hot commodity on the transfer market, with PSV reportedly turning down a $35 million offer from Premier League side Fulham.

The enigmatic midfielder bolstered his U.S. status with superb performances in the November window — his first call-up since March. But to help remain in Pochettino's good graces and stay in the World Cup mix, the 23-year-old must continue earning starts for Mönchengladbach, the Bundesliga club he joined from Borussia Dortmund over the summer.

A sub most of the first several months, Reyna started the last four matches before the winter break and received mixed reviews. He has yet to record a goal or assist this season.

Though he has never played for the U.S. team, the 19-year-old center back remains an intriguing character as the World Cup approaches. The Hawaiian-born German American received his first senior call-up in September but did not get into either friendly. Having started almost every game since early October for Augsburg in the Bundesliga, Banks shouldn't be overlooked.

Pochettino's center back corps is not set in stone. He has used Crystal Palace's Chris Richards, Charlotte's Tim Ream, Cincinnati's Miles Robinson, Toulouse's Mark McKenzie and Celtic's Auston Trusty. (Toronto FC's Walker Zimmerman and Vancouver's Tristan Blackmon are also in the pool, and Celtic's Cameron Carter-Vickers is recovering from an Achilles' tendon injury.)

If relying solely on his club portfolio, the 24-year-old center midfielder should be a U.S. regular. In the past two years, he has moved from Brazil's Internacional to Spain's Real Betis and attracted interest from England's Tottenham Hotspur before leaping to Atlético Madrid last summer on a $35 million transfer.

But injuries have hampered his ascent and, oddly, he has never played very well for the national team. His most recent appearances, in the June friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, were forgettable. Regular assignments with Atlético might earn him one last chance with Pochettino.

The 6-foot-4 Connecticut native took a bit of risk last summer by leaving a certain role in MLS for the uncertainties of the English Championship. Had he sat on Derby County's bench, Agyemang would have lost all World Cup hope.

But he has adapted well, recording six goals and three assists in 19 starts, including a two-goal effort against Sheffield Wednesday last month. A good run over the next two months would keep him in contention for a March call-up.

The only Liga MX candidate under serious consideration, the clever, Mexican-born winger has been terrific for Club América and shown flashes of brilliance for the national team. His volleyed goal against Japan in September was all class. However, he withdrew from the October camp with a knee injury and wasn't called up a month later.

Reduced playing time in San Diego last season damaged his U.S. standing, but with a move to Charlotte this offseason, the 27-year-old central midfielder with 32 caps could reenter the conversation. Like most MLS players, though, he will not have much time to make his case: The regular season doesn't start until Feb. 21.

Once a mainstay in the U.S. lineup – 47 caps before he turned 23 – the versatile Musah has faded from the scene since the Nations League finals last March. After joining Atalanta on loan from AC Milan in Serie A this season, he has been used almost exclusively as a sub. His minutes have picked up recently, hinting at a larger role down the stretch.

While Pochettino and U.S. fans have all but given up on the Norwich City striker, there is always that possibility Sargent goes on a crazy scoring surge. After all, he has scored 52 goals the past 3 ½ years in England's second division. Even if he did go wild, though, there is little faith in a U.S. uniform: He hasn't scored for his country since November 2019.

Sometimes a change of scenery does wonders, and in the case of this 6-foot-4, 21-year-old striker with six caps, this week's move to Hamburg on loan from Southampton could do the trick. He started once in the English Championship and hadn't played since Nov. 25.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Folarin Balogun says that Mauricio Pochettino has ensured that no U.S. men's national team players feel their place is guaranteed, which only makes the Monaco striker's recent goals feel all the more important. After missing much of 2025 with injury issues, Balogun returned to full fitness in the fall and has been scoring for club and country.

Throughout much of 2025, his first full year as USMNT boss, Pochettino stressed that the door was wide open for anyone and everyone to fight for World Cup spots. That message was only further reinforced following the USMNT's thrashing of Uruguay to close 2025, with Pochettino hitting back at the media over the concept of the team having ""regulars"" in the player pool.

The message has been heard loud and clear, Balogun says. The striker position is almost always determined by form anyway, but given the culture developed by Pochettino, Balogun says the entire USMNT is feeling the pressure to perform in these final few months before the World Cup.

""I think you have to give credit to Pochettino and his staff,"" the striker told FIFA. ""They have created an atmosphere where nobody feels like their place is guaranteed. I think that is the most important thing you can do when you have such a big pool of players like the USA does. It was easy for maybe some guys who didn't get previously called up to almost psychologically go into a place where you don't feel like you can get picked, you don't feel like your domestic league warrants you getting picked for the national team because that's what you've been shown before.

""But Pochettino has come in with a completely new philosophy and if he thinks someone is playing well and is playing in a division like Major League Soccer then he will pick them. That is a wake-up call for everybody, and naturally, that will get a reaction, but he's also been able to add the smartness and the tactician side to it, and I think both sides are gelling together.

Balogun has been a mainstay in the Monaco XI for much of this season, making his mark in both Ligue 1 and the Champions League. He has four goals and two assists in 848 Ligue 1 minutes while also scoring in each of his last three Champions League appearances for the club. In addition, Balogun has thrived for the USMNT since returning this fall, finding the back of the net in each of his three starts to close 2025.

""I'm content,"" he said. ""I'm still looking to be a lot more decisive in those games. I know I have the opportunity to make a bigger impact in those types of games. But I've scored three in the last three, and this is my first year playing in the Champions League being a starter consistently. I'm able to contribute with important goals that are helping us win games and help us potentially progress to the next round. I'm definitely content, but I definitely want to strive for more.""

It's been an up-and-down season for Monaco, who currently sit ninth in Ligue 1 following a loss to Lyon this past weekend. Up next, though, is a French Cup game against US Orleans on Saturday before a league clash with Lorient on Jan. 16. Then comes the big test: the return to the Champions League and a visit to Real Madrid on January 20.

The USMNT, meanwhile, will be back in action in March for their final two friendlies before Pochettino selects his World Cup roster. Those friendles will see the U.S. take on Portugal and Belgium in Atlanta.","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

The Delaware native is doing everything he can to ensure U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino takes notice ahead of the World Cup later this year. 

Mark McKenzie needed November. 

When he returned to the Philly area for the U.S. men's national team's penultimate game of 2025 against Paraguay, it was a homecoming that he said grounded him. 

Groomed in the Union's academy system and having spent three seasons as a homegrown player on the club's first team, it marked the first occasion in quite some time McKenzie, a native of Bear, Del., returned to his old grounds. 

Well, they were technically all-new grounds, considering that when he came up the ranks, Subaru Park was named Talen Energy Stadium, and the sprawling expanse that is now the WSFS Sportsplex was still a rendering. 

But being back, seeing familiar faces, training with the national team in Chester, and even briefly seeing a few family members brought perspective to what he's ultimately trying to do: find his name among 25 other hopefuls eager to make the American roster ahead of June's FIFA men's World Cup.

At the time, McKenzie, 26, noted that packing in all of that perspective was part of a “business trip,” one that has continued under the watchful eye of U.S. men's coach Mauricio Pochettino as the starting center back for Toulouse, in France's first division. 

“It's always special coming back to Philly,” McKenzie said following the U.S. win against Paraguay at Subaru Park on Nov. 15. “I saw some old friends, my family came by the hotel, and just that time to take a little stroll and grab a bite to eat reminded me of who's been behind me on this journey, and who I'm playing for.”

Playing time has been consistent for McKenzie, who has appeared in 17 league matches for Toulouse this season, starting 16 at center back. That bodes well, as Pochettino has repeatedly noted that consistency in match play is a plus in his eyes. And considering there's not a clear early favorite as the No. 2 center back on the field for the Americans, McKenzie has to know that his chances are as good as anyone's.

“The biggest thing is controlling what I can control,” McKenzie said. “Sure, I think about that stuff, but ultimately it's not up to me. That's my mentality, my attitude going into my performances.”

Defensively, McKenzie is taking control of a Toulouse team that is eighth in the Ligue 1 standings, just two spots outside of qualifying for the UEFA Europa League next season. There's still plenty of time for McKenzie and the team to climb before the season concludes in May, though it will take a better run than the seven points out of a possible 15 the club has collected in its last five league matches. 

“Going back to my [home] club [in Toulouse], that's where a lot of the hard work is done,” he said. “So I'm just handling myself in those ways, and just not trying to worry about the things outside my control. My job is to keep getting selected for my club, play well, and hope it's enough to prove that I deserve the opportunity to represent my country.” 

Trying to qualify for the second-ever men's World Cup in the United States isn't the only thing on McKenzie's mind. Last October he became a dad, and he is trying to find the balance between those early days of fatherhood, his responsibilities to his club, and staying on Pochettino's radar.

It seemingly worked out as McKenzie was called up for every U.S. camp in the  fall cycle in October and November. In October, he told CBS Sports that the birth of his son made him feel like he had “more to play for.” 

And even though his baby wasn't old enough to understand the rigors McKenzie is going through, having his son while going through this process appeared to mean the world to the center back. 

“He can't really hold his head up right now, and he's not really watching …,” joked McKenzie on CBS Sports' Morning Footy show in October, “but when we look back on these moments, this is something that I'll cherish forever; just to say that he's out there watching his daddy play is something that I'll hold dear to my heart.”

If fate has its way, McKenzie would be one of four players in the U.S. player pool who came up in the Union's academy system or spent time on the club's first team who could find themselves on the World Cup roster. 

Currently, that list includes Medford's Brenden Aaronson, Wayne native Matt Freese, and Media's Auston Trusty, the latter also vying for a spot along the back line. Each player has been invited to recent camps, and there's a belief that one, if not all, has a good chance to crack Pochettino's World Cup squad.

But there's still time before that happens. Six months, to be exact — meaning all McKenzie can do is focus on the now. 

After all, it is the only thing in his control. 

“Look, I'm trying to make the decision as difficult as possible [for the U.S. coaching staff],” he said. “I only do that by being at my best when I'm with my club and making the most of my opportunities when I get them. I just plan to do what I do and showcase my talent to the best of my ability, and hope that's enough.”

World Cup

Video clips of World Cup games will be broadcast live on TikTok this summer, FIFA said on Thursday.

The collaboration between world football's governing body and the short video-based social media platform will last until the end of 2026 in an attempt to bring fans “closer to the action” with more “relatable perspectives”.

In addition to the live broadcasting of parts of games, FIFA announced that they will provide access to press conferences and training sessions to a select group of creators for fan content, with the app's global head of content saying people are “42 per cent more likely to tune in to live matches after watching sports content on TikTok”.

Match ticket information and “gamification features”, such as filters and stickers, to enhance engagement, will also be available.

“This is an innovative and creative collaboration that will connect more fans across the globe to the FIFA World Cup in unprecedented ways, bringing them behind the curtain and closer to the action than ever before,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said.

“As football grows and evolves — uniting an increasing number of people — so should the way it is shared and promoted.”

The 48-team tournament will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

U.S. President Donald Trump had expressed a desire to ban TikTok during his first term in office to resolve national security concerns. In 2024, U.S. Congress passed legislation to address this as lawmakers from both parties believed the app could blackmail Americans or influence elections.

In December of last year, however, TikTok's chief executive announced they had signed an agreement which has been blessed by Trump, who declared he is “saving” the app.



TikTok, which announced reaching a billion users in 2021, has collaborated in this way for sports tournaments before, notably for the 2023 Women's World Cup which was the first official collaboration with FIFA. Midway through the tournament the official hashtag had 1.8 billion views and similarly featured selected creators, who were able to earn money from their content.

TikTok has also collaborated with Burnley Women, the Women's European Championship, the Club World Cup and the Women's Super League in Bangladesh. Beyond football, they announced a partnership with the tennis ATP Tour and golf's PGA Tour.

The 2026 World Cup will start on June 11, with Mexico taking on South Africa, and finish with the final on July 19.

...

Bayern Munich's high profile loss in the battle for former Bayer Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz stung the club and gave its critics an opening to examine why the Germany international became the latest talent to leave the country in favor another league.

In this case, of course, Wirtz chose Liverpool.

Wirtz is not alone, though, several big name players have opted to go abroad in recent years, leading Dwight Yorke to make the determination that the Bavarians just are not the domestic draw to player that they used to be.

Omar Marmoush (Eintracht Frankfurt), Huge Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt), Benjamin Šeško (RB Leipzig), and a host of other players from the Bundesliga have jumped to other leagues after being — at least — loosely linked to Bayern Munich in recent years.

For Yorke, that is a trend.

“I think if you look at German football, all of them wanted to come here (to England), didn't they? All the players outside of Bayern, unique players, every one of them used to run to go to Bayern. They don't want to go to Bayern anymore,” Yorke told FootItalia. “The whole world wants to come here to the Premier League. Omar Marmoush, Florian Wirtz and all these guys. Bayern are interested in getting these players. Bayern used to be like Manchester United in taking the best players from the rest of the league, it's not like that anymore.”

There is at least a bit of context needed as some players who Bayern Munich might have interest in can easily look at depth chart and see a very difficult pathway to consistent playing time or a starting job.

While Yorke is correct in that the Bundesliga does lose some players when Premier League clubs come calling, it is not always about the bright lights on the island that is the big draw. Sometimes, it is just comes down to an excessive salary offer or a much stronger chance for a starting gig.

At Bayern Munich, both of those things can be difficult to get at times.

World Cup

Video clips of World Cup games will be broadcast live on TikTok this summer, FIFA said on Thursday.

The collaboration between world football's governing body and the short video-based social media platform will last until the end of 2026 in an attempt to bring fans “closer to the action” with more “relatable perspectives”.

In addition to the live broadcasting of parts of games, FIFA announced that they will provide access to press conferences and training sessions to a select group of creators for fan content, with the app's global head of content saying people are “42 per cent more likely to tune in to live matches after watching sports content on TikTok”.

Match ticket information and “gamification features”, such as filters and stickers, to enhance engagement, will also be available.

“This is an innovative and creative collaboration that will connect more fans across the globe to the FIFA World Cup in unprecedented ways, bringing them behind the curtain and closer to the action than ever before,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said.

“As football grows and evolves — uniting an increasing number of people — so should the way it is shared and promoted.”

The 48-team tournament will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

U.S. President Donald Trump had expressed a desire to ban TikTok during his first term in office to resolve national security concerns. In 2024, U.S. Congress passed legislation to address this as lawmakers from both parties believed the app could blackmail Americans or influence elections.

In December of last year, however, TikTok's chief executive announced they had signed an agreement which has been blessed by Trump, who declared he is “saving” the app.



TikTok, which announced reaching a billion users in 2021, has collaborated in this way for sports tournaments before, notably for the 2023 Women's World Cup which was the first official collaboration with FIFA. Midway through the tournament the official hashtag had 1.8 billion views and similarly featured selected creators, who were able to earn money from their content.

TikTok has also collaborated with Burnley Women, the Women's European Championship, the Club World Cup and the Women's Super League in Bangladesh. Beyond football, they announced a partnership with the tennis ATP Tour and golf's PGA Tour.

The 2026 World Cup will start on June 11, with Mexico taking on South Africa, and finish with the final on July 19.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","US actions in Venezuela put the 2026 World Cup in disgraceful company","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/08/usa-world-cup-2026-venezuela","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 16:00:00 GMT","

In 1934 and 1978, Fifa's big event was given over to authoritarian aims. There's no more doubt that 2026 will be the same

By 1934, it was entirely evident what Benito Mussolini was up to. Italy's dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup, managing it with a heavy hand and even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn't sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of the decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.

It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla's military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power through systematic detention, torture and murder. Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.

“At last, the world can see the true face of Argentina,” said Fifa president João Havelange at the opening ceremony, newly decorated with a medal from Videla.

Argentina spared no expense in putting on its World Cup, even though the total cost was a state secret. But the right-wing government also didn't bother to slow the pace at which it disappeared political dissidents and opponents. Germany captain Berti Vogts proclaimed that “Argentina is a country where order reigns. I haven't seen a single political prisoner,” though, so no matter.

When Vladimir Putin presided over the opening ceremony to the 2018 World Cup, it had been four years since his forces annexed Crimea from Ukraine and he backed pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas region. Fifa didn't mind.

The problematic nature of these events may have been obvious at the time, but took some time to be fully acknowledged; for there to be no mistaking the actions and intentions of the host government. Years from now, when we look back on the geopolitical context of the 2026 World Cup – shared with Canada and Mexico but hogged by the United States – we'll likely place it in the same category as those others. Hopefully, we have perfect clarity, and this edition of the World Cup will take its place among the most shameful incarnations of the quadrennial tournament.

This conclusion was crystalized by last week's forceful and bloody abduction of the sitting president of Venezuela and his wife, before US president Donald Trump announced that the socialist state was now effectively an American-run territory.

That was, of course, after Trump, or his henchmen, softened their support for Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia; literally blew boats out of the water on mere suspicion of drug trafficking; threatened to invade Mexico and annex Canada (their World Cup co-hosts!), Greenland and the Panama canal; and started a trade war with, well, basically everybody, disrupting the global economy.

We don't yet know how far this administration, which promised isolationism but has instead delivered geopolitical mayhem, will go in a foreign policy that lacks any coherence beyond the governing assumption that it can do whatever it feels like. But it's clear that it may just be getting started.

Still, the World Cup will proceed. Fifa president Gianni Infantino has been immovable in his support for Trump. Unlike Havelange and Videla, the medals and fake awards are going in the other direction.

It's been some time since we had a World Cup without reasonable controversy. The 2010 and 2014 editions in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, were widely panned locally for the strain they put on nations with far more pressing needs. And yet those legitimate complaints seem quaint compared to the 2022 tournament in Qatar, acquired under well-documented corruption and leading directly to many deaths and human rights abuses. The 2030 tournament will inevitably grow notorious for spreading the thing out over three continents, greatly increasing the environmental impact and giving the lie to any claims Fifa once made of caring for the climate. And then there's the 2034 World Cup, which has already been signed over to the Saudi Arabia's strongman de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman.

The US-dominated World Cup fits neatly into this run. This nation isn't presently in a position to lecture anybody else on human rights – nor has it ever been. The Qataris and Saudis are sportswashing outliers no longer. This is just what the World Cup is now: a convenient vehicle for carrying the aims of dangerously self-interested people.

Perhaps some kind of boycott movement from fans toward Fifa events will gather steam, although the slow slide of acceptance to where we are suggests otherwise. One didn't come off before Qatar, either, in spite of a lot of noise. It's doubtful such a boycott would accomplish much by way of embarrassing the men, and the odd woman, who have killed off the parts of themselves that once felt shame anyway.

Soccer has fully gone the way of the Olympics and Formula One, which long ago made their peace with whatever sordid baggage came attached to the highest bidder for their events.

And when the story is told of how the World Cup fully and finally lost its way, they will point to the 2026 edition, played in Canada and Mexico and – problematically, embarrassingly, irredeemably – these United States.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup, being held across the United States, Canada and Mexico, kicks off on June 11 with a record 48 teams competing—the biggest edition in the tournament's history.

Cape Verde, Curacao, Jordan and Uzbekistan have benefitted from the expanded pool of countries able to participate, and they will make their World Cup debuts after coming through their respective qualifying pools.

But the story on many people's lips, however, is not sport but geopolitics: Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured by U.S. forces in a military raid in early January 2026 and flown to the U.S. to face federal charges including narco-terrorism and cocaine-trafficking related offenses.

Maduro has strongly denied the claims, describing himself as a “prisoner of war”—a phrase he used in court to reject his detention—and previously called such charges a tool to further “imperial” plans for U.S. President Donald Trump to get access to Venezuela's oil reserves.  

With such unrest underway, soccer fans around the world are not only wondering how the situation will play out, but also whether Venezuela's national soccer team has qualified for the 2026 World Cup—which would add a quite extraordinary backdrop to the tournament's drama.  

The short answer is no, Venezuela have not qualified for the 2026 World Cup.

La Vinotinto finished eighth in the CONMEBOL qualifying table, missing out on both the automatic qualification places and the intercontinental playoff spot.

They won just four of their 18 matches, with a heavy 6–3 defeat to neighbors Colombia on the final matchday sealing their fate and extending their long-standing record as the only South American nation never to appear at a men's World Cup—even with the expanded 48-team format offering additional slots.

A day after the loss to Colombia in September, head coach Fernando Batista and his entire backroom staff were dismissed, reportedly at the order of President Maduro, who demanded a full restructuring of the national team setup following what he described as a “painful defeat.”

The USMNT will participate as hosts, having not needed to go through the qualifying process—a luxury that was also afforded to Canada and Mexico.

The United States men's national team is set to dress at the 2026 World Cup in a way that will pay tribute to the last tournament held on American soil in 1994.

Leaks of the new primary jersey to be worn by Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Folarin Balogun and co. have emerged. It's a move away from the typical white shirt that is synonymous with the team, instead putting forward abstract red and white horizontal stripes.

Leaked by FootyHeadlines, the wavy stripes designed by Nike, making USMNT jerseys since 1995, is directly inspired by a fluttering American flag and brings a patriotic feel as the U.S. proudly co-hosts the single biggest sporting event on the planet.

In 1994, it was wavy vertical red and white stripes, but the 2026 vibes are certainly similar and immediately evoke memories of players like Alexi Lalas, Cobi Jones, Eric Wynalda and Marcelo Balboa. Horizontal stripes also made an appearance in 2012.

Complementing the red and white, navy blue on the collar and sleeve cuffs adds even more to it.

The expected secondary jersey also draws more subtle inspiration from 1994.

That iconic blue shirt with white stars from 32 years ago is considered by many to be among the all-time great soccer kits, worldwide. The 2026 edition, also leaked before its scheduled release by FootyHeadlines, will not look the same, but bears clear tribute.

Minimalist overall, the carbon colorway will feature a star pattern, while the Nike swoosh and USA crest finish the classy kit in metallic silver.

The USMNT begins the World Cup in Group on June 12, facing Paraguay at SoFi Stadium. The red and white primary jersey is likely to be the team's uniform that day, and again a week later against Australia in Seattle.

The carbon secondary jersey could be seen at the World Cup in match three of the group stage. Despite obviously playing at home—back at SoFi Stadium—the USMNT are the designated away team against the as yet undecided UEFA Path C play-off winner. That will be one of Slovakia, Kosovo, Türkiye or Romania, with the latter two's jerseys perhaps prompting a kit change for the USMNT.

Perhaps Ole Gunnar Solskjaer should have listened to Kieran McKenna when he learned of the possibility of Cristiano Ronaldo returning to Manchester United in 2021. Many Red Devils' fans had dreamed about Ronaldo coming back to Old Trafford for more than a decade, and the prospect of him playing under another iconic player from United's past was the ultimate hit for nostalgia junkies.

Solskjaer had witnessed Ronaldo's rise as a teenager at Old Trafford up close and he understandably jumped at the thought of the multiple Ballon d'Or winner leading his attack. But the now-Ipswich Town boss McKenna was concerned.

""'How are we going to defend ourselves?' That's the first thing he [McKenna] says,"" Solskjaer recalled to Norwegian podcast NRK.

No one else at the club wanted to listen to McKenna though, what with all the shirts the club was about to sell, the commercial prospects and the social media frenzy that was building. But with the benefit of hindsight, Solskjaer wishes he had listened to his trusty assistant.

""It was probably a wrong choice for all of us,"" he admitted. ""But we felt it was the right decision then and there.""

While Ronaldo's return initially unleashed a wave of euphoria at Old Trafford and he scored plenty of goals in his first season back, he also blew up everything that Solskjaer had been building. The Norwegian's three-year spell in charge of United is often remembered for how it ended, and yet his tenure also witnessed incredible highs. The football, for example, was also the most exciting it has been under any manager since Sir Alex Ferguson. 

And so while many rival fans might be sniggering at the prospect of Solskjaer returning to the United dugout more than four years after he was sacked, his second coming can be a success - as long as he doesn't get taken in by hubris again.

Ronaldo's signing came out of the blue, so much so that one senior United staff member was ordered by Ed Woodward to immediately end his family holiday and head straight back to Manchester to prepare for the announcement. Solskjaer didn't have too long to think about it either. Not that he needed to.

""It was a very quick decision,"" Solskjaer told the Stick to Footballpodcast. ""When it became apparent that he was leaving Juventus, obviously there were other clubs that wanted him – but I was excited. They asked me, 'Would you want us to try this?'. I said yes – obviously we know Cristiano is quality, and he's 37, but we have to manage – he's the best goal-scorer in the world.""

United had made a good start to the 2021-22 season, thrashing Leeds 5-1 on the first day while taking seven points from their first three games. Ronaldo had a near perfect debut, too, as he scored twice in a 4-1 win over Newcastle at an ecstatic Old Trafford. But the drawbacks of his return could be seen in the very next game as United were beaten 2-1 by Young Boys in the Champions League.

Ronaldo scored again in a 2-1 win at West Ham, but United lost five of their next seven league games, with Solskjaer sacked after losing 4-1 at Watford in mid-November.

Ronaldo did score important goals in the Champions League which prevented things from getting even worse, but those strikes could not hide the fact that the team had become completely unbalanced by him.

Solskjaer admitted: ""We started off straight away thinking, 'how we are going to press and change the little tweaks?'. With the ball, with him in the team, it was no problem. Without him [pressing], we had to change a little bit the different roles we'd gotten used to. We were one of the highest pressing teams before.""

While Solskjaer thought that Ronaldo understood the need to be rotated due to his age, the reality was that on the rare occasion that the manager did leave the Portuguese out of the starting line-up, there was a massive backlash. When Ronaldo was on the bench against Everton, Ferguson was seen telling UFC fighter and United fan Khabib Nurmagomedov: ""You should always start with your best players.""

The incident undermined Solskjaer's authority and underlined the sense that Ronaldo's return had led United to descend into a circus act. 

""Cristiano – when you know him and speak to him, he wanted to play three out of four games, he realised he's getting older as well. But when you leave him out once, he's not happy!"" Solskjaer recalled. ""I've thought a lot about this... The right thing was to sign Cristiano. But, I think it would've turned out better for Cristiano and for us if he hadn't signed.""

It was not just Ronaldo's sauntering pace that was a problem. Soon after his arrival, Solskjaer sensed a drop in morale across the squad.

He told The Athletic: ""When you have a group, you need everyone to pull in the same direction. When things didn't go right, you could see certain players and egos came out. Things had soured, the collective had been lost and that's not Man United, where teams are built on the collective. Some players felt they should've played more and weren't constructive to the environment.""

Ronaldo's return was a sliding doors moment for Solskjaer's United, but the sour end does not change the fact that the Norwegian remains the club's longest-serving manager since Ferguson left after achieving the best results in the Premier League. In his two full seasons in charge, the team finished third and then second, meaning Solskjaer is the only manager since Ferguson to achieve successive top-four finishes. He brought a smile back to United after Jose Mourinho had darkened the mood and allowed players to believe in themselves again.

That's how Nemanja Matic remembers him. ""I felt sorry because Ole was a great guy and we were on the way to doing something big,"" he told FourFourTwo. ""I wasn't his first choice in the midfield and never liked a coach when I didn't play - I'd fight with them. But Ole was the first coach I didn't fight with. He brought the players who weren't in the starting XI together. He knew the club and the fans loved him.

""We finished second and third under him. There was an atmosphere in the team that we weren't happy finishing second, but when you see the results now, we did amazingly. I think Ole deserved more time - and when I say Ole, I also want to mention his staff, like Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna. They were going the right way to bring United back.""

Marcus Rashford was also highly complimentary of Solskjaer. ""Ole is a fantastic person,"" he said. ""I loved playing under him. I can speak for many of the players at Manchester United when I say that we enjoyed playing for him.""

Contrast the positivity players felt for Solskjaer with the negative atmosphere Ruben Amorim created with his outspoken remarks about the squad. Solskjaer is a unifier and he brought instant results, with United winning 14 of their first 17 matches. He had a similar impact when he became coach of Besiktas, winning eight of his first 12 games, including thrashing Athletic Club 4-1 and beating local rivals Galatasaray.

There are doubts about Solskjaer's tactical acumen but, as Amorim's tenure demonstrates, players at massive clubs do not always cope well with being given too many instructions. Solskjaer's counter-attacking style is simple and it is easy to imagine Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo thriving under him. Nor should it be forgotten that Bruno Fernandes' most productive period as a United player, his 26 goals and 19 assists in his first two seasons, came when Solskjaer was in charge.

As well as agreeing to take Ronaldo back, Solskjaer's biggest mistake was thinking that United could play as equals against Manchester City and Liverpool in his final few weeks in charge. Their two biggest rivals destroyed almost every other side that season, amassing 93 and 92 points, respectively, and Solskjaer was naive not to set his side up differently. 

Liverpool thrashed United 5-0 while City simply passed them into oblivion in a 2-0 loss which felt almost as hopeless as the battering by Jurgen Klopp's side. He subsequently told Stick to Football: ""Those two home games, I always looked at them as we need to be Manchester United. Don't defend, don't be counter-attacking, just let the players go out there, go toe-to-toe with them because otherwise there's no point being at Manchester United. You've got to, at some point take the next step – and they weren't ready. Just not good enough.""

Solskjaer's United were at their best when they played to their strengths, and if he learns from the mistakes of his first spell, he can bring the joy back to a club that lately has been starved of hope.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Antoine Semenyo transfer ‘twist'? Liverpool still in £65m race as Man City sweat on deal for Bournemouth winger","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/antoine-semenyo-transfer-twist-liverpool-65m-race-man-city-bournemouth-winger/blt85e26313efb8c546","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:39:11 GMT","

Antoine Semenyo appears destined to leave Bournemouth for Manchester City in a £65 million ($87m) deal, but Jamie Redknapp has predicted a “twist” that could yet see the Ghana international end up at Liverpool. No move for the 26-year-old forward has been signed off as yet, meaning that he could still be lured away from the Etihad Stadium and over to Anfield.

Bournemouth are resigned to the fact that their talismanic winger appears set to move on, with exit clauses in his contract at the Vitality Stadium being triggered. If the former Bristol City star is to depart, then he signed off in the best possible manner when netting a 95th-minute winner for the Cherries in their dramatic 3-2 victory over Tottenham.

That result has helped to put further daylight between Andoni Iraola's side and the relegation zone, with a 12-point buffer being enjoyed. Fears will have been raised regarding attacking inspiration as Semenyo heads towards the exits.

Iraola concedes that a prized asset is about to be snatched from his clutches, with the Bournemouth boss telling Sky Sports when asked if Semenyo has likely scored his last goal for the club: “It looks like it, yes. Obviously, you have to do the medical and formalities but, I'm afraid to say because I don't want to lose him.

“I think it's going to be his last moments with us. He's a top professional. We're not [just] losing an incredible player but one of the best I've coached, he's ready for anything.”

City have been leading the chase for Semenyo's signature since before Christmas, with Pep Guardiola ready to add another fearsome forward to an attacking unit at the Etihad that already includes prolific Norwegian striker Erling Haaland, Egyptian forward Omar Marmoush and wing wizards Jeremy Doku, Savinho and Oscar Bobb.

The Blues are, however, yet to get a deal over the line and Guardiola told reporters when asked about his pursuit of another wide option in the wake of a disappointing 1-1 draw at home to Brighton: “I don't know. I don't know what is going to happen in the transfer window.”

That would suggest that the door does remain open for other suitors to nip in and pip City to Semenyo. He has been linked with Manchester United, while Liverpool are mulling over their options amid the uncertainty surrounding Mohamed Salah's future on Merseyside.

Ex-Reds midfielder Redknapp has claimed that Arne Slot may be ready to make a late play for Semenyo. He told Sky Sports of City supposedly being on the brink of tying up another big-money transfer: “I'm not so sure. I've heard there might be a little bit of a twist. I think Liverpool could still be in the equation.

“I think that, I've got to be honest, I think if they did come in - why they perhaps haven't come in as strongly, I'm surprised. If you look at that position, with Mohamed Salah and how long he's going to be at the club for, we don't quite know. If you've got a player of that quality and he shows he's a match-winner, he turns up in the big moments.

“Why wouldn't you be in for him? I'm not saying it's a Sky Sports breaking news moment, but all I'm saying is, I've heard tonight that it might not be the foregone conclusion that he's going to be having a medical at Man City. There might still be a little twist, and I hope so.”

Semenyo has seen his stock soar since joining Bournemouth from Bristol City in January 2023. After a relatively slow start to his spell with the Cherries, the 2024-25 campaign delivered 13 goals across all competitions. He has reached double figures already this term.

Many have billed him as the ideal Salah successor on the right of Liverpool's attack, but the Reds - in what has been a difficult defence of their Premier League title in 2025-26 - are going to have to move quickly if they are to pull off a considerable coup and leave old adversaries City frustrated.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Hansi Flick in the dark on Robert Lewandowski future amid transfer talk as Barcelona veteran is left on the bench in Athletic Club humiliation","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/hansi-flick-robert-lewandowski-future-amid-transfer-talk-barcelona-on-the-bench-athletic-club-humiliation/blt365fafe9715d7b04","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:15:55 GMT","

Barcelona manager Hansi Flick has admitted he is uncertain about Robert Lewandowski's future at the club beyond this summer, casting doubt on the veteran striker's long-term status. The comments came after a stunning 5-0 demolition of Athletic Club in the Spanish Super Cup, a match where the Polish international was surprisingly left among the substitutes.

The celebrations following Barcelona's emphatic 5-0 victory over Athletic Club in Jeddah have been accompanied by fresh questions regarding the hierarchy of the squad. While the Catalan giants produced a devastating attacking performance to book their place in Sunday's final, they did so without their most recognisable goalscorer in the starting line-up.

Lewandowski, who has been the focal point of the Blaugrana attack since his arrival, was restricted to a watching brief for the majority of the encounter. Flick opted to rotate his side, a decision that was vindicated by the result but one that has inevitably fuelled speculation about the 37-year-old's standing at the Camp Nou.

When pressed on whether Lewandowski would still be leading the line for the club next season, Flick offered a candid but non-committal response that hinted at potential changes in the summer.

“If you ask about next season, I don't know. I'm happy with Lewandowski and his work. He's at a good level,” Flick told reporters during his post-match press conference.

Lewandowski's contract expires at the end of the season and there has been much speculation regarding his future, with teams from Saudi Arabia said to be lining up bids for him. Meanwhile, AC Milan reportedly aim to unite him with ex-Real Madrid star Luka Modric and other teams are expected to come in for the Poland international.

The ex-Bayern Munich striker cast doubt on his future recently, saying at the end of December: ""I still have time to make a decision. Right now, I don't know where I want to play. There's no need to think about it yet. I don't know which direction to take, but I don't have any pressure.

""I am not talking to the coach about interested clubs. It's not about cutting my salary in half. A lot depends on the club's plan and what I want.""

Flick also addressed concerns surrounding Lamine Yamal, who was on the bench in the Spanish Super Cup clash against Athletic Club on Wednesday before being introduced in the 72nd minute.

While the German coach confirmed his absence from the starting XI was down to a fitness complaint, he insisted there is no reason to worry about the teenager.

“He has had some discomfort in recent days, he had not been able to train and that is why he was not in the eleven. But he is okay,” Flick said.

The match itself saw Barcelona record a comprehensive 5-0 win over their Basque opponents. The result stands as one of the team's largest margins of victory in the current campaign. The performance came shortly after the Catalan derby against Espanyol, a match which Flick referenced in his post-match analysis.

The manager contrasted the display against Athletic Club with the team's showing in that previous fixture.

“For me always, my thought is the next game. But I appreciate what we did today because against Espanyol we hadn't been good,” Flick stated. “I like that we play as a team, together. It's fantastic to win 5-0. But it's only one game and the final will be different.”

Flick also spoke at length about the defensive aspect of the performance. While the five goals garnered attention, the German coach highlighted the clean sheet as a significant factor in the result.

“Today we managed to be in control. We needed a few minutes to start working, then we played well. I'm happy because we controlled the game well. We kept the ball and I like that we defended until the end to keep a clean sheet,” Flick explained.

Barca will be eagerly awaiting the result of the semi-final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid on Thursday to determine who they will meet in the final.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Too little, too late: Antoine Semenyo signing and Marc Guehi pursuit won't save Man City's title hopes as Pep Guardiola counts cost of dismal run of draws","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/too-little-too-late-antoine-semenyo-signing-marc-guehi-pursuit-will-not-save-man-city-title-hopes/bltd2260c2a73f45692","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:54:59 GMT","

Antoine Semenyo bid farewell to Bournemouth in the best possible fashion, netting a 95th-minute winner at the Vitality Stadium to end his side's 11-match run without a Premier League win. As his team-mate Marcus Tavernier told Sky Sports, ""There was no better way for [his last game] to go. That was the type of stuff you write in movies and no man deserves it more than him.""

Semenyo's decisive strike against Spurs also perfectly underlined why Manchester City were so happy to have won what was essentially a 'Big Six' battle to sign the Ghana international. It was the winger's 10th goal of the season - only striking duo Erling Haaland (20) and Igor Thiago (16) have more.

The question, of course, is whether Semenyo's £64 million ($86m) move to Manchester has come too late to save City's title hopes, because while Bournemouth fans were celebrating a vital victory on Wednesday night, the home fans still left inside the Etihad were counting the considerable cost of a desperately disappointing 1-1 draw with Brighton...

After a patchy start to the season, City reached the turn of the year in ominously good form. Pep Guardiola's side won eight games in all competitions between November 29 and December 27 - a fantastic run of results that featured a statement victory over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu.

The six-game winning streak in the Premier League was of far greater significance, though, as it saw City cut Arsenal's advantage at the top of the table to just two points.

However, the lead will increase to eight if the Gunners beat Liverpool at the Emirates on Thursday evening - which looks like something of a formality, given the Reds' regression this season.

So, how have City found themselves in the very unusual position of needing Liverpool to win to boost a faltering title tilt?

City rounding out 2025 with a 2-1 win at the City Ground felt hugely significant. Guardiola's side had had to dig deep to defeat Nottingham Forest, with Rayan Cherki's winning goal arriving with just seven minutes of normal time remaining.

There wasn't a doubt in Guardiola's mind that they would have lost that game last season - which only reinforced his belief that his team was back on track after their trophy-less 2024-25 campaign.

""The critical moment changed in the USA at the Club World Cup,"" the 54-year-old told TNT Sports, referring to City's humiliating 4-3 last-16 loss to Al-Hilal in Orlando in June. ""We looked at ourselves and talked and many things changed from there.

""Now, it is a process. When we won a lot of titles at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and here, you had a lot of games of this type. But the body language, the connection of how we are with the fans - they love the keepers, the strikers, the people, because they feel the team wants to do it, want to fight for each other.

""It's more important in football how you suffer, how you defend, accept you're not playing good and can be better and be in the game, otherwise there is no chance. For a long time the team has wanted to do it and it's the last game of the first leg of the season, so it's good to finish with an important three points.""

On TNT Sports, Joe Hart called City's victory at Forest a ""championship-winning performance"", while midfielder Tijjani Reijnders effectively sent a warning to Arsenal.

""We know a lot of clubs suffer here,"" the Dutch midfielder said. ""From what I heard Nottingham Forest at home is always difficult, and I felt it as well today. So, it's a very important win - and we are on the hunt.""

And given City's track record of successful pursuits, it was hard not to fear for Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, a side renowned for falling with the finishing line in sight.

However, the title race could be as good as over eight days into the New Year, with City having drawn their first three games of 2026.

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

After a scoreless stalemate at Sunderland on January 1, City allowed Chelsea to come away from the Etihad with a point three days later, and Brighton followed suit on Wednesday evening. 

Essentially, in less than a week, all of the momentum built up at the tail end of the year had been thrown away, and Guardiola felt the reason for the incredibly damaging draws was very obvious.

""I like a lot of the way we played,"" the former Barcelona boss told reporters after the Brighton game. ""Many new players and good things - I love that.

""But it was quite similar to the second half against Sunderland. Against Chelsea, maybe we had fewer clear chances, but we missed the passes when it was two against one. And so, we didn't score goals. [We are missing] too many clear chances and it's not just one or two players, it's all the players up front.

""Scoring goals is part of our job when we analyse the game. We played exceptionally well and, in the good moments in the past, [we] always take the chances. [But while] we created a lot of chances in the six yard box, we could not score - and not just one player, everyone. That's why we could not win these games.""

However, blaming City's struggles solely on profligacy feels like a clear case of over-simplifying the problem.

Remember, Chelsea fully deserved their draw at the Etihad. Enzo Fernandez's equaliser may not have arrived until the 94th minute but it was just reward for a side that created the only three 'big chances' of the entire game.

As Fabian Hurzeler also pointed out, Brighton were excellent in the first half of Wednesday's game and really should have been ahead before Haaland scored from the penalty spot just before the break.

So, while City boast the second-best defensive record in the Premier League (19 goals conceded in just 21 games), there is an undeniable air of uncertainty surrounding the backline.

Injuries undeniably played their part against Brighton, with both Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias unavailable - along with the perma-crocked John Stones.

It's not in the least bit surprising, then, that City are now seriously considering making a move for Marc Guehi, whose Crystal Palace contract expires at the end of the season.

Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has already made it clear that his captain won't come cheap but City are desperate and, after wasting a significant sum of money on two players that weren't anywhere near ready for rigours of English football last January (Vitor Reis and Abdukodir Khusanov), they may well feel that £40m ($54m) is a small price to pay for a proven Premier League performer.

With Semenyo's transfer set to be confirmed in the coming hours, also getting Guehi in the door at some point between now and the close of the winter window would go a long way towards addressing City's issues at either end of the field.

Semenyo's mix of pace, physicality and versatility should add another dimension to City's attack, while Guehi now feels like an absolutely essential addition for a back four that looked makeshift even before the injuries to Gvardiol and Dias because of Guardiola's insistence on converting midfielders into full-backs. Indeed, City have proven vulnerable in transitions all season long (the 5-4 win at Fulham is the most glaring case in point) and the obvious hope is that Rodri's return to full match fitness will eventually rectify that particular problem.

However, while adding Semenyo and Guehi would also significantly boost City's Champions League bid, their Premier League challenge might already be over - and Guardiola knows it too.

The Catalan coach cut a frustrated figure on Wednesday evening, even clashing with Hurzeler at one point, and when asked afterwards about his team winning the league, he replied, ""If you don't win games, you cannot think about these things."" And certainly not with Arsenal seemingly going from strength to strength at precisely the time we thought they might start exhibiting signs of weakness.

So, while Semenyo and Guehi would be game-changing signings for City, it might actually be a case of too little, too late in terms of the title race.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Arsenal midfielder Kyra Cooney-Cross has returned to her native Australia indefinitely after her mother, Jess, was diagnosed with a terminal and aggressive form of cancer. The 23-year-old will miss the Gunners' upcoming Women's Super League fixture as she supports her family through what she described as a ""world-changing"" diagnosis.

The midfielder has flown back to Australia to be with her family after confirming that her mother has been diagnosed with Stage 4 Cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the bile duct.

The news was announced via a statement from the Cooney-Cross family and a personal post on the player's Instagram account on Thursday. The diagnosis has been described as a ""huge shock"" for the family, with the condition identified as aggressive and incurable.

As a result of the compassionate leave, Cooney-Cross will not be part of the Arsenal squad for this weekend's Women's Super League fixture against Manchester United. The club are expected to give the midfielder as much time as she needs to be with her family during this time.

In an emotional post shared on social media, Cooney-Cross paid tribute to her mother, describing her as the driving force behind her successful career for both Arsenal and the Matildas.

""A few days ago, our world changed forever,"" Cooney-Cross wrote. ""My amazing mum, Jess, has been diagnosed with Stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). It's a rare and aggressive cancer, and there is no cure.

""My mum is my hero, my best friend, my everything and the person who has shaped every part of who I am. She is the reason I am where I am today, her strength, love, and belief in me has carried me through everything. Trying to put into words what she means to me feels impossible.""

Cooney-Cross, who joined Arsenal from Swedish side Hammarby in 2023, admitted the family is still struggling to process the suddenness of the news.

""I'm now back in Australia to be with my mum, my sisters, and our family as we navigate what comes next. We are all still in shock and learning how to sit with the weight of this news.""



The diagnosis has placed significant strain on the family, both emotionally and financially. A statement released on their behalf highlighted the practical challenges they now face as they care for Jess.

""The news has brought immense financial pressure on Jess, Andy, and the whole family,"" the statement read. ""We have set up a GoFundMe to try and raise vital support during this time. Any donation is greatly appreciated.""

The family has requested privacy as they navigate the difficult months ahead, stating they will not be making further comments at this time.

Cooney-Cross has been a key figure for the Matildas and a growing presence in the Women's Super League. Her return to Australia sees her step away from football to focus entirely on supporting the woman she credits for her success.

Cooney-Cross added: ""Any support, whether that's donating or sharing, is deeply appreciated.""

Cooney-Cross has established herself as a vital component of the Arsenal midfield and her dynamic performances recently earned her the club's Player of the Month award for December.

Her absence will be keenly felt on the pitch, particularly for the high-profile clash against United this Saturday. However, the club and the wider football community have made it clear that football is secondary, rallying around the young star to offer their full support.

She may also miss the upcoming Asian Cup with Australia, with the tournament kicking off in March in her homeland.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Massu on Hurkacz's comeback: 'Nothing is impossible if you maintain the work ethic'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/hurkacz-massu-united-cup-2026-feature","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 04:16:04 GMT","

Before the United Cup, former World No. 9 Nicolas Massu spoke with his player, Hubert Hurkacz. The Pole was readying for his first tournament in seven months thanks to a knee injury that required surgery last July.

The message from the Chilean was clear.

“Enjoy the competition again,” Massu told Hurkacz. “Look back at where you've been, and all that you passed already in the past seven months. You deserve to be here. Appreciate that. Enjoy the moment. Go step by step, not thinking too much about the results.” 

Since then, Hurkacz has made a dream start to his comeback in Sydney, earning straight-sets victories against World No. 3 Alexander Zverev and Tallon Griekspoor to help Poland reach the quarter-finals of the mixed-teams event.

“I'm really, really happy because we had difficult times. And when you are out of competition seven months — it is a lot of time — you need to be patient,” Massu said. “You need to be strong. It's not too easy because sometimes you want to just start to think about the tournaments. You are missing weeks and then there is a slow recovery.”

Although Hurkacz's game has been sharp inside Ken Rosewall Arena, claiming his 20th win against a Top-10 opponent according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, that does not mean recent months have been perfect. It has been far from it for the Pole, who in two consecutive seasons underwent knee surgery.

“It's not easy to maintain the faith all the time because the days are long, it's a lot of treatment, a lot of recovery,” Massu said. “But at the same time, I'm totally convinced — because I had this in my so many years of Tour, so many years in tennis — that at some point, if you keep strong and you believe and you work hard, you deserve it.”

Massu made clear that Hurkacz has done everything in his power to not only recover physically, but to prepare for his comeback. From Marbella and Malaga to Monaco and Poland, Hurkacz has worked exhaustively to put himself in position for moments like he has experienced in the past week.

“It's incredible, the work ethic of Hubi. He follows everything 100 per cent. If he has to do this, he does that and more,” Massu said. “It's not only on the court, it's outside of the court: how he takes care of the food, of the treatment, all the stretching. So I think that when you work like this, the [positive] things need to come back. You deserve to have these kinds of results.”





For Hurkacz every day was the same. Early mornings, late nights and a lot of hard work. There were moments of pain and fatigue. But as the coach explained, “these things are hard”.

“My experience from my life and from my tennis career is that everything that is strong against you or sometimes it is dark, at the end of the tunnel, you see the light,” Massu said. “You need to keep the faith.” 

The two-time Olympic gold medalist returned to Chile for about three months before returning to Europe in September to help the Pole resume on-court training. They took things quite slowly, prioritising listening to Hurkacz's doctors and physio. A key was to not rush. 

“Everything that we needed to do, we were doing, and we were listening to the right people,” Massu said. “We were strong in the difficult moments and I think that the whole thing for me, from my point of view, that I wanted, is to see him again on the court competing.”

One thing that has certainly not left the Pole is his serve. Hurkacz has hit 42 aces across four sets and faced one total break point against formidable opposition.

""It's a big talent,"" Massu said. ""Also for sure he works a lot. He put a lot of focus there.""

But the Chilean was also keen to point out how much of an all-around player Hurkacz is. The World No. 83 stands 6'5"", but has more than a big serve.

""I think that he's a very complete player. I still believe that he can play even on clay the same level as on hard court,"" Massu said. "" And of course, we need to improve some little details that can bring him again to fight in the top of the top. But the most important is the health, I still believe that if he's healthy, we can achieve good things.""

Hurkacz is just getting started. While he hopes to maintain his great early form this week in Sydney, the overall comeback has just begun. Massu very much believes in his charge.

“I always believe that nothing is impossible if you maintain the work ethic, if you maintain your positive mind,” Massu said. “At some point, you will recover.”

Michael Mmoh continued his statement start to 2026 on Thursday at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open, where he upset familiar foe Karen Khachanov 7-6(2), 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals.

The American qualifier notched just two wins on the ATP Tour in 2025, but with his straight-sets victory over the fourth-seeded Khachanov, he has already matched that number in the first week of the new season. It marked Mmoh's first win over a Top 20 opponent since 2023, when he also moved past Khachanov at the US Open.

Moving on! 💪Michael Mmoh takes out Khachanov 7-6 7-6 to advance in Hong Kong.#BOCHKTO2026 pic.twitter.com/0vdC3atkEk

“Funnily enough, my first ITF junior win was against Karen Khachanov, so we've been battling from the age of 14,” said Mmoh, who now leads World No. 17 Khachanov 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “He's a great guy who's had an unbelievable career, so just to share the court with him, I knew I needed to play at the highest level possible.”

Mmoh, the No. 285 in the PIF ATP Rankings, failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set, but regrouped in a tidy tie-break to advance to his seventh ATP Tour quarter-final. The 27-year-old will next face countryman Marcos Giron, who earlier upset seventh seed and defending champion Alexandre Muller 6-4, 7-6(4).

Earlier, Chinese lefty Shang Juncheng became the first player to reach all three Hong Kong quarter-finals since the ATP 250 returned in 2024. The 20-year-old hit 24 winners in his 6-3, 6-4 victory over fifth seed Lorenzo Sonego.

Shang, who missed six months of the 2025 season due to a foot injury, will next face second seed Alexander Bublik, who opened his 2026 with a laser-focused 6-3, 6-3 win over Botic van de Zandschulp.







Bublik finished 2025 with a 30-9 record since Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, highlighted by titles in Halle, Gstaad and Kitzbuehel. Now at a career-high World No. 11, the Kazakhstani doesn't seem to want to let that form slip as he starts his 2026 quest.
“We tried many things before arriving here,” Bublik said of his preseason. “You never know what's going to happen [in the first match]. We chose a tactic, we stuck to it, and I played well, so I'm really happy with the way I performed.”

Will Alex de Minaur be the next player caught in Hubert Hurkacz's United Cup serving barrage when the pair meets in Sydney on Friday?

The 28-year-old Pole has made an emphatic return from a seven-month injury layoff, firing 21 aces in each of his two-set wins over World No. 3 Alexander Zverev and Tallon Griekspoor. Backed by teammate Iga Swiatek — who has also won both of her singles matches — Team Poland, two-time defending runner-up, has surged into its third straight quarter-final.

Standing in their way is home favourite Team Australia, spearheaded by De Minaur and 19-year-old rising star Maya Joint. The tie gets underway with the women's singles at 5:30 p.m. local time.

De Minaur can draw confidence from his 2-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head edge over Hurkacz, including a win in their most recent meeting at Indian Wells last year. Since then, Hurkacz has undergone knee surgery and is competing as the No. 85 in the PIF ATP Rankings, but his performances in Sydney have underlined why he is a former Top 10 player.

After reaching the semi-finals of the Nitto ATP Finals in November, De Minaur opened his 2026 campaign with a straight-sets loss to Casper Ruud. He quickly rebounded against Czechia, however, pulling double duty to propel Australia into the quarter-finals. Hurkacz is well aware of the challenge ahead.

“Alex has been very successful in the past years,” Hurkacz said of De Minaur, who is at a career-high World No. 6. “He's really quick, moves around the court incredibly well. It's going to be a good challenge, especially with the Aussie crowd. It's going to be a lot of fun, and I'm excited for the match.”

Ace machine 😮‍💨Of course Hubi gets our @Nexo #serveoftheday!#nexo pic.twitter.com/8tQYNUTm1d

Swiatek needed just 66 minutes to dispatch Joint in their only previous meeting in Seoul last September, but the six-time major champion is not taking anything for granted. While the Australian teenager will enjoy strong home support, Swiatek may have won over a few local fans with her glowing assessment of Sydney following her three-set win against Eva Lys on Monday.

“I love being here,” Swiatek said. “I could honestly live here — I love Sydney. I wasn't sure, but I think it's becoming my favourite city in the whole world. I really have fun here.”

If the singles matches are split, the tie will be decided by a mixed doubles rubber.

Aryna Sabalenka continued her title defense Thursday, defeating Sorana Cirstea 6-3, 6-3 in 1 hour and 18 minutes to advance to the Brisbane International quarterfinals. She finished with 31 winners to just 15 unforced errors.

Aryna Sabalenka doesn't often enter a match with a losing record against an opponent on hard courts, but that was the case as she prepared to face Sorana Cirstea in the Brisbane International third round.

Brisbane: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The sample size was small -- they had met just once previously on the surface on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, a straight-sets win for Cirstea in Miami in 2023 -- but Sabalenka got her payback Thursday, defeating the Romanian 6-3, 6-3 in 1 hour and 18 minutes in front of a packed Pat Rafter Arena.

The only problem: Sabalenka doesn't remember that match. Or perhaps she blocked it out.

“Probably, it's for good [reason],"" Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. ""She's an incredible player, always pushing me really hard. Especially in the second set, it was really great from her.

“I'm super happy I was able to close this match in straight sets. I was just trying to focus on my game, on going into this match and the things I have to do to get the win.”

The victory wasn't as quick as her 48-minute win over Cristina Bucsa in the second round, but Sabalenka again looked in full control.

She opened with a break, finishing the game with a backhand winner down the line, but the 35-year-old Cirstea responded immediately and leveled the match after two games. The set stayed on serve through 2-all before Sabalenka broke at love for a 3-2 lead.

Despite Cirstea's resistance, Sabalenka would go on to convert her fourth set point to secure a third break and take the opening set.

As in the first set, Sabalenka again led 4-3 in the second and earned three break points to allow herself to all but seal the match. Cirstea remained vigilant, saving them by rattling off four straight points, but Sabalenka answered with a three-point burst of her own to finally break and move within a game of victory.

Cirstea made one last push with a break point in the next game, but Sabalenka held firm and won the final three points to close out the match.

The stats told the story: Sabalenka won just under 80% of her first-serve points and kept the ball in the court, finishing with 31 winners to just 15 unforced errors. She converted 4-of-13 break points -- not the most efficient rate -- but faced only two on her own serve.

It was still a strong week for Cirstea, who announced before the season that this would be her final year on tour. She posted straight-sets wins over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the first round and No. 14 seed Jelena Ostapenko in the second round before falling to the World No. 1.

Sabalenka advances to the quarterfinals, where she'll face No. 5 seed Madison Keys in a rematch of last year's Australian Open final.

Alexandra Eala dominated Petra Marcinko in just over an hour to secure her fourth WTA Tour quarterfinal spot. The Filipina notched an almost-flawless 6-0, 6-2 victory, where she was perfect 6-for-6 break-point conversion rate.

Alexandra Eala needed just over an hour to book a place in her fourth career WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz quarterfinal, routing Petra Marcinko 6-0, 6-2 on Thursday at the ASB Classic.

Though fourth-seeded Eala and the unseeded Marcinko were peers as juniors -- the Filipina is just seven months older than the Croatian, who was ranked World No. 1 in juniors -- the second-round matchup in New Zealand was their first singles meeting at either the international junior or professional level. And she hardly let up after jumping out to an early lead to seal her place in the last eight in 63 minutes. 

""I'm so happy with how I was able to compete and handle the different situations on court,"" said Eala, who needed 2 hours and 40 minutes to win her opening match. ""Every start of the year comes differently: new year, new story, and that goes for everybody.

""I'm happy with how I'm starting. ... It's difficult, everyone at this level gives you certain challenges, but again, I'm happy with how I'm playing.""

Other key figures from Eala's victory included: 

2: Eala is now 2-0 against players from Croatia at WTA main-draw level in her career. Her first win came Tuesday against Donna Vekic. 

6: Eala was a perfect 6-for-6 on break-point opportunities in the match. She also faced six break points herself, but saved five of them. 

7: The World No. 53 started the match by winning the first seven games. She ended the match by winning six in a row, from an early break deficit at 2-1. 

11: Marcinko came into the tilt having won 11 straight matches. She ended 2025 by winning two ITF World Tennis Tour events in the United Arab Emirates -- a W75 in Fujairah and a W100 in Dubai -- before she beat Camila Osorio in the Auckland first round.

12: The World No. 82 won just 12 points in seven service games overall -- a 31% clip.

For a spot in the semifinals, Eala will face No. 5 seed Magda Linette, who defeated unseeded Italian Elisabetta Cocciaretto in three sets, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3. She hopes to beat the 33-year-old for the first time, having lost their two previous matches -- including a match on grass in Nottingham last year.

Madison Keys came from a set and 4-2 down in the Brisbane International third round to defeat Diana Shnaider in three tiebreaks -- the first triple-tiebreak scoreline of her career, and the 12th on tour this decade. Jessica Pegula followed her with her second three-set win of the year.

No. 5 seed Madison Keys was pushed to the limit by No. 12 seed Diana Shnaider in a Brisbane International third-round thriller, coming from a set and 4-2 down to squeak through 6-7(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(5) in 2 hours and 59 minutes.

The result was just the 12th triple-tiebreak scoreline on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz this decade, and the first time either Keys or Shnaider had played a match comprising three tiebreaks. Both players received medical timeouts during the contest -- Keys was treated off court after winning the second set, while Shnaider received treatment on her left wrist trailing 3-2 in the decider. Keys finished with 38 winners, including nine aces, to Shnaider's 17.

Keys' victory sets up a quarterfinal matchup against No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka -- a rematch of last year's Australian Open final, which the American edged 6-3, 2-6, 7-5. Sabalenka leads the overall head-to-head 5-2, including a 6-0, 6-1 revenge in the Indian Wells semifinals.

""That had a little bit of everything,"" Keys remarked in her on-court interview. ""It's good to start the year off with a little bit of drama -- so glad we got that out of the way. Diana played such a great match, I had to come back and figure out how to get myself back into that match.

""It was trying to stay in every single point, and I knew if I could give myself an opportunity, if I had the chance, then momentum switches so quickly. Really trying to keep the score as close as possible and give myself the best opportunity, then when that opportunity finally came round, to take advantage of that.""

Shnaider, who had the edge the longer the pair's baseline battles went on, broke first in each set -- only for Keys to strike back and force a tiebreak. Though Shnaider was too solid in the first set, by the end of the second set the American had cleaned up her more errors and begun to land some forehand blows of her own.

In the third set, showing a greater willingness to approach the net, Keys won the longest consecutive streak of games in the match as she won three in a row to lead 3-1. From that point on, the dynamic switched, and it was the reigning Australian Open champion who had to hold off her opponent's fightback. Down 5-4, Shnaider saved the first two match points against her with service winners, but Keys' volleying prowess proved key in snatching victory in the tiebreak.

Keys improved to 3-0 overall against Shnaider, having also won in the 2024 Miami second round and 2025 Queen's quarterfinals.

Keys was followed on Show Court 1 by compatriot Jessica Pegula, who notched yet another three-set victory as she came from 2-0 down in the third set to defeat Dayana Yastremska 5-7, 6-2, 6-3. Thirteen of Pegula's last 15 matches, including both her 2026 outings, have gone the distance; she has won 10 of those.

Yastremska's form oscillated throughout -- the Ukrainian fired 20 winners in the first set, but just four in the second and 12 in the third while tallying 61 unforced errors overall. Pegula remained steady, resetting after dropping the first set from 5-3 up, and found 18 winners to 26 unforced errors. The former US Open finalist also saved her best for the home stretch, stealing some crucial points from Yastremska with anticipation.

Afterward, Pegula joked about having to wait for Keys to finish her marathon victory.

""At least I didn't go that long,"" she said while glancing at the 2-hour, 16-minute time on her match clock. ""When she won the second set I was like, uh ... But I guess if I'm gonna wait for somebody, I guess it's OK that she won the second set!""

It doesn't appear as if Elena Rybakina used the offseason to cool off after her blazing finish to 2025, as she defeated No. 15 Paula Badosa in straight sets in the third round of the Brisbane International. She's now won 13 matches in a row.

If the early returns on Elena Rybakina's 2026 season are any indication, the rest of the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz should be on high alert.

Brisbane: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Rybakina ended 2025 on a tear, sneaking into the WTA Finals as the last qualifier before going on to win the year-end championships. She appears to have carried that momentum into the new year, following a flawless second-round win over Zhang Shuai with an equally impressive straight-sets victory over No. 15 seed Paula Badosa.

The 2024 Brisbane champion needed just 1 hour and 25 minutes to defeat the Spaniard 6-3, 6-2 at Pat Rafter Arena on Thursday, booking her spot in the quarterfinals.

“It's always tough battles against Paula,” Rybakina said after the match. “She has great shots, she plays really fast and has a very good serve, so it was not easy. I started a little bit slow and was struggling with my serve too. But I'm happy that I managed to win.”

Rybakina did indeed get off to a slow start. Badosa won the first seven points of the match and eight of the first nine to capture an early break and a 2-0 lead. But Rybakina quickly steadied herself, breaking right back and fending off Badosa's further advances to level the set at 2-all.

After Badosa saved a break point and held in the next game, Rybakina rattled off four straight games to close out the opening set.

That surge became part of a run of seven consecutive games, as Rybakina raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set. Badosa briefly halted the slide with a hold for 3-1, but it wasn't enough. By match end, Rybakina had won nine of the last 11 games.

“I was trying to focus one [game] at a time,” Rybakina said. “The serve was not helping so much, so I had to manage the points and stay aggressive on the return. I still have a lot of things to work on for the next match, but hopefully it will be better.”

Here are some takeaways from Rybakina's win over Badosa:

Streaks remain intact: Three streaks continued for Rybakina on Thursday.

Consummate ball-striking: On a day where she struggled on serve, Rybakina's ball-striking carried her. Whether she was playing her forehand or her backhand, it didn't matter, as she struck every ball with conviction, especially on big points.

She sealed the first set with a forehand winner on set point, then opened the second set with a hold before drilling a backhand down the line to convert a break point in the next game. She hit 13 winners to just 7 unforced errors in the second set and finished with 24 winners and 21 unforced errors overall.

What's ahead: Rybakina will face No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova in the quarterfinals. The head-to-head is level at 1-1, but their last meeting came all the way back in 2023 at Indian Wells.

Rybakina won that quarterfinal match in three sets.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Audi have ticked off a milestone moment ahead of the 2026 season, having successfully completed their first fire-up.

Audi have confirmed that they have successfully fired up their 2026 F1 car for the first time, marking a milestone moment as the manufacturer prepares for their debut following their takeover of the former Kick Sauber outfit.

The fire-up – which took place at the team's Hinwil facility on December 19, 2025 – was the first time that the Audi power unit has been run while installed in the chassis.

Audi have heralded the moment as being the product of a collaboration between their powertrain division in Neuburg, Germany, alongside the chassis team in Hinwil, Switzerland, and the new Technical Centre in Bicester, UK.

The milestone also signals the latest step in the outfit's preparations for 2026, a season in which a wave of new technical regulations will come into effect.

Gernot Dollner, CEO of AUDI AG and Chairman of the Board of Audi Motorsport AG, commented: “For Audi, entering Formula 1 is a key part of our brand's ongoing renewal. This milestone is a clear demonstration of our ‘Vorsprung durch Technik' ambition.

“It is the result of seamless teamwork and a relentless pursuit of excellence that will serve as a guiding example for the entire Audi organisation. This project is a catalyst for change, fostering pride, identity, and enthusiasm.

“With the fire-up, the hard work of the teams in Hinwil, Neuburg and Bicester now truly comes to life, marking the beginning of an exciting new chapter in Audi's motorsport history.”

Mattia Binotto, Head of the Audi F1 Project, added: “A fire-up is always a special moment, but this one marks a new beginning. It is the tangible result of our collective ambition and the dedicated work of our teams in Neuburg and Hinwil.

“Seeing everything come together for the first time gives the entire project incredible energy. We have built a solid foundation for what will be a long journey, defined by our relentless drive to improve.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal of the Audi Revolut F1 Team, also said: “This successful fire-up is a critical milestone that validates the quality of the work and collaboration across all departments.

“It energises the entire team and provides a clear focus as we prepare for the next phases of development, including the moment we first bring the car to track. This achievement brings our first race in Melbourne into sharp focus, and we will build on this foundation as one united team.”

Audi will host their global launch event in Berlin on January 20, where their full race livery will be presented before the team join the rest of the field for a private pre-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya from January 26-30.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Arvid Lindblad is the latest on a long list of drivers to represent the Red Bull family in Formula 1.

Arvid Lindblad will become the next driver to take to the grid for a Red Bull-owned team in F1, with the Briton stepping up from F2 to Racing Bulls for the 2026 season. But what about those who went before him – and where have they all ended up?

As Lindblad gets set for his rookie campaign, F1.com runs through the list of Red Bull talents that climbed the ranks to represent either the drinks company's senior F1 team or their aforementioned sister outfit, who previously went by the names of AlphaTauri and Toro Rosso.

Before committing to a full-time F1 entry, Red Bull had a record of sponsoring teams and backing young motorsport talent – beginning with Austrian drivers Christian Klien, Patrick Friesacher and Bernhard Auinger, and a dedicated ‘Red Bull Junior Team' that competed in Formula 3000 between 1999 and 2003.

In 2004, Klien became the first Red Bull junior to compete in F1 by landing a drive at Jaguar. He remained onboard for the 2005 season when Red Bull took over the car manufacturer's entry and made their F1 debut, albeit sharing a seat with another rising star in Vitantonio Liuzzi.

Occasional points finishes were enough to keep a drive alongside David Coulthard into 2006, but that would be his last full-time campaign in F1. Several test and reserve roles followed, including at Honda and BMW Sauber, before a final trio of race Grand Prix outings for backmarkers Hispania in 2010.

Klien embarked on a career in sportscars following his Red Bull exit, finishing third in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2008, and has remained active until recent years – dovetailing those duties with F1 commentary and punditry for Austrian television.

As touched on above, Liuzzi also had a shot in a Red Bull cockpit in 2005 after winning the previous year's F3000 title (the equivalent of F2 back then), but despite scoring points on his debut at the San Marino Grand Prix, that stint lasted just four race weekends.

Liuzzi was given a second chance to prove himself at Red Bull's new junior team, Toro Rosso, from the 2006 season. He stayed there for two years, spending a handful of races alongside future four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel, before being dropped.

After a year-and-a-half out, Liuzzi returned to F1 action with Force India midway through 2009 as a substitute for Giancarlo Fisichella (who had been signed by Ferrari to replace the injured Felipe Massa and under-performing stand-in Luca Badoer). He completed a full season in 2010 – achieving a personal best haul of 21 points – and then switched to Hispania for 2011.

Liuzzi went on to race in a host of different motorsport categories after his time in F1, from V8 Supercars to Super Formula, and remains a paddock presence to this day thanks to him acting as driver steward for F1's governing body, the FIA.

While Liuzzi won the 2004 F3000 title, fellow Red Bull-backed racer Robert Doornbos classified third in the standings, the year he also started his F1 career by conducting test duties – and making Friday practice outings – for Jordan.

Doornbos completed more practice runs with Eddie Jordan's squad in 2005 before switching to Minardi mid-season and replacing Friesacher on the grid. He then slotted into Red Bull's reserve ranks for 2006, supporting Coulthard and Klien, and taking the latter's seat at the final three Grands Prix of the year.

A spell in America saw him finish third in the Champ Car World Series standings, and have a crack at IndyCar, paving the way for a second career as a respected motorsport pundit in his home country of the Netherlands, amongst plenty of business interests.

Scott Speed was America's next F1 hope when he graduated to the top echelon in 2006 via an impressive rise through the single-seater ranks – the California native battling ulcerative colitis (a form of inflammatory bowel disease) along the way.

His time in the championship lasted just one-and-a-half seasons, however, via run-ins with established Red Bull racer Coulthard and Toro Rosso team boss Franz Tost, and questions over an “outrageous” ego that was tamed post-F1.

Speed later tackled NASCAR and Rallycross back home in the United States (fracturing his vertebrae in a heavy 2019 crash), while maintaining his links to the Red Bull brand, and now spends most of his time helping upcoming drivers maximise their potential on and off the track.

Speed's mid-2007 exit from Toro Rosso opened up a spot for the highly rated Vettel, who had already caught the eye during practice runs and a point-scoring debut – in place of the injured Robert Kubica – with BMW Sauber.

After a tricky start, Vettel found his feet and began to show the F1 world what he was made of, scoring a brilliant wet-weather victory on Toro Rosso's home soil at Monza and earning promotion to the senior Red Bull team for 2009.

Making the most of Adrian Newey's technical genius, Vettel racked up a huge number of pole positions and victories over the next few years, claiming back-to-back Drivers' Championship titles from 2010 to 2013, and cementing his legendary status.

A blockbuster move to Ferrari followed in 2015, but he ultimately missed out on adding another crown across six rollercoaster campaigns at the famous Italian marque, with one last hurrah coming via a two-year spell at Aston Martin in 2021-22.

He has since embarked on various initiatives to improve the world we live in, including a ‘Buzzin' Corner' biodiversity project in 2023 and a recycled helmet creation in 2024, while 2025 featured a Race4Women event in Saudi Arabia and the birth of the ‘F1FOREST'.

Following Vettel's Red Bull promotion, Toro Rosso became a team of ‘Sebastiens' in 2009 when GP2 race winner Buemi joined incumbent Bourdais, but the Swiss racer would not follow that path to the main team and championship triumphs.

Buemi lasted three seasons – which featured some solid points finishes but few stand-out moments – before Toro Rosso overhauled their driver line-up again, forcing him to look outside F1 and begin a new chapter in the endurance world.

He enjoyed plenty of success over the years that followed, winning the World Endurance Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times (two alongside Fernando Alonso), while also returning to single-seaters in the electric Formula E series – earning the title in 2015-16.

Alongside this, Buemi has retained links to Red Bull Racing in a test, reserve and development capacity, playing a crucial role on their simulator and providing support to the F1 team wherever he could over the last decade or so.

Buemi shared most of his F1 journey with Jaime Alguersuari, who replaced Bourdais part-way through 2009 and became the sport's youngest-ever driver at 19 years, four months and three days old – Max Verstappen, Lance Stroll, Kimi Antonelli and Oliver Bearman dipping below that marker since.

Alguersuari enjoyed a particularly strong run of form in 2011, scoring points in seven out of 11 mid-season races, including P7 finishes in Italy and South Korea, but it was not enough to convince Red Bull chiefs to keep him in their programme.

After missing out on a seat elsewhere on the F1 grid, Alguersuari made sporadic outings in German GT, Brazilian Stock Cars and Formula E, but he soon decided to retire and focus on his other passion of music production – the Spaniard now performing as DJ ‘Squire'.

With both Buemi and Alguersuari pushed out, Jean-Eric Vergne formed half of another all-new Toro Rosso line-up in 2012, having won the British F3 title, finished second in Formula Renault 3.5 and performed well during F1 test and practice runs.

Like Buemi, Vergne's career would last three seasons, across which Red Bull were never quite convinced to promote him to the senior team. For 2014, it was Daniel Ricciardo who replaced the out-going Mark Webber, and for 2015, it was Daniil Kvyat who took Vettel's spot.

Again, like Buemi, Vergne has combined Formula E and endurance racing since dropping off the F1 grid – winning the electric championship crown in 2017-18 and 2018-19, and continuing into the 2025-26 season, while becoming a regular at Le Mans.

1 / 2

Alguersuari became the then-youngest driver in F1 history when he debuted in 2009

Ricciardo made his F1 debut with Hispania – as team mate to Liuzzi – at the 2011 British Grand Prix, completing half a season in back-of-the-grid machinery before Red Bull bosses sent him to Toro Rosso alongside Formula Renault 3.5 rival Vergne.

When fellow Australian Webber retired from F1, Ricciardo got the nod to replace him for the start of the turbo-hybrid era in 2014, having shaded that intra-team battle with Vergne, and he soon made his mark by claiming a trio of Grand Prix wins across the season.

Ricciardo made Red Bull his home after that, winning more races in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and forming an effective partnership with future champion Verstappen. However, for 2019, as the Dutchman's standing inside the team grew, Ricciardo opted for a switch to Renault.

Two years with the French manufacturer failed to deliver the results both parties had been hoping for, prompting another move to McLaren where, despite winning a dramatic 2021 Italian Grand Prix, Ricciardo generally struggled next to Lando Norris and lost his seat to Oscar Piastri.

After a spell on the sidelines, Ricciardo was given one more chance to show that he still had what it took to fight with the very best, heading to AlphaTauri as Nyck de Vries' replacement in mid-2023, but he could not quite do enough to earn his “dream” of a Red Bull return.

Ricciardo went off-grid in 2025, before emerging to explain how he was going through “a bit of self-exploration” while “trying to figure out who I am” beyond racing. Later, he became a Global Ambassador for the Ford Racing division, and effectively confirmed his retirement.

GP3 champion Kvyat was fast-tracked to F1 in 2014, hopping into the Toro Rosso seat vacated by Red Bull-bound Ricciardo, and he took another leap at the end of his rookie season when he replaced Ferrari-bound Vettel at the senior team for 2015.

Kvyat out-scored Ricciardo over the course of their first season together, but an up-and-down start to 2016 – mixed with Red Bull's desire to promote Verstappen – saw the Russian swiftly sent back to Toro Rosso in dramatic circumstances.

Despite doing all he could to rebuild his career and find a way into a Red Bull seat again, with his efforts yielding a podium at the rain-hit 2019 German Grand Prix, Kvyat had to settle for a few more campaigns at the sister team before bowing out of the sport.

Post-F1, Kvyat has tried his hand at several championships, from NASCAR to the World Endurance Championship, while he is also involved in the development of the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League, serving as a human benchmark.

The next cycle of Toro Rosso drivers came in 2015, when the ousted Vergne and new Red Bull racer Kvyat were replaced by Carlos Sainz and Verstappen – the Spaniard stepping up after beating Pierre Gasly to the 2014 Formula Renault 3.5 title.

Sainz and Verstappen pushed each other hard in the intra-team stakes, but Red Bull's hierarchy favoured the Dutch youngster when it came to a spot at the senior team which, as outlined above, went his way in the early stages of the 2016 season.

While Verstappen settled in at Red Bull, Sainz ploughed on at Toro Rosso and, with no sign of a promotion on the horizon, he looked elsewhere – joining Renault towards the end of 2017 and later enjoying a competitive stint at McLaren as Norris' new team mate.

Then, for 2021, Sainz was poached by Ferrari to replace four-time champion Vettel, raising his stock further alongside the Scuderia's long-time protégé Charles Leclerc by earning a maiden pole position and Grand Prix victory.

Sainz stayed with Ferrari for four seasons, winning three more races, before a bombshell announcement dropped that Lewis Hamilton would be taking his place from 2025 – eventually sending him in Williams' direction, where he has already contributed heavily to their rebuild.

As Sainz transitioned to Renault, then McLaren, then Ferrari, then Williams, Verstappen stayed put at Red Bull, building on an incredible race-winning debut for the team at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix to become a consistent front-runner.

When Red Bull and Honda produced a competitive enough package in 2021, Verstappen did not need to be asked twice – the Dutchman taking the fight to Mercedes rival Hamilton and ultimately coming out on top after a final-round showdown in Abu Dhabi.

Plenty more was to come from Verstappen, who won the next three titles on the bounce – under F1's ground effect era – to equal Vettel and Red Bull's previous championship-winning run, and write his name into the history books as one of F1's greatest drivers.

The 2025 season was tougher for Verstappen, with Red Bull lacking pace and consistency compared to rivals McLaren, but a remarkable comeback over the second half of the year saw him fall just two points short of what would have been a record-equalling fifth straight crown.

Verstappen is now preparing to enter a 10th full season as a Red Bull driver, while exploring other motorsport interests outside F1, having set up his own endurance team and triumphed on his GT3 race debut at the Nurburgring Nordschleife last year.

As mentioned earlier in this piece, Gasly's F1 break came in the final rounds of 2017 – Toro Rosso making several late-season changes when they dropped Kvyat, allowed Sainz to join Renault early and also tried out endurance star Brendon Hartley.

Gasly could not get a point on the board across those five outings, but he impressed in the early stages of his first complete season with a fine run to fourth at the Bahrain Grand Prix, and starred again with drives to seventh in Monaco and sixth in Hungary.

With Ricciardo heading to Renault, Red Bull called on Gasly to join Verstappen at the senior team in 2019, but his time there lasted just 12 races – the Frenchman struggling to get comfortable in a second seat that many drivers have found challenging since then.

Gasly enjoyed a rebirth on his return to Toro Rosso/AlphaTauri, pipping Hamilton to second at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix, claiming an emotional home win for the team at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, and reaching the rostrum again at the 2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

For 2023, though, Gasly left the Red Bull family, linking up with Alpine and forming an all-French driver pairing alongside old karting rival Esteban Ocon. Following the latter's move to Haas, Gasly became the de facto team leader as ‘Team Enstone' push to get back to winning ways.

Hartley had an unusual journey to the F1 grid, initially climbing the single-seater ranks with Red Bull support, and taking on test/reserve duties for the senior and sister teams, but then failing to kick on in Formula Renault 3.5 and GP2, and heading for sportscars.

It looked as though the moment had passed until late-2017 when, in his own words, the “somewhat of a surprise” chance arrived amid Toro Rosso's reshuffling of seats – those four outings paving the way for a full-time drive the following year.

However, while Hartley made it into the points on three occasions in 2018, he was comprehensively beaten by team mate Gasly, leading to the New Zealander being dropped from Red Bull's roster again and going back to endurance competition.

Hartley put that disappointment behind him to take back-to-back World Endurance Championship titles in 2022 and 2023 (when he shared the cockpit with Buemi), adding to previous triumphs in 2015 and 2017, while he is also a three-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Alex Albon was another driver who appeared to have missed the F1 boat following a low-key 2017 F2 season, but he returned to the feeder series in 2018 to take four wins and finish third in the standings behind George Russell and Norris – peers who rated him highly from his karting days.

Dropped by Red Bull several years before, Albon rejoined the programme – backing out of a planned Formula E deal in the process – to join Kvyat at Toro Rosso for 2019, becoming only the second Thai driver to race in F1 after Prince Birabongse Bhanudej Bhanubandh (better known as Prince Bira) in the 1950s.

He started well, scoring points in five of his first 12 Grands Prix, including a best result of sixth in Germany – form that proved strong enough to earn a rapid mid-season promotion to the senior team as Gasly's replacement.

Albon was a consistent points scorer at Red Bull, but again struggled to match Verstappen's relentless pace, meaning his time was also up after just a season-and-a-half – Red Bull demoting him to a reserve role for 2021 and signing Sergio Perez in his place.

After a year on the sidelines, which included plenty of hours in Red Bull's simulator, Albon secured an F1 return with Williams, going from strength to strength over the last four seasons and arguably putting together his most competitive campaign to date in 2025.

Backed by Honda through his single-seater career, Yuki Tsunoda arrived on the F1 scene in 2021, joining Gasly at AlphaTauri – powered by the manufacturer's engines – after taking the Japanese F4 title, winning in F3 and finishing third in the F2 standings.

Tsunoda earned plenty of praise for a points-scoring debut, and ended his debut season with a personal best P4 finish, but dotted between those results were costly incidents, early Qualifying exits and missed opportunities, as well as a fair few radio outbursts.

He received more time than some of those before him to round off those rough edges, and at the conclusion of the 2024 campaign was given an “outstanding” report card from Laurent Mekies, who had taken over from Tost as AlphaTauri's team boss.

While there were clear signs of growth on Tsunoda's side, there was no room at the Red Bull inn for several years thanks to the continuing Verstappen/Perez partnership, and when a position finally opened up for 2025, super-sub Liam Lawson got the call.

Another sequence of second seat musical chairs soon followed, with Lawson and Tsunoda swapping places just two rounds into the season, but the Japanese racer – like so many before him – found life difficult alongside reigning champion Verstappen.

Tsunoda kept his seat until the end of the campaign, but ultimately lost out to Isack Hadjar when it came to a 2026 drive, meaning test and reserve duties – for both the Red Bull Racing and Racing Bulls outfits – are now in store.

Lawson had been knocking on the F1 door for several years when a surprise, last-minute opportunity popped up at the 2023 Dutch Grand Prix, where regular AlphaTauri driver Ricciardo broke his hand in a practice accident.

Dealing with a new car and tricky, mixed weather conditions, Lawson performed admirably over the course of that debut weekend, before well and truly sending a message in Singapore when he pipped Verstappen to a spot in Q3 and raced his way to ninth.

With Ricciardo returning to action in Austin, Lawson's stand-in run was soon over, but he found himself back in action almost exactly one year later – this time replacing the Australian on performance grounds for the final six rounds of 2024.

Lawson and Tsunoda were evenly matched during that period, but when Red Bull decided to part ways with Perez, the New Zealander was favoured for a promotion, given what he had been displaying with significantly less experience.

It was a dream that quickly turned into a nightmare, however, with Lawson lasting just two weekends before being unceremoniously sent back to Racing Bulls. Since then, he has rebuilt his reputation via several points-scoring displays, and will continue at the sister team into F1's new era of regulations.

Already mentioned several times in this feature, given the intertwining careers of drivers involved in Red Bull's junior programme, last on the list is Hadjar – the Frenchman debuting at Racing Bulls in 2025 after finishing second to Gabriel Bortoleto in F2.

Hadjar's start to life in F1 was a painful one, having spun at the start of the formation lap for the season opener in Australia, but he bounced back in style to put together a superb rookie term and leave no doubt in Red Bull's mind over his future potential.

Points were scored in five out of seven Grands Prix between Japan and Spain, before Hadjar made headlines at the Dutch Grand Prix when he qualified fourth and finished a high-flying third behind championship challengers Piastri and Verstappen.

Hadjar continued to impress with more Q3 appearances and points, and a fierce determination to get better and better, making his promotion to Red Bull for 2026 a formality. Now he will be aiming to break the trend of his predecessors and stay there.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Lando Norris believes that Lewis Hamilton can recover from a tricky first season with Ferrari – and hopes to have more chances to battle the seven-time World Champion.

Lando Norris would welcome the prospect of having more battles with Lewis Hamilton in 2026, with the McLaren driver backing the seven-time World Champion to bounce back following a tough year.

The 2025 campaign marked Hamilton's debut for Ferrari and proved to be a tricky campaign for the Briton, a season in which he failed to stand on the podium for the first time in his F1 career.

Norris, meanwhile, became McLaren's first Drivers' Champion since Hamilton in 2008, meaning that he will be defending his title in 2026.

With the season ahead posing some unknowns amid the introduction of new technical regulations, Norris hopes to have the opportunity to fight against several of his rivals – including Hamilton.

“We've had a good amount of battles already,” the 26-year-old told Sky Sports F1. “I would love to race a bit more with Lewis.

“Obviously, Ferrari struggled a lot more this year than I think everyone was expecting. Lewis has proved himself to be probably the best of all time. Everyone knows if anyone can bounce back from difficult years, it's Mr Hamilton, and I would love to race against him more.”

Norris has relished the chance to compete against Hamilton during his time in the sport, as well as other World Champions and reputable names.

“It's always a privilege that I get to race against someone that is the best in the world,” the British driver said. “You have got a good amount of those guys. You have Fernando [Alonso], Lewis, Max [Verstappen].

“There's a lot of us that want to climb in the footsteps of these other guys. George [Russell] and Oscar [Piastri] are two of those and there's so many guys on the grid.”

While the new rules may present a degree of uncertainty, Norris is embracing the possibility of others trying to challenge him for the championship.

“Next year, everyone's got an opportunity,” he explained. “Everyone's looking forward to it. People want to come to take my crown, and I want to try to retain it. And I look forward to that battle.""

The anchor's first official broadcast as anchor improves a bit on the network's season average but still trails ABC and NBC by sizable margins.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	The ratings for Tony Dokoupil's debut as anchor of the CBS Evening News are … fine.


	The Jan. 5 edition of CBS' nightly newscast improved some on the show's season averages, but it did not meaningfully close the gap between CBS and network rivals ABC and NBC. CBS has for years ranked a distant third in the 6:30 p.m. newscast ratings.




	Dokoupil's first weeknight turn in the Evening News anchor chair drew 4.37 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, and 596,000 adults 25-54, considered the key demographic for newscasts. (He actually made his debut a little ahead of schedule on Saturday, Jan. 3, following the U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.)

	The 4.37 million viewers for Monday's CBS Evening News is up about 9 percent from its season average of 4.02 million. The 596,000 adults 25-54 who watched Monday's show improved by 20 percent vs. a season average of about 498,500.


	Both figures, however, trail ABC and NBC by a considerable amount. ABC's World News Tonight, per usual, led the 6:30 p.m. network rankings Monday with 8.24 million viewers, and the NBC Nightly News had 7.21 million. NBC led the 25-54 demographic with just under 1.1 million viewers in that age range, while ABC drew 1.02 million.


	One night of a newscast that runs about 250 days each year is not predictive of much, obviously, but Dokoupil's debut has drawn special scrutiny because his hiring was one of the most consequential moves by Bari Weiss, whose first weeks at the network have generated considerable controversy. Dokoupil's tenure as Evening News anchor will presumably be measured in months and years, and longer-term numbers will tell a more complete story.

	











	Dokoupil was named the anchor of the CBS Evening News in December, with CBS News editor-in-chief saying at the time that the former CBS Mornings co-host would help win back viewers' trust. “Americans hungry for fairness will see that on display night after night,” Weiss said in a statement. He replaced John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois in the anchor chair.


	Both Dokoupil and Weiss have drawn some criticism for the anchor's video, released a few days before he took over as anchor, in which he said news media has “put too much weight on the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on [everyday viewers].” He also pledged that the viewers would come first for him. “Not advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests. And, yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS. I report for you.”

The 'Our Games' teaser will run on the first night of NBC's Olympics coverage and during the Super Bowl pregame show, with a shortened spot set to debut during Sunday's NFL wildcard game.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	NBCUniversal is turning to Matt Damon to hype up Olympic fandom.


	Damon, who will play the legendary Greek king Odysseus in Christopher Nolan's upcoming adaptation of The Odyssey for NBCU's Universal Pictures, is set to star in a new campaign for the company's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics coverage.




	“It's not just sports. This is cinema,” says Jenny Storms, the CMO for NBCUniversal television and streaming, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “It is a cinematic Olympics. Italy is a character where star power is really meeting Team USA, and that's where we're definitely going to continue to push the envelope, especially going into L.A.”

	The “Our Games” campaign, which includes multiple promo spots and teasers, sees Damon standing on the top of an Italian mountain (it was actually shot on the ILM Stage on the company's lot in Universal City), as footage of Olympic athletes past and present play (including the 1980 U.S. Olympic men's hockey team, Mikaela Shiffrin, Lindsey Vonn, Jordan Stolz and Ilia Malinin).

	A cut-down promo version will debut during this weekend's NFL wildcard game, with the full-length teaser set to air during the first night of Olympics primetime coverage and a shorter version during the Super Bowl pregame show.


	“The hero's journey, facing trials, enduring sacrifice, persevering against all odds,” Damon says in the initial spot. “An epic quest to fulfill one's destiny, has led here, to northern Italy, where the story continues.”

	











	Watch:


	Storms notes that NBCU's TV and sports team works closely with Donna Langley's Universal Pictures business, and the timing, location and themes of The Odyssey aligned perfectly with what they were trying to accomplish with their Olympic promotional plans.


	“We have a really incredible partnership with Universal Pictures internally, that close connection with that organization gives us really an unmatched opportunity and access to not only the world's biggest stars, but also helps us tie in with the most talked-about films that are coming forward,” Storms says. “This decade-long voyage of Odysseus, it's about grit and ingenuity, and the Winter Games are absolutely full of those arcs. This is a perfect connection when you talk about athletes solving problems in the moment and the world is watching. That's where this Damon piece really makes it feel epic and human all at the same time. And so we're excited about this one to really land now that some of the Odyssey pieces are out there, and that people can start to see those threads and bring them together.”


	NBCU has been making good use of the ILM Stage for its Olympic promos, which have included stars like Ray Romano, Sebastian Maniscalco, Dua Lipa, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, Glenn Powell, and Scarlett Johansson.


	“Another learning coming out of Paris was consumers want to be immersed in the city and in the country, and Italy is a co-star here they are a huge part and a character of these Olympics, whether it's food, fashion or anything else,” Storms says. “How do we bring Italy into these spots? The best way to do it has been through that ILM Stage … they feel like the characters, the athletes, are there in front of the Duomo and things like that, but it also provides us that opportunity of bigness, it is used in major films, motion pictures.”

	











	And the Milan-Cortina Olympics, with their Italian setting and high stakes, are a perfect place to bring that bigness to life within NBCU's sports portfolio.


	“For night one of the Olympics, we want to make a bold statement about these Games and their power to connect us through the inspiring stories of the world's greatest athletes.” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “Matt Damon, one of entertainment's most incredible storytellers, artfully weaves themes of dedication, sacrifice and inspiration into the heart of this tease, setting the stage for what will be the most unifying event in the world and an unforgettable 17 days of competition.”

'This is a company building with intention ... while staying deeply connected to culture,' says the former Motown Records chairwoman and CEO.


													By
												

	Gail Mitchell



Ethiopia Habtemariam is stepping back into the music industry arena as president of music at HYBE America, Billboard can exclusively report. Habtemariam previously served as chairwoman and CEO of Motown Records before exiting that post in 2022.


	Habtemariam, whose appointment is effective immediately, will assist in advancing HYBE America's “longterm strategy, spearheading A&R and artist development initiatives across the company's label ecosystem and identifying new opportunities at the intersection of music, culture and fandom,” as noted in a press announcement. In addition, she will play a pivotal role in broadening HYBE America's presence in Atlanta, where its Quality Control label is headquartered, calling the city “a global epicenter of R&B and hip-hop, further strengthening Quality Control's presence and impact as Atlanta's premier music company.”


	Those initiatives are in tune with the South Korean music company's burgeoning presence in the U.S. market and its genre expansion beyond K-Pop. HYBE launched its Latin American division in 2023 and acquired hip-hop label Quality Control Music the same year. In addition, Habtemariam's new appointment reunites the music executive with Quality Control Music co-founders COO Kevin “Coach K” Lee and CEO Pierre “P” Thomas. While at Motown, she orchestrated a joint venture between QC and Motown in 2015, developing and overseeing the careers of artists such as Migos, Lil Baby, City Girls and Lil Yachty.


	Based in Atlanta and Los Angeles, Habtemariam will report to HYBE America chairman and CEO Isaac Lee. In announcing her appointment, Lee said, “Ethiopia is a once-in-a-generation leader whose impact on artists, songwriters, culture and the music business is undeniable. Her vision, taste and strategic insight make her uniquely suited to help shape the next chapter of HYBE America as we continue building a future-facing entertainment company centered on artists and fans.”


	Under the HYBE banner, Lee also oversees Big Machine Label Group and the company's investments with Universal Music Group in artists such as KATSEYE. As president of music, Habtemariam will also collaborate closely with UMG.


	“I've long admired how HYBE America approaches artists, fans and the future of entertainment,” said Habtemariam in a statement. “This is a company building with intention and investing for the long term while staying deeply connected to culture. I'm excited to contribute my experience as HYBE America continues to shape what's next for music on a global scale.”


	Habtemariam was promoted to chairwoman and CEO of Motown in 2021 after six years serving as president of the iconic label. During her term as chair/CEO, Motown began operating as a standalone label with a roster that included Vince Staples. In addition to partnering with Quality Control Music under Habtemariam's watch, Motown signed Leon Thomas and NBA YoungBoy.


	“Working with Ethiopia again feels full circle,” Coach K said in a statement. “From the early days in Atlanta, we built something special at Quality Control, and it means a lot to see that legacy continue in this next chapter.”


	Added Thomas, “Ethiopia and I have a long history of working together, pushing boundaries and breaking barriers in this industry. Her passion for artists, commitment to culture and deep understanding of the music landscape make her an extraordinary leader. I'm excited for what we will build together in this next chapter.”


	During her more than two-decade tenure with Motown parent company Universal Music Group, Habtemariam held senior executive posts with Capitol Music Group and Universal Music Publishing Group. Advancing from creative manager to president of urban music & co-head of creative at UMPG, she oversaw signings that included Chris Brown, Theron Thomas, J. Cole, Justin Bieber, Ciara, Jhené Aiko and Hit-Boy.

The Romantic Tour will feature guests Anderson .Paak, RAYE and more.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Bruno Mars is gearing up to bring a little romance to cities all around the world, and Anderson .Paak, RAYE and more big names are coming along with him.


	The superstar revealed on Thursday morning (Jan. 8) that his Romantic Tour will kick off in April following the release of his newly announced The Romantic album. Running through mid-October, the trek will find Mars playing stadiums across North America, Canada and Europe.

	











	His Silk Sonic bandmate will be a featured guest at all of the shows, while “Where Is My Husband!” singer RAYE, Victoria Monét and Leon Thomas will take turns as supporting acts on different dates.


	Fans can now sign up for a ticket presale, which starts Jan. 14 on Mars' website. The general sale begins the day after.


	Mars' tour news comes on the heels of his announcement that, after 10 years, he's finally coming back with his fourth solo album. The Romantic will drop Feb. 27, a full decade after his last LP, 2016's 24K Magic.


	But even though it's been a while since he released a solo full-length, the 16-time Grammy winner has been anything but unproductive in recent years. With .Paak, he formed Silk Sonic in 2021, and the duo scored a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 that same year with “Leave the Door Open.” In 2025 alone, Mars closed out with two of the biggest hits of the year, with his Lady Gaga duet “Die With a Smile” finishing at No. 1 on Billboard‘s year-end Hot 100 chart and ROSÉ collaboration “APT.” coming in at No. 9.

Co-Business Editor


Paramount Skydance today reaffirmed its $30 a share all cash offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, declining to raise its bid.


	The company led by David Ellison said it “notes [WBD's] decision not to engage on Paramount's fully financed all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD” but called its offer superior to Warner's current deal with Netflix and insisted its financing is sound and that it has been receptive to all WBD's concerns.


	“Throughout this process, Paramount has diligently and constructively addressed each concern raised by WBD. As detailed in Paramount's December 22 amended proposal and subsequent filings, Paramount cured every issue raised by WBD on December 17, most notably by providing an irrevocable personal guarantee by Larry Ellison for the equity portion of the financing. Nevertheless, WBD continues to raise issues in Paramount's offer that we have already addressed, including flexibility in interim operations,” Paramount said in a statement.

	On Wednesday, the Warner Bros. Discovery board advised shareholders to reject an amended takeover offer from Paramount, calling the bid “inferior” to its signed deal with the giant streamer.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix is buying the Warner Bros. Studios and streaming assets for about $27.75 a share in cash and stock. 


	Both transactions would require regulatory approval and both could take up to 18 months to close. In the case of Netflix, WBD would move ahead with a planned spinoff of its linear television business into a separate public company called Discovery Global in the third quarter of 2026. 


	WBD said it believes Paramount's takeover offer carries higher risks and uncertainties.


	Paramount disputed that, insisting it has a better chance at regulatory approval. It cited both a recent dip in Netflix shares as well as the wobbly start of trading this week for Comcast's cable spinoff Versant. The the WBD board “has not disclosed any analysis to help its shareholders value their potential ongoing ownership of the linear company,” Par said. The amount of debt WBD ultimately allocates to a standalone Discovery Global will be key and could shift the final price, Paramount suggested, “as we have interpreted the agreement.”  

	











	“We encourage WBD shareholders to ask the Board of WBD for transparency on this aspect of the deal with Netflix.” 


	Paramount also defended its debt financing with Bank of America, Citibank and Apollo, “each global sophisticated financial institutions, with decades of experience financing companies and borrowers in history's largest, most complicated transactions. They have confirmed that the commitment letter previously delivered by them to provide the previously disclosed $54 billion of debt financing.” 


	Paramount is a much smaller company than WBD, which expressed concern at the large amount of debt Paramount is tapping to finance the deal. Par said it “would welcome the opportunity to engage directly with the WBD Board to discuss the offer and address the Board's latest claims.” 


	Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, David Ellison's father and one of the world's richest people, has agreed to personally backstop the equity portion of the deal.


	“Paramount's offer is superior to WBD's existing agreement with Netflix and represents the best path forward for WBD shareholders. $30.00 per share in cash is easy to value. Netflix's transaction, on the other hand, contains multiple uncertain components and has already decreased in total value. When announced in December, the Netflix transaction offered WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, $4.50 in Netflix stock and a share in the pending spin-off of Discovery Global. Today, Netflix's stock price is trading well beneath the low end of its collar, reducing the value offered to WBD shareholders. 


	“In addition, while the WBD Board has not disclosed any analysis to help its shareholders value their potential ongoing ownership of the linear stub, Versant Media, its closest comparable, debuted shares this week and its performance to date illustrates the challenged path ahead for Discovery Global. Paramount's analysis (detailed below) shows the total value of the Netflix transaction to WBD shareholders today is $27.42 – unmistakably inferior to Paramount's $30.00 in cash.


	“Our offer clearly provides WBD investors greater value and a more certain, expedited path to completion. Throughout this process, we have worked hard for WBD shareholders and remain committed to engaging with them on the merits of our superior bid and advancing our ongoing regulatory review process,” David Ellison said.


	Paramount has taken a tender offer directly to WBD shareholders in an attempt to derail the Netflix agreement. Stockholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount.

It's weird how some people can never take a “no” for an answer.

What a weirdo this dude and his father are.

I really hope they would Bari Weiss in charge of CNN too. That way the world can get unbiased news and entertainment. A win-win… wait a minute…

David is a moron in over his head. Awfully convenient how he never mentions the Saudi funding when they're bankrolling most of this pathetic attempt. Move on, grow up. Netflix won and it's for the best.

Dude. She's not into you. Leave her alone.

Truth hurts doesn't it?

How great it would be if Paramount wins this bid and the control CNN! They could install Bari Weiss and finally the world would get both fair and balanced entertainment and news! It's a win-win…. Wait a minute…

Senior Film Reporter


Amazon MGM Studios has unveiled the first trailer for The Wrecking Crew, their action comedy starring Dave Bautista and Jason Momoa, which is slated for release on Prime Video on January 28.


	Directed by Blue Beetle helmer Ángel Manuel Soto, and set in the streets of Hawaii, the film watches as two estranged half-brothers, Jonny (Momoa) and James (Bautista), reluctantly reunite after their father's mysterious death. As they set out to uncover the truth, buried secrets resurface and loyalties are tested, unveiling a conspiracy that can tear their family apart. Together, they are ready to wreck anything that gets in their way.

	The trailer opens with the duo being dressed down by a detective played by Barry alum Stephen Root.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“This doesn't happen here every day,” Root tells them. “I can't have two guys who look like they eat steroid pancakes for breakfast turning my island into Beirut!”


	We subsequently learn that the Yakuza wants the guys dead, as old tensions flare up between them.


	“You just stir up trouble. That's what you do!” says Bautista's James.


	“That's what I do,” says Momoa's Jonny, “because I'm a cop.”


	“Not here, you're not!” James retorts.


	The pair also disagree on the cause of their father's recent death — James think it was a simple hit-and-run, but Jonny isn't so sure. They ultimately agree it was a murder and set out on a mission of vengeance, with Root's detective warning them, “I guarantee you'll end up poking a bear… that doesn't want to be poked.”


	Bautista's James, however, says, “Take my word for it when I tell you… that I'm the bear.”


The Wrecking Crew also stars Claes Bang, Jacob Batalon, and Morena Baccarin. Jonathan Tropper wrote the script with Jeff Fierson, Momoa, Bautista, Matt Reeves, and Lynn Harris producing. Check out the film's trailer above

EXCLUSIVE: Alan Chikin Chow and Kareem Rahma agency Underscore Talent is kicking off 2026 by unveiling a slew of hires and promotions, with a former Paramount adult animation exec among them.


	Sachi Ezura, who was VP, Adult Animation at the Skydance-owned U.S. studio between 2021 and 2025, has joined as Talent Manager in the creator-focused talent house's Comedy division. She was among those who exited in last year's redundancies at the company.


	At Paramount, she worked on shows such as Clone High, Ren & Stimpy, Tooning Out the News, Digman! and Everybody Still Hates Chris, and now joins Underscore's new Comedy unit, which we first revealed news of in October last year. Underscore co-founder Michael Green leads the division, which already includes other managers such as Andrew Topel.

	Sachi's hire comes during a significant growth period for Underscore, an L.A.-based creator economy talent house that has been quietly adding the new staff over the past year, with 20 internal promotions and 44 hires.

	Eleven of those have been talent managers and six senior leaders. We've reported on several of them, with Nadi Filsoof notably upped to partner in the Entertainment division last year.


	Underscore was launched in 2021 by Michael Green, Reza Izad and Dan Weinstein, and has focused on the burgeoning creator economy space. It represents creators hailing from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, Snapchat, the gaming world and podcasting. 


	Key talent includes former New York Times exec and Subway Takes comedian Kareem Rahma, who Deadline recently named as a creator to watch in 2026. Also on the books among others are true crime and make-up influencer Bailey Sarian, actress and comedian Christina Kirkman, Alan's Series maker Alan Chikin Chow, TikTok personality and former soccer player Noah Beck, preschooler content creators Vlad & Niki, digital comedian Zachariah Porter and retired soccer player Brittany Isenhour.

	











	“We're operating in a fast-moving industry whose potential is expanding faster than other media sectors,” Underscore co-founder Reza Izad told Deadline. “By expanding our leadership team across verticals and shared services, while continuing to promote from within, we've built a team designed to support long-term career architecture, not just moment-driven opportunities. This depth allows us to move faster, think more holistically, and help talent navigate an increasingly complex digital-first landscape heading into 2026.”


	Here's an overview of the hires. TheSoul Publishing-owned company's Entertainment talent management division has welcomed Lloyd Tyler from YMU, Chris Motyl and Zachary Cole from Sixteenth, Eric Schulman from Haven, and Molly Werner from UTA. Also on the management front, Polly Auritt joined the Culinary unit, Neville King the Sports department, Dylan Flinn boarded the AI team and Steph Lechman and Kieran John joined the Gaming unit.


	Other significant hires have seen Kyle Singles join as Talent Partnerships Director at production division Shorthand Studios, as we first reported in October last year; Lisa Bossman as Director of Brand Partnerships & Endorsements, Sports; Emily Salerno as Director, Campaign Management; Zack Evans as VP, Creative Strategy, Shorthand Studios; Scott Rowe as Operations Manager, FAST and Joshua Fasold as Senior Account Manager.


	As for promotions, Kyle Stevens and Chris Burns became Senior Directors of Talent & Co-Heads of Comedy, Cristina Fernandez was upped to Senior Director of Talent, and Sam Schoenberg and Frankie Ray were named Senior Directors of Talent, Entertainment.


	At director level, Zach Cole was named Director of Talent, Entertainment; Athena Nash became Director of Talent, Culinary; and Nick Schlegel upped to Director of Talent, Beauty, Fashion & Lifestyle. There were several manager level promotions with Chaisten France and Megan Valdex promoted in the Entertainment team, Larissa Thorold upped in Sports, Claire Mink rising in Culinary and Mandie Meier promoted in the Beauty, Fashion & Lifestyle Unit. Adrienne Gao and Virginia Dodenhoff rose in the Brand Partnerships unit.


	“These promotions reflect the way we're building Underscore, by investing deeply in our people and giving them room to grow into leaders,” said Dan Weinstein, Co-CEO of Underscore Talent. “As our creators' careers become more complex and ambitious, it's critical that our team grows with them. Developing talent from within, alongside bringing in new leaders, is what allows us to move faster and think bigger.”


	YouTube star managers Weinstein, Izad and Green were all co-founders of Studio71, the digital content studio that was part of Germany's ProSiebenSat.1 Media. They formed Underscore five years, and sold a majority stake to TheSoul Publishing in 2022.


Here's a Q&A with Underscore co-CEOs Izad and Weinstein


DEADLINE: How will the new hires and promotions set Underscore up for 2026?


Izad: We're operating in a fast-moving industry whose potential is expanding faster than other media sectors. By expanding our leadership team across verticals and shared services, while continuing to promote from within, we've built a team designed to support long-term career architecture, not just moment-driven opportunities. This depth allows us to move faster, think more holistically, and help talent navigate an increasingly complex digital-first landscape heading into 2026.

	











	As the creator economy continues to decentralize, it's crucial for us to operate at the highest level at this intersection of talent management, media strategy, and IP development. As platforms fragment and creators build businesses across YouTube, podcasts, film, TV, and owned audiences, management can no longer be transactional or simply reactive.


DEADLINE: Where do you want your team most focused in 2026?


Dan: Our focus is on three things: audience ownership, scalable storytelling, and operational leverage.


	Creators are no longer optimizing for a single platform or viral moment, they're building repeatable formats, serialized content, and communities that travel across platforms and into real-world experiences. At the same time, AI is accelerating creative workflows, lowering friction, and allowing talent to experiment faster and smarter.


	Our team is focused on helping talent understand where attention, influence, and budgets are actually moving, while building systems that let them work smarter, not harder, as their businesses scale.


DEADLINE: How do you feel about the explosion of talent management businesses in the creator economy?


Weinstein: It's a sign of how real and permanent this shift is. As creators rival traditional entertainers in reach and cultural impact, the demand for specialized representation is inevitable.


	What differentiates companies now isn't access, it's strategy. The next era of management is about helping talent build durable media businesses, develop IP, and navigate both digital and traditional entertainment on their own terms. The proliferation of new firms reflects how much opportunity there is, but it also raises the bar for what real management should deliver.


DEADLINE: Where are the biggest opportunities and challenges for creators, especially in film and TV?


Izad: The biggest opportunity is that creators no longer need traditional media as the sole path to legitimacy. YouTube, podcasts, and long-form digital formats are now rivaling TV in both reach and monetization, and creators are entering film and television with built-in audiences and creative leverage.


	The challenge is alignment. Everyone is trying to figure out how they succeed in this digital-first world, especially traditional entertainers, athletes and public personalities. Underscore's team, many of whom crossed over from traditional to digital entertainment, have been critical in helping this group of talent make sense of the digital landscape and how they can operate within it as creators and creatives.


DEADLINE: How do you assess the market opportunities and challenges?


Weinstein: What makes this moment meaningful isn't just the scale of growth, it's the balance of continuity and momentum. We have leaders who've grown with Underscore for years alongside new executives bringing fresh perspectives across every corner of business including AI, publishing, comedy, data, content optimization, and monetization.


Izad: The industry is at a heightened state of maturation and the conversations have evolved from explaining why the creator economy matters to how you can participate effectively and win. We've bolstered our internal team ahead of 2026 to meet major moments head-on and stay ahead of them. 


	From the rise of creator-owned communities on platforms like Substack, nascent AI advancements across music, editing and animation to the role of serialized formats for streamers and marketing, these are just a few of areas that will shape 2026. As creator-led entertainment continues to reshape culture, the companies that win will be the ones built to evolve with it. Our goal is to ensure creators, and the teams that support them, are positioned not just to participate in what's next, but to help define it.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


	The BBC is facing “quite a lot of pressure” to come off Elon Musk's X, Director General Tim Davie has said, but he stressed it will remain on the platform.


	Speaking to a UK parliamentary committee about the BBC World Service, Davie made the admission as he set out to prove that the BBC remains active where young people are getting their news. 


	His reference to Musk's social media platform came as X faces criticism around the world over its AI tool Grok and deepfake nudes.


	“I have quite a lot of pressure to remove the BBC from X by the way,” Davie told the Public Accounts Committee this morning. “That is not what I will be doing. Because we need to be on these platforms, we need to give quality information onto the social media platforms and bring people onto them. That is critical because otherwise the Chinese and Iranians are ‘flooding the zone' and they are investing very hard.”

	Davie was responding to a question around how less and less young people now say they get their news from the BBC, preferring social media platforms like X and TikTok. He did not elaborate on who is pressuring him to remove the BBC from the platform. 


	BBC talent's use of X has been a constant source of stress for the corporation, with big stars like ex-Match of the Day host Gary Lineker falling foul of the BBC's impartiality rules over tweets. Elsewhere, in April 2023, X changed a label on the main BBC account, saying it is “publicly funded” instead of “government funded media” after the broadcaster objected to the latter term.

	











More pro-Israel complaints than pro-Palestine


	Davie is set to exit the BBC soon following his shock resignation due to the Donald Trump Panorama scandal. He was sat next to the BBC's interim news boss Jonathan Munro, with Munro having temporarily replaced Deborah Turness – another casualty of the Trump fiasco. 


	Speaking to accusations of pro-Palestinian bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, Munro revealed that the BBC gets more complaints about its coverage leaning pro-Israel than in the other direction. The BBC has previously said it is “taking action” on the BBC Arabic “systemic bias” complaints, which were contained in the excoriating leaked Michael Prescott memo that led to Davie and Turness' departure. Coverage of the Israel-Hamas war and its aftermath has proved difficult for the national broadcaster, causing ructions within New Broadcasting House HQ and beyond.


	“We have more complaints overall in the BBC that we are pro-Israeli than the opposite,” said Munro. “Both complaints piles are relatively chunky as you would expect from a polarizing story but it is not the case that everyone thinks we are leaning in a pro-Arabic or pro-Palestinian way. The opposite is actually true.”


	“For the avoidance of doubt,” Munro added that the BBC doesn't “take any perspective [on Israel-Gaza], but in terms of perceptions of audience, it is important to put that into the discussion.”

Kimberly Guilfoyle has broken her silence on her ex-fiancé Donald Trump Jr.'s engagement to Bettina Anderson.

Nearly one month after the 48-year-old popped the question, Guilfoyle told the New York Times she is “happy for Don.”

In an interview published Sunday, the US Ambassador to Greece insisted, “I wish him, of course, all the best.”

Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. were an item from 2018 to 2024, with the former couple getting engaged in 2020.

Page Six reported in December 2024 that the pair had called it quits.

“Don and Kimberly haven't been getting along over the past year,” a source told us at the time. “They get argumentative at Mar-a-Lago in front of people. Nothing crazy, but you know when a couple is fighting. They bicker in public.”

By the time news broke of their split, Trump Jr. had moved on with Anderson.

We heard he and the socialite, 39, had been together “for a few months” before their romance made headlines.

“[They] are super cute and happy together,” the source gushed, calling the duo a “natural fit.”

Trump Jr. got down on one knee the following December while celebrating Anderson's birthday at Camp David. 

After Page Six exclusively broke the engagement news, President Trump praised their “young love” at the White House Christmas party.

“They get along very well and they are just announcing through me that they're getting married,” the 79-year-old told guests at last month's bash.

The bride-to-be, for her part, gushed about feeling “like the luckiest girl in the world” at the fête.

Trump Jr., notably, was previously married to ex-wife Vanessa Trump, with whom he shares five children.

The exes ended their union in 2018 after more than a decade of marriage, and Trump Jr. moved on with Guilfoyle later that same year.

Guilfoyle has walked down the aisle before as well, marrying California's governor Gavin Newsom in 2001. They divorced in 2006.

As for Anderson, this will be the socialite's first marriage.

“Fire Country” star Leven Rambin seemingly leveled accusations of infidelity and sex addiction against an unnamed ex in a recent TikTok video.

“Guys, I just went on Live and I dropped the most diabolical lore about my entire like, life, my story, my tea” the actress said in a clip shared Saturday, while sitting at a table. 

“I dropped all of the piping hot tea about my ex, my divorce,” she continued. “How I got cheated on by a sex addict who cheated on me with like eight hundred million people and then married the assistant we had together.”

Advertisement

Rambin, 35, continued, “When I asked them if they'd done anything, she said no,” adding that she'd been told “no” even after allegedly finding “all the emails, all the texts, all the DMs and such.” 

Advertisement

She added, “I was like, ‘Did he ever try anything with you?' She was like, ‘No, oh my god this is terrible.'”

“Cut to they're married now” Rambin continued with a brief scream. “They got married. I haven't spoken to either one of them obviously, but that was a tough pill to swallow.” 

Though Rambin did not name the person she accused of cheating on her, Rambin was previously married to “True Blood” actor Jim Parrack, 44 — a fact fans noted in the comments thread. 

“Nooooo not Hoyt,” one person speculated, referring to Parrack's “True Blood” character. “Dayum girl. Spill that tea.”

“You were way too pretty for him,” gushed another, with a third adding, “So what I'm hearing is he played himself on supernatural 🤣.”

Others simply offered sympathy. “I'm so sorry you had to deal with this. But as an extremely nosy person THANK YOU for spilling this juicy tea!!” a fourth person remarked. 

Parrack remarried in 2022, while Rambin tied the knot with photographer Dawson Smith back in July. 

A rep for Parrack did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. 

The “Hunger Games” actress and “9-1-1: Lone Star” actor married in Texas in 2015 and split two years later, in 2017. 

In an Instagram post marking six months since her nuptials to Smith, the “Forever Purge” actress gushed over her marriage. 

“Happy six months of marriage to this sweet guy / my favorite source of entertainment/ donkey trainer @dawsonproductions,” she captioned the PDA-packed upload, adding, “don't worry, I'll always be here to remind you of your age 🤣”

Amy Schumer is retaining a sense of humor following her recent filing for divorce from Chris Fischer. Schumer, 44, posted to her Instagram Stories on Wednesday, showing off a photo of herself wearing a baggy, comfortable outfit that was captured in photos and reported on by the Daily Mail earlier in the day. 

“The comedian opted for comfort,” she jokingly copied directly from the outlet's report, adding her own cheeky callout, “Line up boys,” over the shot.

In the photo, Schumer is bundled up an oversized winter coat, leggings, a hoodie, and “black On running shoes,” all crowned by a droopy red knit hat.

The “I Feel Pretty” star filed documents to end the union with Fischer on Tuesday in New York County, People was the first to report.

Her latest social media post is an about-face from the actress's most recent, highly revealing revenge body posts she has been sharing of late.

She put her weight loss transformation on display looking trim in a slew of bathing suits just over the past weekend, noting “My mom took these photos of me while I was packing for a trip.”

Schumer has not been shying away from sharing her mindset for the new year on the heels of her headline-making split from Fischer.

Divorce speculation swirled in November 2025, with the “Last Comic Standing” alum confirming their breakup the following month.

“Blah blah blah Chris and I have made the difficult decision to end our marriage after 7 years. We love each other very much and will continue to focus on raising our son,” she wrote in December 2025, referencing 6-year-old son Gene.

Earlier that same month, Schumer cryptically clarified via Instagram that “whatever ends up happening” with Fischer, 45, had “nothing to do with” her recent weight loss.

The Golden Globe winner, notably, dropped 50 pounds with the help of Mounjaro, years after a “horrible” experience with Wegovy.

Schumer issued an apology to those “let down” by her slimdown last month, writing, “Sorry for whatever feeling it's giving you.”

Hilary Duff is focusing on her spicy new music after getting pulled into Ashley Tisdale's “toxic” mom group drama.

The actress and singer, 38, posted a video of herself Wednesday looking completely unbothered and singing an unreleased track with NSFW lyrics.

Duff, wearing a butter yellow dress, sang the new song in the middle of a grassy field with the sun shining on her.

Advertisement

The song is about a couple wanting to go back to the exciting part of their relationship after losing their spark.

Advertisement

“I only want the beginning, I don't want the end,” she sings. “I want the part where you say goddamn/Back of a dive bar giving you head/Then sneak home late, wake up your roommates.”

“I want the highlights, 10 out of 10/The butterflies from holding your hand,” she continues to sing. “Before we swept us under the bed/And we became practically roommates.”

More suggestive lyrics include, “I'm touching myself by the front door/But you don't even look my way no more.”

The post comes after Duff's husband, Matthew Koma, took a major shot at Tisdale after the “High School Musical” star criticized her former mom group — which appeared to include Duff, Meghan Trainor and Mandy Moore — in an essay for the Cut that went viral.

Although Tisdale's rep denied that she was talking about Duff, Moore and Trainor, Koma clapped back with an Instagram Story post on Tuesday.

The musician posted a fake mocked-up shot of himself on the cover of the Cut with a headline reading, “A mom group tell all through a father's eyes: When You're the Most Self-Obsessed Tone Deaf Person on Earth, Other Moms Tend to Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.”

He added in a sarcastic caption, “Read my new interview with @thecut.”

A source familiar with the drama told Page Six that “Matthew gave [Tisdale] what she had coming.” 

The source also called Tisdale “insufferable,” adding that the friend breakup “has been a long time coming.”

In Tisdale's essay, she claimed she was excluded from hangouts from her former mom group, which made her feel “not cool enough” and “lost” as to why she was being left out.

The actress, 40, said she eventually texted the group, “This is too high school for me and I don't want to take part in it anymore.”

She said she chose to cut ties with them, though she “never considered the moms to be bad people [except for] maybe one.”

Tisdale shares two daughters with her husband, Christopher French: Jupiter Iris, 4, and Emerson Clover, 1.

Rose McGowan's weight was repeatedly checked by “Charmed” executives, the actress claimed in a new podcast interview.

The 52-year-old, who played Paige Matthews on the show from 2001 to 2006, told “We Need to Talk” listeners Tuesday that higher-ups used to “circle around” her to appraise her appearance.

“[They would] check my weight when I came back from season to season,” she recalled, quipping that the men were “inspecting their product.”

The “Grindhouse” star remembered this “chill” behavior being viewed as “completely fine” on the “nasty set” at the time.

She expressed mixed feelings about Hollywood being “different” these days, claiming the industry “pay[s] lip service” to the idea that it has evolved.

Earlier in the interview, McGowan noted that “Charmed” was “hard for” her to film as it was her first time dealing with “super corporate” dynamics.

She once asked “five white dodos in their suits” whether they would “fire [her]” and let her “leave” if she was caught smoking a joint.

“They were like, ‘If you go work at a pharmacy, we'll sue you. No matter what job you get, we'll take your wages for the rest of your life and then we'll go after your family,'” McGowan claimed.

She labeled the entertainment industry “far worse than the [Children of God] cult [she] grew up in.”

In 2018, McGowan said in her “Citizen Rose” docuseries that she needed hypnotherapy to process her time on the WB show.

“I found the repetitive days so opposite my natural rhythms that I became sick over and over,” she told viewers of the “very stressful environment.”

The “Scream” star added, “I started to have panic attacks because of everything I was pushing down. I was sick about four or five times a season. … The pace was grueling. Two years in a row, I had 102-degree fevers and got dumped in trash cans, in a stunt, always on the days that I was the most ill.”

She gained 10 pounds for the role, explaining in her “Brave” memoir that same year that her goal was to appear “super nonthreatening” as Shannen Doherty's character Prue Halliwell's replacement.

When McGowan dyed her hair bright red before her second season, the series's “furious” executives “flipped out.”

However, McGowan “liked it, so [she] kept it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Netflix makes latest futile effort to convince Stranger Things fans the show's ending was real","https://www.avclub.com/netflix-confirms-stranger-things-finale-was-real","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 02:40:53 GMT","

Netflix made a brief, presumably futile effort today to convince legions of Stranger Things fans—many of whom have spent the week since the show's finale convincing themselves, with at least some measure of sincerity, that a secret extra final episode of the blockbuster series was forthcoming—that the series is, in fact, over. Per Deadline, the streaming service's social media descriptions briefly updated on Wednesday afternoon into an all-caps, hard-not-to-read-as-harried-sounding “ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING.” (The descriptions have since shifted to promoting the upcoming movie People We Meet On Vacation.)

As we reported back on Monday, a fan theory called “Conformity Gate” has been sweeping through Stranger Things fandom ever since the finale aired, as fans have glommed on to various clues that “prove” that the show's mostly happily ever after ending was a dirty trick being planted in the protagonists' brains by psychic big bad Vecna. The theory went on to suggest that a real finale would air on January 7, 2026, because that's Orthodox Christmas, and all of the other parts of the show's fifth season have been dropped on holidays. (Note to wannabe conspiracy theorists: Maybe don't hinge your hopes and dreams on Netflix scheduling folk knowing a lot about Orthodox Christmas.) As noted by Deadline, the lack of a sudden “real” finale coming to upend the established status quo, undo that final scene the Duffer brothers have been talking about filming for years at this point, and make fools out of everybody who paid to go see the actual finale in theaters on New Year's Eve, has elicited a wide variety of reactions from true believers, from anger, to a rueful belief that the “Vecna mind-controlled everybody” twist could just be how the series ends, to a more general acknowledgement that holding tight to fan theories was a way to keep the show alive just a little bit longer.

What we're seeing, in other words, is a generation of folks for whom this show was foundational, and constituted a lot of firsts, coming to terms with their first instance of highly relatable experience Your TV Show Just Disappointed You With Its Ending. As such, it's hard to be too hard on the young folks signing Change.org petitions, putting together “proof” videos, and otherwise nerding out together to try to figure out why a show that's been with them for a huge chunk of their lives just left them a little hollow feeling at the end. It's a natural part of any evolving TV fan's relationship with the medium: Endings are hard, relatively few projects can manage them with any elegance even before you factor in how many moving parts Stranger Things had there at the end, and coming to terms with the absence of a guaranteed satisfying resolution is a key part of maturing into someone who thinks critically about the art they consume. If that kicks out a few wild conspiracy theories and yarn-covered cork boards in the process, then that's presumably just a byproduct of figuring out how to grow up in the upside down world of modern online entertainment.

A warning up top, before we dig in here: This article contains usage of the word “snackable” in contexts where it is not being applied to anything that has been fried, battered, or flavor-blasted; we apologize to anyone who's been rendered snackability intolerant by years of modern TV marketing speak.

The issue, apparently, being that while people do subscribe to the service—at roughly 200 million subscribers, it's the fourth-biggest streaming service on the planet, competing only with Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney's own Hotstar platform in India for the honor—they aren't logging into it every single day, as part of their regular routines, in order to mindlessly scroll through crap.

Sorry, no, we meant to say, they aren't enjoying vertical videos that are “are really great as daily habits, snackable, short, bite-sized experiences,” according to EVP of product management Erin Teague, who did not go on to just straight-up say “You know, like TikTok, or YouTube Shorts.” The push was presented at CES this week as an enticement to advertisers, who would presumably be very excited to do a little snacking of their own on the brains of legions of people flicking through video after video, potentially pulled from categories like “original short-form programming, repurposed social clips, refashioned scenes from longer-form episodic or feature titles, or a combination.”

All of this, Disney would like you to know, is really just about meeting people “where they are. This is what Gen Z and Gen Alpha are expecting. They are not necessarily thinking about sitting down, watching a long-form, two-and-a-half hour piece of content on their phones.” And, sure, it feels worth noting that the social media platforms this move is presumably meant to mimic are social media platforms—with built-in audiences of millions of content creators churning out all that snackable content for their fellow subscribers to consume, as opposed to, say, one company trying to generate the same effect via chopping and screwing its own limited pool of material to better appeal to our attention-deprived minds. But, on the other hand… Okay, actually, we can't think of a good “on the other hand” here. But, then, we're not big, exciting Disney marketing brains, pushing forward into bold new definitions of the once-innocuous word “snack.”

Sidney Kibrick, who played “Woim” in Our Gang comedy film shorts in the 1930s has passed away at the age of 97, The Hollywood Reporter writes. He passed away on Saturday, Jan. 3, at a hospital in Northridge, his daughter, Jane Lipsic, told the outlet. 

Throughout his career, Kibrick appeared in 27 Our Gang/Little Rascals shorts, which were made between 1935 to 1939. His character was the sidekick to the neighborhood bully Butch, who was played by Tommy Bond.

Kibrick left Hollywood at the age of 11, but his legacy lived on through these beloved comedy shorts. 

In 2022, the Hollywood Museum opened an exhibition celebrating the 100th anniversary of “Our Gang.” And with that, Kibrick was there and took a moment to speak with Fox News, reflecting on his career. 

Specifically, he was asked how he was discovered. 

“Well, I have an older brother who was also in the movies. He's four years older than me. I also have a sister who's eight years older than me. We used to go to the movies as a family. Well, one day after one movie, a man came over to my mother. He said, “I could use that little kid for a movie. I'm an agent” and pointed at me,” Kibrick told the outlet. “My mother didn't think it was all that important, but she did discuss it with my father that evening. He said, ‘Well why don't we try it?' These were difficult times during the Great Depression, so they thought it could be a good opportunity for us. My mother agreed, and I joined general casting. Soon after, I was working with Shirley Temple on my first movie.”

In a 2023 interview, Kibrick provided some insight into what it was like being on set at such a young age. 

“We'd have two hours of schooling in the morning and then work anywhere from six to 16 hours until we finished,” he explained. “There was a lot of work, no question about it, but our director Gordon Douglas was a terrific guy, and he was really able to get a lot out of each kid.”

He also was asked about the shorts' lasting legacy. 

“I think people, even today, could identify with being a child and being mischievous when life was simple,” Kibrick said. “It was fun, and it made people laugh. … I was living the studio life. Those are memories I will never forget. It was a wonderful experience.”

Awww… Rest easy Mr. Kibrick, and thanks for the laughs. I am in my late 50s and I remember watching the “Our Gang” shows in the mornings. Great memories. He's right… so much has changed (and not always for the better), but kids will still be kids. ❤️

I was born in 1948 and my brother's and I grew up watching the Little Rascals.  Im enjoying this clip.  Thanks for the memories.

Wow sending prayers&hugs i absolutely love the show il be 53 and every morning wld watch it..use to laugh so much alot of great memories..thank you rest in peace..things sure are way diff now in this world..

Sooo cute made me laugh. I remember watching every Saturday.

Great memories of my siblings and I watching back to back episodes of the Little Rascals, Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges on Saturday morning. Saturday Mornings were truly made for good clean laughter albeit the Stooges knocked the crap out of each other and Laurel would cry
RIP and thanks for memories.Oh yeah? Yeah. I still say it  😂

We used to rush home from school so we wouldn't miss the little rascals in the afternoon. This was the 70's. I like Alfalfa.

I just loved, loved, loved Our Gang!!!!!!!!! Such good memories. The children today don't know what they are missing. Good clean memories. Mr Kibrick was so cute. They all were. My prayers go out to the family.  He has his angel wings and is up there having fun with the rest of the gang!!!!!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fran Drescher Opens Up About the Health Crisis That Changed Her Life Forever","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/fran-drescher-reveals-uterine-cancer-survival/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:09:10 GMT","

Fran Drescher is opening up about one of the most defining chapters of her life, reflecting on surviving cancer, processing long-held trauma and how those experiences reshaped her priorities. More than two decades after her diagnosis, the actress says the journey continues to inform how she lives, works and cares for herself today.

In a recent interview with People, the 68-year-old revealed she was diagnosed with uterine cancer at age 42, a diagnosis that initially went unnoticed because she did not fit the typical risk profile, per the Daily Mail. Drescher explained that uterine cancer usually affects postmenopausal or obese women, neither of which applied to her at the time. Because of that, she believes she “slipped between the cracks.” Still, the cancer was caught at stage one, meaning it had not penetrated the uterine lining, something she now views as a stroke of luck.

The diagnosis forced Drescher to confront painful realities, including the loss of her ability to have children. At the time, she was in a relationship with a younger partner and hoped to become a mother for the first time. Instead of freezing her eggs, she had to prioritize cancer treatment, a loss she has described as deeply heartbreaking.

Drescher has also spoken candidly about the emotional weight surrounding her illness. In past interviews, including comments previously shared with CNN, she has said she believes her cancer was linked to a violent sexual assault she survived in her 20s. After the attack, she said she buried herself in work and caregiving, never fully addressing her own pain. Over time, she came to believe that unresolved trauma found a physical outlet.

She has since urged women not to ignore warning signs or put everyone else first at the expense of their own health. “Don't ignore something and hope it goes away,” she has warned, encouraging women to listen to their bodies and seek care early.

In June 2025, Drescher marked a major milestone, celebrating 25 years cancer-free. She shared a makeup-free video from Italy, calling it her “25th anniversary of wellness.” During the trip, she reflected on her recovery, thanked those who supported her through her illness and highlighted the work of Cancer Schmancer, the advocacy movement she launched alongside her 2002 book focused on prevention and early detection.

She also shared her personal philosophy on health, emphasizing the connection between how people live, think and feel, and encouraging gratitude and balance between mind, body and spirit, per Parade.

Today, Drescher says she feels grounded and empowered. She is enjoying a renewed moment in her career, including her role in the film “Marty Supreme,” while continuing to speak openly about survival and self-care. Looking back, she sees her story as one shaped by resilience and hard-earned wisdom. As she put it simply, “You can't stop me.”

Rock-brained Gerard Butler thrillers are supposed to be amusingly inane — not uncannily relevant.

Arriving at the end of our first Covid year (good times, good times), 2020's “Greenland” was somehow both at once. An earnest disaster movie about a Scottish-American engineer who tries to keep his family alive as a giant comet screams its way toward our planet, Ric Roman Waugh's resourceful and relatively grounded epic was sober enough to feel like the “Deep Impact” to “Geostorm”'s “Armageddon.” The film crashed down onto Earth at a moment as audiences worldwide reeled from the helplessness of their own global crisis. It was as dumb as the flaming rocks that seemed to follow Butler's character from Atlanta to the Arctic, but it resonated with the broadly recognizable truth of living through a catastrophe that not even a beefcake like King Leonidas could wrestle into submission. 

 








Related Stories Casting Society Award Nominees Include ‘Sinners,' ‘Wake Up Dead Man,' and ‘Pillion' Sundance Film Festival Adds Talks, Including Olivia Wilde, Richard Linklater, Antoine Fuqua, and Gregg Araki 

Almost six years later, Butler and Waugh have done it again. And by “it,” I mean “make another exceedingly stupid ‘Greenland' movie that manages to dovetail with one of the most pressing dilemmas of the current moment, and does so with an emotional acuity that belies the programmatic oafishness of its whole general vibe.” Oh, and by “one of the most pressing dilemmas of the current moment,” I thankfully don't mean our demented president's recurrent threats of taking Greenland by force; timely as Waugh's franchise has been, this sequel is very much not about Butler and his fellow survivors defending their post-apocalyptic bunker from a drunk Pete Hegseth and his ultra-embarrassing “Department of War.”

 










Per its title, “Greenland 2: Migration” is a “there but for the grace of god” story about the uncertain search for stability in a world that has us all at its mercy. It's a story about the universal impulse to find a sustainable home for our families, a drive that should affirm the root humanity of exiles, refugees, and various other desperate foreigners rather than inspire the local population to deny it. It's also a story about Gerard Butler being very, very sad.

Screenwriters Mitchell LaFortune and Chris Sparling get to the heart of the matter by flipping the script on the premise of the previous film. That one saw John Garrity (Butler) maximizing his privilege by leading his estranged wife, Allison (Morena Baccarin), and their diabetic son, Nathan, to an extinction-proof shelter that had been reserved for people like them. 

This one starts with that shelter imploding under the strength of a massive radiation storm that displaces the Garrity clan in a hurry, and leaves them on a lifeboat to Europe in the wretched hope that someone on the continent will offer them a safe place to plant new roots. If that doesn't work out, perhaps John can guide his family to the crater left by the comet in southern France; it's rumoured the area has been protected from the poison air, killer waves, and bouncing meteors that have made the rest of the planet such a hellscape.

 










It should go without saying that “Greenland: Migration” doesn't belabor the point. This isn't really an ideas movie. That a Gerard Butler vehicle even gestures toward the short-sighted narcissism of closed borders is enough to make it a categorically different experience than (wonderful) dreck like Jean-François Richet's “Plane” or (plodding) dreck like Waugh's own “Angel Has Fallen,” as the director continues to use this cataclysmic franchise — which operates on a scale, if not a budget, considerably larger than any of his other work — to paint a rather intimate portrait of human perspective at the end of the world. 

To its significant detriment, “Migration” is a far more generic and action-oriented movie than its predecessor, which had the benefit of watching civilization get pulled apart at the seams. John's relationship with Allison was pretty threadbare, to say the least, and their son Nathan was never more than a cherubic insulin crisis waiting to happen, but the chaos around them was galvanized by a real and vivid sense of what happens to people when society reveals the pure survivalism at its core. Although it had its fair share of raining fire and extinction-sized tidal waves, the original “Greenland” hinged on finely wrought displays of separation, selflessness, and betrayal.

 










This sequel doesn't really do any of that — at least not to a meaningful degree. It kicks off with a “Death Stranding”-esque sequence of John scavenging for supplies on Greenland's toxic surface, devotes a few minutes to life inside the Department of Homeland Security bunker (it's bad, and getting worse so fast that Allison has to convince the other survivors to welcome a group of starving outsiders), and spends the rest of the movie chasing the Garrity clan across Europe in a series of ho-hum setpieces that fail to generate the same kind of race-against-the-clock suspense that came easy to the previous movie. They also make the environment seem bizarrely determined to kill these particular characters. 

I get that the Earth has become a hostile nightmare, but the predictability of a windstorm blowing through, or a meteor shower raining down, or a skirmish breaking out every time the Garritys are in a vulnerable moment proves wearying, and the script's emphasis on the spectacle of its natural disasters — rather than on how people react to them — results in a sequel that loses sight of what gave the first “Greenland” its friction. “How will a sexy gun-toting Frenchman react to John and his family?” is a lot more exciting than “will Nathan, now played by Roman Griffin Davis, be able to shimmy across a chasm before the ground crumbles apart on both sides of his ladder?” The answer to the second question is considerably easier to guess than the first. 

 










While the sober tone remains, as does Butler's likably monotone brogue, replicating the road trip structure of the original yields limited returns, and the loss of jagged supporting performances from the likes of Hope Davis and Scott Glenn is too great for the sequel's assorted redshirts to make up (Ken Nwosu's Obi is the exception who proves the rule, as the helpful Nigerian immigrant reinforces the movie's foundation in the five minutes before he's obliterated by a fragment of space rock). 

For their part, the Garrity family is asked to carry more weight with less substance, and their non-characters struggle to support the emotional burden of an intimate life-or-death journey, the destination of which is a lot sillier than it was the last time around. Still, for all of the been-there, survived-that tedium we get here, it's hard to imagine that many other white-bread Hollywood movies this year will so thoroughly internalize the reality that migration is a heroic act of survival. 

Lionsgate will release “Greenland: Migration” in theaters on Friday, January 9.

For the first time in nearly two decades, the Television Academy is introducing a new honorary Emmy known as the Legacy Award.

According to the awards body, the new Legacy Award will be presented to television programs that have made a “profound and lasting impact” on audiences and remain relevant to society, culture and the industry. 

The new award comes with small changes within the Television Academy Board of Governors as well. Its Governors Award committee will soon be known as the Special Awards Committee, and that group will be the one to determine candidates for the Legacy Award, and then present them to the Board of Governors for a vote. Entries may be made by members of the Board of Governors, the Special Awards Committee or individuals who may suggest recipients in a letter to the Television Academy.

The last time the Academy introduced an award of similar significance was the Television Academy Honors Award in 2007, which recognizes programming that drives positive social change. As with the Governors Award, engraved Emmy statuettes will be bestowed upon the recipients of the new Legacy Award.

“The Legacy Award celebrates groundbreaking programming — programs that have stood the test of time delivering stories that continue to engage audiences and featuring iconic and timeless characters with multigenerational appeal,” said Television Academy Chair Cris Abrego via statement. “The award allows the Academy to honor more of television's rich history and acknowledge the storytellers whose work has resonated with viewers and continues to entertain legions of fans around the globe.”

 










The Television Academy is still determining whether the new award will be presented at the Creative Arts Emmy ceremonies, the Primetime Emmys telecast, the Televerse festival, or the TV Academy Hall of Fame event.

Shudder is fueling its post–10-year-anniversary momentum with an instantly unnerving trailer debut — exclusive to IndieWire. 

Recalling the antiseptic dread of Gore Verbinski's “A Cure for Wellness,” but steeped in the lush, suffocating inferno of the deep-green Ontario woods, “Honey Bunch” comes from Canadian filmmakers Madeleine Sims-Fewer and Dusty Mancinelli. The nightmare begins as a discordantly ethereal marriage thriller, set at a strange treatment facility. It twists into something even more like a dark fairytale and reaffirms Shudder as a key tastemaker for international horror in 2026.

 










Streaming on February 13 and in Canadian theaters on January 23, “Honey Bunch” is critically acclaimed, having debuted to positive reception at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival. The promo plays like a noxious breath of fresh air, starring Grace Glowicki and Ben Petrie — the electric duo behind 2025's “Dead Lover” (out of Sundance) — as a husband and wife who don't know each other as well as they think.

The couple appears opposite Jason Isaacs and Kate Dickie for a chilly descent into the instability of intimacy, making a buzzy, fierce first impression on the film festival circuit last year. It also screened at TIFF, Fantastic Fest, and more, making an impressive run that speaks to the film's possible global appeal (this certainly feels like an “Oddity”-type hit) as much as the script's eerie specificity.

When Diana (Glowicki) awakens from a coma with severe memory loss, she and her husband (Petrie) turn to an isolated medical center for experimental trauma treatments. As the procedures grow more invasive, the patient's marriage begins to fracture, and Diana questions not just the nature of the therapy, but the intentions of the man who claims to love her most. In a review for IndieWire, critic Jake Cole called the result a “slow-burn madhouse thriller” that becomes one of the few recent “body horror pictures to recognize the genre's capacity for tragedy over allegorical statement and shock value.”

Sims-Fewer and Mancinelli have emerged as two of the most exciting figures in Canadian horror, and they're part of a broader wave redefining the country's genre output through extraordinary commitment to craft, artistic vulnerability, and emotional extremity. “Honey Bunch” continues that trajectory, and promises to nail the sharp execution and conceptual hook you need for a Shudder sensation. This is what curated cinema should look like — personal, perverse, and unafraid to ask how far love is willing to go.

6.4

Genre:

Experimental / Metal

Label:

House of Mythology

Reviewed:

January 8, 2026

Black metal has been chummy with ambient music since birth, but Ulver's commitment to the genre is something else. Their debut album, Bergtatt (1995), released when singer Kristoffer Garm Rygg was 18, inspired a whole universe of nature-drunk folk metal; meanwhile, Nattens Madrigal (1997) is a prime example of the most scabrous and distortion-encrusted recesses of black metal. Between the two was the ambient Kveldssanger (1996), which proved they could work well at a lower altitude, but that still didn't prepare anyone for 2000's Perdition City: an airless, bled-out trip-hop expanse, finely manicured but devoid of people, and a plausible precursor to the current wave of hyperreal Scandinavian art-pop.

Neverland comes 25 years into their post-Perdition City journey, and though it's a fine example of their late-career style, two absences are obvious. The first is Garm's vocals, which can be a fly in the ointment; even at his best, he sometimes sounds like Mark Kozelek adrift in a sea of Dubai dream tones. The lengthiest stretch of language here is the introductory “Fear in a Handful of Dust,” whose recital from T.S. Eliot's “The Waste Land” hearkens back to their earlier experiments setting William Blake's poetry, and which probably sounds more badass if you didn't study the poem in high school English.

The other major absence is Tore Ylwizaker, Ulver's keyboardist, who passed away in 2024. Ylwizaker's contributions to the band were a major factor in their move away from metal into electronic music; without his characteristically chilly midrange piano textures, the band—now the duo of Garm and multi-instrumentalist Jørn H. Sværen—searches for extremes of bass and treble, digging into the low end while keyboards and fake orchestras trill endlessly in a higher register. The production sounds more EDM circa 2011 than ambient techno circa 2001, and “Hark! Hark! The Dogs Do Bark” is interspersed with a sound that could be a dubstep wub, someone imitating a dog, or the two mixed together.

If the cover art suggests '70s private-press albums have snuck into Garm's rotation, the music seems to confirm it. Lead single “The Weeping Stone” sounds like Hans Zimmer remixing Iasos' new-age classic Inter-Dimensional Music, with a floor-rumbling low end undergirding avian and simian chatter. A high-pitched whine on a few tracks could be an aquatic animal. Ulver don't totally escape the worst tendencies of new age: “Welcome to the Jungle” and its fake sitars represent the kind of out-of-touch exotica the post-I Am the Center new age revival was supposed to supplant. But it's fun to see a band who created an irreplaceable atmosphere on its debut commit so completely to a form of vibe music that's as balmy and diurnal as Bergtatt was cold and grim. It's hard to find any real analogs for Ulver; imagine if Tomb Mold committed to their jazzy side gig Daydream Plus for the next quarter-century, or if Neil Young hung up his guitar and kept putting out variations on Trans.

Still, Neverland doesn't quite break the pervasive feeling that the band's trajectory since Nattens madrigal hasn't always lined up with their strengths. Bits of their metal roots shine through in apocalyptic details like the Eliot narration and apocalyptically absurd titles like “They're Coming! The Birds!” and “Hark! Hark! The Dogs Do Bark,” not to mention the fact that one of the tracks shares a name with an all-time sleaze anthem from Guns N' Roses. Yet their early work still feels somehow more atmospheric than their later work where atmosphere is the focus, with a real sense of fear that Neverland can't quite conjure for all its handfuls of dust. Ulver is a role model for any musical act, metal or otherwise, that refuses to be boxed in and takes big swings for art's sake. But while Neverland is a triumph of unbending commitment, it's less often a triumph of inspiration.

Cate Le Bon and St. Vincent have once again joined forces. Listen to their new duet, “Always the Same,” below. The song follows Le Bon's production of her onetime tourmate's 2024 album All Born Screaming and her vocal turn on the title track.

Fresh off her October album Michelangelo Dying—as well as her production of Dry Cleaning's imminent new album—Le Bon is preparing to head out on a tour of North America this month, starting in Washington, D.C., on Monday. She said of the new song in a press release, “‘Always the Same' needed a little more elbow room than the album would allow but it is cousin to the song cycle of Michelangelo Dying, coming into formation in the same breath. Special to me because it features dear friend and mighty artist St. Vincent who occupies the space around me with composure and gravitas whilst I kick around in the dirty waters of love.”

Maria BC has lined up a new album, Marathon. The Oakland musician will release their Spike Field follow-up on February 27, via Sacred Bones. Watch F. Saber Sutphin's video for the title track—a song of conflicted nostalgia for Marathon gas stations—below.

Maria BC says of the new song in a press release:

There was a Marathon gas station at the end of the street I lived on as a kid. Its big, glowing sign was a landmark for me—when I could see it from the window of my mom's car, I knew we were about to be home. Its iconic ‘M'—on the rare occasion I encounter one these days—still brings up that old feeling, the familiarity of homecoming, and a twinge of nostalgia. There's something perverse about this, I think. The oil company's branding is, or at least was, exceptionally patriotic, what with its red, white and blue color scheme and idealized Midwestern imagery, all dusty roads, cowboys and wild horses that harken the brand's slogan, ‘Fueling the American Spirit.' I once heard someone refer to advertising as ‘satanic poetry'—I have to agree. That this logo, even with all the evil it connotes, can invoke nostalgia—can be a beacon—is very sinister to me.

They add, of the album, “I decided to spend less time on production and recording and more time on songwriting. The result, I think, is more thematically consistent, lyrically speaking, and more concise… I set out to make something more dynamic and varied.”

	Nikki McCann Ramirez



	Hours after executing the raid to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, the heads of the United States government gathered before the press not to exalt democracy or detail their plan for Venezuelan self-determination, but to make clear that they intend to bleed the nation of its oil reserves. 


	President Donald Trump is “deadly serious about getting back the oil that was stolen from us,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned. The president himself repeatedly told reporters that the South American nation — home to some of the largest oil reserves on the planet — “stole our oil.” 


	“We're going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,” Trump said. “We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground.”


	Trump did not notify Congress of his plans to depose Maduro, but he says he did tip off American oil executives. On Tuesday, Trump announced that Venezuela would be “turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil, to the United States of America.” The president also clarified that the seized oil would be “sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!”

	The arrangement is unprecedented even in the history of American resource imperialism, and experts warn that the administration's move to take control of Venezuela's oil production, seemingly with the intent of keeping the profits, will be incredibly difficult, risks triggering a full internal collapse within Venezuela, and could turn violent. 

	











	“There's absolutely no doubt this is 100 percent driven by President Trump's desire that Venezuelan oil is now owned, run — and therefore the profits are controlled — by the White House,” Robert Pape, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, tells Rolling Stone. In Pape's view, however, “Trump will never control Venezuela's oil.”

	The United States does not actually have a legal claim to energy resources under Venezuela. As a matter of international law, a government cannot unilaterally claim ownership over the natural resources of another nation. At the center of Trump's claims of “theft” are billions in unpaid settlement funds international courts granted to American oil companies after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez, seized assets belonging to foreign oil companies amid a push to fully nationalize the industry in 2007. 


	To have a single industry play such a large role in the economy of a nation can give “foreign companies a huge amount of political veto power,” says Patrick Iber, Latin American historian and professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The various waves of economic nationalism that shaped Venezuela's energy sector often followed political movements opposing foreign intervention. Negotiating relationships between states and foreign companies is “difficult,” Iber adds, because when a nation becomes highly dependent on one export, allowing international control to take root can feel like a compromise of their sovereignty. 


	Venezuela's economic health has been directly attached to the success of its petroleum production for almost a century. In 1976, President Carlos Andrés Pérez partially nationalized Venezuela's then-thriving oil industry, creating Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). The move took place at a time when many global oil producers were moving toward state-controlled models, and Venezuela continued to work with foreign energy companies. The 2007 takeover under Chavez was the inflection point that would eventually lead to the near total collapse of Venezuela's economy. Companies fled Venezuela just as oil prices dropped globally. Expensive social projects proposed by Chavez depended on oil revenue for funding, which became more scarce as the infrastructure abandoned by major energy corporations fell into disuse and disrepair. Collapsing revenue, as well as overspending, corruption, and hyperinflation would ultimately destroy the national economy.

	In deposing and arresting Maduro, the Trump administration has refused to endorse members of the opposition who credibly defeated the Venezuelan despot in the nation's 2024 elections. The nation will instead be governed — at least as the administration is presenting it — by the remnants of Maduro's government and inner circle, under the control and supervision of Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. The administration will throw open the door to American oil companies interested in extracting the thick crude of Venezuela's under-tapped reserves. The Venezuelan government will likely acquiesce to whatever arrangements the Trump administration demands. Trump said earlier this week that Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, told Rubio that she'd do whatever the U.S. wants. “She was quite gracious,” Trump said, “but she really doesn't have a choice.” Trump told The New York Times on Wednesday that the U.S. could control Venezuela for years.


	All in all, Trump's government is preparing to write the next chapter of a decades-long tug of war over Venezuela's oil fields. 


	“There's a lot of unknowns here,” says Michael Paarlberg, associate fellow with the Institute for Policy Studies. He notes that what is happening is “not regime change — it is leadership change, but with the same regime in place, one that is just as repressive, just as corrupt, and willing to sell out the Venezuelan people that they're all also continuing to repress anyway.” While Maduro has been replaced by Rodríguez, the factors destabilizing Venezuela remain largely in place. It might get ugly if the U.S. tries to dictate how the region's oil is managed. 


	“There are already tons of places in Venezuela where the state does not have a legitimate monopoly on the use of force,” Iber explains. “The other way to think about the way that the Venezuelan economy works is as a series of fiefdoms that have been parceled out to regime allies to exploit resources — whether those are oil or gold mining — or where somebody in the military has control of an area, and skims the profits out of the mostly illegal operations that are happening there with a ton of exploitation.” 


	“Anything that happens to disrupt the networks that are doing that is going to produce internal strife,” he adds. 


	Pape, who has built his expertise around insurgencies and guerilla movements, agrees. “We already have the remnants of the colectivos” — pro-Maduro militias that have carried out arrests of journalists and cracked down on dissenters since the dictator's capture — and factions of the Maduro government that will be “primed to keep that, the gold, the oil money, for themselves.”  

	











	Pape argues that while the United States has made a show of force in the seas around Venezuela, they have little to no hope of controlling the interior of the country without a robust ground force. 


	“I've advised every White House, including the first Trump administration,” he says, adding that the armada of about 10,000 Marines currently stationed in the Caribbean “would be very useful for perimeter defense, for controlling the area and space around the oil fields, and the oil infrastructure […] but they're not going to be very good at preventing guerrilla warfare.” 


	The U.S. military is not trained to run oil fields, and any effort to capture, control, and rebuild Venezuela's energy sector would require the participation of thousands of private contractors. The United States already has a reputation of imperial exploitation in Latin America, and experts like Pape worry that in an already unstable country, Trump's loud declarations that the U.S. intends to commandeer their primary economic resource could place contractors and others brought in by the Trump administration to manage the takeover in the crosshairs of insurgent violence. 


	“This whole mission has a gigantic hole right in the middle of it, which is that this situation is not going to be safe for civilian contractors,” Pape says. “You will need hundreds, if not thousands, scattered over the oil fields for weeks and months to actually run the oil out in a way that America, the White House, will profit. This is just extremely unlikely to happen.”

	Iber and Paarlberg agree that the situation is extremely fragile. Rodriguez, currently acting as interim president, will be facing pressure and potential violence from other factions of the Chavistas jockeying for power and upset over her public deal-making with the Trump administration. 


	“Anybody who is in charge of the country now has to tie together a really rickety system where a lot of people are on the edge of solvency and are operating through illegal networks,” Iber says. ”[This] could very easily escape out of the boundaries of what [Trump] thinks can be done.”

	As the fervor stemming from Ashley Tisdale's “toxic” mom group essay continues to unfold across parts of the internet, Hilary Duff — whose husband Matthew Koma entered the chat, further escalating the dramatics — is tuning it all out.


	On Wednesday, Duff ramped up the anticipation for her new album, teasing a new song about dive bar hookups, inconvenient roommates, and a once-red-hot romance burning out.


	“I only want the beginning, I don't want the end/I want the part where you say goddamn/Back of a dive bar giving you head/Then sneak home late, wake up your roommates,” sings Duff in a video posted to social media. “I want the highlights, 10 out of 10/The butterflies from holding your hand/Before we swept us under the bed/And we became practically roommates/I'm touching myself by the front door/But you don't even look my way no more.”


	The multi-hyphenate is set to drop her first LP in more than 10 years, titled Luck… or Something, on Feb. 20. She has since released the first single, “Mature,” in November, her first solo music offering since 2015's Breathe In. Breathe Out., which was produced by Koma.

	











	Duff is also scheduled to kick off her sold-out, four-date Small Rooms, Big Nerves 2026 tour on Jan. 19 at O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, which will be followed by a Valentine's Day weekend residency at the Venetian Resort's Voltaire in Las Vegas.

	











	While fans wait to learn more about the upcoming track — no release date or title has been announced yet — Duff has also been roped into drama surrounding fellow Disney Channel veteran Tisdale. Last week, Tisdale penned an essay for The Cut detailing how she broke things off with a mom group after a series of scenarios made her feel iced out and like she was in high school again, sans musical.

	Although Tisdale didn't name names, online sleuths speculated that the group in question included the likes of Mandy Moore, Meghan Trainor, and Duff. Soon after, Koma posted an Instagram Story photo of himself recreating Tisdale's photo from her Cut essay alongside a fake headline that declared, “When You're The Most Self Obsessed Tone Deaf Person On Earth, Other Moms Tend To Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.” In a subheadline, Koma added, “A Mom Group Tell All Through A Father's Eyes,” with the caption, “Read my new interview with @TheCut.”


	While there's no word yet from any alleged members of Tisdale's enigmatic former mom group, Duff's husband did repost his wife's video, succinctly hyping: “Let's. Fucking. Gooooo.”

Robyn appeared on The Late Show to perform the title track of her forthcoming LP, Sexistential, her first new album in nearly a decade. The Swedish pop star took the late-night show stage only hours after announcing the release, set for March 27 via Young. 


	The singer performed solo for the dynamic rendition of the song, which saw her dancing along to the rhythmic track and sprawling across the stage floor as she sang. The buoyant track sees Robyn rapping about having one-night stands while 10 weeks pregnant via IVF. 


	She said was inspired to write the track after Andre 3000 claimed no one would want to hear him rap about getting a colonoscopy. “It was my cue,” she said. “I have to do this, I have to write a rap about IVF.”


Sexistential, co-produced with Åhlund, marks Robyn's ninth album, after 2018's Honey. The singer says the material is meant to feel “like a spaceship coming through the atmosphere at a really high speed and crash landing. That's how I felt, like I'd had all these experiences searching too far out into space, and now I'm crashing back into myself.”

	Robyn said the album title was first an inside joke, before she realized how fitting it was. “Exploring my sensual life is the same feeling as when I make a good song,” she said in a statement. “It's such a beautiful kind of sensitive vibration that takes so much work to keep afloat. I feel like the purpose of my life is to stay horny — it doesn't even have to be about sex, but it's feeling sensual and attracted to things that I enjoy, and not letting anything take over that.”

	











	Robyn previously debuted “Sexistential” along with “Talk to Me,” the album debut single, at a show on New Year's Eve. She performed at the Brooklyn Paramount following an appearance in Times Square, where she showcased “Dopamine,” released in November.

The lights are not a sign of alien life but rather from a Starlink Satellite. 

The satellites can appear as a string of pearls or a“train” of bright lights moving across the night sky.

TRENDING STORIES:

SpaceX launched its first Starlink of 2026 on Jan. 4. 

They orbit at an altitude of 342 miles above Earth, according to space.com. 

The main goal is to provide low-cost internet to areas that are unable to access it. 

You can track the satellites' path here.

Are UFO's physical objects from an advanced alien civilization or is there another possible explanation?

PUBLISHED ON

January 8, 2026

The U.S. government is afraid. 



For the last few years, we have watched a slow-motion collision between the Department of Defense and a reality it cannot explain. We have seen Congressional hearings where decorated pilots testify about objects performing impossible maneuvers. We have heard intelligence officials invent sterile, bureaucratic language to describe the inexplicable: “Instantaneous acceleration,” “transmedium travel,” and “signature management.” 



They call these objects UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena). They treat them as a technological surprise—a potential national security threat from China, Russia, or somewhere further afield. The Pentagon is scrambling to collect data, desperately trying to catch up to a phenomenon they believe is new.

But it isn't new. If the intelligence community bothered to open a theology textbook—or even a history book—they would realize they are thousands of years late to the conversation. 



The Ancient Data Set
The Church has the oldest, most verifiable data set on this phenomenon in the world. But even before the Church, this reality was recorded by every major civilization. 



We see it in Egyptian hieroglyphs. We hear it in the oral traditions of indigenous peoples who spoke of “Star People” long before the Old Testament was written down. This phenomenon has been a constant companion to humanity. The only thing that changes is the language we use to describe it.

Consider the “modern” mystery of livestock mutilations—where animals are found surgically drained of blood with specific organs removed. The media treats this as a terrifying trend that started in the 1970s. But court records from England date similar events back to 1606, describing entire flocks slaughtered with only “inward parts” taken, often accompanied by strange “fireworks” in the night sky. 



The phenomenon hasn't changed. We have. We have traded the language of the supernatural for the sterile language of “national security”; and in doing so, we have blinded ourselves to the truth. 



The Physics of Fatima
Nowhere is this clearer than in the most famous mass miraculous event of the 20th century: the Miracle of the Sun at Fatima in 1917. 



To the faithful, it was a validation of Our Lady's message to three shepherd children. But strip away the religious context for a moment and look at the event through the eyes of a modern Facilities Superintendent or a physics professor. 



On October 13, 1917, nearly 70,000 people gathered in the Cova da Iria field. It had been raining for hours. The ground was a muddy quagmire, and the crowd was soaked to the bone. Suddenly, the clouds broke. The sun appeared as a silvery, opaque disc, yet it wasn't the sun as we know it—witnesses said they could stare directly at it without hurting their eyes. 



Then, the physics broke. 



The disc began to spin wildly on its axis, casting off multicolored lights. It stopped, then plunged toward the earth in a zigzag pattern—a maneuver now cited by U.S. Navy pilots as a hallmark of UAP interaction. The crowd screamed, believing the world was ending. Just before hitting the ground, the object reversed course and shot back into the sky. 



But the most telling detail—the one often overlooked in Sunday school—was the heat. 



After the object departed, the 70,000 witnesses realized that their soaked clothes and the deep mud of the field were instantly, perfectly dry. 



In modern UAP parlance, this is known as “heat generation” or radio-frequency energy, one of the five “observables” established by the Pentagon's AATIP (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program). The spinning motion corresponds to the “anti-aerodynamic lift” observed in the famous “Gimbal” video released by the Navy. The zigzag descent is “instantaneous acceleration.” 



The Pentagon is currently spending millions of dollars to study “observables” that 70,000 Catholic peasants watched for free in a Portuguese field a century ago. 



A Materialist Trap
The danger we face today is not the phenomenon itself. The danger is allowing a strictly materialist government to define a spiritual reality. 



The modern secular mind is trapped in a binary. When they see a silver disk defy gravity, they have only two boxes to put it in: either it is a secret government drone, or it is a visitor from another planet. Because our culture has abandoned the supernatural, it must force every anomaly into a “nuts and bolts” physical explanation. 



This is why the government narrative is one of fear. If a metal craft can shut down our nuclear silos and outrun our fastest jets, that is a threat. It implies a technological adversary that we must build weapons to fight. 



But the Catholic worldview offers a third option: the veil between the physical and the spiritual is permeable. 



We know that nonhuman intelligences exist. We know they can interact with the physical world—causing temperature changes, moving matter, and manipulating light. We know they can appear as “angels of light” to deceive, or as signs from Heaven to instruct. 



When we view UAPs through this lens, the “threat” evaporates, replaced by a call to discernment. Are these phenomena “aliens” traveling light-years in tin cans? Or are they the same spiritual entities that have always interacted with humanity, simply wearing a mask that fits our sci-fi obsessed culture? 



Reclaiming the Narrative
I am a convert to the Faith, and I work in facilities management. I deal with systems—HVAC, plumbing, electrical grids. I know how the physical world is supposed to work. When I look at the UAP data and then I look at the history of the Church, I don't see two different things. I see one reality that the Church has always understood and the state is just now discovering. 



We cannot sit on the sidelines of this “Disclosure” conversation. If we do, the world will be told that “We are not alone” in a way that leads them toward technological worship or existential dread. 



We need to remind the world that we have never been alone. The sky has always been full. The “Transmedium Travel” that baffles the Navy is child's play to the angels and terrifyingly easy for the demonic. 



The veil is thinning. The government is finally seeing what the saints have seen for centuries. The question isn't “What are they?” The question is “Who will we listen to?” 



We must not let the Pentagon rebrand our history as their discovery.

Just before hitting the ground, the object reversed course and shot back into the sky. 



But the most telling detail—the one often overlooked in Sunday school—was the heat. 



After the object departed, the 70,000 witnesses realized that their soaked clothes and the deep mud of the field were instantly, perfectly dry. 



In modern UAP parlance, this is known as “heat generation” or radio-frequency energy, one of the five “observables” established by the Pentagon's AATIP (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program). The spinning motion corresponds to the “anti-aerodynamic lift” observed in the famous “Gimbal” video released by the Navy. The zigzag descent is “instantaneous acceleration.” 



The Pentagon is currently spending millions of dollars to study “observables” that 70,000 Catholic peasants watched for free in a Portuguese field a century ago. 



A Materialist Trap
The danger we face today is not the phenomenon itself. The danger is allowing a strictly materialist government to define a spiritual reality. 



The modern secular mind is trapped in a binary. When they see a silver disk defy gravity, they have only two boxes to put it in: either it is a secret government drone, or it is a visitor from another planet. Because our culture has abandoned the supernatural, it must force every anomaly into a “nuts and bolts” physical explanation. 



This is why the government narrative is one of fear. If a metal craft can shut down our nuclear silos and outrun our fastest jets, that is a threat. It implies a technological adversary that we must build weapons to fight. 



But the Catholic worldview offers a third option: the veil between the physical and the spiritual is permeable. 



We know that nonhuman intelligences exist. We know they can interact with the physical world—causing temperature changes, moving matter, and manipulating light. We know they can appear as “angels of light” to deceive, or as signs from Heaven to instruct. 



When we view UAPs through this lens, the “threat” evaporates, replaced by a call to discernment. Are these phenomena “aliens” traveling light-years in tin cans? Or are they the same spiritual entities that have always interacted with humanity, simply wearing a mask that fits our sci-fi obsessed culture? 



Reclaiming the Narrative
I am a convert to the Faith, and I work in facilities management. I deal with systems—HVAC, plumbing, electrical grids. I know how the physical world is supposed to work. When I look at the UAP data and then I look at the history of the Church, I don't see two different things. I see one reality that the Church has always understood and the state is just now discovering. 



We cannot sit on the sidelines of this “Disclosure” conversation. If we do, the world will be told that “We are not alone” in a way that leads them toward technological worship or existential dread. 



We need to remind the world that we have never been alone. The sky has always been full. The “Transmedium Travel” that baffles the Navy is child's play to the angels and terrifyingly easy for the demonic. 



The veil is thinning. The government is finally seeing what the saints have seen for centuries. The question isn't “What are they?” The question is “Who will we listen to?” 



We must not let the Pentagon rebrand our history as their discovery.

We see it in Egyptian hieroglyphs. We hear it in the oral traditions of indigenous peoples who spoke of “Star People” long before the Old Testament was written down. This phenomenon has been a constant companion to humanity. The only thing that changes is the language we use to describe it.

Consider the “modern” mystery of livestock mutilations—where animals are found surgically drained of blood with specific organs removed. The media treats this as a terrifying trend that started in the 1970s. But court records from England date similar events back to 1606, describing entire flocks slaughtered with only “inward parts” taken, often accompanied by strange “fireworks” in the night sky. 



The phenomenon hasn't changed. We have. We have traded the language of the supernatural for the sterile language of “national security”; and in doing so, we have blinded ourselves to the truth. 



The Physics of Fatima
Nowhere is this clearer than in the most famous mass miraculous event of the 20th century: the Miracle of the Sun at Fatima in 1917. 



To the faithful, it was a validation of Our Lady's message to three shepherd children. But strip away the religious context for a moment and look at the event through the eyes of a modern Facilities Superintendent or a physics professor. 



On October 13, 1917, nearly 70,000 people gathered in the Cova da Iria field. It had been raining for hours. The ground was a muddy quagmire, and the crowd was soaked to the bone. Suddenly, the clouds broke. The sun appeared as a silvery, opaque disc, yet it wasn't the sun as we know it—witnesses said they could stare directly at it without hurting their eyes. 



Then, the physics broke.

After the object departed, the 70,000 witnesses realized that their soaked clothes and the deep mud of the field were instantly, perfectly dry. 



In modern UAP parlance, this is known as “heat generation” or radio-frequency energy, one of the five “observables” established by the Pentagon's AATIP (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program). The spinning motion corresponds to the “anti-aerodynamic lift” observed in the famous “Gimbal” video released by the Navy. The zigzag descent is “instantaneous acceleration.” 



The Pentagon is currently spending millions of dollars to study “observables” that 70,000 Catholic peasants watched for free in a Portuguese field a century ago. 



A Materialist Trap
The danger we face today is not the phenomenon itself. The danger is allowing a strictly materialist government to define a spiritual reality. 



The modern secular mind is trapped in a binary. When they see a silver disk defy gravity, they have only two boxes to put it in: either it is a secret government drone, or it is a visitor from another planet. Because our culture has abandoned the supernatural, it must force every anomaly into a “nuts and bolts” physical explanation. 



This is why the government narrative is one of fear. If a metal craft can shut down our nuclear silos and outrun our fastest jets, that is a threat. It implies a technological adversary that we must build weapons to fight. 



But the Catholic worldview offers a third option: the veil between the physical and the spiritual is permeable. 



We know that nonhuman intelligences exist. We know they can interact with the physical world—causing temperature changes, moving matter, and manipulating light. We know they can appear as “angels of light” to deceive, or as signs from Heaven to instruct. 



When we view UAPs through this lens, the “threat” evaporates, replaced by a call to discernment. Are these phenomena “aliens” traveling light-years in tin cans? Or are they the same spiritual entities that have always interacted with humanity, simply wearing a mask that fits our sci-fi obsessed culture? 



Reclaiming the Narrative
I am a convert to the Faith, and I work in facilities management. I deal with systems—HVAC, plumbing, electrical grids. I know how the physical world is supposed to work. When I look at the UAP data and then I look at the history of the Church, I don't see two different things. I see one reality that the Church has always understood and the state is just now discovering. 



We cannot sit on the sidelines of this “Disclosure” conversation. If we do, the world will be told that “We are not alone” in a way that leads them toward technological worship or existential dread. 



We need to remind the world that we have never been alone. The sky has always been full. The “Transmedium Travel” that baffles the Navy is child's play to the angels and terrifyingly easy for the demonic. 



The veil is thinning. The government is finally seeing what the saints have seen for centuries. The question isn't “What are they?” The question is “Who will we listen to?” 



We must not let the Pentagon rebrand our history as their discovery.

The disc began to spin wildly on its axis, casting off multicolored lights. It stopped, then plunged toward the earth in a zigzag pattern—a maneuver now cited by U.S. Navy pilots as a hallmark of UAP interaction. The crowd screamed, believing the world was ending. Just before hitting the ground, the object reversed course and shot back into the sky.

James and Lou move from Chicago to London to escape their past, but they soon discover that places aren't haunted, people are… Inspired by the iconic, terrifying film series, Paranormal Activity is a new story live on stage. What did the critics think?

London is a city built on ghosts. Romans, plague pits, abandoned Tube stations and the collective memory of audiences who still shudder about The Woman in Black. There's even a theatre supposedly inhabited by a ghost dolphin called Flipper.

You can now get a first look at production photography for the West End run of Paranormal Activity. Patrick Heusinger and Melissa James reprise their Leeds Playhouse roles as ‘James' and ‘Lou'. 

On October 28, I was fortunate enough to sit down on Zoom with Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger, the two leading performers of the show to chat about their careers and being a part of this amazing franchise in a new way.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","'Paranormal Activity' Reboot Director's New Horror Film Will Have You Hearing the Sounds of Terror","https://collider.com/paranormal-activity-director-new-horror-movie-undertone-trailer-a24/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

A24 is about to expose viewers to the sound of pure terror with its new horror film, Undertone. Right in time for the witching hour, the indie giant released the first trailer overnight, introducing The Handmaid's Tale alum Nina Kiri as Evy, a paranormal skeptic who's about to become a believer. The film follows the host of the titular popular horror-tinged true-crime podcast during a recording session when she's sent a series of terrifying audio files to review for the show. She soon realizes, however, that they are more than just deeply disturbing sounds, but legitimately haunted recordings that turn her life into a waking nightmare.

The footage begins with Evy, the in-house skeptic of the Undertone podcast, doing her intro and teeing up an episode focused on the files shared by her co-host, who's a believer in the supernatural. Everything they received came from an anonymous email, but as the pair starts digging into them, all Evy hears is a jumble of mildly creepy sounds. Her partner, however, believes he can pick up a message when playing the recordings in reverse. Everything quickly takes a turn as more words become discernible, a nerve-shredding version of ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" plays, and the hauntings seem to spread into the host's house. The lights start to flicker, there's banging throughout the house, and the clock starts speeding back to 3 a.m., all signs that tell even Evy that something is horribly wrong and they should stop the session. It's too late, however, as the back half of the trailer sees the garbled words of the recordings spread beyond her headphones and throughout her home, teasing a demonic presence that demands to be heard.

Undertone marks the feature directorial and writing debut of Ian Tuason. Like fellow filmmakers Skinamarink's Kyle Edward Ball and Talk to Me's Danny and Michael Philippou, Tuason first gained recognition on YouTube, making virtual reality horror shorts that racked up millions of views and earned showcases at SXSW and beyond. While Kiri will get the bulk of the screentime in his first film and was the only person physically seen in the trailer aside from a haunting background figure, she won't be alone for the horror. The White Lotus and Overcompensating star Adam DiMarco is also on board, alongside Michèle Duquet, Keana Lyn Bastidas, and Jeff Yung. Dan Slater and Cody Calahan are set to produce.

A24 jumped all over Undertone following its much-lauded premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival last year. The slow-burning horror mystery earned rave reviews for its haunting atmosphere and attention to detail, using the in-universe podcast to create a uniquely rich soundscape for terror. Tuason's debut feature was impressive enough that he's already set to make a massive step-up in his career with a legendary found footage franchise — Paranormal Activity. Back in December, he was tapped to helm the upcoming reboot entry being produced by James Wan at Blumhouse-Atomic Monster. Given Undertone's setup, it appears to be a match made in heaven for the filmmaker, and it's moving along quickly at the banner.

Undertone arrives in theaters on March 13. Check out the trailer in the player above.

Nearly six years after the finale, fans are still hoping for a revival of the long-running fantasy TV show, Supernatural, which has had an immense impact on pop culture. Though the two main actors in the series, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, have had successful careers since the conclusion, they have both expressed an interest in returning to the roles that continue to define their reputations.

As a potential revival project continues to be discussed, there are a few obvious characters that fans expect to return to Supernatural, including Misha Collins' Castiel. However, several other side characters from the series will also be hoped for in a reboot. These characters had a significant impact on the Winchesters' arcs and the overall storyline, making them critical players in any new plot.

 Claire Novak is one of the best female characters in Supernatural, first introduced as the little girl of Jimmy Novak, the vessel of the angel Castiel. Years later, Claire comes back as a troubled teen who blames Castiel for her difficult life, including her mother abandoning her and her growing up in group homes. Eventually, she becomes a member of Jody Mills' household, hunting monsters despite the objections of others.

Claire is a controversial Supernatural side character, known for her tough and harsh personality. However, fans would still like to see the Wayward Sisters spinoff, which was proposed and would have focused on Jody Mills and her pupils, including Claire. Despite being a significant character in Castiel's storyline, she was largely overlooked in the last few seasons, appearing only a couple of times as a side plot between the major conflicts.

Some viewers preferred the other side characters and found Claire unlikable, but she's still one of the most fascinating characters, with enough substance to support a Supernatural spinoff series. What is most appreciated about Claire's inclusion is how she represents the next generation of hunters who will take up the torch after those like Sam and Dean. If there is ever to be a revival, the storyline cannot forget about this next generation.

 Garth has one of the best character introductions in Supernatural, appearing in one of the most controversial episodes in the series, yet he still manages to leave an impression. Despite being unorthodox and goofy, he quickly becomes a cherished friend of Dean, who relies on the hunter several times throughout the years. Garth doesn't work like many of the other hunters introduced, but always manages to take down the villain and survive another day.

At one point in Garth's plot in Supernatural, he becomes a werewolf, which typically results in hunters taking their own lives to avoid becoming the monsters they hunt or having another hunter eliminate them. Garth defied the odds, learning to control his impulses as a werewolf. In the end, he is married to another werewolf with children and supports others of his kind who live in peace without hurting humans.

Garth has one of the best story arcs in Supernatural because he provides nuance, proving that not all the monsters of the world are evil and need to be taken out by hunters. Characters like him showed others, like Dean Winchester, that the world is more complex than they initially believed. His role is a crucial representation of the complexities of the overall world-building.

 Rowena MacLeod's story began as a powerful villain in Supernatural, introduced as an ancient witch who keeps herself alive through dark magic and works to get Lucifer out of Hell's cage, hoping it would benefit her. However, she eventually becomes a powerful ally to the Winchesters, especially after Lucifer kills and discards her (from which she resurrects herself with a spell). She is also known as the mother of the demon Crowley, who became the King of Hell to spite his absent mother.

Though Rowena was rarely someone the Winchesters could trust entirely, she had one of the most impressive plot twists in Supernatural. In Season 15, Rowena sacrificed herself by absorbing all the souls from Hell to keep them from destroying Earth. Regardless of all of her bad acts previously, this selfless act solidified the witch as one of the most heroic characters in the TV show.

In another shocking twist, Rowena came back as the Queen of Hell in the final season, thanking Sam Winchester for killing her (which she demanded of him at the time) so she could finally take the position of power she always wanted. Considering Rowena's morally gray characterization, this seemed like the perfect ending for her. However, most fans would love to see her return for a revival, especially if there is another conflict between Heaven and Hell.

Jack Kline is one of the most powerful Supernatural characters ever, fathered by Lucifer and born to a human mother, Kelly Kline, who sacrificed her life to bring him into the world. Born into the world in the appearance of a teenager, Jack had an unusual storyline from beginning to end. As the child of the devil, he was never fully trusted by any of his allies and fought hard to understand his immense power and his place in the world.

Jack is another controversial personality within the fandom due to his questionable actions, including accidentally killing the Winchesters' mother, Mary, but he is still one of the most impressive characters in Supernatural. Despite the odds, Jack ended up siding with good and helped take down God when he tried to destroy the world. Without the Almighty, Jack took over the role and chose to restore balance.

Supernatural's series finale left a lot of fans wanting more, but Jack had one of the most satisfying conclusions of any character. Considering his position in the final season, there is a high likelihood that he will play a role in any revival that brings back Sam and Dean Winchester, who are both in Heaven by the conclusion.

 One of the most devastating stories in Supernatural is that of Jody Mills, the sheriff of Sioux Falls, who loses her son and husband during an encounter with the dark supernatural world around her. It is this experience that connects Jody with the Winchesters and Bobby Singer on a more personal level, becoming a part of their trusted inner circle. Though she occasionally helps them with cases, Jody eventually becomes a respected and skilled hunter.

Jody Mills isn't just one of the best hunters in Supernatural, but an endearing character who fills the role of mother and friend for several characters. She loses her own child to tragedy, but takes in Claire Novak, Alex Jones, a girl raised by vampires, and also Kaia, a girl from another dimension. By the conclusion, she is a safe person for dozens of characters harmed by supernatural beings, but is also the one people can count on to give them tough love as well as endearing encouragement.

Among the hundreds of side characters throughout the fifteen seasons, Jody is one of the overall best characters in Supernatural, beloved as much as significant supporting characters like Bobby Singer and Castiel. As one of the most trustworthy people in the Winchesters' chosen family, a revival could not happen without bringing back Sheriff Mills.

 Ben Braeden played an underrated role in Dean Winchester's character arc, originally introduced as the son of Dean's old flame, Lisa, whom Dean initially thinks is his own child. Though Ben turns out not to be Dean's biological son, he joins their family in Season 6 when he believes Sam is in Hell. Dean's experiences with Lisa and Ben give him a taste of a normal life before he is pulled back into the dangerous world of hunting.

One of the most infuriating storylines in Supernatural is when Dean has Castiel take the memories Lisa and Ben have of him after they're attacked by a demon. Many viewers considered this a cheap and heartbreaking way to end their storyline, especially considering how important they became to Dean. This time, having a family shaped Dean's characterization, though they were rarely mentioned after Season 6.

This is one of the frustrating Supernatural storylines that fans hope get addressed in a revival. While Lisa was also a critical character, there is no denying that Dean had a special bond as a surrogate father to Ben. It would be thrilling to see the boy come back as an adult, potentially taking up monster hunting even after losing his memories of Dean.

I would love to see Claire return and was disappointed we didn't get the Wayward Daughters spinoff but it worked out for the best for Kathryn Newton since she has gone on to become a movie star and if she had done the spinoff show she might never have got the lead role in 'Freaky.' Kathryn still loves 'Supernatural' though and she has said she would return if they brought the show back and she was going to appear in the final episode but the pandemic stopped her.

    The Winchesters are no longer on Netflix. Here's where you can stream them today.
    

Supernatural, the cult classic about two brothers hunting monsters, was a Netflix staple for more than a decade. It arrived back in 2012, and was the home of this popular show for the last 8 years of its run on the CW, with new seasons added shortly after the end of their run on TV. That era has ended, as Netflix's licensing agreement for all 15 seasons has ended and the Winchester brothers have found a new streaming home. 

The final episode of Supernatural, which starred Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean Winchester, siblings who are paranormal investigators and demon hunters, aired on Nov. 19, 2020. This means those five years are up and the show has officially left the platform. You know how sometimes you take things for granted without even realizing it? Supernatural on Netflix is one of those instances when you don't truly appreciate what you have until it's taken away.

Before you panic and decide to make a crossroads deal to watch your favorite show, take a deep breath. Supernatural is still available to stream. Peacock has all 15 seasons available to watch right now. 

If you don't subscribe to Peacock, Amazon Prime also has all 15 seasons. You can stream it, or buy it outright for $0.48 an episode or $8 a season. It's also on Apple TV and Fandango Now, where prices range from $10 to $25 a season.

Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.

While there is no deal available at the moment for Peacock, we encourage you to stay on the lookout for streaming deals which do pop up occasionally. However, there are other ways to get Peacock Premium at no — or low — cost if you're savvy.","{'href': 'https://www.cnet.com', 'title': 'CNET'}","other"

Jason Thornton's memoir, Why Me? Life, Trauma, and Alien Encounters, details his traumatic upbringing, life behind prison walls, brushes with death, and various close encounters.

The book tells the devastating impact on his life of being sexually assaulted in his childhood. The trauma led him down a pathway of crime and gambling addiction. It landed him in two of the UK's top security jails, HMP Frankland in Durham and HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire, where he describes violent encounters with other inmates.

The tale also details uplifting moments where the 54-year-old turned his life around, like entering rehab and becoming a successful salesman who broke sales records.

Jason says he penned the book to process his experiences, but also to inspire others to tell their stories.

""The book is about my life, what happened to me, and my life of crime. I ended up in two of the worst prisons in the country because the others couldn't control me. I have been through a lot, and the book tells about one-eighth of my life,” said Jason.

He also describes two episodes where he says aliens abducted him, as well as his two-year battle with PTSD, and a near-death experience when his lung collapsed due to the effects of vaping. He adds that he has also lived with MS for 26 years and fibromyalgia for 17 years, a chronic condition causing widespread pain and fatigue, which left him bed-bound for three years.

""I was going to write the book anyway, but the abductions spurred me on. The book was a way to process it all and get it out of my head. The other reason [for writing it] was to give people the courage to write about their experiences,” said Jason.

""It means a lot to me. I feel really proud of myself. My mum's really proud of me. When I got the first proof-copy, she said, ‘You're an author!'”

Jason's next plan is to publish a fiction e-book.

Uri Geller has offered his island off the coast of East Lothian to Donald Trump as a military base. The spoon-bending psychic, 79, addressed the US president in a bizarre video shared on social media.

His offer came following Trump's announcement he wanted to take over Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, as the 51st US state. The president previously claimed it would be vital to US national security.

Its location, between North America and the Arctic, means it is well-placed for early warning systems should a missile attack occur, and monitoring activity in the region's waters.

Trump first attempted to buy the territory during his first term in the White House in 2019, but was told by Denmark it was not for sale.

Geller bought Lamb Island, located in the Firth of Forth near North Berwick, 18 years ago, and claimed this week it was ""blessed by supernatural powers"", and had a ""mind-blowing"" connection to Greenland.

He said in a video on X: ""When I bought the island, I knew why, and I still know it today. America needs Greenland.""

He added: ""Not just America needs Greenland, the whole world needs Greenland.""

The video was captioned: ""President Trump, I can solve the problem with Greenland. Adopt my Scottish Lamb Island as your 51st state and use it as a military base!

""Dock your navy and aircraft there - and if you get into a war with China, I will come to your rescue. Lamb is protected by mystical forces and you will succeed with its power.

""All Greenlanders can become citizens of Lamb, so Denmark does not need to worry.""

The psychic previously said he believed his island, which he declared his own micronation with its own flag and national anthem, had a link to Ancient Egypt and the Great Pyramids of Giza.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/UFOs","Anna Brady-Estevez in response to a question about Grusch and biologics: ""Ive actually seen the biologics"". 15 to 30% overlap with terrestrial DNA. ""Some of these things have really bizarre implants""","https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1q7gx38/anna_bradyestevez_in_response_to_a_question_about/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 16:50:46 GMT","


      Before we get to the quotes about the biologics, here some info about her:
    


      Dr. Anna Brady-Estevez is a deep tech venture capitalist, founding partner of American DeepTech. She holds a PhD in chemical/environmental engineering from Yale and previously directed SBIR programs at the NSF, investing in space, energy, and blockchain startups. She advocates for UAP transparency
    


      Recently Karl Nell said something that i think is related to her role:
    


Timestamp 40:40:
    


      Karl Nell: ""The UAP Disclosure Act (UAPDA) was going to be followed by UAP Whistleblower Protection Act (UAPWPA), which was going to be followed by a UAP Truth and Reconciliation Act (UAPTRA). And several of these are already written. They're ready to go, right?""
    


      Karl Nell: ""And so, you know, this program probably still needs to continue. And this idea of eminent domain that a lot of people are kind of concerned about, is a phase in a bigger plan that goes into a consortia phase, and into a regulated market phase""
    


      So i think this Anna Brady-Estevez maybe played that role to get companies interested in the tech. See the purple section on this slide from Karl Nells presentation (mirror)
    


      Now on to what she said in yesterdays interview:
    


Timestamp 35:25:
    


      Martin Willis: ""And so I want to ask you first of all how you felt about all that [reverse engineering and biologics] when you first heard about it. Did you think it's a possibility?""
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""[...] I've actually subsequently seen biologics, but I'll get into that [...]
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""[...] I've actually spoken about some of these things before and I've been a little bit uncomfortable talking about it too, but [she whispers] it's been edited out""
    


      Martin Willis: ""So, did I hear you say just a minute ago that you have seen biologics?""
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""[... ]does [biologics] mean it's engineered? I mean what does that mean? Why are they using the word biologic? So what I've subsequently seen is... which I understand might be very close to what David had seen is in terms of, not necessarily the same place, not necessarily the same beings, but something perhaps similar, was these exotic biologics""
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""And when I say exotic biologics, they... I went with a doctor... they are not human. The doctor said not human. There's been DNA testing [...] the shared DNA testing which should be validated, is that it's 15% overlap with terrestrial DNA. 30% overlap with terrestrial DNA. Which is very very very very low""
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""So those tests can be complex, on archaeological samples. So it's not that there aren't errors that could be introduced, including having a much, the newer terrestrial DNA being amplified up to a much and it's it doesn't need to be terrestrial""
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""It could be common type DNA. But seeing something that is not human does not make it extraterrestrial, right? So that's why, saying something like exotic biologics, it's not really stating exactly what it is""
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""if anybody's been to the Smithsonian, and they've seen that exhibit where [...] there's the Neanderthalss, there's the Florenis, there's there's these different species, human or homminid type species""
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""[...] it's something that is not human, but that does not mean that it's extraterrestrial. Although there are some indications of some things that are really very very different from human""
    


Timestamp 53:03:
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""[...] how would I develop that? Whether it's NHI, whether it's advanced military... how would I build that? And it can also just be inspiration. I know you've talked about consciousness, so [...] we're looking at why is something much higher performing?
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: ""But on the biologic side some of these things have really bizarre implants. So, is there like medical implants? Is there some utility from those implants? Is that something that would be worth doing? Is it something that you want to stay away from? So, there's biologic impacts of some of these technologies. There's the consciousness, there are people [...]""
    


      She continues to describe that from the hundreds of entrepeneurs and businesses she has funded, some of them report getting their information from ""somewhere else"".
    


      For all of the above, i do wonder if she is talking about those dried up Peru tridactyl mummies. But those are reported to have 70% human DNA. So not consistent with what she says. They did have implants. I know very little about the tridactyl stuff and this is just what my AI told me. I think its more likely she is talking about those tridactyl mummies than that she had access to biologics from the legacy program. We know Grusch told Burlison to have a look at them, so Grusch must think they are similar to what he has seen.
    


      She said a lot more about the biologics, and i removed about 50% of it to keep the post short. I recommend people to watch it from about timestamp 35:25 onwards
    


      The question of the most convincing UFO sighting ever recorded is complex and often depends on individual belief and the nature of the evidence. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples:
    


      Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail.
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting."" - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee.
    


      Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling.
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



Corroboration: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



Triangular Craft Sighting: [""I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/

The U.S. government is considering investing in a company's critical minerals mining projects in Greenland, its CEO has told CNBC, ahead of high-stakes talks between Washington and Danish officials over the island's future.

The projects are run by mining company Amaroq, which operates in South Greenland and is involved in extracting or exploring gold, copper, germanium and gallium, among other critical mineral deposits.

Discussions with U.S. government bodies about the potential investment opportunities are ongoing and haven't been finalized, Amaroq CEO Eldur Olafsson told CNBC in an interview.

Deals could involve ""offtake agreements, infrastructure support and credit lines,"" Olafsson added, though he declined to comment on what specific projects the U.S. government was interested in.

When asked to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told CNBC: ""The United States is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland.

""President Trump reiterated the importance of Greenland to U.S. defense and underscored his commitment to the relationship by designating Governor Landry as Special Envoy to Greenland.""

CNBC approached the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) for comment but had not received a response as this article went live.

Olafsson's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up talk of acquiring Greenland, which he sees as integral to national security, following a dramatic military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday.

European nations have been scrambling to respond to escalating rhetoric about Greenland from the U.S., which has refused to rule out military action.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to meet with officials from Denmark next week to discuss Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.

The White House sees Greenland's deposits as a potential way to break China's dominance in the critical minerals space.

Rare earth companies with projects in the Arctic island surged earlier this week on U.S. comments about acquiring the Arctic island.

Trump has mainly emphasized national security when discussing Greenland in recent days, but former national security advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News in January 2025 that U.S. interest in the island was about ""critical minerals.""

Some experts have cautioned that extracting critical minerals from Greenland isn't economically viable due to the harsh conditions and lack of infrastructure, but Olafsson told CNBC that it was realistic with proper planning and logistics.

He compared the process to significant critical minerals mines in Russia and Alaska, which, he said, were built in similar conditions.

He said that ""one of the biggest challenges in any mining project is usually some [transporting minerals] long distances on land,"" but added that many of Greenland's mineral deposits were near ""deep fjords,"" meaning they could be easier to ship. 

Climate change has transformed some parts of Greenland, with ice melting to reveal wetlands, areas of shrub and barren rock. 

This has made some of the island's strategic minerals more accessible for mining firms.

Rep. Ricki Ruiz said three people in his district alone were detained under this ruse.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers can't enter someone's home without a warrant, but that doesn't stop agents from using tactics to get to people. 

ICE agents have altered license plates and placed Mexican flag stickers on their vehicles to try to lure and detain people, NPR reported. And now, Oregon utilities are taking steps to ensure their customers don't mistake ICE agents for their employees. 

In December, NW Natural, a natural gas utility serving 2 million people in Oregon and southwest Washington, published guidance in seven different languages on how to identify if someone is actually one of their employees. Portland General Electric has similar guidance on its website. 

NW Natural employees wear a uniform and a utility badge that says “contractor,” and they will never ask for immediate access to a customer's home. Its workers usually ask for access to a back or side yard to access a meter, the guidance says. 

NW Natural spokesperson David Roy said the company was made aware of incidents of people posing as utility workers and decided to issue the guidance. 

“We translated the message in order to reach as many individuals and communities as possible,” Roy told the Capital Chronicle. 

Rep. Ricki Ruiz, D-Gresham, said he was already concerned about scammers going door to door taking people's money in his district, but he contacted NW Natural and Portland General Electric in December after hearing that three people in his city were detained after ICE agents posed as utility workers.

“They lured him out of his house, and they took him,” Ruiz said in an interview about the first instance he heard about. 

​​Ruiz represents Oregon's 50th House District, a diverse region that includes parts of East Portland and Gresham. According to census data, more than 16% of Gresham residents were born outside the U.S., and 44% of those residents are from Latin America. 

ICE did not respond to the Capital Chronicle's request for comment.

Oregon, particularly the Portland area, has been at the forefront of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration, especially within the Portland metropolitan area. U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents revealed in court in early December that the federal government brought ICE agents from around the country to Portland as part of what they're calling “Operation Black Rose.” Agents use advanced surveillance technology to locate and detain people, often stopping people in their vehicles and using violence, according to an analysis from Stephen Manning, the executive director of Portland-based immigration law firm Innovation Law Lab. 

As the February 2026 short legislative session approaches, several Democratic lawmakers have indicated they plan to sponsor bills addressing federal immigration enforcement in the state. Ruiz said he will sponsor legislation to support lawsuits against federal agents if they come into a person's home without warrants and a bill to prevent ICE agents from wearing masks. 

“As a state representative, I get the great honor of representing my constituents not only as a Democrat,” Ruiz said. “I represent Republicans. I represent unaffiliated voters and I represent people who can't vote.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Another violent death in Minneapolis lays bare the nation's fractured politics","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/minneapolis-shooting-fractured-us-politics-analysis","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:59 GMT","


            It took just a few seconds and a violent, unnecessary death to drag a snowy residential street in Minneapolis into America's new age of political brutality.
    


            Soon, all of America was sharing the horror, as bystander video of an ICE agent's point-blank shooting of 37-year-old American Renee Nicole Good flashed onto millions of mobile device screens.
    


The grainy scene — with its older homes, ice underfoot and green-clad government agents closing on a civilian car — seemed a little unreal. It evoked old news footage from a repressive Soviet state more than the land of the free.
    


            But the killing quickly became the latest explosive incident in the second term of Donald Trump that is dragging politics to a bitter breaking point.
    


            Minneapolis' Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey, plainly outraged by a killing just a day into a federal crackdown sending 2,000 federal agents to his city, told ICE to “get the fuck out.”
    


            But Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem mobilized to define their own misleading narrative. “It was an act of domestic terrorism,” Noem said. A more conventional public servant might have promised inquiries, offered solace and called for calm. 



            Trump was more inflammatory. He posted on social media that a woman seen screaming in a video was a “professional agitator” and that Good “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense.” None of the available video is so unequivocal.
    


            It was left to Good's mother to try to reclaim her humanity. Donna Ganger told the Minneapolis Star Tribune her daughter was “not part of anything like that at all” and was compassionate, forgiving and affectionate.
    


            This was the latest sickening example of violence arising from politics that is draining America's morale and marks a savage chapter in modern history. It follows two assassination attempts against Trump in 2024; the killings of a beloved Minnesota Democratic lawmaker, Melissa Hortman, and her husband last year; the alleged murder of a health insurance executive on a New York street in 2024; and the abhorrent gunning-down of MAGA hero Charlie Kirk in September.
    


            The lesson of past horrors is that politics may thwart national closure.
    


            Normally, an investigation would be expected to probe the mindset and decisions of the officer who killed Good. It might examine whether the force used was excessive or whether current rules of engagement with suspects encourages escalation. But Trump and Noem may have already prejudged any federal inquiries.
    


            At a later news conference in Minneapolis, Noem didn't leaven her initial assessment. But she said: “Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that in this situation, it was preventable.”
    


            Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “you can accept that this woman's death is a tragedy while acknowledging it's a tragedy of her own making.” Vance also said that he, Trump and the entire administration were behind ICE agents.
    


            This was only the latest encounter between citizens and the ICE agents who've fanned into major cities. Often wearing masks, the agents sometimes dragnet American citizens as well as undocumented migrants. Social media videos show car rammings by federal agents or pro-immigration activists. ICE officials told CNN in October that attacks against agents rose 1,000% last year. Noem said one officer involved on Wednesday was dragged by the car of an “anti-ICE rioter” in June.
    


            This all poses a searching question: Is an immigration crackdown that Trump insists will make American safer in fact making it far more dangerous?
    


            Putting the particulars of Wednesday's incident aside, it's possible that any American, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, is in peril. A a few wrong choices by either party in the heat of the moment could spell disaster.
    


            Is that level of danger and risk really tolerable in a democratic society? And is America beginning to resemble some authoritarian states where lives of individuals are a trifle compared to the political ambitions of strongmen? Trump has, after all, declared that America is under “invasion” by foreign migrants and has authorized warlike tactics in response.
    


            It's too early to assess lasting political impact, if any, from Wednesday's shooting.
    


            But the killing took place only a mile from the street corner where another bystander's video was filmed before going viral and creating a mass movement: that of George Floyd, who died with a police officer's knee on his neck in 2020.
    


            One reason Trump was elected in 2024 was that millions of Americans believed that former President Joe Biden lost control of the southern border. Trump has honored a pledge to stem undocumented migration. And a country that fails in enforcement won't make its people feel safe.
    


            But horrible scenes like the one in Minnesota on Wednesday seem far removed from Trump's campaign pledge to first go after criminals, rapists, drug traffickers and the worst of the worst. Looking back in months to come, the Minnesota shooting could appear as a turning point when more voters in a midterm election year rejected his excesses.
    


            Political consequences may, however, be in the eye of the beholder. Administration critics will see state-authorized violence, repression and due process being crushed. Supporters may find enough in the videos to argue that the officer concerned opened fire because he felt his life was at risk. And advocates of Trump's policy will highlight murders committed by illegal migrants.
    


            But Trump's critics say the risks of misunderstandings, violent encounters and innocents being harmed mean his ordering of thousands of armed agents onto the streets is reckless.
    


            “When do things stop being about politics and start being about actual human decency?” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said to reporters. “We can all hypothesize on what all of their political reasons are. But meanwhile, a woman died being shot in her car, and everything that they're doing is making it worse and not better.”
    


            If the crackdown's intent is at least partly performative, public safety risks become even more questionable.
    


            “I have been worried – not that federal law enforcement activity was happening, but how that enforcement was taking place in the city,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN's Erin Burnett. “And I have specifically said I've been worried we would have a tragedy in our community.”
    


            But former Vice President Mike Pence told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that “today should be a cautionary tale that people ought not to, as reports in this case suggest … be harassing ICE officers.”
    


            Good's death came against a backdrop of Trump's dystopian attempts to portray Democratic-run cities as hellholes where migrant gangs run riot and regular Americans fear for their lives. He's used such depictions to justify draconian tactics like the dispatch of the National Guard into some cities last year.
    


            The federal government is also currently locked in a clash with Minnesota over claims in conservative media that Somali-run child care centers have fraudulently taken funding earmarked for low-income families. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, just announced he was dropping his reelection bid over the controversy.
    


            Minnesota Democratic leaders fear any unrest in protest at Wednesday's events could result in a more intense crackdown.
    


            Frey dismissed administration depictions of the shooting as “garbage” but asked Minnesotans not to give Trump a pretext for an even greater show of force.
    


            Walz had a similar message. “They want a show. We can't give it to them. We cannot,” he said. “If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can't give them what they want.”
    


            By nightfall on Portland Avenue, where Minnesota skyscrapers loom in the distance, residents held a vigil for yet another American victim drawn to their death by political forces that, once unleashed, cannot be tamed.

            A prominent tycoon wanted by United States federal prosecutors for allegedly running one of Asia's largest transnational criminal networks has been arrested and extradited to China, Cambodian authorities said Wednesday.
    


Chen Zhi, 38, a national of China and Cambodia, was extradited on Tuesday after a months-long investigation by the two countries, Cambodia's Interior Ministry said in a statement. Chen's Cambodian citizenship had been revoked, the ministry added.
    


            The operation was conducted at the request of the Chinese government, the ministry said, though it is unclear what charges Chen faces in China. He was arrested alongside two other Chinese nationals.
    


            Chen is the founder and chairman of Prince Group, which bills itself as one of Cambodia's biggest conglomerates, with investments in luxury real estate, banking services, hotels, and major construction developments.
    


            But US federal prosecutors say his business empire was fueled by forced labor and cryptocurrency scams that conned victims the world over and at one point were allegedly earning Chen and his associates $30 million every day.
    


            In October, the US Treasury Department and UK Foreign Office sanctioned Prince Group and dozens of its affiliates, designating them transnational criminal organizations. Chen was charged in absentia in New York with money laundering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, along with several associates.
    


            Prosecutors also seized $15 billion in cryptocurrency from Chen following a years-long investigation, in what the Justice Department said was the largest forfeiture action in its history.
    


            Since the indictment was announced, several other jurisdictions including Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan announced seizures or freezes of hundreds of millions of dollars in assets linked to Chen.

            CNN has reached out to lawyers representing Prince Group for comment on Chen's arrest. Prince Group has previously denied engaging in unlawful activity, calling the allegations “baseless” and “aimed at justifying the unlawful seizure of assets,” according to a statement published on its website.
    


            China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said “relevant Chinese authorities” would release information regarding the case at a later date.
    


            “For a period of time, China has been actively cooperating with Cambodia and other countries to combat cross-border telecommunications and online fraud, achieving significant results,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press briefing Thursday.
    


            Cambodia has recently come under more pressure to act against the scam networks operating within its borders. In its statement, the interior ministry said Chen's arrest was “within the scope of cooperation in combating transnational crime.”
    


            The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has said the criminal networks that run the scam hubs are evolving at an unprecedented scale, despite highly publicized crackdowns last year.
    


            “This arrest reflects sustained international pressure finally reaching a point where continued inaction became untenable for Phnom Penh,” said Jacob Sims, visiting fellow at Harvard University's Asia Center and a transnational crime expert.
    


            “It defused escalating Western scrutiny while aligning with Beijing's likely preference to keep a politically sensitive case out of US and UK courts.”
    


            Analysts say Chen's extradition to China will mean it is “highly unlikely” he will face justice in the US, at least in the short term. China does not have an extradition treaty with the US and the two countries are embroiled in a deepening geopolitical and economic rivalry.
    


            “This outcome effectively shields Chen from US jurisdiction,” said Sims.
    


            The global scam industry, much of it centered in Southeast Asia, is estimated to be worth between $50 billion and $70 billion. In 2023 it conned victims in the United States alone out of at least $10 billion dollars.

            The massive industry relies on hundreds of thousands of people who have been trafficked or lured to work in heavily guarded scam compounds, where they are forced to carry out investment or romance scams known as “pig butchering,” to con ordinary people out of their life savings.
    


            US prosecutors allege Chen and others operated at least 10 forced labor camps across Cambodia since 2015 to engage in cryptocurrency investment schemes under the threat of violence.
    


            Authorities allege they laundered criminal proceeds through the business and bribed government officials to stay ahead of criminal investigations and raids on the compounds.
    


            Prince Group, American and British authorities allege, was the umbrella for more than 100 shell companies and entities allegedly used to funnel laundered cash across 12 countries and territories from Singapore to St Kitts and Nevis.
    


            Chen and others used the stolen money to buy Picasso artwork, private jets and properties in upscale neighborhoods of London, ﻿as well as supplying bribes to public officials, according to prosecutors in New York.
    


            Analysts say Chen faces a number of outstanding legal issues in China, though the charges remain opaque and have not compelled his extradition until now.
    


            “What is clear, however, is that Beijing has strong incentives to handle this quietly and internally, given the political sensitivities surrounding his business empire, its regional ties, and in particular, a number of reported ties to various Chinese government officials,” Sims said.

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Mississippi has kept winning despite its coach bolting for another program.

Miami has rekindled the glory days of its 2001 national championship with a ferocious defense and steady quarterback.

One will play for a national championship after Thursday night's Fiesta Bowl.

Ole Miss (13-1) spent the last half of the regular season wondering if coach Lane Kiffin would stick around or leave for LSU. Once the coach did head out, the sixth-seeded Rebels kept winning to reach the College Football Playoff semifinals.

Defensive coordinator Pete Golding took over as coach and many of the assistants expected to join Kiffin in Baton Rouge stuck around to see the Rebels through the rest of the playoffs. Ole Miss and its high-scoring offense blew out Tulane in its opening CFP game and outlasted mighty Georgia 39-34 in the semifinals.

Miami (12-2) is in the midst of its best run since winning the 2001 national title.

The 10th-seeded Hurricanes have done it with a defense that went from mediocrity to one of the stingiest in the FBS under first-year coordinator Corey Hetherman. Miami gave up its fewest points since the 2001 national championship team — fourth nationally at 13.07 per game. The Hurricanes have been even stingier in the CFP, holding Texas A&M and Ohio State to a combined 17 points.

Like most big games, the Fiesta Bowl will likely come down to which quarterback plays best.




Miami's Carson Beck is a proven winner, earning a national championship as a backup at Georgia before two stellar seasons as the starter. He's been a perfect fit since transferring to Miami, throwing for for 3,313 yards and 27 touchdowns on 74% passing with 10 interceptions.

Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss took a circuitous route to the playoffs.

With limited options out of high school, the dual-threat quarterback opted to play at Ferris State, leading the Bulldogs to a Division II championship last season. Chambliss has been superb since taking over as starter three games into this season, racking up 4,180 total yards and 29 touchdowns.

Protesters confronted federal agents outside a facility in Minneapolis on Thursday, one day after the deadly shooting of Renee Nicole Good.

Vice President JD Vance challenged Democrats on Thursday morning to explain whether a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis was ""wrong in defending his life.""

The vice president posed the question on X and called on the media to press Democratic lawmakers and candidates on the issue.

""Every congressional democrat and every democrat who's running for president should be asked a simple question: Do you think this officer was wrong in defending his life against a deranged leftist who tried to run him over?""

""These people are going to try to arrest our law enforcement for doing their jobs. The least the media could do is ask them about it,"" Vance wrote.

Chaos erupted in Minnesota on Wednesday after an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good tried to ""weaponize her vehicle"" and ""attempted to run a law enforcement officer over."" She also accused Good of ""stalking and impeding"" federal agents all day. Noem told reporters that Good was instructed to get out of her car and stop ""obstructing"" law enforcement, but she did not comply.

The agency is labeling the incident as an act of ""domestic terrorism.""

On Thursday, in a separate post on X, Vance expanded on his defense of the officer's actions, slamming critics for engaging in ""gaslighting."" The post was made in response to comments from Jenin Younes, the national legal director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, who argued that the officer was not in danger and had time to get out of Good's way. Vance said Younes' arguments were ""preposterous.""

""The gaslighting is off the charts, and I'm having none of it. This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job. When he approached her car, she tried to hit him,"" Vance wrote. ""A tragedy? Absolutely. But a tragedy that falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with.""

DEMOCRATS LOOK AT DEFUNDING ICE, IMPEACHING NOEM AFTER MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING

Several Democratic lawmakers, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and several others, have slammed ICE in the wake of the shooting.

In a news conference immediately after the fatal shooting, Frey told ICE to ""get the f--- out"" of the city and rejected DHS' claim that the shooting happened in self-defense, calling it ""garbage."" The mayor also claimed ICE was ""creating the kind of dysfunction and chaos that they claimed to be trying to help with.""

""Get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" Frey said. ""We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite. People are being hurt, families are being ripped apart.""

Walz also rejected DHS's statement on the shooting, dismissing the agency as a ""propaganda machine.""

During a news conference, the governor vowed the state would ""seek accountability and justice"" following the shooting. He also rejected further assistance from the federal government, calling out President Donald Trump and Noem by name during a news conference on Wednesday. The governor then announced that he had issued a warning order to the National Guard and that members were prepared for deployment if and when necessary.

WALZ PREPARES NATIONAL GUARD AFTER WOMAN KILLED IN ICE OPERATION: 'NEVER BEEN AT WAR' WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

Omar, a fierce critic of ICE, took to social media to slam the agency, saying that the officer's actions were ""unconscionable and reprehensible.""

""I am beyond outraged that their reckless, callous actions led to the killing of a legal observer in Minneapolis. My heart breaks for the victim's family, who will have to forever live with the pain caused by the Trump administration's reckless and deadly actions,"" Omar wrote. ""This administration has shown, yet again, that it does not care about the safety of Minnesotans... This is not law enforcement. It is state violence. It is simply indefensible, and ICE must be held accountable.""

Klobuchar, who is reportedly considering a run for Minnesota governor after Walz dropped his bid for a third term, said the shooting was ""the result of the administration sending federal agents onto our streets against the wishes of local law enforcement.""

""While our immigration enforcement should be focused on apprehending and prosecuting violent criminals to make our communities safer, these ICE actions are doing the opposite and making our state less safe,"" the senator added.

Several Democrat lawmakers from outside Minnesota have also weighed in. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the shooting ""absolutely horrific"" and accused multiple Trump administration officials, including the president, of lying about the incident. Additionally, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani accused the ICE officer of committing murder.

President Donald Trump's renewed focus on housing affordability has found a clear villain: institutional investors that own large swaths of single-family homes in fast-growing Sun Belt cities, where would-be homeowners increasingly find themselves bidding against Wall Street.

Trump argued in a social media post Wednesday that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans, saying he's immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes. 

The message may be aimed at places like Atlanta and Jacksonville, metropolitan areas where investor ownership is far higher than the national average. 

While institutional investors only own roughly 2% of the nation's single-family rental housing stock, their presence is far more concentrated in parts of the Southeast. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates, for example, that investors control about a quarter of Atlanta's single-family rental market, more than a fifth of Jacksonville's and sizable shares in Charlotte and Tampa.

Those concentrations trace back to the aftermath of the financial crisis, when large investors moved aggressively into housing markets flooded with foreclosures. By buying homes in bulk, they helped stabilize prices in hard-hit regions experiencing sharp declines, particularly across the Sun Belt, according to Wolfe Research. 

""While their overall footprint is limited, ownership is heavily concentrated in Sun Belt cities, likely reflecting expectations of stronger home price appreciation,"" analysts at Wolfe said in a recent note to clients.

The idea of curbing Wall Street's role in housing isn't new. Analysts at BTIG note that Congress has seen multiple efforts in recent years to rein in institutional homeownership, ranging from tighter regulations and financing limits to outright ownership bans and even forced liquidations. 

""Bureaucratic limitations have historically hindered the legislation in Congress, and as it stands now most bills remain in the 'Introduced' phase,"" BTIG said in a note. 

Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. The president said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.

Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI will proceed to trial, further escalating his yearslong feud with the company and its CEO, Sam Altman. 

""We appreciate the Court's thorough and fair consideration and look forward to trial,"" Musk's lead counsel, Marc Toberoff, told CNBC's David Faber Thursday in a statement following a hearing with U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers.

Musk and Altman co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit research company alongside several other researchers and executives in 2015. Musk departed from OpenAI's board in 2018 after trying to convince Altman to let his autos business, Tesla, acquire the AI nonprofit.

In the lawsuit, Musk alleged he agreed to start the company because he was promised that it would ""chart a safer, more open course than profit-driven tech giants,"" according to a complaint.

""The hearing confirms what we've maintained from the outset — there is substantial evidence that OpenAI's leadership made knowingly false assurances to Mr. Musk about its charitable mission that they never honored in favor of their personal self-enrichment,"" Toberoff said.

OpenAI has repeatedly denied the claims, and lawyers for the company have filed a motion to dismiss the case.

The Tesla CEO alleges in the suit that he was ""assiduously manipulated"" and ""deceived"" after OpenAI established an ""opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates,"" including its multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft, and explored converting to a for-profit entity, the filing states. 

He claimed Altman and the other defendants have been ""unjustly enriched to the tune of billions of dollars in value.""

A spokesperson for OpenAI said Thursday that Musk's lawsuit ""continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.""

""We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever,"" the spokesperson said. 

Gonzalez Rogers said Wednesday that the case would head to trial, according to the Associated Press. The judge said she still needed to determine some of the logistics as to how that trial will be set up.

Microsoft is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, as Musk alleges the company aided and abetted OpenAI's breach of fiduciary duty. A representative for Microsoft did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The lawsuit was filed in August 2024 in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California. 

In 2024, OpenAI announced plans to convert into a for-profit company, which would have wrested control from the nonprofit and kept it as a separate arm. After facing pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, OpenAI said its nonprofit would retain control.

The startup announced it completed its recapitalization in October, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business. 

As part of that recapitalization, Microsoft holds an investment in OpenAI's for-profit arm valued at around $135 billion. 

Musk has long warned about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and the risks it could pose for humanity, and launched his own AI company called xAI in 2023. He competes directly with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and other AI players. 

XAI started as a for-profit, ""benefit corporation"" with an obligation to deliver environmental and social benefits through its work. The company dropped that obligation and its benefit corporation status in 2025 when Musk merged xAI with his social network X.

Musk has come under fire in recent weeks after the company's chatbot and image generator, Grok, allowed users to easily create and share what's known as ""deepfake porn,"" or nonconsensual intimate images of real-life women, and AI-generated images depicting child sexual abuse. 

X and xAI are facing regulatory probes over the images by the European Commission, India, Malaysia and Australia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Is XRP (Ripple) the Next Bitcoin?","https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/08/is-xrp-ripple-the-next-bitcoin/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

XRP is an emerging player in the cryptocurrency landscape.

When I began my investment journey nearly a decade ago, the prospect of investing in Bitcoin (BTC 0.15%) was nearly the same as tossing your hard-earned money on the ground and simply walking away. In its early days, cryptocurrency was often referenced as a mechanism for money laundering or seen as the investment equivalent of gambling or playing the lottery.

Nevertheless, retail investors in particular took a liking to the cryptocurrency opportunity. Through a combination of optimism and curiosity, those who invested in Bitcoin 10 years ago and held through today have beaten the S&P 500 by almost 100 times.



Bitcoin Price data by YCharts.

Unsurprisingly, investors are now scouring to find the next Bitcoin. One cryptocurrency that has risen in popularity in recent years is XRP (XRP 2.53%) -- a coin distributed by financial services firm, Ripple.

With a price of about $2, could XRP some day reach a six-figure price point as Bitcoin has? Let's assess the differences between XRP and Bitcoin and explore if the token could emerge as the next breakout candidate in the cryptocurrency landscape.

There are both macro-oriented and token-specific tailwinds that could fuel XRP's price throughout 2026.

While the Federal Reserve has begun cutting interest rates, Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi thinks further easing of monetary policy is on the horizon. Zandi cites ""fragile"" economic growth. He forecasts 2% gross domestic product (GDP) as well as a weak job market that could inspire the Fed to cut rates at least twice this year.

Broadly speaking, a lower interest rate environment can influence investors to at least consider allocating some of their capital toward more speculative assets such as cryptocurrency. Under these conditions, inflows directed toward smaller tokens like XRP could be in store.

Another tailwind for XRP could be rising adoption of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These are passive funds that track the price of XRP without requiring investors to own the coin outright, bypassing much of the administrative nuances of buying cryptocurrency on exchanges and storing them in a crypto wallet. Some of the more popular spot XRP ETFs include the Grayscale XRP Trust ETF, Franklin XRP ETF, and Canary XRP ETF.

Another potential tailwind for XRP revolves around its primary use case as a bridge currency. Ripple's payments infrastructure is both faster and more cost efficient than incumbent protocols -- namely, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system.

Businesses that rely on Ripple have the option to denominate their transactions in XRP as opposed to fiat currency, providing a clever way to bypass foreign exchange fees in cross-border payments. If Ripple acquires more market share in the cross-border payments industry, it could lead to wider adoption of XRP in the long run.

Lastly, Ripple has outlined a robust plan to expand beyond payments applications. Specifically, the company's ecosystem is beginning to explore additional decentralized finance (DeFi) utilities across lending, stablecoins, compliance, and real world asset tokenization in which ownership of assets such as stocks and bonds is converted into tradeable crypto.

While Ripple's ambitions to disrupt the payments industry will take years to bear fruit, XRP could witness renewed buying activity if a rising number of investors begin to collectively buy into the idea that the coin will play a central role in Ripple's long-term adoption.

Given the details above, XRP's upside trajectory looks compelling. The question is: Could XRP experience a rally similar to that of Bitcoin?

In order to answer this, investors must understand what fueled Bitcoin's rise to begin with. After all, it's not like Bitcoin has overtaken fiat currency as a means of payment at global scale. All things considered, Bitcoin's utility is still relatively niche.

Right now, nearly 20 million Bitcoins have been mined and are in circulation. Interestingly, Bitcoin boasts a total supply base of 21 million coins.

At its core, Bitcoin is viewed in a similar fashion to alternative assets like gold, artwork, or rare collectibles. In other words, there is an inherent scarcity mindset when it comes to investing in Bitcoin; it's capped supply makes it desirable despite the speculation that comes with owning it.

XRP, despite its current utility and potential to evolve into a more multifaceted player in the payments world, is structurally different from Bitcoin. I like to think of XRP as more of a business -- or at least an extension of a business (Ripple) -- whereas Bitcoin is more of a store of value.

Against this backdrop, owning XRP versus Bitcoin requires two totally different investment theses.

Choosing to invest in XRP boils down to your appetite for risk. If you're only interested in XRP because you're hoping it will experience an explosive rise akin to Bitcoin, then you're likely to be disappointed.

On the other hand, if you are seeking some exposure to cryptocurrency and are willing to sit through periods of outsized momentum, then XRP could potentially become a multibagger in the long run.

Still, I would only encourage investing in XRP if you can stomach a high degree of speculation. There is no guarantee that Ripple -- and by extension XRP -- will be widely adopted by banks and corporations in the long run.

NFT Paris and its sibling summit, RWA Paris, have cancelled this year's events due to market uncertainty. Organisers say the numbers stopped working. Simple as that.

NFT Paris had grown used to calling itself a fixture. Launched in 2022, it quickly became Europe's most visible Web3 gathering, drawing crowds from digital ownership, culture and currency. Twenty thousand visitors were not unusual. There were hundreds of speakers and late-night panels promoting decentralisation.

This year was meant to be bigger than ever. Instead, Alexandre Tsydenkov, the founder and constant presence behind the event, announced the cancellation on LinkedIn. stating, “The crypto and NFT downturn hit hard. Too hard.” 

In its early editions, NFT Paris leaned heavily into visual art. Digital galleries. Over time, the tone changed. Less art. More infrastructure. More talk of chains, platforms, scaling up. The sponsor lists reflected that drift. John Karp, who runs Lisbon's Non Fungible Conference, has pointed out that art made up a sliver of the ecosystem, probably under five per cent of sponsors. From that angle, the cancellation is a verdict on NFT art more than on the machinery built around it.

RWA Paris was meant to steady things. A pivot toward real-world assets. Property, luxury goods, commodities. The promise of bridging traditional finance and decentralised systems. It sounded like an exciting prospect to many. Institutional money hesitated. Compliance costs climbed. Ticket sales never materialised.

Tsydenkov's note to his team carried weariness. “Thank you for everything. You deserved better. Four years. Tens of thousands through the doors. Hundreds of speakers. Connections made, then scattered. Endings are tough. No attempt to dress it up.”

All ticket holders will be refunded. Around $230 for general admission. Just over $1,100 for VIP access.

The fight between traditional banking stability and the rise of digital finance – What will the U.S. choose?

The ink is barely dry on the GENIUS Act of 2025, but a massive crack has already appeared, with the nation's largest lenders claiming that the act could drain $6.6 trillion from the U.S. banking system.

In a letter to Congress on the 6th of January, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) and a coalition of powerful banking groups issued a warning.

The letter highlighted a major loophole in the new stablecoin rules, one that lets crypto exchanges operate like high-yield shadow banks.

The GENIUS Act bans stablecoin issuers from paying interest, but banks say their affiliate companies are dodging the rule by offering yields that regular savings accounts could never match.

This has sparked fears of a major shift in how Americans store their money.

If stablecoins turn from a payment tool into a high-interest investment, the BPI warns it could trigger a deposit migration.

Such a shift wouldn't just hurt bank balance sheets.

It could cut off credit to Main Street, making mortgages, business loans, and farm financing harder to get.

During the floor debates leading up to the act's passage in July 2025, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene emerged as a vocal critic, though for vastly different reasons.

She said,

“Back in July, I voted NO on the GENIUS Act because it contained a back door to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).” 

Greene added, 

“I support crypto but I will never support giving the government the ability to turn off your ability to have full control of your money and to buy and sell.”

And, to date, the loopholes seem not to have been addressed.

Recently, providing clarity on the GENIUS Act, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, noted,

“The problem with a GENIUS Act-like approach is that it is focused only on stablecoins, providing no way to balance competition between stablecoins and other payment mechanisms.”

However, as a solution, he further added,

“A better approach would have a comprehensive approach to regulation, i.e., a Clarity Act, and seek to put all traditional and digital payments and assets on a level playing field and let the chips fall where they may.”

Meanwhile, the total stablecoin market cap surged to $317.8 billion, dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle's USDC.

 For perspective, USDT alone commanded a market cap of roughly $187 billion, while USDC has seen an aggressive 73% growth over the last year, reaching $75 billion.

As stablecoins continue to grow, the yield loophole has become their main driver of adoption, but closing it could trigger a major shift.

If Congress blocks exchanges from offering interest or rewards, stablecoins may lose their appeal as high-return savings alternatives and be forced back into their original role as simple payment tools.

Thus, this warning signals that crypto's shadow-banking era is nearing its end, leaving one pressing question: if the rewards vanish, does the $317 billion stay?

Russia has pushed crypto crime to record levels as Vladimir Putin ramps up trade outside of Western financial systems to evade sanctions, new figures show.

Global use of cryptocurrencies by rogue states such as Russia, Iran and North Korea surged by 694pc last year to around $100bn (£74bn), according to data company Chainalysis.

Sanctions evasion has become by far the largest category of overall crypto crime, which soared by 162pc, with a record $154bn in transactions to illicit addresses.

Andrew Fierman, of Chainalysis, said that the actual figure will be even higher as more transactions are identified.

Russia, which has begun to use crypto as a key sanctions-busting tool in international trade, was behind the majority of the huge growth by sanctioned entities, Mr Fierman said.

In 2024, Russia introduced new laws to enable sanctions evasion through cryptocurrency. In February 2025, it launched a ruble-backed stablecoin called A7A5, which has since been sanctioned. In less than one year, the coin has been used in more than $93bn of transactions.

Although much of Russia's trade remains technically legal, foreign banks can risk secondary sanctions if they send or receive payments to or from Russia's sanctioned banks.

The US tightened the criteria for the secondary penalties last summer. This means it has become far more difficult for Russian companies to buy or sell goods across the border. Crypto offers a workaround because the transactions occur on largely unregulated exchanges.

Mr Fierman said: “We have seen nation state activity on the blockchain since its inception. But the scale of it is what has shifted really recently.”

Crypto crime has changed from individuals using crypto to facilitate ransomware attacks to nation states making transactions worth millions of dollars, Mr Fierman said.

Mr Fierman said a sanctioned drone manufacturer that was supplying Russia, which received all of its payments from a single cryptocurrency address that had made trades worth a combined $40m.

“If you're looking at a wallet like that, that is almost definitely a Russian government, Russian military-related wallet.”

Back in 2020, stablecoins, which are typically pegged to a currency and are the preferred crypto asset used to buy and sell goods because they are far less volatile than, for example, Bitcoin, and can be easily transferred across borders, were used in only an eighth of global illicit crypto transactions. Now, they make up 84pc.

Alongside Russia, North Korea and Iran have made extensive use of crypto.

While Iran's proxy networks have ramped up their use of crypto in weapons procurement and oil sales, North Korea last year pulled off the largest cryptocurrency heist in history, stealing $1.5bn in Ethereum tokens from Bybit, a crypto exchange based in Dubai.

GR8 Tech has launched Crypto Turnkey, a platform solution that lets operators accept multiple cryptocurrencies without relying on third-party payment providers or extra technical integrations. The platform enables operators to go live faster, maintain uninterrupted operations, and expand globally with native multi-currency support.

""Industry data shows crypto players deposit 35-50% more and bet with 40-60% higher frequency than traditional players,"" said Denys Parkhomenko, CPO at GR8 Tech. ""The operators winning their markets are the ones acting on that data now, not waiting. We built Crypto Turnkey to make that move simple.""

By eliminating reliance on external payment providers, Crypto Turnkey reduces the risk of launch delays and service disruptions. Unlike traditional payment infrastructures—where provider outages can halt operations—crypto-based payments allow operators to go live faster and maintain uninterrupted revenue flow around the clock.

The platform supports over 15 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT, while maintaining KYC and responsible gambling compliance. Operators gain control over payment uptime, reducing delays and outages common with traditional payment systems.

Also catering to VIP players, who contributed 47% of turnover on GR8 Tech platforms in 2025, Crypto Turnkey allows users to hold multiple currencies, deposit and withdraw without conversion, and switch currencies instantly. The system automatically handles conversions, balance segregation, and real-time exchange rates.

Crypto Turnkey also eliminates chargebacks entirely and reduces transaction costs from 2.5–5% in fiat payments to approximately 0.5%. Settlement times are reduced to 10–30 minutes, compared with three to five business days for traditional payment methods. The irreversible nature of blockchain transactions also minimizes fraud risk and removes the administrative burden of dispute management.

GR8 Tech noted that the payment advantages are amplified when combined with its broader platform capabilities, including AI-driven personalization, advanced CRM tools, sports margin management, and geo-specific “Champion setups” designed to accelerate performance in target markets.

Crypto Turnkey is available globally for new operators or as an upgrade for existing GR8 Tech clients—no extra integration required.

Interested parties can book a meeting with the GR8 Tech team at ICE 2026 to discuss the advantages of the new crypto functionality in person.","{'href': 'https://www.yogonet.com', 'title': 'Yogonet'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A quantum discovery that breaks the rules of heating","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260107225539.htm","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:12:20 GMT","

In everyday experience, applying repeated force almost always leads to heating. Rubbing your hands together warms your skin. Striking metal with a hammer makes it hot to the touch. Even without formal physics training, people quickly learn a basic rule: when you keep driving a system by stirring it, pressing it, or hitting it, its temperature rises.

Physicists expect the same behavior at much smaller scales. In quantum systems made up of many interacting particles, continuous excitation is normally assumed to cause steady energy absorption. As energy builds up, the system should heat. But a recent experiment suggests that this intuition does not always apply at the quantum level.

Researchers from Hanns Christoph Nägerl's group at the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck set out to test whether a strongly driven quantum system must inevitably heat up. Their answer was unexpected.

A Quantum Gas That Stops Absorbing Energy

The team created a one dimensional quantum fluid made of strongly interacting atoms cooled to just a few nanokelvin above absolute zero. Using laser light, they subjected the atoms to a lattice potential that switched on and off rapidly and repeatedly. This setup created a regularly pulsed environment that effectively kicked the atoms over and over again.

Under these conditions, the atoms should have absorbed energy continuously, similar to how motion builds on a trampoline when someone keeps jumping. Instead, the researchers saw a surprising change. After a short initial period, the spread of the atoms' momentum came to a halt. The system's kinetic energy stopped increasing and leveled off.

Even though the atoms were still being driven and continued to interact strongly with one another, they no longer absorbed energy. The system had entered a state known as many body dynamical localization (MBDL). In this state, motion becomes locked in momentum space rather than spreading freely.

""In this state, quantum coherence and many-body entanglement prevent the system from thermalizing and from showing diffusive behavior, even under sustained external driving,"" explains Hanns Christoph Nägerl. ""The momentum distribution essentially freezes and retains whatever structure it has.""

An Orderly Outcome That Defied Expectations

The result surprised even the scientists involved. Lead author Yanliang Guo admitted the behavior ran counter to what they had predicted. ""We had initially expected that the atoms would start flying all around. Instead, they behaved in an amazingly orderly manner.""

Lei Ying, a theory collaborator from Zhejing University in Hangzhou, China, shared that reaction. ""This is not to our naïve expectation. What's striking is the fact that in a strongly driven and strongly interacting system, many-body coherence can evidently halt energy absorption. This goes against our classical intuition and reveals a remarkable stability rooted in quantum mechanics.""

Ying also pointed out that recreating this behavior using classical computer simulations is extremely challenging. ""That's why we need experiments. They go hand in hand with our theory simulations.""

Why Quantum Coherence Matters

To see how robust this unusual state really was, the researchers altered the experiment by adding randomness to the driving sequence. The effect was immediate. Even a small amount of disorder was enough to destroy the localization.

Once coherence was disrupted, the atoms behaved more conventionally. Their momentum spread out again, kinetic energy increased rapidly, and the system resumed absorbing energy without limit. ""This test highlighted that quantum coherence is crucial for preventing thermalization in such driven many-body systems,"" says Nägerl.

Implications for Future Quantum Technologies

The discovery of MBDL has implications that extend well beyond basic physics. Preventing unwanted heating is one of the biggest challenges facing the development of quantum simulators and quantum computers. These devices rely on maintaining delicate quantum states that can easily be lost through energy buildup and decoherence.

""This experiment provides a precise and highly tunable way for exploring how quantum systems can resist the pull of chaos,"" says Guo. By showing that heating can be halted entirely under the right conditions, the findings challenge long held assumptions about how driven quantum matter behaves.

The study opens new paths for understanding how quantum systems can remain stable even when pushed far from equilibrium.

The research has been published in Science and received financial support from the Austrian Science Fund FWF, the Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG, and the European Union, among others.

Xenotransplantation of gene-edited pig kidneys offers a promising solution to the shortage of kidneys for organ transplantation. We recently performed a gene-edited pig kidney transplantation into a living human recipient with end-stage kidney disease. Here, using transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and multiplexed imaging, we conducted high-dimensional immune profiling in this individual. Despite profound depletion of circulating T cells, early T cell-mediated rejection occurred within 1 week after transplantation, likely driven by subtherapeutic immunosuppression and the presence of residual CD8+ T cells in lymph nodes. This T cell-mediated rejection event was reversed by intensified immunosuppression. After treatment, adaptive immunity remained suppressed, whereas innate immune activation, characterized by sustained monocyte and macrophage activity along with elevated levels of interleukin-1 beta and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, persisted. Comparative transcriptomic analysis showed that xenograft rejection profiles resembled those typically observed in human allograft rejection, while also revealing unique innate immune signatures. We did not detect antibody-mediated rejection. The levels of circulating pig donor-derived cell-free DNA rose during the initial rejection episode and declined with treatment, supporting the potential of cell-free DNA measurements as a noninvasive biomarker of xenograft rejection. These findings define the distinct immune landscape of kidney xenotransplantation and highlight the need for regimens targeting both innate and adaptive immunity to improve outcomes.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 25 million individuals in the USA, with many progressing to end-stage renal disease1. For these patients, kidney transplantation remains the gold standard treatment. However, the severe shortage of transplantable organs forces most patients to rely on dialysis. While dialysis is essential for maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality risks2,3. Alarmingly, more than half of the patients on the transplant waiting list will succumb to the disease within an average of 5 years1—a prognosis worse than many cancers—or become too ill to undergo transplantation by the time a kidney becomes available.

Xenotransplantation, the transplantation of organs from nonhuman species into humans, offers a promising solution to the critical organ shortage. If genetically engineered pig kidneys can demonstrate sustained safety and functional superiority over dialysis, they could provide a scalable and transformative alternative for the tens of thousands of patients awaiting life-saving transplants. Advances in gene editing have enabled the development of pigs with enhanced immunological compatibility with human recipients4. These donor pigs, raised under stringent controlled conditions, provide kidneys similar in size and function to human organs while harboring genetic modifications designed to mitigate immune rejection.

On 16 March 2024, a historic milestone in transplantation was achieved at Massachusetts General Hospital with the xenotransplantation of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living human recipient5. In this groundbreaking procedure, a Yucatan pig kidney containing 69 genetic modifications (EGEN-2784) was successfully transplanted into a 62-year-old male patient. While nonhuman primate models have shown promising xenograft survival with optimized immunosuppressive regimens across different swine donors4,6,7,8,9, the human immune system presents greater immunological challenges, including a high frequency of memory cells driven by prior vaccinations, diet and infections. As rejection remains an important obstacle, comprehensive characterization of immune responses following xenotransplantation is crucial for guiding future strategies.

The complexity of human immune responses is influenced by diverse factors such as genetic variability, age, chronic infections and environmental exposures. A comprehensive, multidimensional, longitudinal systems immunology approach is essential to uncover connections between biological pathways, the immunosuppression regimen and clinical outcomes. Here we employed different layers of biological information to systematically perform high-dimensional profiling of the evolving immune landscape in this human kidney xenotransplantation. By integrating longitudinal immune monitoring with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we aimed to unravel the complexities of human-xenograft interaction, define the immunological consequences, and identify key molecular pathways driving rejection and their correlation with clinical parameters. The findings provide critical insights into xenogeneic immune responses and have the potential to refine immunosuppressive strategies and possibly future porcine genetic edits, ultimately improving clinical outcomes in xenotransplantation.

To comprehensively assess the immune response triggered by kidney xenotransplantation, we characterized the recipient's immune profile using proteomics, metabolomics and clinical measurements (Fig. 1a). Using an unbiased, longitudinal, multilayered integrative approach, we identified three distinct immune clusters associated with xenotransplantation (Extended Data Fig. 1). Cluster analysis based on silhouette scores confirmed that three clusters provided the optimal separation (Supplementary Fig. 1): one cluster was defined by a progressive decline in analytes over time (Extended Data Fig. 1a), another showed an increase post-transplantation (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and the third displayed no clear temporal pattern (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

The orange line represents the normalized levels (z-scored) of the indicated clinical measurements at different times. Pre-Tx, pre-transplantation.

Focusing on the cluster of analytes that declined over time (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a), we hypothesized that the immunosuppressive regimen was a key driver of these changes. The regimen included rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG), rituximab (anti-CD20), high-dose steroids and an anti-C5 antibody (ravulizumab) as induction therapy, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with Fc-modified anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (tegoprubart), tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and prednisone (Extended Data Fig. 2). Network analysis with those declining features demonstrated that this cluster was enriched for pathways related to effector immune responses, cytokine-mediated signaling and T cell proliferation and activation (Fig. 1c). Notably, when investigating individual features, we found that several downregulated proteins corresponded to specific effects of immunosuppressive drugs, including CD19 (rituximab), CD8A and CD4 (ATG), interleukin-2 RA (IL-2RA) (tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid), GZMB and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid), CD80 (mycophenolic acid), ITGAM and CXCL9/10 (tegoprubart) (Fig. 1d). CD19 was selected over CD20 as a marker of B cell depletion because it is more broadly expressed across B cell subsets and remains a stable and reliable surrogate following rituximab treatment, whereas CD20 expression can be variably affected by antibody binding.

This immune modulation was associated with improved graft function, reflected by declining creatinine and cystatin C levels. Additional laboratory trends, including reductions in glucose and magnesium and a fluctuating lactate dehydrogenase pattern, were also observed (Fig. 1e), though these are influenced by multiple factors beyond allograft status. Several T cell-associated metabolites, such as homocysteine10, caproic acid11 and oxoglutaric acid12, also showed substantial reductions following xenotransplantation (Fig. 1c). In addition, we observed a decrease in indoxyl, a metabolite linked to chronic kidney disease13,14 and end-stage renal disease15, correlating with improved kidney function observed in our xenotransplant recipient5. Together, these findings demonstrate a striking shift in the circulating immune composition following xenotransplantation, consistent with the selective targeting of adaptive immunity by the immunosuppressive regimen.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at six time points to gain a high-resolution view of the systemic cellular immune dynamics. After quality filtering, approximately 36,000 high-quality cells were analyzed. To better identify the immune subsets, we integrated the longitudinal recipient samples with 22 external healthy control samples from public PBMC datasets. Integrative analysis identified 17 unsupervised distinct cell clusters based on their transcriptomic profiles (Fig. 2a). Using Louvain clustering, we annotated PBMC subsets and mapped their dynamic proportions over time (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3). Integration of longitudinal scRNA-seq data into a temporal UMAP embedding revealed a progressive decline in adaptive immune cells, accompanied by an increase in innate immune cells observed at all post-transplant time points relative to baseline (Fig. 2b). Specifically, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells exhibited a profound reduction compared to pretransplant (Fig. 2c). A xeno-crossmatch assay, incubating the recipient's serum with donor pig PBMCs, detected no xenoantibodies (Extended Data Fig. 4), consistent with B cell depletion and ongoing blockade of CD40–CD40L costimulation.

Data obtained from longitudinal PBMC samples from the recipient were integrated with data from 22 healthy control samples from publicly available datasets (GSE165080 (ref. 39), GSE171555 (ref. 40) and GSE192391 (ref. 41)). b, Proportions of innate and adaptive immune cells in PBMC samples over time. c, The proportion (percentages) of PBMC subsets, derived from single-cell RNA-seq, at the indicated time points.

Cell fractions represent percentages of viable lymphocytes. See also Supplementary Fig. 2 for gating strategies related to the flow cytometry analysis. cDC, conventional dendritic cell; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell.

In contrast to adaptive immune cells, innate myeloid populations, including CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and conventional dendritic cells, were proportionally increased over time relative to pretransplant (Fig. 2c). A detailed characterization of monocyte subsets revealed distinct gene expression profiles over time, using the pretransplant time point as baseline. We identified three major gene expression patterns: gene set 1 (red) included genes upregulated after transplantation; gene set 2 (green) comprised genes that were downregulated; and gene set 3 (purple) contained genes predominantly expressed by CD16⁺ monocytes (Extended Data Fig. 5). Most differentially expressed genes were associated with the migration and differentiation of circulating monocytes into peripheral tissues, including DDIT416, IL1R217, C1QB18, CX3CR119, DUSP520 and EGR121.

Flow cytometry validated the scRNA-seq findings, revealing a pronounced decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Treg cells and B cells (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2), along with a relative expansion of CD14+ monocytes and conventional dendritic cells compared to pretransplant levels (Fig. 2d). These findings indicate a profound shift in the systemic immune landscape, characterized by a suppression of adaptive immunity and the emergence of an innate immune signature.

The second immune cluster identified through multi-omics analysis consisted of analytes that increased following xenotransplantation (Fig. 3a). This cluster was enriched for pathways associated with innate immune activation, including the Toll-like receptor 4 cascade, IL-1 signaling and Fc-receptor signaling (Fig. 3b). Key signaling molecules within these pathways, such as BIRC2, MAPK8, MAP2K3, IKBKB and IKBKG were upregulated (Fig. 3b). Moreover, levels of inflammatory metabolites, including L-kynurenine22 and eicosenoic acid23, also increased following xenotransplantation (Fig. 3b).

a, Integrative clustering of clinical, proteomic and metabolomic data using Fuzzy C-Means clustering across all time points.

To further investigate the functional implications of these findings, we measured cytokine production in response to innate immune stimulation (Fig. 3c). From analysis of 65 cytokines, we detected increases in IL-1β (Fig. 3d), IL-6 (Fig. 3e), IL-8 (Fig. 3f) and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Fig. 3g) following PBMC stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. This cytokine surge paralleled the expansion of monocytes and conventional dendritic cells, suggesting heightened TLR and NF-κB signaling post-xenotransplantation. Furthermore, we identified an increase in type I interferon-related molecules, including IRF5, TIRAP and ISG15, as well as the metabolite adenine24 (Fig. 3b). Taken together, these findings indicate that despite potent immunosuppression targeting adaptive immunity, innate immune activation persists and is augmented over time, highlighting the need for tailored immunosuppressive regimens and/or additional gene editing strategies that mitigate the innate immune responses in xenotransplantation.

Within the first week post-transplant, the recipient developed a Banff grade 2A T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), confirmed by a biopsy on day 8. This rejection occurred despite a marked reduction in circulating adaptive immune cells, shown by our longitudinal scRNA-seq and flow cytometry analyses. Examination of T cell depletion in secondary lymphoid organs revealed that while T cells were effectively depleted from circulation at the time of transplant, persistent CD8+ T cells were still detected on draining lymph nodes (Extended Data Fig. 6). These findings suggest that circulating immune cell counts may not fully reflect the extent of depletion or the risk of rejection. We reasoned that the presence of activated T cell populations that were primed in the secondary lymphoid organs and then migrated to the graft likely contributed to the early rejection episode. However, this hypothesis requires formal investigation.

To manage the rejection, the recipient was treated with two pulses of glucocorticoids, anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody therapy on day 8, and T cell depletion with ATG on days 9 and 10, along with an increased dosage of tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid (Fig. 4a). Due to C3 deposition observed in the biopsy sample5, the C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan was administered from day 12 to day 28.

We performed bulk mRNA analysis using the NanoString nCounter platform to assess molecular immune changes associated with rejection. Transcriptional profiles from the rejection biopsy (day 8) were compared to those from a stable, nonrejection (nonR) time point (day 34) and the contralateral kidney of the donor pig (donor, day 0) (Fig. 4b). Representative hematoxylin and eosin stains of the kidney xenograft biopsies are shown in Fig. 4c. We compared these findings with transcriptomic data from archival human kidney allograft biopsies described in ref. 25, which included 15 samples from living donor biopsies, 84 from stable time points post-transplant, 36 from TCMR and 89 from chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR). Compared to the day 0 biopsy, xenograft rejection was associated with increased expression of both adaptive and innate immune transcripts. Adaptive immunity markers included elevated CD4+ (Fig. 4d) and CD8+ T cell signatures (Fig. 4e). Innate immune responses were characterized by increased natural killer (NK) cells (Fig. 4f), M1 (Fig. 4g) and M2 macrophages (Fig. 4h) and TLR signaling (Fig. 4i). These immune signatures closely resembled those observed in human kidney allograft TCMR and were partially resolved at the subsequent nonR time point (day 34, Fig. 4d–i). In addition, the rejection biopsy also showed transcriptomic evidence of activation of other pathways, including adaptive immunity, IL-12 family signaling, cytokine signaling, innate immune system, type I interferon signaling, MHC class I antigen presentation, cytosolic DNA sensing, NOTCH signaling and programmed cell death. The levels of these pathways were comparable to or higher than those seen in human allograft TCMR samples (Extended Data Fig. 7a–i). Our data demonstrate that xenograft rejection shares key molecular features with human allograft rejection, including adaptive and innate immune activation within the tissue microenvironment.

To complement transcriptomic profiling and provide spatial resolution of the immune infiltration, we performed multiplexed tissue immunofluorescence to characterize the cellular landscape of xenograft rejection. Kidney tissues from day 0 (donor), day 8 (TCMR) and day 34 (stable, nonR) post-transplantation were stained for glomerular and tubular markers (podocin and β-catenin), total leukocytes (CD45), endothelial cells (CD31), T lymphocytes (CD4 and CD8), macrophages (CD68 and CD163) and NK cells (NKG2A). Compared to the day 0 biopsy, rejection was marked by severe interstitial inflammation and mild glomerulitis (Fig. 5a). The immune infiltrate was characterized by increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, M1 (CD68+) and M2 (CD163+) macrophages, and NK cells (Fig. 5a,b). CD4+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages were the most prominently upregulated subsets during rejection (Fig. 5a,b). Notably, while T cells, M1 macrophages and NK cells declined after rejection treatment, M2 macrophages remained persistently elevated in the xenograft microenvironment (Fig. 5b). Human-specific HLA class I staining indicated that the majority of macrophages were of human origin (Extended Data Fig. 8), reflecting heightened innate immune activity. These spatial findings corroborate transcriptomic data, confirming that xenograft rejection is driven by coordinated infiltration of T cells and macrophages, mirroring patterns observed in human allograft rejection. Persistent M2 macrophage presence post-treatment highlights potentially ongoing innate immune activity within the graft.

Gating strategies are detailed in Methods. Quantification was independently repeated twice with similar results.

To determine whether immune events within the graft were reflected systemically, we assessed correlations between tissue immune activation and circulating immune cell dynamics. Since PBMCs were unavailable on the day of rejection (Fig. 1a), we inferred immune cell subsets from bulk RNA-seq data using the CIBERSORT tool (Fig. 6a). Consistent with the tissue findings, we observed increased proportions of CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, CD16+ monocytes and CD14+ monocytes on day 8 compared to pretransplant (Fig. 6b). While CD4+ TEM cells and total monocytes declined following rejection treatment, the subset of CD14+ monocytes remained persistently elevated. This continuous elevation may reflect ongoing innate immune activity associated with tissue repair or subclinical inflammation, underscoring the need for further studies to clarify their role in postrejection graft outcomes.

The dashed line highlights the separation between rejection and nonR clusters.

To investigate broader systemic immune changes, we compared peripheral blood gene and protein expression profiles during rejection (day 7) and at a stable, nonR time point (day 26). This analysis identified 207 differentially expressed genes and proteins, including 181 upregulated and 26 downregulated targets (Fig. 6c). Upregulated signatures were enriched in pathways related to myeloid cell signaling, IL-6 and IL-12 signaling, and effector T cell activation (Fig. 6c). Key upregulated targets included CXCL10, STAT1, STAT3, CD163 and NLRP3 (Fig. 6d). Downregulated pathways were related to glycosylation (Fig. 6c), with reduced expression of B3GAT1, B4GAT1 and ST6GALNAC4 (Fig. 6d). These findings indicate that xenograft rejection is associated with coordinated transcriptional and proteomic changes involving both adaptive and innate immune activation, detectable in the peripheral blood.

In addition to immune cell and transcriptomic profiling, we assessed whether levels of porcine donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), a circulating marker of tissue damage widely used in allotransplantation26, correlated with graft injury in the xenotransplantation setting. We tracked both porcine-derived cfDNA and recipient-derived human cfDNA. At the time of rejection, porcine dd-cfDNA levels increased markedly (~1,000-fold by day 9), indicating xenograft injury (Fig. 6e). A modest, delayed rise (~10-fold) in human cfDNA was also observed, potentially reflecting recipient immune cell turnover associated with rejection and immunosuppressive treatment, including T cell depletion. Following treatment, porcine dd-cfDNA levels declined substantially, consistent with histological resolution of the immune response and restoration of graft stability (Fig. 6e). These findings suggest that species-specific cfDNA may serve as a dynamic noninvasive biomarker for early detection and monitoring of xenograft injury.

Lastly, we investigated whether the blood transcriptional profile observed during xenograft rejection in kidney xenograft recipients resembled those observed in human kidney allograft rejection. Using the publicly available dataset GSE120649 (ref. 27) from human kidney transplant recipients, we compared blood transcriptomics from our xenograft recipient with a previously described transcriptional rejection signature of human allograft rejection28. Distance correlation analysis, which captures nonlinear relationships, revealed that the xenograft rejection sample (day 7) clustered with human kidney allograft rejection profiles, while the nonrejection sample (day 26) aligned with human nonrejection states (Fig. 6f). These results demonstrate significant molecular overlap between xenograft and allograft rejection in both tissue and peripheral blood, suggesting conserved immune pathways that could guide future strategies for immune monitoring and therapeutic intervention in xenotransplantation.

Here we report the high-dimensional immune characterization of a gene-edited pig kidney xenotransplantation in a living human. Using longitudinal transcriptomic, proteomic analyses and spatial analyses, we observed a profound shift in adaptive immunity, while innate immune activation persisted despite immunosuppression. The recipient experienced a TCMR episode within the first week post-transplant, marked by the presence of T cells and macrophages in the tissue, which improved following treatment. This study provides critical insights into xenogeneic immune responses, highlighting the need to optimize immunosuppressive strategies and potentially guide future porcine donor gene editing to improve clinical outcomes in xenotransplantation.

We identified key differences in immune dynamics between our kidney xenograft patient, xenotransplantation in decedent recipients and human allograft rejection, particularly regarding the type and timing of rejection. Potential factors contributing to the observed differences include variability in donor animals, patient selection criteria, immunosuppressive regimens, baseline inflammation and immune alterations associated with brain-dead donors. Our xeno recipient developed TCMR within 1 week of transplant, which is a rare occurrence in human allotransplantation when T cell depletion with thymoglobulin is used. However, a reduced dose of ATG (1.5 mg kg−1 versus standard 4.5 mg kg−1) was administered in our case due to significant lymphopenia and hypersensitivity reaction after the first ATG dose29. TCMR was absent in most reports using decedent models30,31, except for one group that used a low-dose ATG induction therapy (~2.5 mg kg−1) and reported a mixed TCMR and antibody-mediated rejection32. Despite differences in timing, the xenograft biopsy profile resembled human allograft rejection, with prominent T cells and macrophages, and transcriptional upregulation of IFNγ, IL-1 and IL-6 signaling pathways25. The rejection episode was successfully treated with standard immunosuppressants, indicating that xenograft TCMR responds to conventional rejection therapies. However, xenograft rejection also showed distinct peripheral blood features, including heightened innate immune activation involving TLR signaling and type I interferon pathways. These findings suggest that xenograft rejection engages unique immune mechanisms that may require tailored therapeutic interventions, and greater T cell depletion might be needed to prevent TCMR.

In nonhuman primate (NHP) and human decedent xenotransplantation models, circulating B cells were detected post-xenotransplant31 and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) was typically the dominant rejection mechanism rather than TCMR4,30,33. By contrast, our patient showed no histological or serological evidence of AMR, likely due to effective pretransplant B cell depletion and ongoing CD154 costimulation blockade. Our observation of a lack of AMR compared to preclinical primate models may be explained by species-specific differences in humoral immunity and drug efficacy. Human IgM natural antibody binding to 3KO pig cells is significantly lower than that observed in Old World monkeys34, and human transgenes introduced in 3KO pigs may function more effectively in humans than in NHPs. In addition, the greater cross-reactivity of clinical immunosuppressive agents in humans may contribute to improved control of AMR in our clinical setting, despite the use of similar immunosuppressive regimens. However, persistent CD8⁺ T cells in lymph nodes highlight residual cellular immunity. Peripheral blood monitoring failed to detect early rejection, whereas porcine dd-cfDNA levels correlated with graft injury, suggesting species-specific cfDNA as a promising noninvasive biomarker. These findings emphasize the need for improved monitoring tools, such as dd-cfDNA assays and advanced imaging, to detect rejection before clinical dysfunction.

We observed persistent innate immune activation despite effective suppression of the adaptive immune response. This was characterized by a sustained increase in monocyte and macrophage populations, upregulation of TLR/NF-κB signaling and type I interferon responses, and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels following TLR stimulation. This is corroborated by observations in decedent models showing human innate immune cells rapidly infiltrate pig xenografts following transplantation30,31,35. Similar systemic inflammation has also been reported in NHP xenotransplantation models36, and it may have contributed to the early onset of TCMR post-xenotransplantation in our patient. Potential drivers of this innate immune response include xenograft-derived damage-associated molecular patterns, which stimulate monocytes and macrophages, and incomplete immune regulation by current immunosuppressive strategies. Existing therapies primarily target T and B cells while largely neglecting innate immune pathways. Although our xenotransplant recipient developed a fatal cardiac event on day 51, no acute myocardial infarction was found on autopsy5. Rather, chronic myocardial fibrosis, likely related to prior microvascular disease from prolonged dialysis, was identified and may have predisposed the patient to arrhythmia. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the potential contribution of xenograft-associated systemic inflammation to cardiovascular risk.

Notably, M2 macrophages remained elevated in the xenograft microenvironment even after rejection treatment. This is consistent with transcriptional signatures in circulating monocytes indicative of migration and differentiation into peripheral tissues. Persistent macrophage infiltration has been reported in human kidney transplantation, where their presence is associated not only with the resolution of inflammation but also with progression to fibrosis and poorer long-term graft survival, partly through pathways such as transforming growth factor β1 signaling37,38. This dual role highlights the importance of monitoring macrophage polarization in xenotransplantation, as sustained M2 infiltration may signal a risk for chronic graft injury and impaired outcomes. Clinically, these findings highlight that current immunosuppressive regimens targeting adaptive immunity are insufficient to control innate immune activation in xenotransplantation. Future xenograft recipients may benefit from therapies specifically targeting innate immunity, such as IL-1 or IL-6 blockade, to improve graft outcomes.

In addition to pharmacologic strategies, future engineering of porcine donors could focus on reducing innate immune activation by targeting key inflammatory pathways identified in this study. Given the prominent upregulation of IL-1 signaling (also observed by Kawai et al.5), graft-specific expression of human IL-1 receptor antagonist could offer localized suppression of cytokine-driven inflammation. Introducing immunoregulatory molecules such as PD-L1 may further help modulate residual T cell and macrophage activity through checkpoint inhibition. These strategies, combined with existing transgenes that address complement activation, coagulation and macrophage phagocytosis, could provide a comprehensive approach to reducing xenograft-induced innate immune activation. Collectively, such next-generation genetic modifications hold promise for enhancing graft compatibility, reducing reliance on systemic immunosuppression and improving long-term outcomes in clinical xenotransplantation.

This study is limited by its single patient design, necessitating validation in larger xenotransplantation trials to confirm the generalizability of our findings. The short follow-up period also limits our understanding of long-term immune adaptation and graft survival. In addition, the limited number of biopsies restricted the ability to fully monitor tissue-based immune responses. Given the importance of the tissue microenvironment in graft outcomes, future studies should incorporate more frequent and systematic biopsy sampling to comprehensively assess immune dynamics over time.

In summary, this study provides a detailed high-dimensional immune characterization of pig-to-human kidney transplantation into a living recipient. While demonstrating the feasibility of kidney xenotransplantation, our findings reveal that targeting adaptive immunity alone may be insufficient. Achieving durable graft survival and favorable patient outcomes will require refined strategies to modulate innate immune activation, prevent early T cell-mediated rejection, and implement more sensitive and dynamic monitoring approaches. Advancing xenotransplantation as a sustainable solution to organ shortage will require next-generation immunosuppressive regimens and real-time diagnostic tools.

An EGEN-2784 gene-edited pig kidney was transplanted into a 62-year-old male patient with end-stage kidney disease, recently described in ref. 5. A Yucatan miniature pig was genetically engineered with 69 genomic modifications. These included the deletion of three major glycan antigens, the inactivation of porcine endogenous retroviruses and the insertion of seven human transgenes (TNFAIP3, HMOX1, CD47, CD46, CD55, THBD and EPCR). The immunosuppressive protocol included antithymocyte globulin (ATG, 1.5 mg kg−1 on days −2 and −1), rituximab (anti-CD20, 1,000 mg on day −3), Fc-modified anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (tegoprubart, 20 mg kg−1 on days −3, −2, −1, 1, 3, 7 and weekly thereafter) and anti-C5 antibody (ravulizumab, 3,330 mg on days −1, 7 and 28). This regimen was combined with standard maintenance immunosuppression consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid (540 mg twice daily) and glucocorticoids starting on day 0. On post-transplant day 8, a biopsy revealed Banff grade 2A TCMR without signs of thrombotic microangiopathy or antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment included a 500-mg pulse of methylprednisolone and anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab, 8 mg kg−1). Additional 500-mg methylprednisolone pulses were given on days 9 and 10, along with ATG (1.5 mg kg−1). Tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid doses were increased. Due to C3 deposition seen in the biopsy, pegcetacoplan, a targeted C3 and C3b inhibitor, was administered. However, as there was no evidence of antibody-mediated rejection, no further doses of tocilizumab were given.

Peripheral blood was collected for serum and plasma at pretransplantation (day −3), post-xenotransplantation (days 13, 20, 26, 33 and 51) and during suspected rejection (day 7 post-transplantation). Blood was collected in heparinized tubes for PBMCs isolation at pretransplantation (day −3) and post-xenotransplantation (days 13, 20, 26 and 33). Blood was also collected in Paxgene tubes for RNA profiling (days −3 and 7) and post-xenotransplantation (day 26). The sample collection schedule is shown in Fig. 1a. The patient provided written informed consent, as approved by the MGH Human Research Committee (IRB no: 2023P003631).

PBMCs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque solution (GE HealthCare), counted and cryopreserved in heat-inactivated Human AB serum (GeminiBio) with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in liquid nitrogen. The serum was isolated and stored at −80 °C until further analyses.

Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and washed two times with PBS ×1. Cells were then counted using a Countess II Automated Cell Counter and loaded for scRNA-seq using ×10 Genomics Chromium Single Cell 30 Kit (v3.1 Chemistry). We preprocessed the reads with pyroe 0.9.0, Salmon 1.10.3 and alevin 0.10.0 packages with the reference genome GRCh38.p14 v46 from Gencode, and performed the downstream analysis with Seurat 5.1.0.

Longitudinal recipient samples were integrated with 22 external healthy control samples from 3 publicly available PBMC datasets (GEO accessions GSE165080, GSE171555 and GSE192391) using Harmony 1.2.0. The GSE165080 dataset consisted of 6 female samples and 5 male samples with a mean age of 43.1 ± 7.94 years39; the GSE171555 dataset included 3 female and 2 male samples40; and the GSE192391 dataset consisted of 4 female and 2 male samples41. Age information was not available for the GSE171555 and GSE192391 datasets.

Before integration, each dataset underwent independent quality control filtering followed by normalization using the Seurat SCTransform function. Based on an empirical evaluation of the distributions of the number of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) (nCount_RNA), number of detected genes (nFeature_RNA), log-transformed gene-to-UMI ratio (log10GenesPerUMI) and mitochondrial gene expression ratio (mitoRatio), the following filters were applied: GSE165080: nCount_RNA ≥ 1,800; nFeature_RNA ≥ 900 and <2,500; log10GenesPerUMI ≥ 0.84 and mitoRatio < 22%. GSE192391: nCount_RNA ≥ 1,800; nFeature_RNA ≥ 1,000 and <2,500; log10GenesPerUMI ≥ 0.84 and mitoRatio < 10%. GSE171555: nCount_RNA ≥ 1,800; nFeature_RNA ≥ 900 and <2,500; log10GenesPerUMI ≥ 0.84 and mitoRatio < 8%. Recipient samples: nCount_RNA ≥ 350; nFeature_RNA ≥ 300 and <2,500; log10GenesPerUMI ≥ 0.84 and mitoRatio < 10%. An additional gene filtering step was applied to each dataset, retaining only genes expressed (that is, nonzero counts) in at least 10 cells.

After integration, marker genes for each cluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function following PrepSCTFindMarkers. Clusters were manually annotated into cell types based on the expression of the marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 3). A first round of annotation was performed at clustering resolutions of 0.2 and 0.4, resulting in 13 annotated cell types: CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, erythrocytes, B cells, CD16+ monocytes, megakaryocytes/platelets, naive-like CD8+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conventional dendritic cells, two subsets of CD14+ monocytes and two subsets of NK cells. A second round of annotation was performed after sub-clustering aggregated monocyte and T cell subsets, followed by marker gene identification. This round annotated a third subset of CD14+ monocytes, naive-like CD4+ T cells, CD8+ MAIT cells and Treg cells. Single cells expressing canonical marker genes of at least two major cell types were assumed to be doublets and excluded from the Seurat object.

Gene sets of interest across time were identified empirically by calculating the average log2 fold change at each time point relative to the pretransplant baseline. This analysis was performed separately for CD14+ monocyte subsets, CD16+ monocytes and NK cell subsets. Genes were then ranked based on the absolute average log2 fold change to prioritize those with the most pronounced temporal shifts in expression.

Venous blood collected at different time points and stored in PAXgene tubes at −80 °C were used for bulk RNA-seq. To process the bulk RNA-seq, we used FastQC 0.12.0 with standard parameters to evaluate the quality of the reads. We trimmed the adapters with Fastp 1.0.1 and quantified the abundance of transcripts with Salmon 1.10.3. We used the human reference transcriptome and the annotation named GRCh38.p14 v.46 from Gencode as the transcriptome reference. We used tximport 1.32.0 to import the abundance files and DESeq2 was used to harmonize samples. The same process was used for the public dataset (GSE120649 (ref. 27)). We used SRA tool 2.10.7 to download the public fastq files.

To perform proteomics analysis from serum samples, 11,000 markers were measured using SomaScan analysis (SomaLogic). This analysis was performed at the BIDMC Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Center using the SomaScan Assay Kit for human serum, covering ~11,000 proteins. The expression counts were standardized using the median of hybridization controls. The outliers were flagged based on the limit of variation of 0.4–2.5 of the ratios.

Untargeted metabolite analysis was performed using a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer equipped with a HESI II probe and coupled to a Vanquish binary ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample underwent two chromatographic separations. For both methods, 5 µl of the sample was injected into a BEH Z-HILIC column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters). The first separation was conducted at pH 9, using 15 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Merck) in 90% water and 10% acetonitrile as mobile phase A, then 95% acetonitrile and 5% water as mobile phase B. The gradient was applied at a flow rate of 0.225 ml per min, following a method adapted from42, and the mass spectrometer operated in negative mode. The second separation followed the method of Mülleder et al.43, with mobile phases A and B buffered with 10 mM ammonium formate and 45 mM formic acid (pH 2.7). Mobile phase A consisted of a 1:1 acetonitrile to water mixture, while mobile phase B contained 95:5:5 acetonitrile to water to methanol. Chromatography was conducted at 40 °C (column oven) and 4 °C (autosampler), with a gradient flow rate of 0.4 ml per min as follows: an initial hold at 95% B for 0.75 min, a linear decrease to 30% B from 0.75 to 3.00 min, followed by a 1.00 min isocratic hold at 30% B. Mobile phase B was then returned to 95% over 0.50 min, with re-equilibration under initial conditions. Mass spectrometry was performed in positive mode. Data acquisition was carried out in full-scan mode, with the spray voltage set to 3 kV (negative mode) or 3.5 kV (positive mode). The capillary temperature was maintained at 320 °C, the HESI probe at 300 °C, the sheath gas at 40 U, the auxiliary gas at 8 U and the sweep gas at 1 U. The resolving power was set to 120,000. An untargeted metabolite library was generated using top-15 DDA acquisitions on a pooled study sample, with MS1 and MS2 resolutions of 60,000 and 30,000, respectively.

Raw data files (.raw) were processed using MZmine 4.544 and emzed45. Metabolite MS2 spectra were compared against HMDB, GNPS, MassBank and MoNA databases using spectral library matching (ref to DDA_library). In addition, retention times and m/z values from full-scan acquisitions of a pooled study sample were cross-referenced with an in-house database containing retention times of authenticated standards (Human Endogenous Metabolite Compound Library Plus L2501, TargetMol). Internal standards were integrated via emzed, and raw peak areas were normalized by dividing by sample biomass and the mean internal standard area.

On the day of the transplant, an iliac lymph node was harvested during the surgery for cell isolation. A lymph node from a patient who did not receive ATG was used as a control. The tissues were minced and digested with 500 U ml−1 collagenase D (Roche) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 0.1 M EDTA in PBS, pH 7.2, buffer for 5 min before a final suspension in 5 mM EDTA (Gibco), 1% FBS (Gibco) in × 1 PBS, pH 7.2 (Boston BioProducts). Isolated cells were then mechanically dissociated through a 70-μm cell strainer (Corning) in a 50-ml tube, and red blood cells were lysed using hypotonic ACK buffer (Gibco). Cells were then counted and cryopreserved in heat-inactivated human AB serum (GeminiBio) with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in liquid nitrogen.

Monitoring of immune cells over time was performed using 100 μl of whole blood. Cells were stained with surface antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with 1× BD FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at room temperature for lysing red blood cells. We also stained cells isolated from human lymph nodes. Cells were thawed, washed twice and Fc-blocked (TruStain FcX, combination of anti-human CD16 (clone 3G8), CD32 (clone FUN-2) and CD64 (clone 10.1) antibodies, BioLegend, cat. no.: 422302) for 20 min before staining for surface markers for 30 min in FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS × 1) on ice. The information about the antibodies used is shown in Supplementary Table 1. Stained cells were analyzed on an LSR Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) for all experiments. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) in all experiments. Viable cells were selected based on the staining with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, cat. no.: L23105) before Fc-blocking. Gating strategies for PBMC analysis were as previously described and can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2.

Recipient's PBMCs from different time points were thawed and washed twice with RPMI 1640 (Gibco) containing 10% FBS (GeminiBio) and ×1 pen/strep (Gibco) (complete RPMI), and then resuspended in complete RPMI. In a 96-well round-bottomed tissue culture plate at a volume of 100 μl, 4 × 105 cells per well were seeded. Cells were stimulated with 100 μl of either complete RPMI (controls) or a mixture of bacterial and viral TLR ligands (0.025 μg ml−1 LPS, 10 μg ml−1 Pam3CSK4, 4 μg ml−1 R848, 25 μg ml−1 poly I:C—all from Invivogen). PBMCs from each sample were stimulated in duplicates. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, supernatants were obtained for Luminex analysis using the premixed ProcartaPlex Human Immune Monitoring Panel 65-plex (Thermo Fisher), including APRIL, BAFF, CXCL13, CD30, CD40L, CXCL5, CCL11, CCL24, CCL26, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), CX3CL1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CXCL1, hepatocyte growth factor, IFNα, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-2, IL-20, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-27, IL-2R, IL-3, IL-31, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, CXCL10, CXCL11, LIF, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, lymphotoxin-alpha, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, MDC, MIF, CXCL9, CCL3, CCL4, CCL20, MMP-1, nerve growth factor beta (NGF-β), SCF, SDF-1α, TNF, TNF-RII, TRAIL, TSLP, TWEAK and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). We read the assay in a Luminex200 machine, and data with a bead count <20 were excluded. Samples from the time points from one individual were measured on the same plate to mitigate the effect of potential plate-based technical variation on calculated fold changes between time points.

Bulk mRNA analysis was performed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded xenograft biopsies and a sample from the nontransplanted contralateral donor kidney, using the nCounter instrument (Nanostring) combined with the Banff Human Organ Transplant panel, following the methods and data analysis previously documented for human allograft biopsies25. The probe sequences were screened for homology with pig and NHP transcripts by a specialist at the manufacturer company (NanoString). We used probes from the panel that had >85% homology with porcine sequences for parenchymal cells or endothelium (n = 235 probes) and all probes for human leukocytes, similar to those used previously in pig-to-human xenografts5,30. Normalization was performed using seven housekeeping probes with >90% homology with the corresponding porcine transcripts. Pathways were manually curated from prior publications25,46,47,48 and KEGG Pathways (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html), Gene Ontology (geneontology.org) and Reactome (reactome.org) repositories. Cell types from tissue bulk were assessed with marker genes49.

Biopsy tissue was processed using standard kidney biopsy methods for light microscopy. hematoxylin and eosin samples were scored using the current Banff criteria50,51.

Frozen slides from the donor collateral kidney biopsy and xenografts at days 8 and 34 were processed for multiplex imaging on the Orion platform (RareCyte), following Lin et al.52. An Orion multiplex antibody panel was used to profile immune cell subsets (Supplementary Table 2). In brief, slides were thawed at room temperature and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min. They were washed in Tris‑buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X‑100 in Tris‑buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature, washed once in Tris‑buffered saline and once in PBS, and treated with 4.5% H2O2/24 mM NaOH in PBS (hydrogen peroxide solution) to reduce autofluorescence. After a surfactant wash and enhancer treatment, slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with ArgoFluor‑conjugated antibodies and Hoechst 33342. The next day, slides were washed extensively in PBS, mounted in ArgoFluor mounting medium (RareCyte 42‑1214‑000), and imaged on an Orion microscope. Fluorophores were then quenched with hydrogen peroxide solution, and a second round of overnight 4 °C staining was performed with a different set of ArgoFluor‑conjugated antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) plus Hoechst 33342, followed by mounting and imaging.

Image stitching, segmentation and single‑cell quantification were carried out using the MCMICRO pipeline53. A Gaussian mixture model implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks)54 excluded cells exhibiting excessive autofluorescence. Gating strategies were defined as follows: CD4 T cells: HLA‑ABC+, CD45+ and CD4+; CD8 T cells: HLA‑ABC+, CD45+ and CD8+; M1 macrophages: HLA‑ABC+, CD68+ and CD163−; M2 macrophages: HLA‑ABC+ and CD163+; NK cells: HLA‑ABC+, CD45+ and NKG2A+. The HLA‑ABC marker recognizes human MHC I, thereby excluding from counts the few residual donor pig kidney-resident M2 macrophages with which the CD163 antibody cross‑reacts (Extended Data Fig. 7).

After pig donor blood collection, PBMCs were isolated using Lympholyte-Mammal Cell Separation Media (Cedarlane) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Using a V-bottom 96-well-plate, serum was serially diluted in PBS ×1 as follows: 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64 and 1:128. Serum from a healthy human control and a Baboon previously transplanted with a pig kidney were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, along with different time points of the recipient serum. To avoid nonspecific binding sites, pig PBMCs (5 × 105 cells per well) were blocked with 10% heat-inactivated goat serum (R&D Systems, cat. no.: S13110H) for 20 mins at 4 °C. After two washes, pig PBMCs were incubated with serially diluted serum for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times in cold PBS × 1. Next, pig PBMCs were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-human IgG Fc-APC (clone M1310G05, BioLegend). After two washes, cells were resuspended in a staining buffer (PBS, 1% of bovine serum albumin, 0.09% sodium azide). Stained cells were analyzed on an LSR Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) for all experiments. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) in all experiments.

Karius retrieved porcine and human cfDNA using a protocol similar to that described by Blauwkamp et al.55. Briefly, plasma samples were initially processed by centrifugation to remove residual cells, after which cfDNA was extracted using a modified Mag-Bind cfDNA kit in automated liquid handling platforms. Sequencing libraries were prepared with dual-indexed Ovation Ultralow System kits and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq sequencers. The resulting reads underwent stringent bioinformatics processing, including alignment against human, porcine and microbial reference databases to distinguish human and porcine cfDNA fragments accurately. The concentration of each species' cfDNA was quantitatively estimated by normalizing against synthetic internal control molecules (WINC molecules), ensuring precise measurement of cfDNA abundance in plasma samples

We normalized all the data series to z-score with scikit-learn 1.6.156. To analyze the data in time, we used scikit-fda 0.9.157. With this package, we excluded outliers using the MS-Plot Outlier Detector method. We then used Fuzzy C-Means with l2-distance to cluster. We defined the optimal number of three clusters, calculating the silhouette score with scikit-learn 1.6.1. To plot the time series, we calculated the median with NumPy 2.2.0 and plotted the line and the violins with Matplotlib 3.8.0.

For the three clusters defined by functional data analysis, we used the z-score normalized proteomics data to calculate the nearest neighbors with scikit-fda 0.9.1, calculated the Louvain communities with NetworkX 3.4.258 based on the connectivity of the nearest neighbor's graph, followed by an enrichment analysis for each community with GSEApy 1.1.759. After annotating the clusters based on GSEApy results, we trained a k-neighbors classifier with scikit-fda 0.9.1 on proteomics Louvain labels. We predicted the Louvain communities for z-score normalized metabolomics data. To plot networks, we used Netgraph 4.13.1 to annotate the nodes. We used the package adjustText 1.3.0 (https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText).

After preprocessing the whole-blood bulk transcriptomic data, we normalized the expression counts with DESeq2. Next, we used the R package IOBR 0.99.860 to estimate the population abundance on whole blood using the LM22 and LM6 matrices without tumor optimization.

We calculated the log2 fold change between days 7 and 26 (log2[D7/D26]) for both transcriptomics and proteomics. Since we have only one sample, we selected the most relevant fold change by the first quartile of negative fold changes and the third quartile of positive fold changes to define downregulated and upregulated molecules, respectively. We found the intersection using Python native functions and performed an enrichment analysis with GSEApy 1.1.759. To plot the Venn diagram, we used the venn 0.1.3 package.

A chord diagram was constructed using the circlize package 0.4.1661 in R 4.4.2 to illustrate relationships between differentially expressed genes and proteins. Sectors representing upregulated and downregulated genes and proteins were color coded, and interconnections were drawn based on shared elements between sets. Edge transparency and arrow annotations were applied to improve interpretability.

To maintain consistency, we reprocessed the public dataset GSE120649 (ref. 27) from whole-blood human kidney transplant recipients using the same pipeline used for the xenotransplant samples. We used a previously described transcriptional profile of human allograft rejection28 to compare allo and xenotransplantation gene expression. To detect nonlinear correlation, we clustered the samples using the complete linkage method on the distance correlation metric with SciPy 1.11.462. We used seaborn 0.13.263 to plot the cluster heatmap.

Three distinct analyte clusters were identified based on their temporal dynamics: one characterized by a progressive decline over time, which included 3433 features (a), another by a posttransplantation increase with 2599 features (b), and a third that exhibited no consistent temporal pattern, including 2792 features (c). The lines connect the median of features for each day for the three functional data analysis (FDA) clusters to highlight the different directions of each cluster. The clusters were defined by the semi-supervised clustering, which is based on FuzzyCMeans with pairwise L2 distance. The silhouette score optimized the number of clusters. More details about algorithms are in the methods section of the paper.

Donor porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated with serial dilutions (1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128) of recipient serum collected at pre-transplant and days 7, 12, 21, and 26 posttransplant. Controls samples included serum from a healthy human individual and serum from a baboon previously transplanted with a porcine kidney (sensitized). Fluorescently labeled anti-human IgG antibody was used to quantify donor-specific antibody (DSA) levels by flow cytometry. The graph represents total IgG binding to porcine donor PBMCs, measured by geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI). Data expressed as mean ± SD. Experiments were performed in triplicate.

Gene expression profiles were analyzed in CD14⁺ and CD16⁺ monocyte subsets using the pre-transplant time point as baseline. Genes were ranked by the absolute average log2 fold-change across all time points to prioritize those with the most pronounced temporal shifts. Three major gene expression patterns were identified: gene set 1 (red) comprised genes upregulated after transplantation; gene set 2 (green) included genes that were downregulated; and gene set 3 (purple) contained genes predominantly expressed by CD16⁺ monocytes. Related to Fig. 2a–c.

Mpox virus particles (purple) seem to be spreading more easily between people.Credit: NIAID/SPL

As mpox continues to spark localized outbreaks in Africa and, on occasion, in other parts of the world, researchers are racing to understand how the virus managed to spread globally in 2022 — and how it might do so again.

A study published in December found that the strain that caused the 2022 outbreak persisted in the testes of mice for weeks after infection and caused tissue damage1, highlighting the possibility that the virus could impact male fertility. This has not yet been studied in people.

The study was posted on the preprint server bioRxiv and has not yet been peer reviewed. Meanwhile, the virus continues to evolve. In December, health officials reported a strain of the mpox virus that combines genetic elements of two existing types, or clades, for the first time. Although it is normal for viruses such as mpox to evolve, the more opportunities they are given to spread, the more likely they are to eventually evade protection from vaccines and treatments.

Taken together, these data show that scientists “still have a lot to learn” about existing strains, let alone new strains, says Boghuma Titanji, an infectious-disease physician at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Mpox belongs to the poxvirus family, which also includes smallpox, “so we should not underestimate what it can do if it's allowed to become firmly entrenched in human populations and continue to adapt”, she adds.

Mpox infections can cause painful, fluid-filled lesions on the skin, fever and, in severe cases, death. There are four known clades of the mpox virus: clades Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb (see ‘Quick guide to the clades of mpox virus').

The virus has been infecting humans since the 1970s. Historically, it rarely spread widely, but this all changed in the late-2010s, when a clade II strain caused a large outbreak in Nigeria. A similar clade IIb strain sparked the 2022 global outbreak, in which more than 100,000 people were infected. It is still ongoing.

Clade Ia: this clade has been spreading in Central Africa since the virus was first discovered to infect humans in 1970. Most infections have been in children, and, until the past few years, transmission occurred mainly from animals to humans.

Clade Ib: this clade has caused a surge of cases in Central Africa since its discovery in late 2023. It is known to spread from person to person, through means including sexual contact.

Clade IIa: the least-studied mpox clade. It has spread mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire. Modes of transmission are not fully understood; there is no documented evidence of sexual transmission, but it is likely that all forms of close contact contribute to its spread.

Clade IIb: the clade responsible for the still-simmering 2022 global outbreak. It is known to spread from person to person, through means including sexual contact. The most-affected population has been men who have sex with men.

In 2025, there was a large increase in infections with clade I mpox, which historically caused sporadic but deadly outbreaks in rural parts of Central Africa. A new subtype of clade I, called Ib, began spreading between people in dense urban areas in late 2023, possibly through sexual contact. This spread has worried scientists because the sudden emergence of clade Ib mpox mirrors the trajectory of clade II before it went global, Titanji says.

Mpox is spreading rapidly. Here are the questions researchers are racing to answer

Over the past couple of years, researchers have been racing to understand how the new mpox clades, Ib and IIb, differ from their predecessors. Data from rodents infected with mpox offer evidence to support a theory that these clades are less lethal but more adept at spreading from one person to another because they cause milder illness2.

Rats infected with clade Ib mpox had higher survival rates than those infected with clade Ia, yet they transmitted just as much infectious virus. And the onset of visible skin lesions was significantly delayed in clade Ib infections, the researchers found.

These findings help to explain why the virus “might be quite efficient in spreading through sex”, as people could be unknowingly transmitting the virus before they are symptomatic, Titanji says.

Another group of scientists studied how clade IIb mpox infects mice1. They found high levels of infectious virus in the rodents' testes for at least three weeks after infection, suggesting that the male reproductive tract might act as a reservoir for the virus, and helping to explain why the virus is so efficiently transmitted through sexual contact.

The infection caused tissue damage that led to the loss of sperm production, the researchers found.

“We were expecting to see some inflammation or disorganization, but to see that potentially this infection was affecting male fertility was shocking,” says study co-author Alyson Kelvin, an emerging-virus specialist at the University of Calgary in Canada.

Snowflake plans to acquire Observe, an observability platform that has been built on Snowflake's databases from day one. (Observability platforms help companies monitor their software systems and data for performance issues and bugs.)

The cloud data company announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Observe, subject to regulatory approval, on January 8. Snowflake will integrate Observe's product into its own to give customers a unified place to collect and store their telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces from software systems) and better spot potential bugs and issues in their data and software.

Observe was founded in 2017 by Jacob Leverich, Jonathan Trevor, and Ang Li and launched its first observability product built on a centralized Snowflake database in 2018. The company was incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures and has since raised nearly $500 million in venture capital from firms including Snowflake Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, and Madrona, among others.

Notably, both Snowflake and Observe were incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures, with Sutter Hill managing director Mike Speiser serving as Snowflake's founding CEO from 2012 to 2014.

Jeremy Burton, the current CEO of Observe, has served on Snowflake's board of directors since 2015.

Integrating Observe into Snowflake allows users to proactively monitor their data stack and spot and fix issues 10x faster than before, according to a Snowflake blog post — a task that has become harder to scale due to the sheer volume of data generated by AI agents.

The acquisition also creates a unified framework for telemetry data, which is automatically collected, built on Apache Iceberg and OpenTelemetry architectures.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. According to reports, the deal is valued at around $1 billion, which would make it Snowflake's largest acquisition to date, surpassing its $800 million purchase in March 2022 of Streamlit, an open source framework that allows developers and data scientists to quickly build and share data applications without needing expertise in front-end development.

Observe was most recently valued at $848 million as of July 2025, according to PitchBook data. TechCrunch has reached out to Snowflake for more information on the deal.

Last year saw a wave of consolidation in the data industry as data companies looked to build out their product offerings to make themselves more attractive one-stop-shop partners in the age of AI.

This deal could be a sign that data company consolidation will continue in 2026. Snowflake has been particularly active, completing and announcing several AI-related acquisitions in 2025, including Crunchy Data and Datavolo, and Select Star, a data governance and metadata management platform that helps organizations understand and trace their data at scale.

Small touch targets is true, but with how expansive UIs have gotten since Windows Mobile it's FAR less of an issue and I've used it just fine in the past (external touch display). The most difficult target is usually the window close button, but the consequences for missing that are nearly zero, and practically everything else is more than large and space-buffered enough if you don't close your eyes before reaching for the screen. And that's before liquid glass redesigns.

iPad and Macbook should've already converged at this point.I say that even as a very happy user of a Macbook with the fancy non-reflective screen coating that wouldn't be a thing on a touchscreen.I expect the new cheap Macbook that's rumoured will be a hybrid.Nicer windows laptops have had this for a long time and it works great, other than the janky OS and app support. Just being able to lazily scroll content is worth it some of the time, and there are no downsides. Just like having built-in 5G networking, it's a bizarre blindspot for Apple.My old-ass Chromebook Pixel (retired due to Chrome no longer having worthwhile adblocking) had a perfect form factor for hybrid tablet/laptop use, though not the software - Beautiful 180 degree hinge, 4:3 aspect ratio.

No thanks. Unless you mean the iPad should also be running a general purpose operating system fully under the device owner's control...

reply

Not even a hint of a price region as well. Can't imagine anyone really asking for this. Just get an iPad.Edit: Correction on the no price thing, it's relatively cheap for Kickstarter.

You just naturally get used to using it for reading documents/email/slack when you are using the laptop portable.It's specially good when you are on a couch/shit surface where you would normally use the touch pad awkwardly, it's also great when you are ""one hand"" holding the laptop and then scrolling/showing someone something. I found it also great in the small ass meeting rooms for zoom calls.I wish the MacBook had it.

It's one of those situations where the more seamless they make the experience, the quicker the user will end up totalling either the laptop screen / hinges or the touchscreen. Given the position of the connector and how people generally close laptops, it's the perfect lever to crack something.

> The biography, due out on Tuesday, alleges Musk ordered Starlink engineers to turn off service in the area of the attack because of his concern that Vladimir Putin would respond with nuclear weapons to a Ukrainian attack on Russian-occupied Crimea. He is reported to have said that Ukraine was “going too far” in threatening to inflict a “strategic defeat” on the Kremlin.The amendment on the article:> This article was amended on 14 September 2023 to add an update to the subheading. As the Guardian reported on 12 September 2023, following the publication of this article, Walter Isaacson retracted the claim in his biography of Elon Musk that the SpaceX CEO had secretly told engineers to switch off Starlink coverage of the Crimean coast.So maybe Starlink did turn it off or maybe it was just jammed in some way or maybe, well... anything really. All this says is the source retracts the claim and The Guardian doesn't clarify beyond that.

> On Friday, Isaacson tweeted a clarification, writing that “the Ukrainians THOUGHT coverage was enabled all the way to Crimea, but it was not. They asked Musk to enable it for their drone sub attack on the Russian fleet. Musk did not enable it, because he thought, probably correctly, that would cause a major war.”> On Saturday, Isaacson said that based on conversations with Musk, he “mistakenly” believed that the policy preventing Starlink from being used for an attack on Crimea had been decided on the night of the attempted Ukrainian attack. He added that Musk “now says that the policy had been implemented earlier, but the Ukrainians did not know it, and that night he simply reaffirmed the policy”.

The above is for jamming directed beams in general. It is likely that starlink has a number of other jamming countermeasures.

they can censor IPv4 when they want, but they don't know how to censor IPv6. So they block it entirely.This is the reason why they aren't blacking out IPv4From my own experience, my ex gf was iranian. She was using discord via some psiphon vpn or something iirc idk how she got access to it but she had it.I didn't trust psiphon that much so I asked her to install proton vpn and it did work. I wanted to play minecraft with her so prismlauncher but resources couldn't be downloaded so I made her download protonvpn so that she can play minecraft with me/install it (piracy was forced and also at that point necessary)She was using tlauncher which somehow worked but tlauncher was russian spyware and prism launcher was open sourceI talked to her about how she could use stablecoins crypto but crypto was illegal so ended up not suggesting it in the end to prevent inflation or talked to her about gold which is wild considering its like 3-4 months after we broke up but inflation is at 50% now.Anyways the point being that protonvpn worked and other vpn worked too.My question is, would things like protonvpn work after this blackout? I mean marco's and other comments in a thread explain to me that ipv4 can be blocked by them so I presume vpn's for ipv4 would shut down. And so vpns would most likely be using ipv6 which got blocked downSo does that mean that now Iranian people can't access vpns?I also saw the other day some video about how when people called Iranian numbers from outside countries some random AI  robot ass voice called and asked who are you and who are you talking to? And gave pause, and the most logical explaination to it was that the govt was recording these things so dont say anything to them. It was a creepypasta video.Briar might help but Briar still leaks some metadata when I talked to their authors or heard about it online.Instagram isn't blocked in Iran so are these social media apps still there after the blackout?This raises so many questions and wtf is happening in the world

I asked my guide what he thought was going on.

One characteristic of v4 is it's somewhat reasonable to do a straight forward block on a range of addresses to shut down access.  This is still somewhat possible with v6, but harder as there's simply a much larger portion of ip addresses that can be all over the place.  It's theoretically a lot easier for anyone that wants to bypass a simple filter to grab a new public IP address.

reply

But, it is a new skill, and you can turn off v6 at small cost if you're already ok with heavily restricting v4.

reply

You'd typically block an AS - i.e. every IP originating from AS12345. That's just as easy on v6 as v4.

A lot of anti censorship organizations have trouble getting more IPv4 /24 for cost reasons or moving it around to different AS since they would go offline.With IPv6, you can get IPv6 /40 from ARIN/RIPE no problem. You slice that up into /48 and just start bouncing it all over the place. When one /48 goes down, you move everything to another /48, switch providers if required and continue.EDIT: They also tend to get multiple blocks as well for when ISP figures out to root /40.

reply

No it isn't. Nobody is blocking ranges as they roll in, they're blocking whole ASNs at once. That's just as trivial with v6 as v4, actually v6 can be simpler because ISPs tend to have fewer large blocks in v6land.

Looking at IPv6 its not 0 exactly, looks like probably censorship, only some devices allowed online? Some other comment mentioned there's calls to protest again today.

New satellite images of what was once the largest iceberg in the world show warning signs of its imminent demise, revealing extensive pools of aquamarine blue water melting on its surface.

NASA's Earth-observing Terra satellite captured an image of what remains of iceberg A-23A in Antarctica, which suggests it may have sprung a leak and is only days away from completely disintegrating.

The iceberg is breaking apart while drifting in the South Atlantic between the eastern tip of South America and South Georgia Island.

Iceberg A-23A has had a long and arduous journey. It first broke off from Antarctica's Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986. Afterwards, the iceberg remained lodged on the seafloor of the southern Weddell Sea for decades before breaking free in the early 2020s and drifting northward.

In March 2024, it was caught in a rotating ocean vortex in the Drake Passage before spinning out and becoming lodged again on the shallow coastal shelf south of South Georgia Island. The iceberg freed itself once more before coming to its final rest stop north of the island.

When it was first detached, the iceberg was around the size of Rhode Island, measuring roughly 1,500 square miles (4,000 square kilometers). Today, the iceberg is around 456 square miles in size (1,182 square kilometers), still larger than New York City.

Scientists have been tracking the iceberg's journey for years using satellite imagery, allowing them to document its disintegration over time. Today, scientists estimate that the iceberg won't be around for much longer, giving it days to weeks before its complete disintegration.

“I certainly don't expect A-23A to last through the austral summer,” Chris Shuman, a retired scientist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, said in a NASA statement. “A-23A faces the same fate as other Antarctic bergs, but its path has been remarkably long and eventful.”

Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite, scientists observed the remains of the waterlogged iceberg. The image shows pools of meltwater on its surface, turning the iceberg a haunting blue color.

An astronaut on board the International Space Station (ISS) has also captured a closer image of the iceberg, revealing streaks of blue and white that likely accumulated when the ice was part of a glacier dragging across Antarctic bedrock. “The striations formed parallel to the direction of flow, which ultimately created subtle ridges and valleys on the top of the iceberg that now direct the flow of meltwater,” Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow & Ice Data Center, said in the statement.

“It's impressive that these striations still show up after so much time has passed, massive amounts of snow have fallen, and a great deal of melting has occurred from below,” Shuman said.

The MODIS image also reveals that the iceberg may have sprung a leak. The weight of the water pooling at the top of the iceberg would have created enough pressure at the edges to push through, resulting in a white area on the left side of the image.

A-23A is currently on thin ice, floating in water that's around 37 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) and heading toward even warmer temperatures. “It's hard to believe it won't be with us much longer,” Shuman said.

As rates of obesity continue to rise, clinicians are increasingly tasked with recognizing how different obesity measures, sex-specific anatomical patterns, and weight-related risk trajectories can influence sleep apnea screening, diagnosis, and management.

Although obesity can be a risk factor for central sleep apnea development, it is most strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Data indicate that obesity is more of an established risk factor for OSA than for central and mixed subtypes. Moreover, patients with central sleep apnea are considered to be ""relatively less obese.""

Learn more about OSA.

Along with obesity, sex can play a role in OSA development. Data indicate that neck circumference is more strongly correlated with OSA severity than BMI. Furthermore, data reviewed by the International Consensus Statement on Obstructive Sleep Apnea demonstrate that neck circumference was predictive of OSA in males, whereas waist-to-hip ratio was a significant predictor of OSA in both sexes.

Learn more about physical examinations in OSA.

Although females have higher rates of obesity and severe obesity (compared with males), researchers have found they have comparatively lower rates of OSA than males. This might be due in part to sex differences in the anatomical correlates of OSA development and severity.

Learn more about the epidemiology of OSA and obesity.

While obesity is the most frequent finding, other anatomical signs associated with OSA include a crowded oropharynx, tonsillar hypertrophy, macroglossia (large tongue), retrognathia, micrognathia, a low-lying palate, and dental overjet. However, only lateral pharyngeal wall narrowing has been shown to be an independent predictor of OSA after adjusting for body weight and neck circumference.

Learn more about anatomical considerations in obesity and OSA.

The same International Consensus Statement on Obstructive Sleep Apnea contains recommendations regarding surgical procedures for patients with OSA and obesity, including bariatric surgery. Given the increased perioperative risk for surgical complications associated with the condition, they recommend patients be preoperatively screened for OSA; however, no specification is provided regarding severity of the risk. Further, data reviewed by the experts concluded that bariatric surgery is associated with improvements in apnea-hypopnea index scores; this included patients who underwent bariatric surgery and those who underwent bariatric surgery and continued utilizing other obesity management methods (eg, lifestyle modifications). However, they noted that OSA ""often persists following bariatric surgery.""

Twenty years on since the approval of the first human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, a raft of studies involving millions of people have reached the same conclusion: HPV vaccination is safe and dramatically lowers women's risk for cervical cancer.

Those are the topline findings of two updated Cochrane reviews on the impact of HPV vaccination — one looking at population levels of cervical and other HPV-related cancers, and the other a network meta-analysis of clinical trial data.

The population studies, involving over 132 million people in all, show that the benefits of vaccination for cervical cancer prevention are unequivocal, according to senior author Jo Morrison, BM, of the University of Exeter in Exeter, England.

“The evidence of safety and efficacy of HPV vaccination is not, and should not be, controversial,” Morrison told Medscape Medical News.

Based on data covering 4.5 million person-years, vaccination by age 16 is associated with an 80% reduction in the risk for cervical cancer (relative risk [RR], 0.20; 95% CI, 0.09-0.44).

Meanwhile, long-term studies of girls vaccinated at ages 12–13 show “even more dramatic” effects, Morrison said — with no cervical cancers detected in those cohorts.

Currently, groups such as the American Cancer Society and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine HPV vaccination for all children starting between the ages of 9 and 12. Guidance from the CDC is similar.

The Cochrane update supports such early vaccination. Overall, studies found that cervical cancer protection was less when the HPV vaccine was given after the age of 16.

“It is important to vaccinate before [first] exposure to HPV infection,” Morrison said.

As for safety, the Cochrane team specifically looked for population data supporting any potential link between HPV vaccination and a list of adverse events commonly cited as risks on social media — including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, infertility, and paralysis. They found no such evidence.

Nor was there any evidence that HPV vaccination encouraged earlier sexual activity, another concern often raised on social media.

“It's great to now have a large body of evidence that shows that HPV vaccines do not cause long-term harms,” Morrison said. She contrasted that against the “very real” harms of cervical cancer, which causes roughly 350,000 deaths per year worldwide.

An HPV expert who was not involved in the reviews called the data “compelling.”

“This is one of the most efficacious vaccines ever invented,” Linda Eckert, MD, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington in Seattle, told Medscape Medical News.

She agreed that early adolescence is the best time for the HPV shot but also stressed that the benefits are not lost among older teens and young adults or simply because a young person is already sexually active.

“I don't want doctors to stop [giving the vaccine] at 16,” Eckert said. Even young people who've had “two or three” sexual partners, she noted, have not been exposed to all of the HPV strains that vaccination protects against.

The population data Morrison's team reviewed come from 225 studies conducted worldwide. Most (177) reported on women only, while 11 focused only on men, and 37 involved both sexes.

The companion meta-analysis focused on 60 randomized controlled trials involving over 157,000 participants, as well as various HPV vaccines and different vaccination schedules. Pharmaceutical companies funded 44 of the studies.

Most trials had a follow-up of 12 months, though the range was up to 11 years. In contrast to the population studies, the trials could not provide sufficient data on cancer outcomes.

But in trials with relatively longer follow-up, HPV vaccination did prevent many high-grade precancers of the cervix. Among 15- to 25-year-olds, there was a 60% reduction in grade 2 or worse cervical intraepithelial neoplasia from vaccine-matched HPV types over 6 years (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.54).

In addition, vaccination reduced rates of rare vulvar and vaginal precancers among 15- to 25-year-olds — from three cases per 1000 among control individuals to one per 1000 following Gardasil vaccination (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.45) and 0 per 1000 with Gardasil-9. (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.51).

There was also evidence, from three trials of over 21,000 participants, that vaccination cut the incidence of anogenital warts for up to 4 years of follow-up.

Those short-term endpoints, Morrison said, help in drawing conclusions about the likely long-term efficacy of HPV vaccination “without waiting a generation for the clinically relevant outcomes to develop.”

Eckert agreed. She noted that other than cervical cancer, HPV-linked cancers — including head and neck, penile, and anal cancers — typically develop in older adults.

Proof of the vaccines' ability to prevent those cancers could take another decade or two to emerge, Eckert said, but there's no reason to believe outcomes will be much different than what's been seen with cervical cancer.

In terms of discussing the HPV vaccine with parents and young people, Eckert had advice to clinicians: Keep the focus on future cancer prevention, not sex.

“We made a mistake when we rolled out this vaccine,” she said. “We should have called it the anti-cancer vaccine, not the HPV vaccine.”

Morrison is a senior editor for Cochrane but was not involved in the editorial process for this review. Eckert had no relevant financial disclosures.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi, everyone. Dr Chandrasekaran here. Today we're going to talk about the cold weather impact on COPD. These patients are prone to more COPD exacerbations, especially during the cold.

The cold weather can directly trigger bronchoconstriction within the airways that can lead to an exacerbation. The cold air also stimulates mucus production, and this can cause mucus plugging or airway clogging that, again, can lead to increased wheezing or a COPD exacerbation.

It's important to remember to tell your patients to stay indoors, keep warm by wearing multiple layers, and to use a humidifier with air mist within the house to keep the air more moist.

When going out, it's important to remember to bring your inhaler and use albuterol or your rescue inhaler prior to leaving your house, especially if it is snowing or the air happens to be very cold.

A new study of over 32,000 US Veterans has found that the longer people stay on medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine, methadone, or extended-release naltrexone), the greater the probability of short- and medium-term survival. This benefit continues to increase at least for four years of ongoing treatment, considerably longer than most patients currently stay in treatment.

People with opioid use disorder run the risk of dying from accidental overdose but opioid use disorder also increases the risk of death from other health conditions, most notably infectious disease. People who receive buprenorphine and other medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) have fewer drug cravings, improved social functioning, and better quality of life than those who do not, and those improvements decrease their risk of mortality.

It's unusual for patients to stay on MOUD for four years, or even for one year. Most standards of care specify 6 months as the minimum target for treatment duration, and more than 25% of patients say they want even shorter durations. This study shows that to get the greatest benefit from MOUD, the recommended treatment duration should be years longer. Encouraging patients to continue treatment for at least four years will significantly increase their chances of survival.

This study, published in the scientific journal Addiction, measured relative predicted survival probability as the ratio of the predicted probability of surviving to 6 years if a patient were treated for 1 year instead of 6 months, 2 years instead of 6 months, and so on. Longer time on therapy increased expected relative survival, with larger gains in longer time horizons. Higher-risk patients saw greater benefits over shorter time horizons than lower-risk patients.

For example (see figure), a 50-year-old male with no other health risk factors who remained in MOUD treatment for two years had a 4 % higher survival probability than a 50-year-old male who stopped treatment at six months. In contrast, a 30-year-old female with no other health risk factors was not projected to achieve a 4 % greater survival probability until around 5 years of MOUD duration. Additionally, for the lowest risk patients, the improvements in relative survival for each additional year of therapy started to diminish as duration increased, with no statistically discernible difference beyond 4 years.

The study included 19,666 buprenorphine users, 8,675 methadone users, and 4,007 extended-release naltrexone users. After four years of receiving MOUD, additional time in treatment may not continue to increase the relative predicted probability of survival.

This year's flu season is turning out to be brutal. As a new variant known as subclade K spreads rapidly, a study out today offers clues as to how to avoid the annual sickness. 

Researchers from University of Maryland Schools of Public Health and Engineering in College Park and the School of Medicine in Baltimore wanted to find out how the flu spreads, so they put college students already sick with the flu into a hotel room with healthy middle-aged adult volunteers. The result? No one caught the flu. 

""At this time of year, it seems like everyone is catching the flu virus. And yet our study showed no transmission – what does this say about how flu spreads and how to stop outbreaks?"" said Dr. Donald Milton, professor at SPH's Department of Global, Environmental and Occupational Health and a global infectious disease aerobiology expert who was among the first to identify how to stop the spread of COVID-19.

The study, out today in PLOS Pathogens, is the first clinical trial in a controlled environment to investigate exactly how the flu spreads through the air between naturally infected people (rather than people deliberately infected in a lab) and uninfected people. Milton and his colleague Dr. Jianyu Lai have some ideas about why none of the healthy volunteers contracted the flu. 

""Our data suggests key things that increase the likelihood of flu transmission – coughing is a major one,"" said Dr. Jianyu Lai, post-doctoral research scientist, who led data analysis and report writing for the team. 

The students with the flu had a lot of virus in their noses, says Lai, but they did not cough much at all, so only small amounts of virus got expelled into the air. 

""The other important factor is ventilation and air movement. The air in our study room was continually mixed rapidly by a heater and dehumidifier and so the small amounts of virus in the air were diluted,"" Lai said. 

Lai adds that middle-aged adults are usually less susceptible to influenza than younger adults, another likely factor in the lack of any flu cases. 

Most researchers think airborne transmission is a major factor in the spread of this common disease. But Milton notes that updating international infection-control guidelines requires evidence from randomized clinical trials such as this one. The team's ongoing research aims to show the extent of flu transmission by airborne inhalation and exactly how that airborne transmission happens. 

The lack of transmission in this study offers important clues to how we can protect ourselves from the flu this year. 

""Being up close, face-to-face with other people indoors where the air isn't moving much seems to be the most risky thing – and it's something we all tend to do a lot. Our results suggest that portable air purifiers that stir up the air as well as clean it could be a big help. But if you are really close and someone is coughing, the best way to stay safe is to wear a mask, especially the N95,"" said Milton. 

The team used a quarantined floor of a Baltimore-area hotel to measure airborne transmission between five people with confirmed influenza virus with symptoms and a group of 11 healthy volunteers across two cohorts in 2023 and 2024. A similar quarantine set-up was used in an earlier study and exhaled breath testing was used in several pioneering studies by Milton and colleagues on influenza transmission. 

During the most recent flu study, participants lived for two weeks on an isolated floor of the hotel, and did daily activities simulating different ways that people gather and interact – including conversational ice-breakers, physical activities like yoga, stretching or dancing. Infected people handled objects such as a pen, tablet computer and a microphone, before passing the objects among the whole group. 

Researchers measured a wide range of parameters throughout the experiment, including participant symptom monitoring, daily nasal swabs and saliva samples and blood collection to test for antibodies. The study measured the viral exposure in volunteers' breathing area as well as the ambient air of the activity room. Participant exhaled breath was also measured daily in the Gesundheit II machine, invented by Milton and colleagues at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 

Finding ways to control flu outbreaks is a public health priority, says Milton. Flu is responsible for a considerable burden of disease in the United States and globally – up to 1 billion people across the planet catch seasonal influenza every year and this season has seen at least 7.5 million flu cases so far in the United States alone, including 81,000 hospitalizations and over 3,000 deaths. 

Researchers at UMD's interdisciplinary Public Health Aerobiology Lab – Kristen Coleman, Yi Esparza, Filbert Hong, Isabel Sierra Maldonado, Kathleen McPhaul and S.H. Sheldon Tai – contributed to this study, as well as colleagues from UMD Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, the University of Hong Kong and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

The home kit has a chance to be an icon

How a soccer team takes the field doesn't just involve formations and tactics, the way a team is presented is also important. From the black and white of Juventus to Argentina's light blue and white stripes or the orange adorning the Netherlands, a team's kit is the mold a side's identity is forged into. A jersey comes with expectations and even gives a team an edge before stepping on the field.

For fans of US Soccer this is something that has been missing over the years. At times, there have been jerseys that seemed to reflect the nation and team almost perfectly. The striped and denim kits from 1994 or Waldos are instantly recognizable and iconic. This style has come and gone, striped shirts and jerseys with stars have been worn by US Soccer teams but just as many kits with blobs or splatter or alternative color choices have come along also.

It seems pretty obvious that the United States should wear a jersey with stars and stripes on it. This year, Nike has delivered a design that does that. The home kit totally nails what an identity for the team should be reflected in on the field.

Red and white stripes with blue shorts fits the bill. That said, the second kit might leave room for improvement. It's navy, very navy, with lighter navy star shadows floating in the design also. The decision not to make the stars more visible and perhaps toning down the navy is a drawback from the overall concept.

For now these are just leaks, but Footy Headlines usually gets these things right. The home kit is one that will look unmistakably American on the field with the away jersey needing a closer look. That said, the way the team will look at the World Cup when it comes to on-field fashion has the makings of turning just another kit into a uniform that joins other icons in the sport. Of course, the next step will be the team playing as good as they look when the tournament rolls around this summer.

Atlético de Madrid and Real Madrid arrive at the Spanish Super Cup, played for the sixth time in Saudi Arabia, surrounded by uncertainty. Simeone's side come off a draw against Real Sociedad, while Xabi Alonso's Real Madrid arrive after surrendering a four-point lead at the top of LaLiga.









Will Mbappé play against Atlético de Madrid?





Kylian Mbappé did not travel with the squad to Saudi Arabia due to a sprain in his left knee. However, he has not been completely ruled out of returning if Real Madrid reach the final against Barcelona.

Xabi Alonso already faced heavy scrutiny at the end of September, when Real Madrid were thrashed 5–2 by Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano. It marked his second major defeat in a high-profile match as Real Madrid head coach.

That result followed another alarming precedent: a 4–0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer Club World Cup.

It was almost grimly predictable. When news broke that the United States military had attacked Venezuela on Saturday, there wasn't even a flicker of activity among the Fifa Council, according to senior sources.

This is despite the primary host of their grand global event launching what is a rare act of aggression for a country staging the World Cup, with the president even talking in a concerning manner about a co-host.  In the aftermath of the Venezuela attacks, Donald Trump spoke about how his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum, is “very frightened of the cartels” and that “something is going to have to be done with Mexico”.","{'href': 'https://www.independent.ie', 'title': 'The Irish Independent'}","soccer"

	When it comes to popular music, Sweden punches in a different weight class. Think ABBA. Think Roxette, Ace of Base, the late Avicii and Swedish House Mafia. The great songwriter and producer Max Martin is a Swede. Heck, Spotify emerged from Sweden, as did the rogue searchable content index that changed the game, The Pirate Bay.

	With the announcement of it Wednesday, Jan. 8, Robyn shared the project's second and third singles, the shimmering dance-pop anthem “Talk To Me,” and “Sexistential,” which a press release explains is “possibly the world's first rap about having one-night stands while 10 weeks pregnant after IVF.”

EXCLUSIVE: Hannah Hafey & Kaitlin Smith have come aboard to write the live-action theatrical Monster High movie for Mattel Studios, Universal Pictures, and Akiva Goldsman's Weed Road.


	It's the first big development on the project since the M3GAN films' Gerard Johnstone boarded to direct in June 2025. First announced one year prior, the film will be produced by Robbie Brenner, President and Chief Content Officer of Mattel Studios, as well as Goldsman. Darian Greenbaum is overseeing for Mattel, alongside Greg Lessans for Weed Road, with Universal Pictures' Senior Vice President of Production Lexi Barta and Director of Production Development Jacqueline Garell overseeing for the studio.

	











	Plot details for the feature take on Monster High remain under wraps. First introduced via a line of dolls in 2010, the franchise centers around a fictional high school attended by the teenage children of famous monsters, such as Draculaura (daughter of Dracula), Frankie Stein (daughter of Frankenstein's monster), Clawdeen Wolf (daughter of the Werewolf) and Cleo de Nile (daughter of the Mummy). Inclusive, in encouraging fans to embrace their authentic selves and what makes them unique, the franchise has expanded over the years via an animated web series, TV specials, movies, and books.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Hafey & Smith are rising voices in film and television whose work has been recognized on the annual Black List three times, most recently with their new spec script Entertaining on this year's list. Their feature script Rachel Nevada is in development at Paramount, with Ryan Reynolds' Maximum Effort on board to produce. The duo also penned St. Mary's Catholic School Presents The Vagina Monologues for Amazon Studios, with Tanya Wexler directing and Di Novi Pictures producing.

	











	On the television side, the scribes sold Misfit City to HBO Max, with Boom! Studios producing. They are represented by Gersh and Jack Greenbaum at The Arlook Group.


	For the moment, Mattel Studios has dated just one live-action film on the heels of Barbie: Masters of the Universe, which Amazon MGM releases in North America on June 5. Also expected to release this year is Apple, Skydance and Mattel's Matchbox movie starring John Cena.

	On Thursday morning, A24 debuted the first trailer for Undertone, the horror film from first-time feature filmmaker Ian Tuason that they snapped up for worldwide release following its Fantasia Film Festival premiere, as we first reported last August.


Undertone stars Nina Kiri as Evy, a paranormal podcast host who returns home to care for her dying mother. Thereafter, she begins receiving recordings from a married couple plagued by strange noises in their house, pulling her into a spiral of fear and paranoia.


	In her description of the film for Fantasia Fest, programming director Carolyn Mauricette wrote, “Fans of SKINAMARINK and I AM THE PRETTY THING WHO LIVES IN THE HOUSE will love this slow-burn nightmare that will make hackles on your neck rise and your blood chill.”

	











	The trailer has Babic and her co-host introduce viewers to the Undertone podcast, where they're preparing to sift through 10 enigmatic audio recordings sent on an anonymous email. They believe that there are hidden messages to be found in the audio by playing it back in reverse, and only realize in retrospect that they've “unleased something.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“You shouldn't have called out to her,” Babic is later told by an unseen character. “It's what she wants.”


	There were six buyers in the mix for Undertone, sources told us, with A24 closing a deal for the film at mid-7 figures. Pic was produced by Dan Slater for Slaterverse Pictures and Cody Calahan for Black Fawn Films. Exec producers include Steven Schneider and Roy Lee for Spooky Pictures, Chad Archibald for Black Fawn Films, Brit MacRae and Daril Fannin for Kino Studios, DimensionGate, and Will Rowbotham and Luke Maxwell for 3 Arts Entertainment.

Don't count on seeing Jenny McCarthy back on “The View.”

The “Masked Singer” host, 53, appeared on this week's episode of “The Katie Miller” podcast, where she discussed her brief stint as a host on the talk show in 2013 and 2014.

When asked if she would return for a spot at the show's desk “given where they are politically today,” she said, “The reason why they wanted to bring me on is because they, quote, said it was too polarizing. They thought it was too polarizing back then, you guys!”

She explained that her initial role in the cast was to give “light, fluffy, and fun” commentary on “Dancing with the Stars” and “The Bachelor,” but that “only lasted a whole week.”

“And back then, I didn't consider myself to be a political person, which is why I thought I was perfect for the job. After a week, when they said they wanted to get political, I was like, ‘Oh my God, what am I going to do?'” McCarthy noted. 

She had previously claimed producers of the show told her to “act Republican,” though she does lean towards more conservative views.

The former Playboy model pointed out in her conversation with host Katie Miller that she is “much more political” now because “our latest administration has helped so much.” 

“But, back then? Ooh, I would not, I would never even,” she said. “They've asked me to come back for, like, reunion shows. I was like, over my dead body would I ever step foot in that place.”

McCarthy was part of the permanent hosts of “The View” during Season 17, which also included Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg and Sherri Shepherd.

The “Dirty Love” actress recalled leaving the show in a conversation with Andy Cohen in July 2025.

“They let all of us go,” she recalled on SiriusXM's “Radio Andy,” adding that she was begging to be fired.

“What wound up happening was they came into the offices and Sherri came crying into my dressing room saying, ‘I was just let go.'”

McCarthy remembered thinking she didn't “even want to f–king be here” and wondered why it was Shepherd over her. However, as the day continued, several producers were also let go.

“Then I get the phone call. I was like last to get the phone call from my agent. He's like, ‘You're next.' I'm like, ‘Thank God.' It was a massacre,” McCarthy said. “They got rid of a bunch of people.”

After Rhett Miller helped wrap up 2025, A.V. Undercover season 10 is now ringing in the new year with roots rockers The Wood Brothers. Chris and Oliver Wood, along with Jano Rix and his melodica, dropped by Ella's Lounge above Brooklyn Paramount, ready with a blues-like twist on one of the biggest indie songs of the 2000s: Yeah Yeah Yeahs' “Maps.” 



The band previously joined us for season three of A.V. Undercover, back in the days of the fabled small, round room. “Maps” was much more familiar territory for the band's bassist, who was previously inspired by the Fever To Tell track, which has proven more enduring than the debut album from which it sprang, as part of a different folk outfit, Medeski Martin & Wood. Brother Oliver and Rix were at more of a loss, and as a trio they wondered “How the hell are the Wood Brothers gonna do this song?” While not initially “obvious,” reimagining the yearning love song became a “fun challenge,” as lead singer Oliver crooned Karen O.'s lyrics over a rumba beat. As for their approach to covers in general, Oliver says “We never try to copy them, because we can't beat what they already did. And that's already just an iconic song, so best to do it as differently as possible for us, and see what we can do with it.” With their take on “Maps,” The Wood Brothers want “trance [their] own way.” 

The trio are heading back on the road for a new tour beginning January 29, and you can learn more about dates here.

Mike Wolfe is set to make his return to reality TV with a new show on the HISTORY Channel!

The HISTORY Channel is expanding its unscripted lineup with a brand-new series spotlighting America's most fascinating treasures, according to a press release.

“History's Greatest Picks with Mike Wolfe” will premiere Sunday, February 22 at 9 p.m. ET, bringing viewers inside the stories, values and cultural impact behind some of the rarest and most iconic collectibles in history.

Hosted and executive produced by “American Pickers” star Mike Wolfe, the eight-episode, one-hour series is produced by Cineflix and builds on Wolfe's longtime passion for uncovering hidden gems and preserving the past.

While “American Pickers” focuses on the thrill of the hunt, “History's Greatest Picks” zooms out to explore legendary finds that have already made history — and the journeys that turned them into cultural touchstones.

“I've been on the road filming ‘American Pickers' for over a decade, tracking down hidden gems in the most unexpected places and connecting with fascinating people who are preserving history,” Wolfe said in a statement. “I'm looking forward to embarking on a new adventure, while continuing my lifelong passion of picking with this series. Viewers are in for a ride through the greatest finds of all time.”

Each episode will showcase an array of extraordinary artifacts, ranging from vintage cars and motorcycles to pop-culture memorabilia and rare historical oddities.

Wolfe guides viewers through how these pieces were discovered, how their value has evolved over the last 50 years, and why they continue to captivate collectors and historians alike. Expert insights and rich storytelling help contextualize each item, transforming objects into living pieces of American history.

The series is also part of the HISTORY Channel's ambitious HISTORY Honors 250 initiative, a multi-year, multiplatform campaign leading up to the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States in July 2026.

Through original programming, digital content, live events and partnerships, HISTORY Honors 250 aims to spotlight the innovations, achievements and unsung heroes that have shaped the nation since the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

With its blend of nostalgia, discovery and deep-dive storytelling, “History's Greatest Picks” promises to offer history lovers and collectors alike a fresh look at the legendary items that continue to define America's past — one unforgettable find at a time.

Prior to the announcement, Wolfe shared behind the scenes images to his social media account, as he was recording voice overs.

“VO in the studio for the new show I'm doing for @history that will air Feb 22nd,” Wolfe wrote. “It's of course called ‘History Greatest Picks'… It's nothing I've picked, it will be stories from other pickers and the artifacts they have found…. AND how they've changed hands over the past 50 years. Anything from Babe Ruth's jersey to the Mustang from the movie ‘Bullet.'”

The first official U.S. trailer for “Sirāt” feels like a warning shot, less interested in teasing its unexpected survival plot than in dropping prospective viewers into its fierce landscape of pulsing bass, scorched earth, and emotional freefall. 

Directed by Oliver Laxe (“Fire Will Come,” “You All Are Captains”), the 2025 Cannes standout follows a father and son as they plunge into the rave scene of southern Morocco to search for their missing daughter and sister, only to find an underworld more perilous than they could have expected.

 










Luis (Sergi López) and his son Esteban (Bruno Núñez Arjona) arrive deep in the mountains, clutching a photo of Mar. She disappeared months earlier at one of these sleepless parties, and now her family has no choice but to canvas strangers in a place that feels more lawless than loving or communal. When a tip takes them further into the desert, the pair press on — even as the terrain turns forbiddingly hostile.

That premise only hints at what Laxe delivers. As critic David Katz wrote for IndieWire in his “A-” review, “Sirāt” is a “sui generis” work that resists classification while still nailing visceral, sometimes crowd-pleasing thrills. Born in France but a staple of Moroccan cinema, Laxe has a talent for scaling international borders and belief systems to peer into worlds that feel dangerously tactile and spiritually slippery. The trailer leans hard into tension, juxtaposing profound familial grief with the rhythm of indifference inherent to drugged-up dance culture and an unstable geopolitical backdrop.

 










Critically acclaimed, “Sirāt” is shortlisted in five categories at the 98th Academy Awards, including Best International Feature (Spain), Best Cinematography, Best Music (Original Score), and Best Sound. It won Best Music Score from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and earned nominations from the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards, European Film Awards, and the Gotham Awards. “Sirāt”promises a journey that treats emotional and physical obstacles as equal narrative forces, daring audiences to cross a transcendent bridge between despair and euphoria, without knowing what's on the other side.

Watch the trailer for “Sirāt,” in select theaters on February 6 after a qualifying run last year, below.

      Time: 06/01/2026 midday Location: Zermatt
    


      Wtf did I see, this thing zipped down past our Gondola and just stopped over the skiers. Weirdly no one underneath it realised it was there, even the skiers moving directly towards it from the side didn't seem to notice it either. It was totally silent. It's impossible to describe how it moved but the closest I can say is that it was pulling everything towards it rather than moving itself. The ball at the center of it seemed to be not physically attached to the edges like a planet but you cant really tell in this image. The strangest part was that it had this iridescent petrol like texture but fluidly moving more like a fire, which didn't show up in the photo at all. About 1 second after I took the picture it zipped back up again and it was completely gone from sight. It was absolutely the most bizzare and awe inspiring thing i've ever witnessed. It it also looks comically like a pop culture UFO in the picture, but in the flesh it was like something from scifi film.
    


      The question of the most convincing UFO sighting ever recorded is complex and often depends on individual belief and the nature of the evidence. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples:
    


      Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail.
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting."" - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee.
    


      Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling.
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



Corroboration: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



Triangular Craft Sighting: [""I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","CIBC's chief market technician thinks a correction is nearing","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-cibcs-chief-market-technician-thinks-a-correction-is-nearing-but-it/","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:49:05 GMT","

Although North American equity markets are hovering near record levels, technical indicators suggest a potential market correction may occur in the first half of 2026, according to CIBC's chief market technician Sid Mokhtari. 

Mr. Mokhtari believes equity markets could decline between nine and 13 per cent sometime in the first six months of the year. However, he argues that such a drawdown would represent a buying opportunity by easing overbought technical conditions and creating a reset environment for a secular bull market that remains intact.

Last year, he forecast the S&P/TSX Composite Index and the S&P 500 would both post low double-digit returns in 2025. His market outlooks were directionally correct but too conservative given the strong and sustained market momentum.

Mr. Mokhtari's portfolio of stock selections delivered spectacular returns in 2025. Each month, he publishes a report with his top 10 stock ideas and his disciplined process outperformed the broader index for a fourth consecutive year. In 2025, his portfolio of stock selections rallied 51.3 per cent, compared to a 28.3 per cent price return for the S&P/TSX Composite Index. His stock selections also outperformed the TSX Index in 2024, 2023 and 2022 by 5.8 percentage points, 6.3 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points, respectively.

Earlier this month, we published his top picks for January. His diversified basket of stock selections includes 10 new stocks across six sectors. In the materials sector, he added three stocks to his basket of top picks – CCL Industries (CCL-B-T), Ivanhoe Mines (IVN-T) and Nutrien (NTR-T). His consumer discretionary stock selections include Dollarama (DOL-T) and Gildan Activewear (GIL-T). In financials, Fairfax Financial Holdings (FFH-T) and Great-West Lifeco (GWO-T) were selected. In consumer staples, Premium Brands Holdings (PBH-T) was included in his basket of top picks. Telecom provider Quebecor (QBR-B-T) was added along with an industrial stock, TFI International (TFII-T). 

On Jan. 6, The Globe and Mail spoke with Mr. Mokhtari and discussed his January stock picks, investment opportunities and his outlook for equity markets.

This month, you have a diversified basket of top picks, 10 stocks across six sectors. Could you highlight a few of them? 

Historically, this month has mixed returns. We have seen equity markets up 5 per cent or down 5 per cent in January. So, it is very clear to us that we need to be more balanced. We have a good mix of value, dividend yield and cyclical beta within our basket of top picks.

We think it will be a cyclically tilted year. We titled our year ahead piece “2026 - More Cyclical Tailwinds” because we're seeing a lot of positive cyclical rotation within base metals, industrials, copper, packaging, agriculture and fertilizers. 

And that's why we added Ivanhoe Mines (IVN-T), a copper name within our improving quad. In agriculture, we have Nutrien (NTR-T), which is also in our improving quad. In packaging, we have CCL Industries. Combined, that's 30 per cent materials exposure. 

We also added Quebecor. It is ranking well in our quant and technical matrix, scoring high across quality, value and low-volatility factors. It's currently the top telecom member in our trend-following process. From a seasonal perspective, January has historically been a strong month for the TSX telecom sector providing additional support for Quebecor despite it appearing somewhat overbought. 

So, I think there's a good mix in our basket of top picks. 

Can you run through your technical targets for each of these stocks? 

Ivanhoe can measure up toward $18.90 to as high as $19 on this leg of the breakout. In time, we think we should be able to retrace the entire move back up and potentially make new highs. 

For Nutrien, this is a slow but modular rising uptrending condition. We have a technical target that is closer to $92.50 to as high as $95, in Canadian dollar terms. 

CCL Industries regularly comes into our basket. This time, it came in because of its alpha that is being produced on a monthly basis. We have a technical measured move for CCL closer to $95. The stock has broken out in both absolute and relative terms. It doesn't show any divergences so we do assume the durability of alpha is reasonable. Our fundamental desk that covers this company also likes it.

Quebecor is an extended name but the reason we brought the name into our basket is because of its defensive posturing. The technical upside for Quebecor is estimated around $55.60 with downside support at $49.

Historically, the technology sector has been a top performer in the S&P/TSX Composite Index as well as the S&P 500 in January. And according to your recent report, the NASDAQ100 has rallied 2 per cent or more, on average, over the past 10 and 30 years. Are you seeing evidence supporting technology leadership in early 2026?

Historically, seasonal influences or positive hit rates (a hit rate is a measure of frequency of observations) tend to decline post January. 

We're very mindful that the group is becoming very bifurcated, which may require a lot more attention than before. We should be very selective about our choices when it comes to the tech space. 

Let's talk about industry ETFs. I noticed the rankings of several bank and financial ETFs moved materially higher. The BMO Equal Weight Banks Index (ZEB-T) is ranked near the top of the list, along with Invesco KWB Bank ETF (KBWB-Q) and iShares Global Financials ETF (IXG-A). Will banks and financials continue to rank well going forward? 

We do not see any significant negative divergences that might indicate a shift in the current upward trend cycle. The positive ranking of capital markets and financials in our matrix processes is encouraging from both a value factor and longer-term cyclical rotation perspective. Despite appearing overbought from a mean-reversion standpoint, our factors still support dip-buying strategies.

We've also seen positive rotation within our U.S. small-cap models, favouring financials. The State Street SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE-A), which holds U.S. regional banks, is a great example. We've been vocal about our positive outlook for this sector. The relative strength of U.S. regional banks is emerging positively, supported by M&A [merger and acquisition] sentiment, cheaper valuations, potential rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and a steeper yield curve. We wouldn't be surprised to see regional banks outperforming their larger cap peers. We note that banks and financials relative strength in the U.S. has broken out of a decade-long range pattern, suggesting a favourable leadership rotation. If our views are correct that the market internals and cross sector rotations are beginning to shift towards cyclicals, then financials could take the leadership over and begin outpacing technology.

Additionally, the industrials GICS sector appears to be resuming its uptrend forces. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE-A) may be the right vehicle for investors seeking exposure to this space. 

You have been recommending PAVE for a while but another thematic ETF that has advanced in your rankings is U.S. Global JETS ETF (JETS-A). 

Good observation. 

It's not just airlines, it's also transports, in general. We see participation from truckers. One of the reasons we added TFI International (TFII-T) to our basket was because we're seeing a big rotation favouring transports and industrials. 

With TFI, it's alpha has now improved into our improving quad, and we're seeing positive money flow within the sector, in general. We're measuring closer to $190 on the upside. It may take a while. But it's rebuilding its base, it's recovered above its longer-term averages, and it's part of the cyclical narrative that we have for transports and industrials. And a lot of its comps are also showing better price action. I would not be surprised to see it close the gap that opened up prior to Liberation Day. 

Back to JETS, this is year three of a breakout that we're seeing within the U.S. airlines index for many good reasons. I think again that's another signature of a cyclical rotation. But, I would also say that jet fuel prices are sharply lower and that has buoyed this sector. 

We maintain our technical view that oil and its corresponding indicator charts are likely to remain weak and stagnant at a lower high for longer. This should help keep the price of jet fuel tame and support the airlines index uptrend forces.

Speaking about airlines, what are your thoughts on Air Canada (AC-T)? 

Air Canada's chart looks very good. It has been in a wave of a consolidation for almost the past two years. The stock has broken out of its upper range that should be able to trace a better move closer to $23, if not higher. I think dips are likely to be bought. 

In your report published at the beginning of January with your top picks, the very first sentence said, “Internals are supportive for January.” Can you expand on that and tell readers where equity markets may be headed? 

We have been talking more about a market that is beginning to show a broadening of its breadth. We have seen more participation within small caps and mid-caps in the U.S., and that's very positive because they have lagged for quite some time and we are starting to see better group participation. We're seeing financials, including regional banks, health care, consumer stocks, industrials within small and mid-caps participating. 

Breadth in Canada has been in better shape relative to the U.S. for quite some time. Canada's breadth has been much better because of our exposure to financials. Banks have been very strong. And secondly, I would say that materials and industrials have been very strong here in Canada. 

We think the U.S. may be able to put on a better performance as we go into the second half of the year.

Expand on your remark that the U.S. market may outperform in the second half of this year. 

Our view is that there are two colliding cycles that are meeting one another. One is year two in the U.S. presidential cycle has historically had a very poor hit rate. So out of the four years of the U.S. presidential cycle, year two is the weakest year, and it also has a very challenging return profile in the first half of the year. Second, it is year four of the bull cycle, assuming 2022 marked the trough, and that also has a backdrop that typically is stronger in the second half. I think these two cycles are colliding with one another in 2026 that should bring about some disruptive price action for the market. Our view is that the first half of the year will be a lot more disruptive than the second half. 

History may not repeat itself, but it is likely to rhyme. 

I think the January effect that we're experiencing this month, where historically broadening often occurs, cyclical rotation often takes place, small and mid-caps tend to do well, but we've got to be mindful that in the next few months, I'm not sure what may cause it, but at least by cycle work that we do, we believe that disruptive price action may take hold in first half of the year. 

What do you mean by disruptive action? Can you quantify it?

Volatility should rise, which we think will be another buying opportunity.

The peak-to-trough drawdown risk for Canada and U.S. can be anywhere between nine to 13 per cent. It may not happen. But, we're closer to the top end of our measured move for this leg that we're seeing, and in order to bring down some of these overbought mean reversion factors that we have in our models, in order to bring them to a trough point, we can experience a nine to 13 per cent peak-to-trough decline for equity markets.

For the U.S., we see initial downside risk to be at 6,530, that's a 5 per cent decline with much stronger support being marked at 6,290, 6,300 - that's a 9 per cent decline. That's my measured move downside risk for the U.S. Anything beyond that is a buying opportunity because we still believe we are in a secular bull market. 

For Canada, we're looking at initial downside risk being closer to 30,000, call it roughly 5 to 7 per cent downside risk. Bigger downside support is marked at about 27,500 - that's 13 per cent downside risk.

Any commodities that you want to highlight for 2026?

I believe the direction of the Fed will be key for gold in 2026. Geopolitical risks, inflation concerns, and sustained central bank demand are likely to support gold's long-term uptrend, despite overbought conditions and seasonal mean-reversion risks post-January. 

Copper and other base metals are looking particularly strong as well. The CRB Spot Raw Industrials Index has broken out, which is effectively a compilation of many industrials base metals commodities and signaling a new upcycle for industrial base metals. This supports the recent re-emerging narrative of a cyclical rotation, benefiting base metals and related mining sectors.

An ETF that is ranking very highly in our work is Global X Copper Miners ETF (COPX-A). That ETF has broken out of a 10-year elongated base relative to the S&P 500. 

And there's a Canadian ETF, BMO Equal Weight Global Base Metals Hedged to CAD Index ETF (ZMT-T). 

Can you give readers your technical targets for those ETFs?

Like I said, COPX broke out of a 10-year base. It does measure closer to $88. It does look extended by the measure of mean reversion oscillators, but we think dips within this space should be viewed positively. COPX is not as parabolic as silver or gold, and it's still in a very early phase of its relative strength emerging condition. 

ZMT, we measure this to be closer to $130. It is not as extended as COPX. It has a very notable emerging relative strength condition that is just beginning to accelerate. Here too, any setback should provide a buying opportunity. 

Lastly, any interesting observations you want to highlight to readers? 

I do want to make sure that we're fully aware that we are in a year of colliding cycles, and that is likely to bring about disruptive price action and volatility. 

While we should remain mindful of potential disruptions and volatility for risk assets in 2026, such movements may ultimately prove to be a cyclical rotation favouring financials, industrials, commodities, and select consumer sectors and help sustain, what we believe to be, a well-defined longer-term secular bull market.

This is a guest opinion column

For generations, community banks have been the backbone of towns like Sylacauga, Talladega, and communities across East Alabama. As a former president of a community bank, I have watched local banks help first-time homebuyers get their keys, entrepreneurs turn ideas into storefronts, and farmers' weather seasons when nature or markets did not cooperate. When community banks thrive, so do the places they serve.

That is why I am concerned about unintended consequences in a new federal law known as the GENIUS Act. While the legislation aims to bring clarity and oversight into the rapidly evolving world of digital payments, it leaves behind a critical gap — one that could quietly undermine community banks and the local economies that depend on them.

The GENIUS Act establishes rules for companies that issue stablecoins, a form of digital currency designed to maintain a consistent value. Importantly, the law prohibits those issuers from paying interest directly to consumers. That safeguard makes sense. But the law stops short of clearly preventing crypto platforms — the exchanges and apps that manage these assets — from offering so-called “rewards” or incentives to entice customers to move their money out of traditional banks and into digital accounts.

This distinction matters. By offering rewards that function much like interest, crypto platforms gain a competitive edge over community banks that play by long-established rules. Consumers may be drawn to higher returns without realizing the tradeoffs. Unlike deposits at a local bank, funds held on many digital platforms are not insured by the FDIC. If one of these companies fails, customers could lose everything.

When deposits leave community banks, the consequences ripple outward. Those deposits are the fuel banks use to lend — to finance homes, equipment, farms, and small business growth. One recent estimate suggests that a shift of deposits into digital platforms could reduce nationwide farm lending by as much as $62 billion. For a state like Alabama, where agriculture and small businesses remain central to our economy, that kind of loss would be deeply felt.

Community banks do not operate from algorithms or distant offices. They know their customers personally — the family running the hardware store, the restaurant owner on the square, the young couple saving for their first home. Once deposits drain away from these institutions, they are difficult to replace and rebuilding that lending capacity can take years.

Congress still has time to get this right. I encourage Senator Katie Britt and her colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee to close this loophole and ensure that small towns and rural communities are not sidelined in the effort to regulate digital assets. This Genius Act will cripple smaller community banks that serve our neighborhoods. Our congressional leaders should reconsider this unintended loophole to establish a stronger competitive environment. 

Here in East Alabama, our local banks have always shown up for their communities. We should make sure federal policy does the same — by keeping the playing field fair and allowing community banks to continue doing what they do best: supporting local people, local businesses, and local futures.

[Editor's Note: Agents of Transformation is an independent GeekWire series and 2026 event, underwritten by Accenture, exploring the people, companies, and ideas behind the rise of AI agents.]

Microsoft is making its own bid to turn AI conversations into agentic commerce, announcing a new feature called Copilot Checkout that lets users complete purchases directly within its AI chatbot, without being redirected to an external website.

The company is betting that its existing enterprise technology footprint and established relationships with large retailers will give it an edge over OpenAI, Google, and Amazon in winning over merchants wary of giving up control to retail rivals or AI intermediaries.

“We've designed it in such a way that retailers own those relationships with the customers,” said Kathleen Mitford, corporate vice president of global industry marketing at Microsoft. “It is their data, it is their relationship, and that's something that's really important to us.”

It's part of a broader AI rollout by Microsoft at NRF 2026, the retail industry's annual conference in New York. Microsoft is also launching Brand Agents, pitched as a complete solution for Shopify merchants to add AI assistants to their websites, along with new AI tools to assist store employees and help retailers enhance their online product listings and metadata.

Copilot Checkout works by surfacing products from partner retailers within Copilot search results. Purchases can be completed without leaving the conversation. Microsoft says the retailer remains the merchant of record, handling fulfillment and customer service.

The bigger question for the tech industry is whether chat-based commerce is actually the next big thing. Forrester analyst Sucharita Kodali, for example, previously told GeekWire that “e-commerce isn't a problem that needs to be fixed.” She added that it's unclear what value chat-based commerce is bringing to retailers, “other than disintermediating Google.”

Microsoft's Mitford offered a different take in an interview this week, saying that consumer behavior is shifting faster than it may seem. She drew a parallel to how quickly businesses moved from experimenting with AI to putting it into operation over the past year.

“I see the same thing happening with consumers … it just takes a little bit of time,” Mitford said, predicting that the speed of consumer adoption will eventually match the rapid uptake seen in the business world. 

Copilot Checkout is rolling out now in the U.S. on Copilot.com, with PayPal, Shopify, and Stripe handling payment processing. Etsy sellers will be among the first available on the platform. Shopify merchants are set to be automatically enrolled following an opt-out window.

That last detail is notable given the backlash Amazon has faced over its “Buy for Me” feature, where brands complained about being included without consent and seeing inaccurate listings. 

Microsoft's approach is more tightly connected to its partners — the company said Shopify will management the opt-out process for its merchants — but automatic enrollment seems to raise the potential for some of the same concerns. (We've contacted Shopify for more information.)

More broadly, Microsoft is playing catch-up on the consumer side. 

OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT last September, partnering with Shopify and Stripe to let users buy from more than a million merchants. Google followed in November with its own “Buy for Me” feature which lets its Gemini assistant purchase products on a user's behalf.

Despite its inroads with businesses, Copilot has a fraction of ChatGPT's market share with consumers. Recent data from Similarweb's Global AI Tracker showed ChatGPT with about 68% of AI chatbot web traffic, with Google Gemini at 18% and Copilot in the single digits.

But Microsoft has its advantages: Unlike Amazon and Google, which compete directly with retailers through their own marketplaces, it isn't a retailer. And retail has long been a major vertical for its enterprise cloud and software business, with large chains running on Azure and Microsoft 365.

Mitford said Microsoft is leaning on its existing trust and long-standing relationships with retailers, along with a commitment to responsible AI, to help differentiate itself from rivals.

Microsoft is making the broader case for AI to retailers based on return on investment. A Microsoft-commissioned study from IDC, released in November, found that retail and consumer packaged goods companies are seeing a 2.7x return on every dollar spent on generative AI. 

Mitford, a former fashion designer who has been in the technology industry for most of her career, said she sees the retail sector among the leaders in AI uptake across the business world. 

The technology, she said, is being “adopted at a pace that I've never seen.”

Liam Delap scored against Fulham, even if Chelsea ultimately lost Justin Setterfield/Getty Images

More than 200 days after completing his move from Ipswich Town, is Liam Delap finally finding his feet at Chelsea?

One of the most significant moments of Delap's Stamford Bridge career so far came early in the 2-0 win over Fulham in August, when he pulled up, grimacing, with the hamstring injury that would rule him out for two months. He will hope the reverse fixture on Wednesday, though overshadowed by a 2-1 defeat, will also be a turning point in his story at this club.

Delap's Chelsea career has not started as anyone hoped. When he swivelled and fired home Chelsea's then-equaliser in the 72nd minute at Craven Cottage, it ended an 18-game run without a goal for him in the Premier League — stretching back to scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers for Ipswich in April. It is his second goal outside of the Club World Cup for Chelsea, adding to one scored in the 3-0 Champions League win against Barcelona in November.

Delap's absence throughout September and October as he recovered from that hamstring injury, followed by another layoff with a shoulder problem in December, has meant he has not put together any consistent form. Until Wednesday he had yet to complete a full match this season.

For a striker who shone for relegated Ipswich last season, and who drew interest from multiple Premier League sides this summer, the numbers were not adding up. Undoubtedly, that was mostly due to injury, but Delap has also not helped himself at times. His return from injury against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Carabao Cup was cut short by a red card Enzo Maresca described as “embarrassing”. He has picked up two yellow cards since, including one within two minutes of being introduced against Aston Villa.

As incoming head coach Liam Rosenior, who is already familiar with Delap after coaching him on loan at Hull City in 2023-24, watched from the stands at Craven Cottage, he will have picked up on numerous problems he needs to address quickly at Cobham. One of the positives he can pluck out of that defeat, though, is that Delap is finally beginning to look like the player Chelsea paid £30m for in June.

Delap the target man started to emerge as a more effective force in November and December, showing his ability to agitate defenders, hold up the ball with his back to goal, and link up with his wingers. But that was inconsistent, shown only in glimpses, and more importantly, Delap the finisher was nowhere to be found. He appeared isolated at times, generating little in the way of clear-cut opportunities, and that frustration showed in ill-discipline.

Wednesday's game at Fulham was the first time that fans have seen Delap the target man and Delap the finisher and technician really appear.

Far from appearing isolated, he was involved in more attacking sequences than any other player on the pitch — particularly impressive given that Chelsea were down to 10 men for most of the game. That often involved dropping off and holding up the ball before teeing up an onrushing colleague. As Delap has built his minutes back up after injury, he is growing more vocal and more enterprising in his off-the-ball movement to capitalise on space in behind.

When Marc Cucurella was sent off in the 22nd minute, it could have turned into another frustrating and isolated evening for Delap — but he continued to occupy Fulham's back line and pulled his weight defensively, too, ranking fourth for defensive actions.



Before his goal, Delap's best moment came late in the first half. With his back to goal and Joachim Andersen grappling with him near the halfway line, the striker kept his feet rather than go to ground for a free-kick. He turned Andersen and pulled away from him and Sander Berge to create a counter-attack that eventually saw Cole Palmer's effort saved.

It encapsulated what a fit, firing Delap can add to Chelsea's build-up; then, in the second half, he added the end product. He had already run through on goal after linking up with Palmer, but was denied by Bernd Leno. It was eventually from a corner that he found the breakthrough, turning home Pedro Neto's delivery after it rebounded from the post. It was a close-range finish, but he reacted well to lose his marker and convert first-time with his body at an awkward angle.

That goal should also help Delap bond with a fanbase he has not been able to share much celebration with this season. His goal against Barcelona was welcome but ultimately a cherry on top of what had already been a superb performance; this time, he looked to have actually won Chelsea a point and celebrated fervently with the away end. Harry Wilson's superb late winner left Delap's goal ultimately as a consolation — but in the moment, it meant more.

This is only a start. There are still areas to work on: Delap was not booked but committed three fouls, the joint-most on the pitch. His output from open play can improve. But now, with a clean slate and working with a manager under whom he has blossomed before, things are certainly looking up.

“I thought Liam was brilliant when he came on at the Etihad,” said interim manager Calum McFarlane after Wednesday's match. “You can see that he had the bit between his teeth against his old side. He gave us a real outlet. His link-up play, his hold-up play was exceptional. Tough circumstances tonight, being the single No 9 down to 10 men. But even then, you see him fight, bully, control centre-backs and get us up the pitch.

“He had a big chance that he'll be disappointed to miss, which was great play from him and Cole linking up.

“I'm delighted he got his goal. He deserves it. He'll take confidence from that, and I hope his performances stay at this level.”

Delap is still far from the finished product — but 217 days after he joined the club, it feels as though he is really getting started.

It seems not all base camps in the Kansas City area are viewed the same by international soccer powerhouses.

When the 48 teams arrive in the United States, Mexico and Canada ahead of the 2026 World Cup, they'll travel to their home away from home before playing a match.

That's the purpose of a World Cup base camp. It's a place where the players can practice and get acquainted to the steamy weather.

Kansas City has three base camp options: Compass Mineral Sporting Fields, where Sporting Kansas City practices; the KC Women's Soccer Training Complex for the KC Current; and the University of Kansas' facilities and Rock Chalk Park.

Pam Kramer, the president of KC2026, said each nation had to give FIFA its top five base-camp choices by Monday. By the end of January, FIFA will assign the base-camp locations, stepping in to settle any disputes over a location.

Location and FIFA rankings will be two key ways to determine which country gets its first choice. That's important following the news that Argentina reportedly is eying Kansas City for its base camp.

Argentina is ranked second in the world by FIFA, one spot behind Spain, which is leaning toward Chicago or Atlanta for a base camp, according to a report in Spain. And Argentina plays a group-stage match at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.

That's bad news for England and coach Thomas Tuchel. Following last month's World Cup draw, The Guardian reported “Tuchel had cleared an FA (Football Association) plan for England to be based in ­Kansas after a pre-tournament ­training camp in Fort Lauderdale, but after the draw ... there are concerns that the Netherlands will be allocated their chosen facility at ­Sporting Kansas City, a ­high-performance centre used by US Soccer.”

The Netherlands also play one of their three group-stage matches at Arrowhead Stadium. But the Netherlands hasn't picked a base camp site yet.

The Guardian story said the World Cup draw was “potentially pitting the FA against the Netherlands and Argentina for bases in the tournament's south‑central region. ... The FA is understood to be exploring alter­natives on the east coast.”

England likely would have stuck with Kansas City if FIFA gave them the first option.

England, which is fourth in FIFA's world rankings, plays group-stage matches in Arlington, Texas; Foxborough, Massachusetts; and East Rutherford, New Jersey.

While England seems to have preferred Sporting Kansas City's training site, it is not known why Tuchel would not consider the KC Current or Rock Chalk Park options for a base camp.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

F1 Arcade has announced its Atlanta location will officially open on February 6, 2026.

F1 Arcade, the world's first official Formula 1 experiential hospitality brand, will officially open its Atlanta location on Friday, February 6, 2026, at The Interlock in West Midtown.

The opening brings a first-of-its-kind F1 entertainment experience to Georgia and the greater Southeast. Designed from the ground up for group fun, F1 Arcade Atlanta brings racing, dining, cocktails, and social connection together under one roof, adding a major new draw to one of Atlanta's fastest-growing entertainment districts. Reservations to race open to the public on January 15, 2026.

F1 Arcade Atlanta is as much about food, drink, and connection as it is about racing. The venue pairs the adrenaline of Formula 1 with a chef-driven culinary program and a destination-worthy bar, making it a place guests come for dinner and drinks – and stay for the competition.

Inspired by the iconic F1 Grand Prix circuits around the world, the menu blends elevated comfort food with global street-food influences, featuring dishes like ahi tuna tartare, wagyu beef sliders, and chipotle shrimp tacos, designed for sharing between races or lingering long after the chequered flag.

The full-service bar is curated by Netflix Drink Masters champion LP O'Brien, which anchors the space with inventive signature cocktails, locally inspired selections, and F1 Arcade's alcohol-free “Designated Drivers” mocktails, each playfully named with a story behind every sip.

Beyond the track, F1 Arcade Atlanta is built as a full-scale social destination. Guests can move seamlessly between racing, dining, and gathering to cheer on friends mid-race, lingering over cocktails, or simply soaking in the atmosphere. Hosts guide first-time racers through a quick onboarding before guests slide into bespoke simulators that move, rumble, and respond to every turn of the wheel.

Racers can choose from five skill levels, ranging from Rookie – featuring full driving assists – to Elite, which offers a true no-assist challenge for experienced drivers seeking maximum control. Built to be inclusive and easy to pick up, the experience is accessible for all skill levels and open to guests ages seven and up, making F1 Arcade a rare destination where families, friend groups, and multigenerational teams can compete together.

Each simulator features dual screens – one for the driver and an elevated spectator screen – allowing friends and colleagues to watch the race unfold in real time and cheer drivers on.

“We're excited to officially announce our Atlanta opening and welcome guests beginning February 6,” said Jonathan Peters, CEO of F1 Arcade. “Atlanta is a dynamic, culture-forward city, and F1 Arcade is designed to bring people together—whether they're lifelong fans or brand-new to the sport — for unforgettable racing, food, and social experiences.”

To mark its Atlanta debut, F1 Arcade will introduce a limited Founder's Club Card on opening day. Doors open at 5:00 p.m. on February 6, and the first 100 guests through the doors will receive a Founder's Club Card, unlocking lifetime exclusive perks and experiences – including 50% off food for the first three months – designed to reward the earliest members of the F1 Arcade Atlanta community.

Spanning more than 15,500 square feet, F1 Arcade Atlanta features 68 state-of-the-art full-motion racing simulators, immersive audiovisual elements, and a refined, industrial interior, along with an expansive outdoor patio set to open in spring 2026.

The space is designed to reflect both the precision of Formula 1 and the raw, energetic character of Atlanta. Rather than a themed approach, the space embraces material honesty – polished concrete floors, expressive lighting, and a layout that encourages movement and discovery throughout the venue.

Beyond the simulators, guests can test their reflexes on an interactive react wall and explore a series of visually striking moments, including neon circuit-style chandeliers and hand-painted tyre-mark murals by Atlanta-based artist Thomas Turner. Turner's work brings a bold, visceral edge that grounds the global F1 Arcade brand in Atlanta's creative culture, giving the space a distinct sense of place while remaining part of a cohesive international experience.

Designed for celebrations of every kind, from corporate events and client entertainment to birthdays, date nights, and friendly meetups, F1 Arcade Atlanta offers flexible event options including private rooms, exclusive spaces, and full-venue buyouts for up to 450 guests. The venue's private Briefing Room accommodates up to 90 guests, with additional semi-private spillover space for larger parties.

Here, guests enjoy exclusive access to dedicated racing simulators, along with a private bar, personalized service, and built-in AV. Throughout the space, team-based racing formats and shared leaderboards turn competition into connection, making F1 Arcade a standout group experience. Through F1 Arcade's digital Arcade Hub, guests can track their racing scores over time, compare results with friends, and even opt into prize pools for the chance to win Formula 1 Grand Prix tickets.

F1 Arcade simulators are powered by Motorsport Games' rFactor 2 racing simulation platform and developed in collaboration with Formula 1 and Studio 397. Guests can race solo, head-to-head, or as teams, creating a highly social, adrenaline-fueled environment. Race day watch parties will give guests the chance to enjoy live Formula 1 Grand Prix broadcasts throughout the season, paired with food and beverage specials and the opportunity to jump into the simulators.

Together, racing, dining, live broadcasts, and interactive competition create a fully immersive Formula 1 fan journey that extends far beyond a single visit. With weekly programming and special events, F1 Arcade Atlanta becomes a year-round home base for Formula 1 fans and everyone in between.

As part of its commitment to the Atlanta hospitality community, F1 Arcade will also support The Giving Kitchen, a Georgia-based nonprofit providing emergency assistance to food service workers in crisis. During its first month of operations, F1 Arcade will support The Giving Kitchen by donating $1 from every Georgia Tow sold, which is Atlanta's signature cocktail.

Race reservations at F1 Arcade Atlanta open January 15, 2026. While reservations are required to race, The Octane Bar and dining areas are open to all.

To enquire or reserve, visit f1arcade.com/us/atlanta. Guests can also sign up for updates and priority access at www.f1arcade.com/us/newsletter-signup and follow @f1arcadeusa on Instagram.
