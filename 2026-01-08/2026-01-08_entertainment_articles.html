                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Directors Guild of America revealed its feature film nominees Thursday for the 78th DGA Awards, with the helmers behind awards-season stalwarts One Battle After Another, Sinners, Frankenstein, Marty Supreme and Hamnet scoring noms in the Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Theatrical Feature Film category. The Theatrical Feature Film nominations mark the first full DGA nom ever for Sinners‘ Ryan Coogler and Marty Supreme‘s Josh Safdie, and the second for Hamnet‘s Chloé Zhao, who won the honor in 2021 for her eventual Oscar Best Picture winner Nomadland. It's also just the second nom for Del Toro, after he won in 2018 for his also eventual Oscar Best Picture winner The Shape of Water. Anderson was previously nominated for There Will Be Blood and Licorice Pizza, and he is coming off a Best Director win at the Critics Choice Awards. Last year, Sean Baker won the DGA's Theatrical Feature FIlm prize for his Anora, part of a haul that built momentum toward his Best Director and Best Picture wins at the Oscars. He beat out a DGA field that included Jacques Audiard (Emilia Pérez), Edward Berger (Conclave), Brady Corbet (The Brutalist) and James Mangold (A Complete Unknown). Last year, RaMell Ross took the First-Time award for his Nickel Boys. This year's DGA Awards ceremony is set for Saturday, February 7 at the Beverly Hilton after member voting that runs from now to February 6.

The Directors Guild of America (DGA) has spoken with its own nominees amid a very busy awards season week that started with the Critics Choice Awards and will end with the Golden Globes. The directors contending for outstanding theatrical feature film are: Paul Thomas Anderson (“One Battle After Another”), Ryan Coogler (“Sinners”), Guillermo del Toro (“Frankenstein”), Chloé Zhao (“Hamnet”), and Josh Safdie (“Marty Supreme”). Related Stories ‘Primate' Review: Fine-Enough Killer Chimp Movie Will Beat You Over the Head Casting Society Award Nominees Include ‘Sinners,' ‘Wake Up Dead Man,' and ‘Pillion' The DGA nominations aren't always predictive of the final Oscar five; last year, “The Substance” filmmaker Coralie Fargeat was Academy-nominated instead of DGA pick Edward Berger for “Conclave.” In both scenarios, Sean Baker won for his eventual Best Picture recipient, “Anora.” The 78th Directors Guild of America Awards are set to take place at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles on Saturday, February 7.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Alan Chikin Chow and Kareem Rahma agency Underscore Talent is kicking off 2026 by unveiling a slew of hires and promotions, with a former Paramount adult animation exec among them. Sachi Ezura, who was VP, Adult Animation at the Skydance-owned U.S. studio between 2021 and 2025, has joined as Talent Manager in the creator-focused talent house's Comedy division. She was among those who exited in last year's redundancies at the company. At Paramount, she worked on shows such as Clone High, Ren & Stimpy, Tooning Out the News, Digman! and Everybody Still Hates Chris, and now joins Underscore's new Comedy unit, which we first revealed news of in October last year. Underscore co-founder Michael Green leads the division, which already includes other managers such as Andrew Topel. 'Love Island' Star & Make-Up YouTuber Lana Jenkins Joins Creator Agency NAO Talent Sachi's hire comes during a significant growth period for Underscore, an L.A.-based creator economy talent house that has been quietly adding the new staff over the past year, with 20 internal promotions and 44 hires. Eleven of those have been talent managers and six senior leaders. We've reported on several of them, with Nadi Filsoof notably upped to partner in the Entertainment division last year. It represents creators hailing from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, Snapchat, the gaming world and podcasting. Key talent includes former New York Times exec and Subway Takes comedian Kareem Rahma, who Deadline recently named as a creator to watch in 2026. Also on the books among others are true crime and make-up influencer Bailey Sarian, actress and comedian Christina Kirkman, Alan's Series maker Alan Chikin Chow, TikTok personality and former soccer player Noah Beck, preschooler content creators Vlad & Niki, digital comedian Zachariah Porter and retired soccer player Brittany Isenhour. “We're operating in a fast-moving industry whose potential is expanding faster than other media sectors,” Underscore co-founder Reza Izad told Deadline. “By expanding our leadership team across verticals and shared services, while continuing to promote from within, we've built a team designed to support long-term career architecture, not just moment-driven opportunities. This depth allows us to move faster, think more holistically, and help talent navigate an increasingly complex digital-first landscape heading into 2026.” Adrienne Gao and Virginia Dodenhoff rose in the Brand Partnerships unit. “These promotions reflect the way we're building Underscore, by investing deeply in our people and giving them room to grow into leaders,” said Dan Weinstein, Co-CEO of Underscore Talent. Developing talent from within, alongside bringing in new leaders, is what allows us to move faster and think bigger.” They formed Underscore five years, and sold a majority stake to TheSoul Publishing in 2022. DEADLINE: How will the new hires and promotions set Underscore up for 2026? Izad: We're operating in a fast-moving industry whose potential is expanding faster than other media sectors. By expanding our leadership team across verticals and shared services, while continuing to promote from within, we've built a team designed to support long-term career architecture, not just moment-driven opportunities. This depth allows us to move faster, think more holistically, and help talent navigate an increasingly complex digital-first landscape heading into 2026. As the creator economy continues to decentralize, it's crucial for us to operate at the highest level at this intersection of talent management, media strategy, and IP development. As platforms fragment and creators build businesses across YouTube, podcasts, film, TV, and owned audiences, management can no longer be transactional or simply reactive. DEADLINE: Where do you want your team most focused in 2026? Dan: Our focus is on three things: audience ownership, scalable storytelling, and operational leverage. Creators are no longer optimizing for a single platform or viral moment, they're building repeatable formats, serialized content, and communities that travel across platforms and into real-world experiences. Our team is focused on helping talent understand where attention, influence, and budgets are actually moving, while building systems that let them work smarter, not harder, as their businesses scale. Weinstein: It's a sign of how real and permanent this shift is. As creators rival traditional entertainers in reach and cultural impact, the demand for specialized representation is inevitable. What differentiates companies now isn't access, it's strategy. The next era of management is about helping talent build durable media businesses, develop IP, and navigate both digital and traditional entertainment on their own terms. The proliferation of new firms reflects how much opportunity there is, but it also raises the bar for what real management should deliver. Everyone is trying to figure out how they succeed in this digital-first world, especially traditional entertainers, athletes and public personalities. Underscore's team, many of whom crossed over from traditional to digital entertainment, have been critical in helping this group of talent make sense of the digital landscape and how they can operate within it as creators and creatives. DEADLINE: How do you assess the market opportunities and challenges? We have leaders who've grown with Underscore for years alongside new executives bringing fresh perspectives across every corner of business including AI, publishing, comedy, data, content optimization, and monetization. From the rise of creator-owned communities on platforms like Substack, nascent AI advancements across music, editing and animation to the role of serialized formats for streamers and marketing, these are just a few of areas that will shape 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'This is a company building with intention ... while staying deeply connected to culture,' says the former Motown Records chairwoman and CEO. Habtemariam previously served as chairwoman and CEO of Motown Records before exiting that post in 2022. Habtemariam, whose appointment is effective immediately, will assist in advancing HYBE America's “longterm strategy, spearheading A&R and artist development initiatives across the company's label ecosystem and identifying new opportunities at the intersection of music, culture and fandom,” as noted in a press announcement. In addition, she will play a pivotal role in broadening HYBE America's presence in Atlanta, where its Quality Control label is headquartered, calling the city “a global epicenter of R&B and hip-hop, further strengthening Quality Control's presence and impact as Atlanta's premier music company.” HYBE launched its Latin American division in 2023 and acquired hip-hop label Quality Control Music the same year. Her vision, taste and strategic insight make her uniquely suited to help shape the next chapter of HYBE America as we continue building a future-facing entertainment company centered on artists and fans.” Under the HYBE banner, Lee also oversees Big Machine Label Group and the company's investments with Universal Music Group in artists such as KATSEYE. As president of music, Habtemariam will also collaborate closely with UMG. “I've long admired how HYBE America approaches artists, fans and the future of entertainment,” said Habtemariam in a statement. “This is a company building with intention and investing for the long term while staying deeply connected to culture. In addition to partnering with Quality Control Music under Habtemariam's watch, Motown signed Leon Thomas and NBA YoungBoy. “Working with Ethiopia again feels full circle,” Coach K said in a statement. “From the early days in Atlanta, we built something special at Quality Control, and it means a lot to see that legacy continue in this next chapter.” I'm excited for what we will build together in this next chapter.” Advancing from creative manager to president of urban music & co-head of creative at UMPG, she oversaw signings that included Chris Brown, Theron Thomas, J. Cole, Justin Bieber, Ciara, Jhené Aiko and Hit-Boy. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

Bruno Mars is gearing up to bring a little romance to cities all around the world, and Anderson .Paak, RAYE and more big names are coming along with him. Running through mid-October, the trek will find Mars playing stadiums across North America, Canada and Europe. His Silk Sonic bandmate will be a featured guest at all of the shows, while “Where Is My Husband!” singer RAYE, Victoria Monét and Leon Thomas will take turns as supporting acts on different dates. Fans can now sign up for a ticket presale, which starts Jan. 14 on Mars' website. The Romantic will drop Feb. 27, a full decade after his last LP, 2016's 24K Magic. But even though it's been a while since he released a solo full-length, the 16-time Grammy winner has been anything but unproductive in recent years. With .Paak, he formed Silk Sonic in 2021, and the duo scored a No. 1 on Billboard‘s year-end Hot 100 chart and ROSÉ collaboration “APT.” coming in at No. See Mars' tour announcement and full list of dates below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rose McGowan's weight was repeatedly checked by “Charmed” executives, the actress claimed in a new podcast interview. “[They would] check my weight when I came back from season to season,” she recalled, quipping that the men were “inspecting their product.” She expressed mixed feelings about Hollywood being “different” these days, claiming the industry “pay[s] lip service” to the idea that it has evolved. Earlier in the interview, McGowan noted that “Charmed” was “hard for” her to film as it was her first time dealing with “super corporate” dynamics. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. She once asked “five white dodos in their suits” whether they would “fire [her]” and let her “leave” if she was caught smoking a joint. She labeled the entertainment industry “far worse than the [Children of God] cult [she] grew up in.” In 2018, McGowan said in her “Citizen Rose” docuseries that she needed hypnotherapy to process her time on the WB show. “I found the repetitive days so opposite my natural rhythms that I became sick over and over,” she told viewers of the “very stressful environment.” I was sick about four or five times a season. She gained 10 pounds for the role, explaining in her “Brave” memoir that same year that her goal was to appear “super nonthreatening” as Shannen Doherty's character Prue Halliwell's replacement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an interview published Sunday, the US Ambassador to Greece insisted, “I wish him, of course, all the best.” Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. were an item from 2018 to 2024, with the former couple getting engaged in 2020. Page Six reported in December 2024 that the pair had called it quits. “They get argumentative at Mar-a-Lago in front of people. Nothing crazy, but you know when a couple is fighting. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By the time news broke of their split, Trump Jr. had moved on with Anderson. We heard he and the socialite, 39, had been together “for a few months” before their romance made headlines. Trump Jr. got down on one knee the following December while celebrating Anderson's birthday at Camp David. After Page Six exclusively broke the engagement news, President Trump praised their “young love” at the White House Christmas party. The exes ended their union in 2018 after more than a decade of marriage, and Trump Jr. moved on with Guilfoyle later that same year. Guilfoyle has walked down the aisle before as well, marrying California's governor Gavin Newsom in 2001. As for Anderson, this will be the socialite's first marriage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix uncovered release dates and fresh looks for a number of projects from its 2026 film slate, including sneak peeks at Millie Bobby Brown in Enola Holmes 3 and John Cena in the comedy Little Brother. The company also debuted an array of release dates and news for its 2026 television roster, in addition to a “What Next?” video (seen below) teasing its high-profile forthcoming projects. The streamer announced Wednesday that Remarkably Bright Creatures, director Olivia Newman's feature adaptation of author Shelby Van Pelt's best-selling 2022 novel, is set to debut on Netflix on May 8. Paramount Stands By $30 Per Share Offer for Warner Bros. Netflix announced that Tyler Perry‘s Joe's College Road Trip will begin streaming Feb. 13. Also getting a newly announced release date was the Alan Ritchson-led action film War Machine, launching March 6. Director Patrick Hughes' feature centers on a team of Army Rangers facing an unparalleled threat. Dennis Quaid, Stephan James, Jai Courtney and Esai Morales round out the cast. Louis Partridge, Himesh Patel, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Henry Cavill and Helena Bonham Carter reprise their roles in Philip Barantini's follow-up that is set to launch this summer. Also seen above is the first image to be revealed from Little Brother, the comedy starring Cena as a famed real estate agent who gets an unexpected visit from his “little brother,” as played by Eric André. Additionally, Netflix announced that Swapped, its animated feature formerly known as Pookoo, has added Tracy Morgan and Cedric the Entertainer to its voice cast. Michael B. Jordan and Juno Temple were previously announced as the voice stars of director Nathan Greno's movie about a small woodland creature (Jordan) and majestic bird (Temple) switching bodies and reluctantly teaming up to survive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix made a brief, presumably futile effort today to convince legions of Stranger Things fans—many of whom have spent the week since the show's finale convincing themselves, with at least some measure of sincerity, that a secret extra final episode of the blockbuster series was forthcoming—that the series is, in fact, over. Per Deadline, the streaming service's social media descriptions briefly updated on Wednesday afternoon into an all-caps, hard-not-to-read-as-harried-sounding “ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING.” (The descriptions have since shifted to promoting the upcoming movie People We Meet On Vacation.) As we reported back on Monday, a fan theory called “Conformity Gate” has been sweeping through Stranger Things fandom ever since the finale aired, as fans have glommed on to various clues that “prove” that the show's mostly happily ever after ending was a dirty trick being planted in the protagonists' brains by psychic big bad Vecna. (Note to wannabe conspiracy theorists: Maybe don't hinge your hopes and dreams on Netflix scheduling folk knowing a lot about Orthodox Christmas.) As noted by Deadline, the lack of a sudden “real” finale coming to upend the established status quo, undo that final scene the Duffer brothers have been talking about filming for years at this point, and make fools out of everybody who paid to go see the actual finale in theaters on New Year's Eve, has elicited a wide variety of reactions from true believers, from anger, to a rueful belief that the “Vecna mind-controlled everybody” twist could just be how the series ends, to a more general acknowledgement that holding tight to fan theories was a way to keep the show alive just a little bit longer. What we're seeing, in other words, is a generation of folks for whom this show was foundational, and constituted a lot of firsts, coming to terms with their first instance of highly relatable experience Your TV Show Just Disappointed You With Its Ending. As such, it's hard to be too hard on the young folks signing Change.org petitions, putting together “proof” videos, and otherwise nerding out together to try to figure out why a show that's been with them for a huge chunk of their lives just left them a little hollow feeling at the end. It's a natural part of any evolving TV fan's relationship with the medium: Endings are hard, relatively few projects can manage them with any elegance even before you factor in how many moving parts Stranger Things had there at the end, and coming to terms with the absence of a guaranteed satisfying resolution is a key part of maturing into someone who thinks critically about the art they consume. If that kicks out a few wild conspiracy theories and yarn-covered cork boards in the process, then that's presumably just a byproduct of figuring out how to grow up in the upside down world of modern online entertainment.

A warning up top, before we dig in here: This article contains usage of the word “snackable” in contexts where it is not being applied to anything that has been fried, battered, or flavor-blasted; we apologize to anyone who's been rendered snackability intolerant by years of modern TV marketing speak.

Anyway, Disney+ is gearing up to get snackable as hell, with Deadline reporting that the streaming service will soon be incorporating a heavy slathering of vertical videos into its digital offerings in order to better colonize our brains. The issue, apparently, being that while people do subscribe to the service—at roughly 200 million subscribers, it's the fourth-biggest streaming service on the planet, competing only with Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney's own Hotstar platform in India for the honor—they aren't logging into it every single day, as part of their regular routines, in order to mindlessly scroll through crap.

Sorry, no, we meant to say, they aren't enjoying vertical videos that are “are really great as daily habits, snackable, short, bite-sized experiences,” according to EVP of product management Erin Teague, who did not go on to just straight-up say “You know, like TikTok, or YouTube Shorts.” The push was presented at CES this week as an enticement to advertisers, who would presumably be very excited to do a little snacking of their own on the brains of legions of people flicking through video after video, potentially pulled from categories like “original short-form programming, repurposed social clips, refashioned scenes from longer-form episodic or feature titles, or a combination.”

All of this, Disney would like you to know, is really just about meeting people “where they are. This is what Gen Z and Gen Alpha are expecting. They are not necessarily thinking about sitting down, watching a long-form, two-and-a-half hour piece of content on their phones.” And, sure, it feels worth noting that the social media platforms this move is presumably meant to mimic are social media platforms—with built-in audiences of millions of content creators churning out all that snackable content for their fellow subscribers to consume, as opposed to, say, one company trying to generate the same effect via chopping and screwing its own limited pool of material to better appeal to our attention-deprived minds. But, on the other hand… Okay, actually, we can't think of a good “on the other hand” here. But, then, we're not big, exciting Disney marketing brains, pushing forward into bold new definitions of the once-innocuous word “snack.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fran Drescher is opening up about one of the most defining chapters of her life, reflecting on surviving cancer, processing long-held trauma and how those experiences reshaped her priorities. More than two decades after her diagnosis, the actress says the journey continues to inform how she lives, works and cares for herself today. In a recent interview with People, the 68-year-old revealed she was diagnosed with uterine cancer at age 42, a diagnosis that initially went unnoticed because she did not fit the typical risk profile, per the Daily Mail. Drescher explained that uterine cancer usually affects postmenopausal or obese women, neither of which applied to her at the time. Because of that, she believes she “slipped between the cracks.” Still, the cancer was caught at stage one, meaning it had not penetrated the uterine lining, something she now views as a stroke of luck. Drescher has also spoken candidly about the emotional weight surrounding her illness. Over time, she came to believe that unresolved trauma found a physical outlet. She has since urged women not to ignore warning signs or put everyone else first at the expense of their own health. “Don't ignore something and hope it goes away,” she has warned, encouraging women to listen to their bodies and seek care early. In June 2025, Drescher marked a major milestone, celebrating 25 years cancer-free. She is enjoying a renewed moment in her career, including her role in the film “Marty Supreme,” while continuing to speak openly about survival and self-care. Looking back, she sees her story as one shaped by resilience and hard-earned wisdom. As she put it simply, “You can't stop me.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>
