If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Para leer esta historia en español, haga clic aquí. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers can't enter someone's home without a warrant, but that doesn't stop agents from using tactics to get to people. ICE agents have altered license plates and placed Mexican flag stickers on their vehicles to try to lure and detain people, NPR reported. In December, NW Natural, a natural gas utility serving 2 million people in Oregon and southwest Washington, published guidance in seven different languages on how to identify if someone is actually one of their employees. Portland General Electric has similar guidance on its website. NW Natural spokesperson David Roy said the company was made aware of incidents of people posing as utility workers and decided to issue the guidance. Rep. Ricki Ruiz, D-Gresham, said he was already concerned about scammers going door to door taking people's money in his district, but he contacted NW Natural and Portland General Electric in December after hearing that three people in his city were detained after ICE agents posed as utility workers. “They lured him out of his house, and they took him,” Ruiz said in an interview about the first instance he heard about. ​​Ruiz represents Oregon's 50th House District, a diverse region that includes parts of East Portland and Gresham. According to census data, more than 16% of Gresham residents were born outside the U.S., and 44% of those residents are from Latin America. ICE did not respond to the Capital Chronicle's request for comment. U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents revealed in court in early December that the federal government brought ICE agents from around the country to Portland as part of what they're calling “Operation Black Rose.” Agents use advanced surveillance technology to locate and detain people, often stopping people in their vehicles and using violence, according to an analysis from Stephen Manning, the executive director of Portland-based immigration law firm Innovation Law Lab. As the February 2026 short legislative session approaches, several Democratic lawmakers have indicated they plan to sponsor bills addressing federal immigration enforcement in the state. Ruiz said he will sponsor legislation to support lawsuits against federal agents if they come into a person's home without warrants and a bill to prevent ICE agents from wearing masks.

The US Senate ratified the convention in 1992 by unanimous consent, but lawmakers have repeatedly failed to assert their constitutional authority to stop presidents from unilaterally withdrawing from global treaties. Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement that “Trump cutting ties with the world's oldest climate treaty is another despicable effort to let corporate fossil fuel interests run our government.” Letting this lawless move stand could shut the US out of climate diplomacy forever,” Su warned. “Withdrawing from the world's leading climate, biodiversity, and scientific institutions threatens all life on Earth.” The president's move came as he continued to steamroll domestic and international law with an illegal assault on Venezuela and threats to seize Greenland with military force, among other grave abuses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A small bloc of Senate Republicans has delivered a notable rebuke of President Donald Trump just days after his operation ousting Venezuela's leader, voting to advance a resolution that would limit future US military force in the nation without Congress' approval. Five Republicans on Thursday voted with all Senate Democrats to allow a future vote that would limit the president's powers in the deepening conflict with Venezuela — a move that surprised even some Democrats who had not been certain how the GOP votes would fall. The vote in the Senate had been considered mostly a messaging exercise by Democrats and Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, a co-sponsor of the measure, to force their GOP counterparts to register their discontent over – or support of – an increasingly emboldened White House. But now that it has won over enough Republican votes, it becomes a much more real threat to the reach of Trump's power. After his vote, Fetterman refused to answer questions about why he voted in favor. Trump officials scramble to sell skeptical lawmakers, oil execs on Venezuela plan If that passes, the two chambers would need to unify their two resolutions — ultimately sending something to Trump's desk for his consideration. It has been a closely watched vote in both GOP leadership suites and the White House in a week where members of Congress have pressed the administration for answers about its next steps in the widening conflict with Venezuela. While Republicans like Speaker Mike Johnson have been clear they believe Trump was within his powers to execute the operation in Venezuela without approval from Congress, not all Republicans agree. The operation leading to the ouster and capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro triggered a series of classified briefings in Washington this week that left a partisan split in their wake. And there have been further questions, including among Republicans, about where Trump might deploy US military forces next, including Cuba, Colombia or Greenland. Speaking with reporters on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of the vote, Paul emphasized that this resolution is not a referendum on whether or not Maduro was a “bad guy,” but about asserting Congress' right to declare war. Paul previously said he had heard from two other Republicans who were considering backing the resolution, increasing its chances for passage. Kaine had said he had “high hopes and low expectations,” for the vote, and was hopeful they could pull more GOP support after the operation to capture Maduro than they received in November, noting that some of his colleagues had thought Trump was “bluffing.” “If the first one was premature, and that was an opinion by a number of my colleagues who voted no, this isn't premature,” he added. Both senators argued that the administration's insistance that the Venezuela operation was a law enforcement effort, with some military support, and not a military operation didn't ring true. We've got a military blockade,” said Kaine, “You know, this is, this is not a surgical arrest operation, by any stretch, and that means we got to declare where we are on it.” However, in a speech on the Senate floor earlier this week, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham countered that Trump did not need congressional consent or approval for capturing Maduro, calling the War Powers Act “patently unconstitutional,” and argued that Congress can push back on extended US involvement in Venezuela through its control over government funding. Analysis: Congressional Republicans are running out of powers to give Trump “If you don't want any American boots on the ground, I think you could come forward and pass, through the appropriations process, a prohibition of funds to be used to have American ground forces in Venezuela,” he said. “What we can't do is substitute our judgment for the decision itself,” to use military force. Kaine also told reporters that senators would be forcing votes to block military action in other nations and territories mentioned by the administration in recent days, including Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Nigeria and Greenland. Paul said that behind closed doors he hasn't heard any Senate Republican argue that there is a military rationale for using force to capture Greenland, despite the administration refusing to rule it out. I've not heard of anybody in the hallways, in the gym, anywhere, I haven't heard one Republican go up to me and say, get it by military force. Paul suggested that such points are not coming from senators, saying, “It's from you know, people like [senior White House aide] Stephen Miller, who also ruminated about getting rid of habeas corpus. So that kind of stuff is, should be condemned.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Plichta faces misdemeanor charges, which locals say is a tactic of Grand Rapids, Michigan, police to suppress protests The clip went immediately viral, racking up millions of views across social media. Plichta, who recently co-founded local group Grand Rapids Opponents of War, which helped organize Saturday's protest, had visited the Venezuelan capital of Caracas just last month, amid the Trump administration's blockade. But after Trump ordered that Venezuelan airspace be “closed in its entirety” on 29 November, many canceled their trips. So what else can you say about that?” Plichta said. Emerson Wolf, co-director of Grand Rapids' Institute for Global Education and chair of Palestine Solidarity Grand Rapids, said this is an established tactic of Grand Rapids police to suppress local protests and protesters. Last March, Wolf spoke at a local International Women's Day event; the next month, as they were preparing to lead the local Hands Off! “If it's truly about the safety of people executing their sacred free speech rights in the streets of Grand Rapids, then why doesn't [the Grand Rapids police department] arrest protesters right away, or do more to help encourage the safety of protesters downtown? Instead, they issue citations months later in order to criminalize dissent,” said Wolf. Amid yesterday's ICE killing of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, thousands have taken to the streets in cities across the US to demonstrate. We're living in a nightmare right now, and it's time for us to be escalating against this sort of brutality.” Wolf said they had been following the anti-war movement since they were a teenager during the Iraq war; Plichta has been organizing for about two years. Both feel strongly that the Trump administration's actions in Venezuela were a five-alarm fire for international politics writ large. We do not want the US to escalate its attacks on Venezuela. We don't want our friends and family to have to fight a rich man's war for oil,” Plichta said. “I've seen a comment [that] ‘there's now going to be 1,000 Jessicas with this'. It's not about me or my name,” Plichta said. When you try to suppress the movement, all it does is radicalize those who stand against needless war.” Said Wolf: “If they don't want us marching in the streets, how else do they expect us to voice our opinions?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jennifer Garner is fully aware that some people are impressed with how she successfully co-parents with her ex-husband Ben Affleck, but it's not because she read it in a tabloid. One thing is that she “protects her peace by refusing to engage with tabloid coverage.” “It doesn't serve me to take in gossip about myself or anyone else, much less my kids, so I don't do it,” Garner said. The couple married in June 2005 and confirmed their split in 2015, a day after their 10th wedding anniversary. More than 20 years later, they continue to make headlines whenever spotted together, including last year, a month after he settled his divorce with Jennifer Lopez and Affleck and Garner reunited for son Samuel's birthday party. Affleck is on the same page as Garner about tabloids. “We used to have a thing, my ex-wife and I, when they would see something on a supermarket stand,” he told GQ last year. “We would say, ‘Well, you know this isn't always true because if it were, you would have 15 brothers or sisters or whatever the number of stories is where they said that your mom was pregnant. “You have to be smart about what you can and can't handle, and I could not handle what was out there,” she told Marie Claire UK. “The fact of it is what was hard,” she said. “The actual breaking up of a family is what was hard. Losing a true partnership and friendship is what was hard.” The new season of “The Last Thing He Told Me” is scheduled to drop on Apple TV+ on February 20.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow calls on Washington to adhere to the rule of law and immediately cease illegal actions against the oil tanker Marinera, according to a statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry. "We call on Washington to resume compliance with the fundamental norms and principles of international maritime navigation and immediately cease its illegal actions against the Marinera and other vessels engaged in law·abiding activities on the high seas," the ministry said. "We reiterate our demand that the US ensure humane and dignified treatment of the Russian citizens comprising the tanker's crew, strictly observe their rights and interests, and make no obstacles to their prompt return to their homeland," the Foreign Ministry added. "The Marinera, which on December 24 received temporary permission to sail under the Russian flag in accordance with international law and Russian legislation, was peacefully transiting international waters in the North Atlantic, heading for one of Russia's ports," the ministry said. They could not have had any doubts about this, just as there were and are no grounds for arguing that the tanker was sailing ‘without a flag' or ‘under a false flag.'" "Russia did not give consent to these actions. Under these circumstances, US military personnel boarding a civilian vessel on the high seas and effectively seizing it, as well as capturing its crew, "can only be viewed as a gross violation of the basic principles and norms of international maritime law and freedom of navigation." "Unilateral restrictive measures by the US, as well as other Western countries, are illegitimate and cannot justify attempts to establish jurisdiction and, even more so, to seize ships on the high seas," the ministry said. "The statements by some US officials that the seizure of the Marinera is part of a broader strategy to establish Washington's unlimited control over Venezuela's natural resources are extremely cynical. We strongly reject such neo-colonialist tendencies," the ministry concluded.</p>

MOSCOW, January 8. /TASS/. The document on "security guarantees" prepared by the Western calition of the willing together with Kiev is far from a plan for a peaceful settlement and is aimed at continued militarization, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

"On January 6 in Paris, participants in the so-called coalition of the willing, led by the UK and France, signed a declaration with the Kiev regime entitled Robust Security Guarantees for a Solid and Lasting Peace," Zakharova said in a comment. "This document is far from a peaceful settlement plan. It is aimed not at achieving lasting peace and security, but at continued militarization, escalation, and the expansion of the conflict."

According to her, the key provision of the document is "the deployment of certain ‘multinational forces' on Ukrainian territory." She said coalition members intend to form these forces in order to assist in the "restoration" of the Ukrainian army and ensure the "containment" of Russia after the end of hostilities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Volodymyr Zelensky urged additional pressure from the United States on Jan. 7 to help achieve a peace deal in Ukraine in the coming months, jokingly evoking calls for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov to suffer the same fate as captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Let them carry out some kind of operation with this — what's his name — Kadyrov. Maybe then (Russian President) Putin will see it and think twice," Zelensky joked. Zelensky's quip comes just days after the U.S. carried out a large-scale attack on Venezuela, an ally of Moscow, with the stated goals of effecting regime change and seizing control of the country's oil reserves. Kadyrov, a ruthless strongman who has referred to himself as "Putin's foot soldier" has ruled the pro-Kremlin Chechen Republic since 2007. The U.S. and other Western allies have imposed sanctions against Kadyrov and his family over human rights abuses in Chechnya. The comments come as U.S.-led peace talks continue to unfold despite increased tensions between Russia and the U.S., sharpened by Washington's military operation in Venezuela, Moscow's ally, and Russia's refusal to cease hostilities in Ukraine. Zelensky said earlier in the day that peace "negotiations have reached a new milestone together with our European partners and, of course, the United States," sharing his belief that Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine could be brought to an end in the first half of 2026.

More than 1 million people in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast remained without water and heating as of the morning of Jan. 8, Communities and Territories Development Minister Oleksii Kuleba said. Anka Feldhusen, the German ambassador from 2019-2023, replaces Canadian Roman Washchuk, who led the Business Ombudsman Council from December 2021-2025. "We understand that the American side will engage with Russia, and we expect feedback on whether the aggressor is genuinely willing to end the war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. The loan will help state-owned Ukrhydroenergo purchase stockpiles of critical supplies, replacements for equipment damaged by Russian attacks, as well as to refurbish and modernize old equipment. U.S. President Donald Trump has approved moving forward with a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill, opening the door for a potential Senate vote as early as next week, according to Senator Lindsey Graham. "The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. "This will allow us to build the 'Dream Military' that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us safe and secure, regardless of foe," Donald Trump said on Truth Social. The report follows an agreement reached in December 2025 by EU countries to ban Russian gas imports beginning Jan. 1, 2028, with LNG imports set to be prohibited at the start of 2027.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged that Good had attempted to ram ICE officers with the car, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey dismissed that version of events as “bullsh**t.” In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump backed ICE officers. It is a horrible thing to watch,” Trump wrote. “The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” he added. “We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!” he wrote. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told reporters that Good's vehicle was blocking a road when federal agents approached her. At least two shots were fired,” he said. Good's mother, Donna Ganger, denied that her daughter was involved in anti-ICE protests. “She was probably terrified,” Ganger told the Minnesota Star Tribune. “Renee was one of the kindest people I've ever known,” she said. Trump launched a crackdown on illegal immigration after returning to the White House in January 2025, vowing to carry out the largest deportation effort in American history.

With former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro awaiting trial in federal custody in New York City on narco-terrorism charges and U.S. President Donald Trump vowing that the United States will run the country until there is a “proper transition,” the world is witnessing the sharpest manifestation yet of a generational U.S. foreign policy shift which has been taking shape since Trump returned to the White House last year.

Under the “Trump Corollary” to President James Monroe's 1823 policy that declared the Western Hemisphere a distinct sphere of U.S. influence, removing Maduro from office and seizing control of Venezuela's oil resources are among the latest and greatest geopolitical maneuvers as part of a renewed focus on affairs closer to America's shores, most notably and immediately in the Caribbean Basin.</p>
