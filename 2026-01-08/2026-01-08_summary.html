Rep. Ricki Ruiz said three people in his district alone were detained under this ruse.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers can't enter someone's home without a warrant, but that doesn't stop agents from using tactics to get to people. 

ICE agents have altered license plates and placed Mexican flag stickers on their vehicles to try to lure and detain people, NPR reported. And now, Oregon utilities are taking steps to ensure their customers don't mistake ICE agents for their employees. 

In December, NW Natural, a natural gas utility serving 2 million people in Oregon and southwest Washington, published guidance in seven different languages on how to identify if someone is actually one of their employees. Portland General Electric has similar guidance on its website. 

NW Natural employees wear a uniform and a utility badge that says “contractor,” and they will never ask for immediate access to a customer's home. Its workers usually ask for access to a back or side yard to access a meter, the guidance says. 

NW Natural spokesperson David Roy said the company was made aware of incidents of people posing as utility workers and decided to issue the guidance. 

“We translated the message in order to reach as many individuals and communities as possible,” Roy told the Capital Chronicle. 

Rep. Ricki Ruiz, D-Gresham, said he was already concerned about scammers going door to door taking people's money in his district, but he contacted NW Natural and Portland General Electric in December after hearing that three people in his city were detained after ICE agents posed as utility workers.

“They lured him out of his house, and they took him,” Ruiz said in an interview about the first instance he heard about. 

​​Ruiz represents Oregon's 50th House District, a diverse region that includes parts of East Portland and Gresham. According to census data, more than 16% of Gresham residents were born outside the U.S., and 44% of those residents are from Latin America. 

ICE did not respond to the Capital Chronicle's request for comment.

Oregon, particularly the Portland area, has been at the forefront of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration, especially within the Portland metropolitan area. U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents revealed in court in early December that the federal government brought ICE agents from around the country to Portland as part of what they're calling “Operation Black Rose.” Agents use advanced surveillance technology to locate and detain people, often stopping people in their vehicles and using violence, according to an analysis from Stephen Manning, the executive director of Portland-based immigration law firm Innovation Law Lab. 

As the February 2026 short legislative session approaches, several Democratic lawmakers have indicated they plan to sponsor bills addressing federal immigration enforcement in the state. Ruiz said he will sponsor legislation to support lawsuits against federal agents if they come into a person's home without warrants and a bill to prevent ICE agents from wearing masks. 

“As a state representative, I get the great honor of representing my constituents not only as a Democrat,” Ruiz said. “I represent Republicans. I represent unaffiliated voters and I represent people who can't vote.”

The US is the first country to abandon the landmark UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday withdrew the United States from dozens of international treaties and organizations aimed at promoting cooperation on the world's most pressing issues, including human rights and the worsening climate emergency.

Among the treaties Trump ditched via a legally dubious executive order was the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), making the US — the world's largest historical emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gases — the first country to abandon the landmark agreement.

The US Senate ratified the convention in 1992 by unanimous consent, but lawmakers have repeatedly failed to assert their constitutional authority to stop presidents from unilaterally withdrawing from global treaties.

Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement that “Trump cutting ties with the world's oldest climate treaty is another despicable effort to let corporate fossil fuel interests run our government.”

“Given deeply polarized US politics, it's going to be nearly impossible for the U.S. to rejoin the UNFCCC with a two-thirds majority vote. Letting this lawless move stand could shut the US out of climate diplomacy forever,” Su warned. “Withdrawing from the world's leading climate, biodiversity, and scientific institutions threatens all life on Earth.”

Trump also pulled the US out of the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the UN International Law Commission, the UN Democracy Fund, UN Oceans, and dozens of other global bodies, deeming them “contrary to the interests of the United States.”

The president's move came as he continued to steamroll domestic and international law with an illegal assault on Venezuela and threats to seize Greenland with military force, among other grave abuses.

Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Trump's withdrawal from the world's bedrock climate treaty marks “a new low and yet another sign that this authoritarian, anti-science administration is determined to sacrifice people's well-being and destabilize global cooperation.”

“Withdrawal from the global climate convention will only serve to further isolate the United States and diminish its standing in the world following a spate of deplorable actions that have already sent our nation's credibility plummeting, jeopardized ties with some of our closest historical allies, and made the world far more unsafe,” said Cleetus. “This administration remains cruelly indifferent to the unassailable facts on climate while pandering to fossil fuel polluters.”

Democratic strategists are telling swing district candidates to focus on the economy and to avoid discussing Trump.

Recent statements from political strategists and Democratic Party insiders seem to suggest that the party's strategy for the 2026 midterm races — particularly in hotly contested swing districts —  will be to focus on economic concerns rather than on holding President Donald Trump accountable.

The statements from these strategists, highlighted in a report from The Hill this week, seem to imply that candidates will also avoid candidly discussing the idea of impeaching Trump — a move that has the potential to hurt their chances more than help them, polling data suggests.

“You can't ignore Trump because it's his economy,” one strategist from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) said. “But the top message is the economy and affordability.”

Thirty-nine seats are viewed as competitive by Democrats this year, 28 of which are in districts Trump won by at least 5 points. GOP strategist and never-Trumper Kevin Madden told The Hill he viewed those districts as competitive because the economy resonates with voters in those areas — and implied that voters would dismiss messaging that focuses on holding Trump accountable for his abuses of power as president.

“The core focus of any candidate running in 2026 has to be focused on the reality that these affordability concerns, even one year later, still exist,” Madden said.

Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons seemed to agree. Although he called Trump “an easy foil,” he also said swing district candidates should avoid putting too much focus on him.

“We still have to appeal to the anxiety and aspiration that made people support him because what happens in the course of a year if Trump finds his footing with the American people again?” Simmons said.

The strategy is already being implemented, in a way, by Democrats currently in Congress. In December, around two dozen Democratic members of Congress joined Republicans and voted against advancing a Trump impeachment measure, brought forward by Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who had included in his articles of impeachment the fact that Trump had threatened lawmakers with charges of sedition and the death penalty after they correctly pointed out that military servicemembers can disobey illegal orders from their higher ups or the president.

But avoiding Trump may be impossible, especially since Trump himself is making impeachment an issue for voters.

Speaking to Republicans at a GOP retreat held at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday, Trump told lawmakers up for reelection in November that they had to win to prevent the possibility of a future impeachment vote.

“You've got to win the midterms because, if we don't win the midterms, it's just going to be — I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me,” he said. 

It is possible, of course, for Democrats in these districts to take a two-pronged approach — centering the economy while still campaigning on holding Trump accountable when he disrespects the separation of powers, infringes on people's constitutional rights, or otherwise uses his office to engage in abuses of power.

Polling indicates that voters (both in general and in swing states) are mostly split when it comes to whether or not they want Trump impeached. But the numbers suggest that Democrats shouldn't avoid the issue entirely.

A Data for Progress poll in April, for example, found that a majority of respondents, 52 percent, supported impeaching Trump. (Notably, the poll was conducted just three months into his second term.) Forty-eight percent said they opposed the idea.

Among independent voters, whom Democrats are worried about offending, the split was wider, with 55 percent saying they backed the idea of impeachment and only 44 percent saying they opposed it. 

More recently, a Free Speech for People survey in September, which focused on likely voters in 17 swing districts across the U.S., found plurality support for impeaching Trump, with 49 percent saying they backed the move and 44 percent saying they were opposed. Six percent expressed no opinion.

            A small bloc of Senate Republicans has delivered a notable rebuke of President Donald Trump just days after his operation ousting Venezuela's leader, voting to advance a resolution that would limit future US military force in the nation without Congress' approval.
    


            Five Republicans on Thursday voted with all Senate Democrats to allow a future vote that would limit the president's powers in the deepening conflict with Venezuela — a move that surprised even some Democrats who had not been certain how the GOP votes would fall.
    


            The full measure is expected to pass next week, which would require 51 votes in the Senate. The measure, though, will still need to withstand a full amendment process and support for the final resolution is not guaranteed.
    


            The vote in the Senate had been considered mostly a messaging exercise by Democrats and Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, a co-sponsor of the measure, to force their GOP counterparts to register their discontent over – or support of – an increasingly emboldened White House. But now that it has won over enough Republican votes, it becomes a much more real threat to the reach of Trump's power.
    


            Sens. Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri were the surprise GOP defections to join with Paul, a critic of Trump's overseas military actions, and GOP moderate Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman also surprised his colleagues by voting with his party, despite his public suggestions he may oppose it. After his vote, Fetterman refused to answer questions about why he voted in favor.
    


Trump officials scramble to sell skeptical lawmakers, oil execs on Venezuela plan



            The House will take a similar vote on a measure limiting Trump's authorities to intervene militarily in Venezuela later this month, thanks to a push by House Democrats. If that passes, the two chambers would need to unify their two resolutions — ultimately sending something to Trump's desk for his consideration.
    


            It has been a closely watched vote in both GOP leadership suites and the White House in a week where members of Congress have pressed the administration for answers about its next steps in the widening conflict with Venezuela. It's the second bipartisan resolution to come up in the Senate since November to check the president's powers.
    


            Top Democrats, along with Paul, had been privately pushing Republicans to support the move, amid growing frustration behind the scenes about the president's moves. While Republicans like Speaker Mike Johnson have been clear they believe Trump was within his powers to execute the operation in Venezuela without approval from Congress, not all Republicans agree.
    


            The question of the boundaries of the president's authority – and Congress' role in authorizing military action abroad – has roiled Capitol Hill in recent months as the Trump administration has escalated its military campaign in South America. The operation leading to the ouster and capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro triggered a series of classified briefings in Washington this week that left a partisan split in their wake.
    


            And there have been further questions, including among Republicans, about where Trump might deploy US military forces next, including Cuba, Colombia or Greenland.
    


            Speaking with reporters on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of the vote, Paul emphasized that this resolution is not a referendum on whether or not Maduro was a “bad guy,” but about asserting Congress' right to declare war.
    


            “The debate really isn't about good or evil, bad or good. There's a lot of evil in the world. The question is about who has the power to take the country to war,” he said, later adding, “The Constitution was very clear, and it divides war into two aspects. One is the declaration or initiation of war, that power was given to Congress, and then the execution of the war, the making of the war, was left to the president.”
    


            Paul previously said he had heard from two other Republicans who were considering backing the resolution, increasing its chances for passage.
    


            Kaine had said he had “high hopes and low expectations,” for the vote, and was hopeful they could pull more GOP support after the operation to capture Maduro than they received in November, noting that some of his colleagues had thought Trump was “bluffing.”
    


            “If the first one was premature, and that was an opinion by a number of my colleagues who voted no, this isn't premature,” he added.
    


            Both senators argued that the administration's insistance that the Venezuela operation was a law enforcement effort, with some military support, and not a military operation didn't ring true.
    


            “We're seizing its oil. We've got a military blockade,” said Kaine, “You know, this is, this is not a surgical arrest operation, by any stretch, and that means we got to declare where we are on it.”
    


            However, in a speech on the Senate floor earlier this week, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham countered that Trump did not need congressional consent or approval for capturing Maduro, calling the War Powers Act “patently unconstitutional,” and argued that Congress can push back on extended US involvement in Venezuela through its control over government funding.
    


Analysis: Congressional Republicans are running out of powers to give Trump



            “If you don't want any American boots on the ground, I think you could come forward and pass, through the appropriations process, a prohibition of funds to be used to have American ground forces in Venezuela,” he said. “What we can't do is substitute our judgment for the decision itself,” to use military force.
    


            Kaine also told reporters that senators would be forcing votes to block military action in other nations and territories mentioned by the administration in recent days, including Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Nigeria and Greenland.
    


            Paul said that behind closed doors he hasn't heard any Senate Republican argue that there is a military rationale for using force to capture Greenland, despite the administration refusing to rule it out.
    


            “On Greenland, I just have found no support, and I heard no support within our caucus for introducing troops into Greenland, taking military action, zero support. I've not heard of anybody in the hallways, in the gym, anywhere, I haven't heard one Republican go up to me and say, get it by military force. But I think that loose talk is not just not good, but it's also counterproductive,” he told reporters.
    


            Paul suggested that such points are not coming from senators, saying, “It's from you know, people like [senior White House aide] Stephen Miller, who also ruminated about getting rid of habeas corpus. So that kind of stuff is, should be condemned.”

Jessica Plichta faces misdemeanor charges, which locals say is a tactic of Grand Rapids, Michigan, police to suppress protests

Jessica Plichta was arrested on 3 January after a live interview with a local news station about a Grand Rapids, Michigan, protest against the Trump administration's seizure of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela's president, in an attack with a reported death toll of 100. The clip went immediately viral, racking up millions of views across social media. While the headlines focused on Plichta's age (22) and that she's a preschool teacher, Plichta believes the reason for her arrest – seemingly the only one among roughly 200 protesters – went beyond the day's events.

Plichta, who recently co-founded local group Grand Rapids Opponents of War, which helped organize Saturday's protest, had visited the Venezuelan capital of Caracas just last month, amid the Trump administration's blockade. She was a part of a delegation to the International People's Assembly for Sovereignty and Peace of Our Americas. Activists from dozens of groups planned to attend. But after Trump ordered that Venezuelan airspace be “closed in its entirety” on 29 November, many canceled their trips.

Plichta still attended, visiting communes and meeting with activists there, and claims she even spoke with Maduro.

“I came back to the US, and I've done report-backs. I had spoken at that rally. I gave an interview, and immediately, during the interview, I get shut down and arrested out of 200 people. So what else can you say about that?” Plichta said.

Plichta is now facing misdemeanor charges of “obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command from a police officer”, according to local outlet 13 On Your Side. Emerson Wolf, co-director of Grand Rapids' Institute for Global Education and chair of Palestine Solidarity Grand Rapids, said this is an established tactic of Grand Rapids police to suppress local protests and protesters.

Last March, Wolf spoke at a local International Women's Day event; the next month, as they were preparing to lead the local Hands Off! protest, they were arrested with the same charge as Plichta over the previous action.

“If it's truly about the safety of people executing their sacred free speech rights in the streets of Grand Rapids, then why doesn't [the Grand Rapids police department] arrest protesters right away, or do more to help encourage the safety of protesters downtown? Instead, they issue citations months later in order to criminalize dissent,” said Wolf.

Amid yesterday's ICE killing of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, thousands have taken to the streets in cities across the US to demonstrate. “First, they arrest us on camera, and then they shoot us in the streets,” Wolf said of protesters. “This is unacceptable. We're living in a nightmare right now, and it's time for us to be escalating against this sort of brutality.”

Wolf said they had been following the anti-war movement since they were a teenager during the Iraq war; Plichta has been organizing for about two years. Both feel strongly that the Trump administration's actions in Venezuela were a five-alarm fire for international politics writ large.

“We do not want war. We do not want the US to escalate its attacks on Venezuela. We don't want our friends and family to have to fight a rich man's war for oil,” Plichta said.

Despite attempts at protest suppression across the US under the Trump administration, Plichta is undeterred. “I've seen a comment [that] ‘there's now going to be 1,000 Jessicas with this'. It's not about me or my name,” Plichta said. “So many people are going to be coming out more and more. When you try to suppress the movement, all it does is radicalize those who stand against needless war.”

Said Wolf: “If they don't want us marching in the streets, how else do they expect us to voice our opinions?”

            Jennifer Garner is fully aware that some people are impressed with how she successfully co-parents with her ex-husband Ben Affleck, but it's not because she read it in a tabloid.
    


            In a newly published interview with Marie Claire UK, the actress promoted the second series of her Apple hit thriller “The Last Thing He Told Me” and talked about the lessons the past decade taught her.
    


            One thing is that she “protects her peace by refusing to engage with tabloid coverage.”
    


            “It doesn't serve me to take in gossip about myself or anyone else, much less my kids, so I don't do it,” Garner said.
    


            She shares three children with Affleck: Violet born in 2005, Seraphina born in 2009, and Samuel born in 2012.
    


            The couple married in June 2005 and confirmed their split in 2015, a day after their 10th wedding anniversary. 



            More than 20 years later, they continue to make headlines whenever spotted together, including last year, a month after he settled his divorce with Jennifer Lopez and Affleck and Garner reunited for son Samuel's birthday party.
    


            Affleck is on the same page as Garner about tabloids.
    


            “We used to have a thing, my ex-wife and I, when they would see something on a supermarket stand,” he told GQ last year. “We would say, ‘Well, you know this isn't always true because if it were, you would have 15 brothers or sisters or whatever the number of stories is where they said that your mom was pregnant.'”
    


            While the former couple are in a good place now, that wasn't always the case.
    


            “You have to be smart about what you can and can't handle, and I could not handle what was out there,” she told Marie Claire UK.
    


            But what was out in the public sphere was not the most difficult part, Garner said.
    


            “The fact of it is what was hard,” she said. “The actual breaking up of a family is what was hard. Losing a true partnership and friendship is what was hard.”
    


            The new season of “The Last Thing He Told Me” is scheduled to drop on Apple TV+ on February 20.

            Protests fueled by crippling economic conditions have swept across Iran's provinces, as authorities revert to their tested playbook of cracking down without offering viable solutions to grievances driving public anger.
    


            Millions of Iranians are grappling with rampant inflation and a plummeting currency, as thousands took to the streets in demonstrations that turned violent after the deployment of government security forces.
    


            What began last month as organized protests in Tehran's bazaars and universities has gradually spread to cities nationwide. Experts said the leaderless and uncoordinated movement turned violent as economic protests intertwined with political ones.
    


            “This feels different because it's about the people's buying power and people really can't afford anything,” said a 30-year-old Tehran resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Prices keep going up almost hour-by-hour at this point, but how it ends no one really knows. … Everyone feels worried.”
    


            When shopkeepers in the narrow streets of Tehran's Grand Bazaar protested the government's failing economic policies last week, their chants rattled the regime.
    


            Exacerbating the situation, the central bank decision last week to end a program allowing some importers to access cheaper US dollars compared to the rest of the market – a decision that led shopkeepers to increase prices.
    


            Prices of basic goods like cooking oil and chicken dramatically spiked overnight and some products vanished all together. The volatility pushed the bazaaris to close shop, a drastic measure for a group traditionally supportive of the Islamic Republic.
    


            After days of protests and crackdown, the reformist-ruled government attempted to alleviate the pressure by offering direct cash handouts – almost $7 per month, saying at the same time that it alone cannot solve the crisis.
    


            “We should not expect the government to handle all of this alone,” President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a televised speech Monday.
    


            Iranian provinces as far west as Ilam, a Kurdish-majority region bordering Iraq, and Lorestan, have emerged as restive hotspots. Fueled by ethnic division and poverty, crowds set fire to the streets and chanted “Death to Khamenei,” directly challenging Iran's Supreme Leader, who holds ultimate authority over the nation's religious and state affairs.
    


            The city became a focal point this week after wounded protesters were taken to a hospital, only for security forces to subsequently raid the facility and arrest them in an incident that sparked widespread condemnation from human rights groups and prompted the government to promise an investigation.
    


            Iranian state affiliated Fars news agency said 950 police forces and 60 personnel from the paramilitary Basij force have been injured in the protests mostly in confrontations with “rioters” in western provinces “equipped with firearms, grenades, and weapons.”
    


            People in more than 100 cities have taken to the streets since demonstrations began 11 days ago, including the capital Tehran.
    


            At least 38 people have been killed and over 2,000 arrested in the ensuing crackdown, human rights organizations based outside Iran claimed. CNN could not independently verify the numbers of those killed and arrested, and Iranian state news organizations have sometimes reported individual deaths without reporting a comprehensive tally.
    


            The ongoing protests are the biggest since the large scale and deadly protests that were sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the religious police in 2022.
    


            This time, the bazaaris, a powerful force for change in Iran's history and one that is seen as loyal to the regime, began the protests.
    


            The enduring alliance between the bazaaris and the clergy in Iran had the shopkeepers play a crucial role as kingmaker across Iran's history. It was their support to those very clergymen that eventually helped the Islamic Revolution of 1979 succeed, giving the rebels a financial backbone that led to the fall of the Shah, or monarch.
    


            “For more than 100 years of Iranian history, bazaaris have been key actors in all of Iran's major political movements. … Many observers do believe that the bazaaris are some of the most loyal to the Islamic Republic,” said Arang Keshavarzian, associate professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies at New York University and author of “Bazaar and State in Iran,” told CNN.
    


            Their role as a major political force has since become more symbolic, but the impact of fluctuations in currency on their business is what led them to spark the protests that have since turned deadly.
    


            Authorities have also sought to differentiate between economic protesters and those calling for regime change, branding the latter as “rioters” and foreign backed “mercenaries” while pledging a tougher crackdown against them.
    


            The exiled son of Iran's former monarch, Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi has positioned himself as a viable alternative to the ruling regime, declaring support for the protests and issuing direct calls for coordinated nationwide action. Pro-monarchy chants have been heard in videos from the demonstrations, though the extent of monarchist support across the country remains unclear.
    


            The current protests also take place under rising foreign threats. Just six months ago, Israel and the United States launched attacks on Iran for the first time, with US President Donald Trump raising the prospects of new attacks just last week, just days after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            During his campaign, Pezeshkian positioned himself as a champion of the working class, promising economic relief through reduced government intervention in the currency market while also blaming US sanctions, corruption, and excessive money printing.
    


            But corruption across all parts of government, mismanagement of funds and the convergence of environmental problems and stagnant leadership has the government on the brink.
    


            More than a year after he was voted in, the very working class he vowed to protect and the middle class that form the backbone of the Iranian society, are struggling.
    


            External factors like crippling sanctions and a potential new war with the United States and Israel, has left the state paranoid, and the population anxious.
    


            The ongoing protest are the biggest public challenge to the regime since the 12-day war with Israel in June, and since Iranians demonstrated the killing of Mahsa Amini, the young woman who was arrested for not abiding by the dress code, the state now struggles to provide any tangible steps that could prevent an eventual complete dysfunction.
    


            Experts say that without a viable alternative to the current ruling system, protests are unlikely to instigate regime change, yet the widespread unrest underscores the profound crises confronting Iran's government.
    


            “None of Iran's political leaders have a blueprint to get Iran out the crises,” Keshavarzian told CNN.
    


            “The only tool that the Islamic Republic truly has left is coercion and force. People have tried different methods to air their views,” he added. “But over the past 15 years large segments of the population have lost trust in the regime and don't believe they are able and willing to actually listen to them and address their grievances and interests,” he said.

A new anthology marking the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's murder aims to stir action against white supremacy.

Emmett Till is someone that we know through documentaries, writings, photos, and inadequate history lessons. Open Casket: Philosophical Meditations on the Lynching of Emmett Till draws us unsettlingly and lovingly close to Emmett Till, and to his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley. George Yancy's and A. Todd Franklin's breathtaking new anthology brings us face-to-face with the disquieting sorrow of Black death, and the unsettling reality that Emmett Till does not rest in peace.

Published to mark the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death, Open Casket is a potent reminder that bearing witness to the horrors of white supremacy is a historically rooted collective grieving process that has particular resonances for Black people — and anyone with a moral conscience. Each essay upends the attempted erasure of the horrors wrought on a Black 14-year-old child by white adult men and the system designed to protect them. This collection raises questions that complicate our thinking about Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley, victimhood, the politics of refusal, Black maternal militancy, Black agency, and more.

This book attests that for Black people living in an anti-Black society, our mourning and mournability are part of our story, but they are not the full story. Readers are invited to bear witness and tarry with Mamie Till-Mobley as she rejects suggestions to keep her only child's funeral private and hidden from public view. Her act of Black maternal resistance connects us to the slave ship and bridges the gap between 1955 Jim Crow Mississippi and today.

While it rigorously interrogates the past, Open Casket illuminates the present with unflinching and piercing insight. The text unfolds with profound clarity and care. While many people have moved on because they can, our collective psychological and emotional wounds remain tender. We see ourselves in Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley precisely because we know that no amount of Black suffering and Black death has been enough to unsettle white supremacy.

Yancy and Franklin's book is conceptually rich, and analytically sharp. It honors Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley by calling on all of us to see and to act.In the interview that follows the authors discuss the psychological terror of Emmett Till's murder, the politics of Black maternal grief, unmasking the grotesque as a process of truth-telling, bearing witness, and more. Open Caskett honors Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley by inviting us to engage with death and grief as communal, political, and philosophical processes while stirring us toward action.

Kim Wilson: Todd, you write about Mamie-Till Mobley's strength and the unbearable pain that she must have felt when she saw what white racists did to her son, Emmet (aka Bobo, Bo). Can you say more about the collective psychological weight that Emmett's murder has placed on communities that claim him? Relatedly, how does the book help to complicate our thinking about the strength required by Mamie Till-Mobley, and by extension, all Black mothers that have had their children stolen from them by white supremacy? 

A. Todd Franklin: The image chosen for the book's cover speaks volumes about the psychological weight carried in the aftermath of Emmett Till's murder. In one sense, it offers a meditation on erasure. There is a mother, and there are images of a mother and her son; and yet, the son himself is not there — in his stead is a casket. As framed, he has been physically taken from us, much as our children and loved ones are taken from our own communities by the violence of white supremacy.

What remains visible is the pain of such loss. The image also foregrounds the psychological terror of being susceptible to erasure: Insofar as one can look at the images inside the casket and see oneself, one confronts the terrifying prospect of sharing in Emmett's demise. Powerfully, though, the image also frames a refusal to be nullified. Emmett was more than a victim of white supremacist violence — he was a beloved son, and the image viscerally captures and relays his being as such in virtue of both the photographic evidence on display in his casket and the gut-wrenching reaction of his mother as she is forced to grapple with him lying in it.

Such juxtapositions were not there by accident. Mamie Till-Mobley expressly chose to have her son publicly lie in repose in an open casket so as to complicate and confound the white supremacist logics that led to his murder. In doing so, she exemplified an unparalleled strength and determination to refuse to allow that which took his life to rob him of rightful regard for his human dignity. Many Black mothers, yourself included, find similarly challenging ways to complicate and confound the white supremacist logics, practices, and systems that continue to rob us of our children.

This is a book that merits care-full reading. I found myself putting it down every few pages to make room for the feelings that arose. I wanted to honor the space between the task at hand (reading the book), and a mother's piercing call for us to see what they did to her beautiful son. What insights do the contributors offer us into understanding the relationship between private and public grief?

Franklin: I'm grateful that you centered care. Indeed, the call is to read this text with care — not simply with sympathy, but with resolve. Put plainly, it is a call to care enough to act, individually and collectively, in ways that press society to acknowledge and confront anti-Black racism. Many contributors underscore the way the public grief of a racial community besieged by white supremacist violence emerges from a heart-wrenching private grief that extraordinary individuals like Mamie Till-Mobley refuse to be undone by. Instead, she — and others like her — belong to a long tradition of Black maternal figures and other Black folk who rise from the depths of despair to creatively transform their grief into emotionally charged and intellectually compelling airings of their grievances against the subjects and systems that trespass against us.

Black suffering is largely dismissed in the white public imagination. By putting Emmett's battered body on display, Mamie Till-Mobley was able to not only publicly condemn white womanhood, white lies, and whiteness in general — she challenged the nothingness of Black life and rewrote the course of history. We all know who Emmett Till was. Few of us remember the names of the white people involved in his torture and death. We are in a moment in history where we are being politically collectively gaslit by people that want to erase America's history of racial violence (arguably this has always been the case). What does truth-telling look like for us right now in light of Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley?

Franklin: Mamie Till-Mobley made history — she rendered present, and ever-present, both her son and the horror that took him from her. She made Emmett matter in a way that disrupted the callous ease with which Black life, and the taking of Black life, are too often consigned to oblivion.

Following in her wake, truth telling becomes a matter of unmasking the grotesque. Many looked at Emmett and saw a grotesque face. Yet truth be told, there were many white faces — “beautiful” and “manly” — that masked a far deeper grotesqueness. Those hidden behind such faces were grotesque in their very being. Today, there are many like them: Some wear makeup and serve as broadcasters, some wear uniforms and badges, some wear dark suits and red ties, and all impugn and imperil Black people under the guise of serving and protecting what they “rightly,” or rather “whitely,” take to be the nation's interests.

George, in the introduction to the book, you draw a distinction between bearing witness and being a spectator. Can you explain the difference, and help us understand how Mamie Till-Mobley's decision to let the world see what she saw transformed the process of bearing witness into a political act?

George Yancy: That distinction became important to me as I thought about Saidiya V. Hartman's text, Scenes of Subjection, where she warns against confusing indignation in response to seeing brutalized Black bodies with a form of voyeurism or fascination regarding the assault and dehumanization of Black bodies. Spectatorship, for me, can function as a form of voyeuristic pleasure, a form of Black trauma porn. Think here of those white spectators during the lynching of Black bodies. Those sites were treated as picnics, where white people came to “confirm” and “justify” their white being, their “sacred” white humanity. They were sites of a white libidinal economy where forms of white perverse pleasure and white phobias were animated. To truly bear witness to such anti-Black horror, however, is to carry the near impossible weight of that trauma, which involves a profound sense of vulnerability and shared suffering. It is a way of communicating and communing with the Black dead and dying that says, “We see you, we testify on your behalf, and we will help to carry you.” Through the open casket, Mamie Till-Mobley invites Black people to see the grotesquerie of anti-Blackness, while also loving the young beautiful Black boy, Emmett Till. And all of this, for Mamie, had to be done publicly. That public mode of bearing witness implicated and indicted the United States regarding its terrible and ugly history of gratuitous violence against Black people. The power of the collective loving Black gaze, and its refusal to look away from the results of the lie of American white “innocence,” is the political act.

For Black people living in a white supremacist settler colonial heteropatriarchal society, death is always proximate, looming, and ever-present in our lives. The ways that we are socialized to relate to death in the U.S. only reinforce our alienation from death, but not the dead. As a Black mother to Black adult children, two of whom are currently sentenced to life in prison, death is something that I think about often — more than it is healthy to do so, but not more than I believe that we (Black people) think about it, even if we never disclose our fears. Many, arguably most of us, are in a perpetual state of mourning for both the living and the dead. You write, “As I see it, Black death is, as it were, a suture that helps to protect the quotidian health of whiteness.” Can you say more about this? 

Yancy: I appreciate your vulnerability, Kim. I feel you, and I bear witness to your Black maternal love and how it is painfully entangled with both Black physical and social death. I am reminded of Claudia Rankine, who writes, “Dead blacks are a part of normal life here. Dying in ship hulls, tossed into the Atlantic, hanging from trees, beaten, shot in churches, gunned down by the police or warehoused in prisons.” Black people are a death-bound people, but not because we are simply human and finite. It is because death is right there as we jog, as we shop, as we drive, as we sleep in our own homes, and as we attempt to be in a country that is hegemonically white and structurally anti-Black. This is not to deny that white people are not aware of processes of death and dying, but death haunts our Blackness because our “right to life” has never felt like an untarnishable political axiom or an undeniably upheld moral imperative in this country. I am familiar with the powerful and constant sense of mourning that you speak of. It is not enough that we mourn the murder of, say, George Floyd. We also mourn our living Black children who are always on the precipice of being killed, that is, who are always killable because of their Blackness, and whose Black flesh is always exposed to bullets fired from guns in the hands of those who are said to serve and protect. This reality dialectically affirms the existential value of white life. In other words, white people move through the world, because they are white, with effortless grace. They jog, shop, and drive with effortless grace, because death, which always hovers near Black life, secures their life, their very being, and provides for them psychic coherence and protection against the constant anguish that I experience as I fear that my Black children may not return home alive.               

Black suffering has never been enough to persuade white people to dismantle white supremacy. But the power in what Mamie Till-Mobley did was to center Black people in a conversation about Black people, even if white people looked on. Her decision was an act of creative resistance. Can you help us contextualize this within the Black Radical Tradition?

Yancy: Part of the problem is that Black death secures the fiction of white supremacy and white innocence, and yet, paradoxically, Black life also secures the fiction of white supremacy and white innocence. In both cases, Black bodies function as the ontologically abject. This is a case where Black abjection metabolizes whiteness, reinforcing its power, privilege, and mythical standing as the apex of humanity. Hence, whether dead or alive, Black bodies are ungrievable. Part of that dismantlement will begin once white people — as James Baldwin made clear in his interview with Kenneth Clark in 1963 — “try to find out, in their own hearts, why it was necessary to have a ‘nigger' in the first place.” In asking/facing that question, perhaps white people will understand the poisonous emptiness that is whiteness. But that is the responsibility of white people, not ours. However, it is our responsibility, despite the near impossible odds, to resist. In Black Marxism, Cedric J. Robinson points out that indicative of the Black Radical Tradition is the sense that as Black people we obtain freedom on our own terms. This is what Mamie Till-Mobley did according to her own revolutionary love and resistance. This is what Malcolm X did as he spoke truth plainly about anti-Blackness in the U.S. and European colonization in Africa. It is what Ida B. Wells did in her anti-lynching crusade, even though a bounty was placed on her head. Speaking about the logics of the Black Radical Tradition and its resistance to white forms of domination, Robinson points to the importance of “the continuing development of a collective consciousness informed by the historical struggles for liberation and motivated by the shared sense of obligation to preserve the collective being, the ontological totality.” This quote speaks to Mamie Till-Mobley's effort to mobilize a sense of Black collectivity despite the violent effacement (literally, to remove the face) of Till's humanity. As Black people looked at and looked beyond such unconscionable cruelty, they were able to express an ontological totality, a sense of collective humanity, that refused to be limited by the malicious structure of whiteness.    

I'm grateful to you both for taking up the intellectual work of helping us all to see more clearly. I see the emotional labor that went into this volume. That work is visible to those of us who resist, organize, and fight like hell against the dehumanizing systems that want us to believe that we don't matter (ontological nullity). I'll speak for myself, as a Black mother, of Black adult children — who deeply identifies with every Black mother that has lost children (even if they are still living), thank you for this work. You remind us in so many words that our children matter, that we matter, that we have always mattered to each other! What do you want people to think of when they think about Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley?

Franklin: This was a project neither of us wanted to undertake, but both of us recognized that it was one we had to. Socially, politically, and personally, it captures what is most important to us — the affirmation of Black humanity and the effort to build a world consonant with it. Our hope is that through these poignant and wide-ranging philosophical reflections on this fateful Black mother and son, readers will see the power of refusing to be rendered unseen or silent.

To read this book is to engage in an act of collective grief. I was very much aware that I had to attend to the grief that I was feeling, even if that awareness did not shield me from the feelings I held. A therapist friend reminds me that under oppressive systems we don't live dignified lives, and that we deserve dignified deaths. But I wonder, where is the dignity in being unjustly killed? Can we reclaim, or perhaps, less ambitiously, claim dignity in the wake of horror? This book is a good place to contemplate these questions.

Franklin: Far too many Black people, like young Emmett, have been robbed of the opportunity to die dignified deaths. But the manner of death should never be mistaken for a measure of the dignity inherent in being human, or in being interwoven within a community that holds one lovingly. If nothing else, this volume invites readers to contemplate what it means to truly and fully see our own lovingly in what too often proves to be a loveless world. As you rightly note, this work is emotionally taxing — and no less so in moments like this, when we speak about it publicly. For us it is often a matter of trying to steady ourselves and hold enough of our composure to carry the conversation through. Here, however, we both lost it when you said you were shattered.

We are with you!

We both shed tears with you, and we hope readers understand that the work is not simply about claiming those violently claimed by the horrors of white supremacy, but also an act of claiming those shattered by it and left to piece together the shards in ways that forge a mirror that foregrounds a community fully committed to demanding the human dignity we are due against the background of a social world that offers us so little.

The banality of horror in our lives is precisely what obscures those horrors that are closest to us, and renders illegible (and often, invisible) the horrors that are often right under our noses. I draw parallels between the way those men terrorized Emmett that night, and my sons being sentenced to life in prison. I fight the comparisons, and at the risk of being misunderstood for admitting this, I see the way that white supremacy structures all of our lives. When I look at my sons, I see the boys they were, the stolen years that we can never reclaim, and the systematic destruction of their hearts, minds, and bodies. No, it's not the same, but there is a shared horror. I see, in a way that I believe this book wants me to see, the glaring similarities between the slow death of incarceration and the excruciatingly torturous, and not swift enough death of Emmett, Mamie Till-Mobley's son. I'm shattered!!! How does the book help us to understand Black motherhood and the politics of claiming?

Yancy: I think that the book encourages readers to understand that Black pain and suffering are both quotidian (as in anti-Black microassaults and microinvalidations) and spectacular (as in a public lynching). But given the history and pervasiveness of anti-Blackness, perhaps it can all be described as quotidian: routines of white bloodlust. Kim, you're not being misunderstood at all. Black forms of death and dying ravage both the Black body and the souls of Black folk whether this is on the streets (Eric Garner), in a barn (Emmett Till), or in prison (your sons). White supremacy is like a Leviathan, and its monstrous reach is unavoidable. And it existentially and psychically shatters Black lives. The book speaks directly to Black motherhood by focusing on Mamie's courage and daring, but not through the prism of romanticization. Those of us who are cisgender Black fathers, we can't give birth to Black sons. Black mothers feel that ever faint kick of love from the inside, from the matrix of their bodies. It is that mode of intimacy that inflects the pain of loss, the anguish of having one's Black child held captive by systems of oppression. In this case, Black sons are already claimed through the warmth and protection of the Black womb. That is both unspeakably beautiful and yet tragic. Why tragic? Because that intimacy is under threat by an anti-Black system that doesn't give a damn about your womb or the thriving life within it. So, the precarity of Black life begins in utero. In this case, Black women, from the beginning of pregnancy, are intimately and silently laying claim to their Black bodies and their Black babies. Our book honors the revolutionary acts of political claiming enacted by Black women from the past, in the present, and in the future.

MOSCOW, January 8. /TASS/. Moscow calls on Washington to adhere to the rule of law and immediately cease illegal actions against the oil tanker Marinera, according to a statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry.

"We call on Washington to resume compliance with the fundamental norms and principles of international maritime navigation and immediately cease its illegal actions against the Marinera and other vessels engaged in law·abiding activities on the high seas," the ministry said.

"We reiterate our demand that the US ensure humane and dignified treatment of the Russian citizens comprising the tanker's crew, strictly observe their rights and interests, and make no obstacles to their prompt return to their homeland," the Foreign Ministry added.

 

US knew the owner

 

The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed "serious concern" over the US military's use of force against the oil tanker.

"The Marinera, which on December 24 received temporary permission to sail under the Russian flag in accordance with international law and Russian legislation, was peacefully transiting international waters in the North Atlantic, heading for one of Russia's ports," the ministry said. "The US government has repeatedly received reliable information, including from the Russian Foreign Ministry, about the ship's Russian origin and its civilian status. They could not have had any doubts about this, just as there were and are no grounds for arguing that the tanker was sailing ‘without a flag' or ‘under a false flag.'"

"Russia did not give consent to these actions. On the contrary, it lodged an official protest with the US government regarding the pursuit of the Marinera by a US Coast Guard vessel over the past several weeks, insisting on the immediate cessation of these activities and the withdrawal of the unlawful demands made on the Russian ship's captain," the ministry said.

 

Violation of international law

 

Under these circumstances, US military personnel boarding a civilian vessel on the high seas and effectively seizing it, as well as capturing its crew, "can only be viewed as a gross violation of the basic principles and norms of international maritime law and freedom of navigation."

 

Illegal sanctions

 

Moscow considers the US references to its national "sanctions legislation" to be unfounded.

"Unilateral restrictive measures by the US, as well as other Western countries, are illegitimate and cannot justify attempts to establish jurisdiction and, even more so, to seize ships on the high seas," the ministry said. "The statements by some US officials that the seizure of the Marinera is part of a broader strategy to establish Washington's unlimited control over Venezuela's natural resources are extremely cynical. We strongly reject such neo-colonialist tendencies," the ministry concluded.

MOSCOW, January 8. /TASS/. The document on "security guarantees" prepared by the Western calition of the willing together with Kiev is far from a plan for a peaceful settlement and is aimed at continued militarization, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

"On January 6 in Paris, participants in the so-called coalition of the willing, led by the UK and France, signed a declaration with the Kiev regime entitled Robust Security Guarantees for a Solid and Lasting Peace," Zakharova said in a comment. "This document is far from a peaceful settlement plan. It is aimed not at achieving lasting peace and security, but at continued militarization, escalation, and the expansion of the conflict."

According to her, the key provision of the document is "the deployment of certain ‘multinational forces' on Ukrainian territory." She said coalition members intend to form these forces in order to assist in the "restoration" of the Ukrainian army and ensure the "containment" of Russia after the end of hostilities.

BRUSSELS, January 8. /TASS/. Amid US President Donald Trump's increasingly harsh rhetoric about establishing control over Greenland, the European Union is preparing for a direct confrontation with the US leader, according to Politico Europe.

"We must be ready for a direct confrontation with Trump," an EU diplomat briefed on ongoing discussions told the newspaper. "He is in an aggressive mode, and we need to be geared up," he added.

The newspaper notes that while European governments previously did not realize the seriousness of Trump's threats, they now understand them and are "desperately searching for a plan to stop him."

Trump has repeatedly stated that Greenland should join the US. He did not rule out the use of force to resolve the issue in an interview with NBC News in early May 2025.

On January 6, the White House, in a written statement provided to Reuters, commented on plans regarding Greenland, stressing that "of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal," meaning it is available to Trump.

In turn, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified on January 7 that Trump is actively discussing the possibility of purchasing Greenland with his subordinates.

President Volodymyr Zelensky urged additional pressure from the United States on Jan. 7 to help achieve a peace deal in Ukraine in the coming months, jokingly evoking calls for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov to suffer the same fate as captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

"(The Americans) must put pressure on Russia. They have the tools; they know how to do it. And when they really want to, they can find a way," Zelensky told reporters.

"Here is an example with Maduro, right? They carried out an operation... Everyone sees the result — the whole world. They did it quickly. Let them carry out some kind of operation with this — what's his name — Kadyrov. With this murderer. Maybe then (Russian President) Putin will see it and think twice," Zelensky joked.

Zelensky's quip comes just days after the U.S. carried out a large-scale attack on Venezuela, an ally of Moscow, with the stated goals of effecting regime change and seizing control of the country's oil reserves. Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife were captured and brought to the U.S., where they have been indicted on narcoterrorism conspiracy and other charges.

Kadyrov, a ruthless strongman who has referred to himself as "Putin's foot soldier" has ruled the pro-Kremlin Chechen Republic since 2007. Under his leadership, the Chechnya has become known as one of the most dangerous parts of the world, infamous for forced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings.

The U.S. and other Western allies have imposed sanctions against Kadyrov and his family over human rights abuses in Chechnya.

The comments come as U.S.-led peace talks continue to unfold despite increased tensions between Russia and the U.S., sharpened by Washington's military operation in Venezuela, Moscow's ally, and Russia's refusal to cease hostilities in Ukraine.

Zelensky said earlier in the day that peace "negotiations have reached a new milestone together with our European partners and, of course, the United States," sharing his belief that Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine could be brought to an end in the first half of 2026.

More than 1 million people in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast remained without water and heating as of the morning of Jan. 8, Communities and Territories Development Minister Oleksii Kuleba said.

Anka Feldhusen, the German ambassador from 2019-2023, replaces Canadian Roman Washchuk, who led the Business Ombudsman Council from December 2021-2025. 







The DeepState monitoring group reported on the evening of Jan. 7 that Andriivka was back under Russian control.

"We understand that the American side will engage with Russia, and we expect feedback on whether the aggressor is genuinely willing to end the war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The loan will help state-owned Ukrhydroenergo purchase stockpiles of critical supplies, replacements for equipment damaged by Russian attacks, as well as to refurbish and modernize old equipment. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has approved moving forward with a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill, opening the door for a potential Senate vote as early as next week, according to Senator Lindsey Graham.

"The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.

"This will allow us to build the 'Dream Military' that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us safe and secure, regardless of foe," Donald Trump said on Truth Social.



Russia appealed to the U.S. to halt the pursuit and reportedly dispatched a submarine and other vessels to escort the tanker before it was boarded by U.S. forces.

The report follows an agreement reached in December 2025 by EU countries to ban Russian gas imports beginning Jan. 1, 2028, with LNG imports set to be prohibited at the start of 2027.

The ICE agent who fatally shot a woman during an altercation in Minneapolis in the US state of Minnesota on Wednesday was acting in self-defense, US President Donald Trump has said.

According to video of the incident, an immigration agent attempted to open the door of an SUV driven by Renee Good and fired multiple shots when she tried to drive away.

While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged that Good had attempted to ram ICE officers with the car, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey dismissed that version of events as “bullsh**t.”

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump backed ICE officers. “I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,” Trump wrote.

“The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” he added.

The president blamed the incident on members of the “radical left” targeting ICE agents. “We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!” he wrote.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told reporters that Good's vehicle was blocking a road when federal agents approached her. “The vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired,” he said.

Good's mother, Donna Ganger, denied that her daughter was involved in anti-ICE protests. “She was probably terrified,” Ganger told the Minnesota Star Tribune. “Renee was one of the kindest people I've ever known,” she said.

Trump launched a crackdown on illegal immigration after returning to the White House in January 2025, vowing to carry out the largest deportation effort in American history. Democrats have denounced ICE raids in US cities as an abuse of power and scapegoating of migrants.

With former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro awaiting trial in federal custody in New York City on narco-terrorism charges and U.S. President Donald Trump vowing that the United States will run the country until there is a “proper transition,” the world is witnessing the sharpest manifestation yet of a generational U.S. foreign policy shift which has been taking shape since Trump returned to the White House last year.

Under the “Trump Corollary” to President James Monroe's 1823 policy that declared the Western Hemisphere a distinct sphere of U.S. influence, removing Maduro from office and seizing control of Venezuela's oil resources are among the latest and greatest geopolitical maneuvers as part of a renewed focus on affairs closer to America's shores, most notably and immediately in the Caribbean Basin.

Live Updates


            • Tensions flared in the Minneapolis area, as protesters and law enforcement clashed this morning after an ICE agent fatally shot a woman yesterday. Pepper balls were fired toward a crowd of demonstrators outside a federal building, with agents also deploying a gas-like substance.
    


• The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it was forced to withdraw from investigating the shooting after the FBI took control of the case. Gov. Tim Walz urged that “Minnesota must be part of this investigation.”
    


            • Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the agent, saying the woman — identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good — tried to run over the officer. State and local officials disputed claims that the shooting was done in self-defense. Homeland Security officials have privately expressed shock over the department's immediate response.
    


            • Multiple videos of the shooting reviewed by CNN show nuance, and exactly what took place before the shooting remains unclear.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke about a person who he said was outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building on Thursday “with the intent to antagonize” protesters and used a bullhorn to “scream at them.”
    


            He urged the community to not “allow that to be a catalyst to create violence.”
    


            “Our respect for the First Amendment means we will expect and respect all opinions. If this individual is there expressing support for ICE? That's their constitutional right to do so, and they need to be protected,” the governor said.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged people protesting to not to “lash out” at protests, and to continue to practice “peaceful civil disobedience.”
    


            “When I saw yesterday some of the anger — whether it's Minneapolis police, Minnesota State Patrol, Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, Minnesota National Guard — they are there to protect and serve, as it's said. They are there to protect Minnesotans,” the governor said at a Thursday news conference.
    


            “Throwing your anger at them only inflames this situation,” he added.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “t feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome” following yesterday's fatal shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.
    


                    “And I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment. From the President to the Vice President, to Kristi Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,” he said.
                





            “When Kristi Noem was judge, jury and executioner yesterday, that's very, very difficult to think that there were going to be fair,” the governor added later.
    


            Vice President JD Vance will join White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt for a briefing on Thursday centered on Wednesday's fatal shooting involving an ICE officer, a White House official told CNN.
    


            In the hours since the shooting, Vance has vehemently defended the federal officer who fired the gun as acting in self-defense.
    


            “This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job,” Vance wrote Thursday on social media, referencing Renee Nicole Good, the 37-year-old woman who was killed when the ICE agent shot into her vehicle during an encounter. “When he approached her car, she tried to hit him. A tragedy? Absolutely. But a tragedy that falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with.”
    


            “Minnesota must be part of this investigation,” Gov. Tim Walz said about the investigation of Wednesday's fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent, referring to state's claim that federal investigators excluded the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from participating in the probe.
    


            The BCA has “non-partisan career professionals that have spent years building the trust of the community,” Walz told reporters in a Thursday news conference.
    


            “There's a BCA force investigations unit that was created by the legislature by the people of Minnesota to provide an independent, consistent, and trusted mechanism for investigating the use of force incidents involving law enforcement officers,” Walz said.
    


            “I will continue to press that we be part of the investigation, that we do the investigation, so that Minnesotans can trust what the outcome is,” Walz said.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is now addressing reporters. His office said this would be a public safety update following the shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a federal ICE agent.
    


 Immigration and Customs Enforcement “took a pause” from operations in Minneapolis yesterday afternoon following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, but the agency is now “back to doing our law enforcement mission,” ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons told Fox News this morning.
    


            “We took a pause yesterday afternoon after that deadly shooting … to check on our staff and our officers (at) the scene, making sure everything was secure. But we were back in the fight more than an hour later,” Lyons told Fox News when asked whether ICE was back on Minneapolis streets.
    


            Lyons expressed sympathy for everyone involved in the shooting, but said it was “avoidable,” and that the public “should not interfere with a law enforcement operation.”
    


            The ICE officer who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good yesterday has 10 years of experience with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's enforcement and removal operations, a senior Homeland Security Official tells CNN.
    


            Enforcement and Removal Operations is the branch of ICE that deals specifically with the arrest and deportation of undocumented immigrants. Of that branch, the officer was part of the special response team, the Homeland Security Official said.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she is “not opposed to sending more” immigration authorities to Minneapolis following yesterday's fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.
    


            “I'm not opposed to sending more, if necessary, to keep people safe,” Noem said  Thursday at a news conference in New York City.
    


            When asked about the ICE agent who shot into the vehicle of Renee Nicole Good, Noem said he is an experienced officer “who served a number of years.” She declined to provide more information.
    


            Officials including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have called for ICE agents to leave the Twin Cities area.
    


            Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told CNN he is trying to figure out who he “can get on the phone with and persuade to reverse this poor decision,” referring to the state's claim that federal investigators excluded a state agency from investigating Wednesday's fatal ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis.
    


            “What I have seen is deeply disturbing and there is sufficient basis for further investigation and potential charges,” Ellison said of the case. “There's basis to move forward. There's basis to, at some point, present it to a prosecuting authority to make it to charging.”
    


            The slain woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was playing the role of “legal observing” and not interfering at the time of her interaction with ICE, Ellison said.
    


            The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said it “reluctantly” withdrew from investigating the fatal ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis after the FBI told the agency the US Attorney's Office “had reversed course” and would no longer allow the BCA “access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews,” BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.
    


            The BCA was initially set to conduct the joint investigation with the FBI after consulting with the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, the US Attorney's Office and the FBI yesterday.
    


                    “Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands.”
                





            “If the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI were to reconsider this approach and express a willingness to resume a joint investigation, the BCA is prepared to reengage in support of our shared goal of public safety in Minnesota,” Evans added in the statement.
    


            Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison just reacted to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension being forced to withdraw from investigating the fatal ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis after the FBI took control of the case, telling CNN it is “deeply concerning, extremely disappointing.”
    


                    “My question is, what are you afraid of? What are you afraid of an independent investigation for?” Ellison questioned.
                





            Before learning of the news, Ellison said he was still trying to reverse the federal government's course.
    


            “I'm still trying to say: Wait a minute, don't do this stupid thing! Do not go forward with an exclusive, which would an inherently untrustworthy investigation. Do what is right, do what is wise, do what is best for this country, and have an inclusive joint investigation that includes cooperation by state and local authorities,” he said.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is expected to provide a public safety update at 12:30 p.m. ET following the shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent on Wednesday, the governor's office said.
    


            The state's Department of Public Safety commissioner, Bob Jacobson, is also expected to speak.
    


            Walz on Wednesday announced he had issued a warning order to prepare the Minnesota National Guard “to be deployed if necessary.”
    


            A counterprotester antagonized some of the demonstrators near the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building on Thursday morning.
    


            “We executed one of you yesterday,” the counterprotester said. “You guys will continue to be killed if you continue to harm these men.”
    


            The protesters' response: “Don't feed the trolls.”
    


            Authorities briefly intervened, and the counterprotester left.
    


            By late Thursday morning, the size of the crowd had dwindled.
    


            Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading the charge on the Trump administration's nationwide immigration crackdown, is outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building right now.
    


            Crowds have thinned and thickened throughout the morning outside the building where protesters arrived as early as 7 a.m. local time today.
    


            While there haven't been any confrontations between Bovino and protesters, according to CNN's Ryan Young, who is on scene, the official's presence reignited the crowd.
    


            As he walked through the group of federal agents on scene, members of the crowd can be heard yelling questions to him, but he didn't stop to answer any of them.
    


            Actions by federal officers outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in the Minneapolis area, residents they have to keep each other safe, demonstrators say.
    


            “We want to keep our people safe. We want to keep everybody safe. We know we don't want anyone else to die here in Minnesota today,” Beth Gendler, the executive director of the National Council of Jewish Women Minnesota, told CNN's Ryan Young on Thursday.
    


            Gendler described the crowd gathered Thursday as “a huge crowd of Minnesotans saying that, ‘You know what? Get ICE out of our town! We're the ones who keep each other safe'.”
    


            “And honestly, the longer that we stay here, the longer that these guys are here, the less time that they're spending in the streets, detaining our neighbors,” Gendler added.
    


            Minneapolis Police Department Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN tensions have been building in the city for several weeks before yesterday's fatal shooting.
    


                    “I have very publicly been saying that I have been concerned, both number one, that a tragedy would occur — that either a federal law enforcement officer or a civilian member of the community would get seriously hurt or killed — and also that such heightened tensions and so many emotions around these issues could lead to civil unrest, which is something that our city was, the center of truly the worst and most destructive civil unrest in our country's history five years ago.”
                





            One question that still exists is whether the officer was wearing a body-worn camera. It's unclear whether the officer who shot the victim was wearing a camera however, ICE officers are not required to wear body-worn cameras while conducting operations in Minneapolis, a law enforcement source told CNN.
    


            When asked if any body-worn camera footage exists from the shooting to illustrate the perspective of the federal agents involved, O'Hara said he didn't have any information about that.
    


            “I can tell you this much, there were not any Minneapolis Police officers on the scene when the use of deadly force occurred,” he said, urging people to consider that with a number of videos circulating from the incident, it's only a matter of time before the full story is sewn together.
    


            “Out of respect for the deceased, we should be willing to go as far as possible to gather all of the evidence and follow the evidence to its logical conclusion,” O'Hara said.
    


            US Border Patrol agents seen at a protest near Minneapolis, Minnesota, appear to be a mix of the agency's special response team and its Border Patrol Tactical Unit, also known as BORTAC.
    


            BORTAC agents are generally trained in crowd control and crowd dispersion, as well as other tactics to protect property. Pepper spray and tear gas canisters are among the tools that agents have relied on for crowd control.
    


            Similar Border Patrol teams have been previously deployed to various civil unrest incidents, including Portland in 2020.
    


            When ICE agents first approached Renee Good's car, cursing at her and yanking on her door, it's understandable why the driver would flee, attorney Raul Reyes said.
    


            “In my view, it is completely reasonable for this young woman – when an agent is approaching her car, (a weapon) drawn, shouting at her, reaching into her car – I think it is a completely reasonable response to attempt to flee the scene, to get out of harm's way,” Reyes said.
    


            Video shows officers approaching Good's car and saying, “Get out of the f*cking car.” The footage shows one officer pulling on Good's driver-side door while another officer walks in front of the car from the other side.
    


            Good's car was parked horizontally across the right lane of a one-way street. She puts her SUV in reverse before moving forward and to the right, toward the direction of traffic.
    


            At the same time, the ICE officer who approached the front of Good's vehicle pulls out his gun while moving away from the front of her car. The ICE officer shoots Good as she is driving away, and her car crashes into a utility pole and a parked vehicle.
    


            “Even if she was potentially disobeying an order to step out of the car,” Reyes said, “that should not be a death sentence.”
    


            Federal officers in fatigues, including those with Border Patrol special response teams, have arrived and positioned themselves in a line outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal building in the Minneapolis area, trying to move protesters across the street.
    


            While some agents interacting with protesters were seen trying to use deescalation, while other agents were heard having conversations antagonizing the protesters, telling them to “bring it if they want to bring it,” and using their body to physically push people down to the ground, CNN's Ryan Young reported from the scene.
    


            The protesters, some directly facing federal officers, have been vocal, cursing and calling officers Nazis and murderers.
    


            Every gate around the federal facility has been cleared of protesters.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Protesters confronted federal officers Thursday in Minneapolis the day after a woman was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

The demonstrations came amid heightened tensions after President Donald Trump's administration dispatched 2,000 officers and agents to Minnesota for its latest immigration crackdown. 

The killing of 37-year-old Renee Good on Wednesday set off a clash between federal officials who insist the shooting was an act of self-defense and Minneapolis officials who dispute that narrative.

Here's what is known about the shooting:

The woman was shot in her car in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where police killed George Floyd in 2020. Videos taken by bystanders and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped in the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. 

The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.




It is not clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer. The SUV then speeds into two cars parked on a curb nearby before coming to a stop. Witnesses can be heard shouting in shock.




Good died of gunshot wounds to the head.

She described herself on social media as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” from Colorado. Calls and messages to her family were not immediately returned.

Public records show Good had recently lived in Kansas City, Missouri, where she and another woman with the same home address had started a business last year called B. Good Handywork.

In a video posted from the scene on social media, a woman who describes Good as her wife is seen sitting near the vehicle sobbing. She says the couple had only recently arrived in Minnesota and they have a 6-year-old child.

Her killing is at least the fifth death to result from the aggressive U.S. immigration crackdown the Trump administration launched last year.

The ICE officer has not been publicly identified. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described him only as an experienced officer. She said the officer was hit by the vehicle during Wednesday's shooting and taken to a hospital. He has since been discharged.

“Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he's been taught to do in that situation, and took actions to defend himself and defend his fellow law enforcement officers,” Noem said.

Noem said officers were trying to push a vehicle out of the snow when protesters confronted them. She said the woman was blocking officers with her vehicle and refused to heed their commands before trying to run over one of them.

“This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism,” Noem said.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara gave no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone when he described the shooting to reporters.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called Noem's description of the events “garbage,” saying he had watched videos of the shooting that show it wasn't self-defense and was avoidable.

Meanwhile, the head of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said Thursday that federal prosecutors have barred the state agency from taking part in investigating the shooting.

BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said his agency had planned a joint investigation with the FBI but was later told that state investigators would have no access to evidence, witness interviews and other case materials. As a result, Evans said, the BCA has “reluctantly withdrawn” from the shooting investigation.

Dozens of protesters gathered Thursday morning outside a Minneapolis federal building being used a base for the immigration crackdown. Border Patrol officers fired tear gas and doused demonstrators with pepper spray to push them back from the gate.

Area schools were closed as a safety precaution as Gov. Tim Walz pleaded for calm. 

A vigil Wednesday night for the victim drew hundreds of people. A march through the city concluded without violence.

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Mississippi has kept winning despite its coach bolting for another program.

Miami has rekindled the glory days of its 2001 national championship with a ferocious defense and steady quarterback.

One will play for a national championship after Thursday night's Fiesta Bowl.

Ole Miss (13-1) spent the last half of the regular season wondering if coach Lane Kiffin would stick around or leave for LSU. Once the coach did head out, the sixth-seeded Rebels kept winning to reach the College Football Playoff semifinals.

Defensive coordinator Pete Golding took over as coach and many of the assistants expected to join Kiffin in Baton Rouge stuck around to see the Rebels through the rest of the playoffs. Ole Miss and its high-scoring offense blew out Tulane in its opening CFP game and outlasted mighty Georgia 39-34 in the semifinals.

Miami (12-2) is in the midst of its best run since winning the 2001 national title.

The 10th-seeded Hurricanes have done it with a defense that went from mediocrity to one of the stingiest in the FBS under first-year coordinator Corey Hetherman. Miami gave up its fewest points since the 2001 national championship team — fourth nationally at 13.07 per game. The Hurricanes have been even stingier in the CFP, holding Texas A&M and Ohio State to a combined 17 points.

Like most big games, the Fiesta Bowl will likely come down to which quarterback plays best.




Miami's Carson Beck is a proven winner, earning a national championship as a backup at Georgia before two stellar seasons as the starter. He's been a perfect fit since transferring to Miami, throwing for for 3,313 yards and 27 touchdowns on 74% passing with 10 interceptions.

Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss took a circuitous route to the playoffs.

With limited options out of high school, the dual-threat quarterback opted to play at Ferris State, leading the Bulldogs to a Division II championship last season. Chambliss has been superb since taking over as starter three games into this season, racking up 4,180 total yards and 29 touchdowns.

Protesters confronted federal agents outside a facility in Minneapolis on Thursday, one day after the deadly shooting of Renee Nicole Good.

Vice President JD Vance challenged Democrats on Thursday morning to explain whether a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis was "wrong in defending his life."

The vice president posed the question on X and called on the media to press Democratic lawmakers and candidates on the issue.

"Every congressional democrat and every democrat who's running for president should be asked a simple question: Do you think this officer was wrong in defending his life against a deranged leftist who tried to run him over?"

"These people are going to try to arrest our law enforcement for doing their jobs. The least the media could do is ask them about it," Vance wrote.

Chaos erupted in Minnesota on Wednesday after an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good tried to "weaponize her vehicle" and "attempted to run a law enforcement officer over." She also accused Good of "stalking and impeding" federal agents all day. Noem told reporters that Good was instructed to get out of her car and stop "obstructing" law enforcement, but she did not comply.

The agency is labeling the incident as an act of "domestic terrorism."

On Thursday, in a separate post on X, Vance expanded on his defense of the officer's actions, slamming critics for engaging in "gaslighting." The post was made in response to comments from Jenin Younes, the national legal director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, who argued that the officer was not in danger and had time to get out of Good's way. Vance said Younes' arguments were "preposterous."

"The gaslighting is off the charts, and I'm having none of it. This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job. When he approached her car, she tried to hit him," Vance wrote. "A tragedy? Absolutely. But a tragedy that falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with."

DEMOCRATS LOOK AT DEFUNDING ICE, IMPEACHING NOEM AFTER MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING

Several Democratic lawmakers, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and several others, have slammed ICE in the wake of the shooting.

In a news conference immediately after the fatal shooting, Frey told ICE to "get the f--- out" of the city and rejected DHS' claim that the shooting happened in self-defense, calling it "garbage." The mayor also claimed ICE was "creating the kind of dysfunction and chaos that they claimed to be trying to help with."

"Get the f--- out of Minneapolis," Frey said. "We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite. People are being hurt, families are being ripped apart."

Walz also rejected DHS's statement on the shooting, dismissing the agency as a "propaganda machine."

During a news conference, the governor vowed the state would "seek accountability and justice" following the shooting. He also rejected further assistance from the federal government, calling out President Donald Trump and Noem by name during a news conference on Wednesday. The governor then announced that he had issued a warning order to the National Guard and that members were prepared for deployment if and when necessary.

WALZ PREPARES NATIONAL GUARD AFTER WOMAN KILLED IN ICE OPERATION: 'NEVER BEEN AT WAR' WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

Omar, a fierce critic of ICE, took to social media to slam the agency, saying that the officer's actions were "unconscionable and reprehensible."

"I am beyond outraged that their reckless, callous actions led to the killing of a legal observer in Minneapolis. My heart breaks for the victim's family, who will have to forever live with the pain caused by the Trump administration's reckless and deadly actions," Omar wrote. "This administration has shown, yet again, that it does not care about the safety of Minnesotans... This is not law enforcement. It is state violence. It is simply indefensible, and ICE must be held accountable."

Klobuchar, who is reportedly considering a run for Minnesota governor after Walz dropped his bid for a third term, said the shooting was "the result of the administration sending federal agents onto our streets against the wishes of local law enforcement."

"While our immigration enforcement should be focused on apprehending and prosecuting violent criminals to make our communities safer, these ICE actions are doing the opposite and making our state less safe," the senator added.

Several Democrat lawmakers from outside Minnesota have also weighed in. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the shooting "absolutely horrific" and accused multiple Trump administration officials, including the president, of lying about the incident. Additionally, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani accused the ICE officer of committing murder.

President Donald Trump suffered a rare setback Thursday after the Republican-led Senate narrowly advanced a bipartisan measure to restrict further military operations against Venezuela without congressional approval.

The Senate voted 52-47 on a procedural step for the war powers resolution, with five Republicans joining Democrats to support the measure, marking a significant rebuke of Trump's actions in Venezuela after a military operation that deposed former dictator Nicolas Maduro. Republicans were broadly supportive of the operation, but the vote reflects growing unease over the lack of congressional notification and how the administration plans to manage the transition.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a co-author of the resolution, along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins (R-ME), Todd Young (R-IN), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) were the Republicans who crossed the aisle to support the measure.

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was the lone undecided Democrat going into the vote, but he ultimately stuck with his party on Thursday.

The outcome is a shift from two unsuccessful war power votes in the Senate, spurred last year by the Pentagon's campaign against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea. Thursday's vote was on whether to bring the resolution to the Senate floor, meaning it has yet to pass the Senate but likely has the necessary support.

House lawmakers are mounting their own bipartisan effort to pass a war powers resolution, but the efforts have been largely symbolic given Trump's ability to veto. The GOP House narrowly rejected a similar vote in December 2025, keeping all but three Republicans in line with the rest of the party.

Collins, a centrist up for reelection in battleground Maine, said Trump's openness to a drawn-out U.S. presence in Venezuela justifies the need for Congress to reaffirm its authority.

“I believe invoking the War Powers Act at this moment is necessary, given the president's comments about the possibility of ‘boots on the ground' and a sustained engagement ‘running' Venezuela, with which I do not agree,” Collins said in a statement.

Top administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and War Secretary Pete Hegseth, insisted to lawmakers during all-member classified briefings on the eve of the vote that the president's actions have been warranted and properly executed under his constitutional authority.

WHY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS CALLING THE MADURO MISSION A ‘LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATION'

The administration is in the midst of selling off up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that the United States will use to leverage the country's transition of government.

“They are not generating any revenue from their oil right now,” Rubio told reporters Wednesday. “They can't move it, unless we allow it to move because we have sanctions, because we're enforcing those sanctions. This is tremendous leverage. We are exercising it in a positive way. They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States.”

Sen. John Fetterman , D-Pa., joins 'Fox & Friends' to weigh in on the arrest and indictment of Nicolás Maduro as Democrats criticize President Donald Trump's action against the alleged narco-terrorist.

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., expressed support for the idea of the U.S. buying Greenland, which is linked to the nation of Denmark.

"I believe Greenland has massive strategic benefits for the United States. I do not support taking it by force. America is not a bully. Ideally, we purchase it — similar to our purchases of Alaska or the Louisiana Purchase. Acquiring Greenland is a many decades-old conversation," the senator noted in a Wednesday post on X.

In a Fox News appearance last year, Fetterman had similarly noted that he would not support forcibly seizing Greenland but expressed an openness to the prospect of purchasing the land. He pointed to the Louisiana Purchase and the Alaska Purchase.

President Donald Trump has been eyeing the island, categorizing the U.S. acquiring the territory as a national security matter.

In a 2024 Truth Social post, he asserted, "For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity."

DEM SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO STOP TRUMP FROM INVADING ‘ANOTHER COUNTRY ON A WHIM' OVER GREENLAND

During a Sunday news gaggle aboard Air Force One, he said, "We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security. And the European Union needs us to have it."

Trump has previously floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in the past, but the commander-in-chief spoke about the Artic territory recently when someone brought it up during the gaggle on Air Force One after the U.S. operation in Venezuela that captured Nicolás Maduro. Since then, the president said the U.S. is in charge of Venezuela and will be for the foreseeable future until a secure transition of power can take place.

In a Fox News appearance on Monday, Fetterman described the U.S. capture of Maduro as a "good thing," calling the operation "surgical."

"Removing Maduro was positive for Venezuela. As a Democrat, I don't understand why we can't acknowledge a good development for Venezuelans — and how deft our military's execution of that plan was," he noted in a Tuesday post on X.

Fox News host Jesse Watters says that the officer who fired in the deadly I.C.E.-involved shooting ‘felt that his life was in danger' on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.' 

Republican lawmakers are urging President Donald Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after the Democrat warned he could deploy the National Guard in response to federal immigration enforcement actions in his state.

"Invoke the Insurrection Act. Arrest Tim Walz," Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., said in a post to X on Wednesday evening. 

Miller's calls to apply the law, which gives the president powers to arrest suspects obstructing federal law enforcement, follow Walz's suggestion that he might deploy the National Guard to push back on President Donald Trump's use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

"We do not need any further help from the federal government. To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough. I've issued a warning order to prepare the Minnesota National Guard," Walz said in a press event.

Walz's warning on Wednesday came on the heels of a deadly encounter between ICE and a woman. A law enforcement officer shot Renee Nicole Good, 37, when she confronted agents from inside her car in Minneapolis, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

"We have soldiers in training and prepared to be deployed if necessary. I remind you, a warning order is a heads-up for folks," Walz said. "Minnesota will not allow our community to be used as a prop in a national political fight."

FAMILIAR PROTEST GROUPS MOBILIZE IMMEDIATELY AFTER ICE SHOOTING OF MINNESOTA PROTESTER

Under Minnesota law, Walz has the power to deploy the National Guard for the "defense or relief of the state, the enforcement of the law, [or] the protection of persons" in the state.

Other Republicans reacting to Walz's warning also believe such an action could trigger the use of the act.

"Someone remind him: Donald Trump is the Commander in Chief. And federal authority supersedes state authority. That's not an opinion, that's the Constitution," Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said in her own post.

"What Walz is threatening has a name: insurrection. Mr. President, the law is on your side. Use it," she added.

            Saudi-backed forces moved to capture a key southern Yemeni city on Thursday after Riyadh accused the UAE of helping a separatist leader flee.
    


            Citing “reliable intelligence,” the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen said the leader of Yemen's UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), Aidarous al-Zubaidi, left the country by boat “in the dead of night” for Somaliland, before boarding an aircraft to Mogadishu, which later transported him to a military airport in Abu Dhabi.
    


            CNN has reached out to the UAE foreign ministry for comment.
    


            The interior ministry of the Saudi-backed Yemeni government said in a statement that government-allied National Shield Forces (NSF) had “secured” the southern city of Aden and its security situation was “under control.” The NSF posted a video on social media showing a large convoy of military vehicles mobilizing to “secure several provinces” in the south that had been captured by the STC and allied militias. CNN cannot independently verify the claims.
    


            Aden had been the seat of Yemen's government since the Iran-backed Houthi movement took over the capital Sana'a in 2014, prompting a military intervention by Saudi Arabia and the UAE a year later. Last month, government officials stationed there fled to Riyadh when the southern forces, led by Al Zubaidi, launched a military offensive to take over the area last month.
    


            Over the past decade, UAE and Saudi agendas in the country diverged, leading them to support rival factions. In particular, the UAE's backing of southern separatists was at odds with Saudi Arabia's support for a unified and stable Yemen at its border. The UAE pulled most of its troops from Yemen in 2019, but a small contingent of what it called counter terrorism forces remained.
    


Saudi Arabia's dispute with the UAE exposes a deeper regional power struggle



            The advance of STC forces across key southern Yemeni provinces early December infuriated Riyadh and triggered an unprecedented public dispute with its Emirati neighbor, culminating in Saudi airstrikes on UAE shipments and a call by the Yemeni government for the remaining UAE forces to leave the country in 24 hours, which Saudi Arabia endorsed.
    


            Following the UAE's withdrawal, Yemeni government forces, with Saudi air support, launched a counteroffensive that pushed the separatists to their former stronghold in Aden. Under intense military pressure, the STC's leadership agreed to hold talks in Riyadh aimed at de-escalating the conflict.
    


            The Saudi-led coalition said Wednesday that al-Zubaidi was expected to accompany the STC delegation, but instead mobilized “a large military force” to create “chaos and unrest”.
    


            Following the statement, Yemen's internationally recognized government accused al-Zubaidi of “high treason” for “inciting internal strife”.
    


            An STC foreign affairs official, Amr Al-Bidh, said in a briefing on Tuesday that the delegation of more than fifty STC officials had been incommunicado since arriving in Riyadh. A photo posted on X by the Saudi ambassador to Yemen on Wednesday showed him meeting with the officials in the capital.
    


            “The message (from Saudi Arabia) was either you come, or you are an enemy, and that is your last chance,” Al-Bidh said.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Saudi government for comment.

Kai Trump may have politics in her family, but do not expect her to get into it.

At age 18, President Donald Trump's granddaughter is set to play college golf next fall at the University of Miami and just recently made her debut on the LPGA Tour in November.

Trump hopes to become a professional one day, but one thing that seems certain is that she will not turn to politics later in life.

"To be honest with you, I stay out of politics completely. I would never run, I don't want anything to do with politics," Trump said during an appearance on Logan Paul's podcast. "I feel like politics is such a dangerous thing, and I think if both sides met in the middle, everyone would be so much more happier."

Trump said people have gotten "too extreme" on both sides of the coin, and social media has driven people to hone in on their beliefs.

KAI TRUMP REVEALS 'AWKWARD' REALITY OF DATING WITH SECRET SERVICE AGENTS WATCHING FROM NEARBY TABLES

"There's not a lot of things on social media where you're very much in the middle. And I think that kind of makes some people crazy and some people buy into it too much," Trump added. "I think that's like the best way to say it. There's no bad blood. I'm very much in the middle and kind of like, it is what it is. They ran against each other [Trump and Kamala Harris]. Obviously, I'm gonna support my grandpa, my family member, but that's pretty much it."

The closest Trump has dove into the political waters was when she spoke at the Republican National Convention just days after her grandfather was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania.

In an interview with Fox News Digital in October, Trump said she was "proud" of her grandfather after he brokered the historic ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and former I.C.E. special agent Tim Miller criticize Minneapolis' 'explosive' environment after a fatal I.C.E.-involved shooting on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Democratic lawmakers are increasingly calling to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after a federal agent shot and killed a woman in Minnesota on Wednesday.

The defunding push is creating problems for lead Democrats, however, as they argued earlier this week that any attempt to defund ICE is off the table. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have emphasized that the Affordable Care Act remains their priority.

Nevertheless, Wednesday's killing of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis has galvanized ranks of Democrats.

"Certainly everyone in that room, at least on my side, is livid at what happened to this woman," said Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., who has previously called for a government shutdown to defund ICE. "Not just a resident of Minnesota, a U.S. citizen... a 37-year-old White woman, was shot, and then they lied about it."

"They're disappearing people off the street, and this has nothing to do with citizenship at all, increasingly, in who they're going after," argued Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., said Wednesday that she plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Noem.

"Secretary Kristi Noem is an incompetent leader, a disgrace to our democracy, and I am impeaching her for obstruction of justice, violation of public trust, and self-dealing," Kelly said. "Secretary Noem wreaked havoc in the Chicagoland area, and now, her rogue ICE agents have unleashed that same destruction in Minneapolis, fatally shooting Renee Nicole Good."

While Kelly's effort is more far-fetched, Democrats seeking to throw a wrench in the legislative process over ICE funding could potentially see some success.

"Democrats cannot vote for a DHS budget that doesn't restrain the growing lawlessness of this agency," wrote Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a statement.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., echoed Murphy's sentiment, saying Congress cannot "keep authorizing money for these illegal killers," going on to call ICE a "rogue force."

When announcing new dietary guidelines, Health and Human Services Secretary RFK Jr. said U.S. adversaries could strategize to weaken the country by getting Americans addicted to ultra-processed foods.

The Trump administration has taken a new approach to the food pyramid.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced new guidelines on Wednesday with an updated, inverted pyramid. The top of the pyramid, which is now the wider part of the structure, is built on meat, fats, fruits and vegetables, while whole grains are at the narrow bottom.

This follows HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s mission to "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA), aimed at addressing chronic disease, childhood illnesses and ultraprocessed foods.

"The new guidelines recognize that whole, nutrient-dense food is the most effective path to better health and lower health care costs," Kennedy said during a press briefing in Washington, D.C. 

"Protein and healthy fats are essential, and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines. We are ending the war on saturated fats."

The HHS secretary rallied against refined carbohydrates, food additives and added sugar, highlighting the health risks associated with sugar-sweetened beverages. 

Kennedy's main message to Americans was to "eat real food."

The announcement triggered reactions from top health and wellness voices, including Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman, host of the "Huberman Lab" podcast.

In a post on X, Huberman shared the White House's graphic of the new pyramid, praising the decisions that were made.

"Oatmeal (and I think that's rice and sourdough) made the cut!" he commented. "In all seriousness, assuming overall calories are kept in check and people exercise & get sun(day)light, this looks spot on."

He added, "Maybe up the veggies a bit, add low-sugar fermented foods like sauerkraut & this is great."

Huberman said in a thread on the same post that Americans "don't have to eat all the foods" shown in the diagram.

"You won't see me drinking milk or eating shrimp," he said. "Nothing against shrimp, I just don't like the taste. Aversion to crustaceans."

"Maybe up the veggies a bit, add low-sugar fermented foods like sauerkraut & this is great," Huberman commented on X. (Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images; iStock)

The new guidelines received praise from other major health figures, including former FDA commissioner Dr. David Kessler.

"There should be broad agreement that eating more whole foods and reducing highly processed carbohydrates is a major advance in how we approach diet and health," Kessler told The Associated Press.

"Protein and healthy fats are essential, and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines."

Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association, shared in a statement that these guidelines "affirm that food is medicine and offer clear direction patients and physicians can use to improve health."

"The American Medical Association applauds the Administration's new Dietary Guidelines for spotlighting the highly processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages and excess sodium that fuel heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other chronic illnesses," Mukkamala wrote.

But not all feedback was positive.

Some people expressed concern about prioritizing red meat and dairy, while calling for the limitation of saturated fat.

Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, shared in a reaction to STAT that while the guidelines "do have one or two good points, emphasizing fruits and vegetables and limiting alcohol," the guidelines are "for the most part a strong reflection of industry influence."

Christopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford University, also spoke out against the new guidelines, as reported by NPR.

"I'm very disappointed in the new pyramid that features red meat and saturated fat sources at the very top, as if that's something to prioritize. It does go against decades and decades of evidence and research," said Gardner, who was a member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.

            A regular morning in south Minneapolis turned to horror Wednesday morning as residents of Portland Avenue rushed out of their homes to sounds of commotion and gunshots.
    


            Emily Heller was in the middle of making breakfast when she heard whistles – a signal residents have used to warn their neighbors about the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers – and agents quarreling with protesters on her street.
    


            Without time to put on her shoes, Heller ran outside and saw a convoy of ICE agents on her street, yelling at a woman in an SUV who appeared to be blocking them from passing.
    


            Moments later, the woman, Renee Nicole Good, 37, was fatally shot.
    


            “My life is forever changed from having witnessed this,” Heller said.
    


            Heller told CNN Good “was totally peaceful” before the agents began yelling at Good to move and “aggressively” approached her vehicle.
    


            An ICE agent then tried to open her car door as another stood nearby. “She reversed a little bit,” Heller said, and then turned her wheels to begin pulling away.
    


Another violent death in Minneapolis lays bare the nation's fractured politics



            “An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, ‘Stop!' and then — I mean, she was already moving — and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,” Heller said.
    


            Trevor Heitkamp, another resident, was standing outside of his home when he heard chaos down the street. As he got closer, he saw ICE agents yelling at Good to move.
    


            “The car backed up slowly and proceeded to pull forward pretty slowly,” while witnesses shouted in protest, he said.
    


            “Then the agent who fired the weapon was on the opposite side of the car to me and I heard four, possibly five shots, and then the car sped forward because … this person's injured and their foot went down,” Heitkamp said.
    


            Nearby, Tyrice Jones was in an upstairs apartment when he heard gunshots and a crash, prompting him to go outside and see that the SUV driven by Good had smashed into a streetlight directly in front of his building.
    


What we know about the woman killed in the Minneapolis ICE shooting



            Jones then saw a woman who identified herself as Good's wife and was covered in blood sitting in the snowy front yard of Jones' building, crying alongside a black lab dog.
    


            “You guys just killed my wife!” the woman shouted.
    


            The fatal shooting marks the latest dramatic escalation in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown on cities across the US, which has led to widespread protests and violence. The Department of Homeland Security announced it was deploying roughly 2,000 federal agents to Minneapolis this week in a new enforcement campaign following an alleged fraud scandal involving Somali-run childcare centers in Minnesota.
    


            Simmering tensions quickly ramped up across the city Wednesday as federal and local officials painted opposing narratives of what happened between Good and the ICE agent.
    


            DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said Good was “stalking and impeding” officers' work throughout the day and tried to “weaponize her vehicle” to run over an officer, who she claimed “used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.”
    


            City and state officials, however, blamed the Trump administration's immigration tactics for her death.
    


            Gov. Tim Walz said he has been “warning for weeks” that ICE operations in his state were a “threat to public safety,” while Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey called the DHS account of the shooting “bullshit.”
    


            “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,” Frey said during a news conference, telling ICE to “get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”
    


            Three videos taken of the scene of the shooting and reviewed by CNN show two federal officers in a truck pulling up to Good's car and exiting their vehicle.
    


            “Get out of the car,” the officers approaching the woman's driver-side door can be heard repeatedly saying.
    


            One of the two officers can be seen pulling on the woman's driver-side door as the other officer reaches the front of the car from the other side. The car then starts to move in reverse as one officer continues pulling on the car door, and the other officer is in front of the vehicle.
    


            The vehicle begins to move forward and, at the same time, a third officer who had approached the vehicle pulls out his pistol and points it at the woman while moving away from the front of the car. He then opens fire.
    


DHS said a woman attempted to run over ICE officers before being shot in Minneapolis. Here's what videos show



            As news of the shooting spread, protests quickly broke out near the scene, which is less than a mile from where, almost six years ago, the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer became a flashpoint for national tensions over police use of force and anti-Black racism.
    


            Later Wednesday, demonstrators yelled and lobbed snowballs at federal officers and Minneapolis police in an outpouring of anger and grief.
    


            But by evening, an uneasy calm had settled across the city. The glow of hundreds of candles illuminated the snowy residential street where Good had been killed. A crowd of people stretching an entire city block braved freezing temperatures to lay bouquets of flowers and quietly mourned her life in a vigil.
    


            Good was a US citizen and a mother of three, according to the Associated Press. There were stuffed animals in her car when she was shot, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said.
    


            Frey, the mayor, urged residents to remain calm in the wake of “chaos” in the city.
    


            “This is a moment where all of us in Minneapolis and beyond, we can rise to the occasion,” Frey said. “We can show them who we are. We can show them the kind of courage, bravery, love and compassion that makes Minneapolis and that makes America.”

During the government shutdown of fall 2025, the Senate Democrats' campaign arm went on a spending spree, generously wining and dining deep-pocketed donors at luxury locales across the country, according to recently disclosed expense reports reviewed by the Washington Examiner.

While federal employees were either furloughed or worked without pay, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) splurged on high-end hotel stays, travel, and catering costs, including eye-popping sums spent at an oceanside resort and a retreat in wine country.

Republicans in Congress had blamed the record-breaking shutdown, which marked a period of financial strife for many members of the federal workforce, on the Senate Democrats who repeatedly blocked a short-term funding bill over demands to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies.

Democrats in the Senate, meanwhile, pointed fingers at GOP lawmakers, accusing congressional Republicans of “sending premiums skyrocketing instead of working with Democrats to protect affordable health care.”

However, as the threat of another government shutdown looms, the Senate Democrats' spending receipts from the fall appear to sour their claims that, by filibustering, they were fully focused on fighting financially for the working class.

For instance, on Oct. 2, day two of the shutdown, the DSCC tossed $62,415 toward an apparent fundraising retreat at a five-star resort on Sea Island, a privately owned island part of Georgia's Golden Isles.

The coastal getaway boasts horseback rides along the island's sandy shores, daybeds at the beach bar, and a state-of-the-art spa, with signature services such as Swedish massages, custom aromatherapy, a eucalyptus-infused steam room, and guided meditation labyrinth walks meant to “gently direct you away from the distractions of daily life.”

Around two weeks into the shutdown, on Oct. 13 and 14, the DSCC was slated to host donors at an overnight “Napa Retreat,” featuring a tour of the vineyards, according to an invitation obtained first by Politico.

Despite political opponents warning that the two-day trip reveling in California's wine region would appear wildly out of touch with constituents, the DSCC put money toward the retreat anyway, dropping $10,341.24 on a booking at the Hotel Yountville, the event's originally planned venue.

Located in the “culinary capital of Napa Valley,” the premier hotel is known for its Tuscan-European aesthetic. Guests there can pamper themselves at the estate's oasis and enjoy a glass of wine between “vino therapy,” a full-body exfoliation with Cabernet-enriched salt scrub, followed by Chardonnay grape seed oil.

DSCC's chairwoman, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), told the Washington Examiner in October that their plans could change if the shutdown dragged on.

“Right now, we're focused on getting healthcare restored to millions of people, and I'll make a decision on that later,” Gillibrand said of the respite in paradise.

Reports at the time indicated that the major fundraiser still proceeded as planned. On Tuesday, Gillibrand's office acknowledged but chose to “ignore” the Washington Examiner's latest request for confirmation that Gillibrand attended.

Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), who appeared at the top of the invite, denied that she was one of the hosts and said she would not participate should the shutdown persist.

“I'm not hosting anything,” Alsobrooks previously told the Washington Examiner. “When we have a shutdown, we're not going to be in Napa Valley.” 

A spokesman for Alsobrooks reaffirmed this week that the senator did not attend the event in question.

At the end of October, the DSCC paid Hotel Yountville an additional $1,480.25, although it is unclear if that disbursement is tied to the earlier excursion.

Separately, on Oct. 29, the DSCC issued a $21,964.34 check to the Hotel Bennett in Charleston, South Carolina, reporting the transaction's purpose as a fundraising activity.

Frequently ranked the No. 1. hotel in the city, the boutique hotel received a near-perfect rating from the Michelin Guide. It is known for combining Southern elegance with French-inspired accommodations intended to transport patrons to the streets of Paris.

That month, the DSCC also recorded dozens of travel and meals-related charges to American Express totaling more than $135,000. Earmarked for campaign materials and fundraising purposes, the payments, all occurring on Oct. 27, broadly covered transportation, event expenses, catering services, and venue fees.

When contacted by the Washington Examiner, the DSCC noted that Oct. 27 is the date that the American Express bills were paid, not necessarily the date of each individual charge. According to past filings, the DSCC typically paid off its American Express bills on or around the 27th of each month.

As for when exactly the American Express expenditures occurred, the DSCC did not respond to multiple follow-up requests for comment addressing whether they took place pre-shutdown.

The campaign committee also did not respond to inquiries about its payments concerning the Sea Island Resort and the Napa Valley retreat.

During the historically long shutdown, Republicans had highlighted the optics of Senate Democrats, who refused to extend government spending at current levels over the healthcare dispute, jetting off to luxurious locales to rub elbows with wealthy elites, but both parties had their fair share of hobnobbing at shutdown soirees.

SHUTDOWN SENDS CAMPAIGNS INTO OVERDRIVE TO SEIZE ON GOVERNMENT CHAOS

The National Republican Senatorial Committee spent considerable campaign funds on courting donors during the shutdown.

On Oct. 3 and 4, the NRSC was scheduled to host its own high-dollar fundraising retreat at the Sea Island Resort. Marketed as the committee's “Fall Meeting,” the stay included a weekend of golf, pickleball, fishing, shooting, and afternoon lawn games. Invitees were offered beach club bedroom suites and oceanview rooms at a nearly $600-per-night rate.

However, the committee's Federal Election Commission disclosures that fall did not document payments to the Sea Island Company, other than a mere $45.97 spent on food and beverages in October, as well as $40,000 on facility rental fees in June, and another $40,000 disbursement in July.

According to Axios, the weekend extravaganza was not canceled in light of the standstill on Capitol Hill. Sea Island attendees reportedly received an email from organizers telling them: “These events are reserved and contracted years in advance — beyond even our current term at the NRSC — and both our costs and attendees' rooms are non-refundable.”

The show likely went on at the staff level, Axios speculated, with the 20 or so senators set to attend largely bailing and those who did appear attending incognito. Even when legislators are no-shows at events, senior aides and political advisers typically still get to schmooze with donors.

Sources similarly told Bloomberg Government that the hotel rooms had already been paid for and the retreat itself was booked well before talks of a government shutdown. Lobbyists said the logistics of scrapping a large, long-planned sojourn would be difficult and costly.

The NRSC did not reply to repeated requests for comment.

In the lead-up to the fundraising fete, the NRSC couched it as necessary to build the GOP's base ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

“Schumer continuing to shut down the government because he wants to give free healthcare to illegals only further underscores how essential it is [that] Republicans protect and grow President Trump's Senate majority next year,” NRSC spokeswoman Joanna Rodriguez wrote in a previous statement.

On Oct. 14, the NRSC sent $34,738.60 to the Newport Beach Country Club, although the transaction, categorized under catering and facility usage, was marked as an administrative cost. A frequent gathering spot for fundraisers, the invitation-only California country club has hosted numerous GOP events over the years, primarily for the Republican Party of Orange County.

ISLAND FUNDRAISERS, ROOFTOP SOIREES, AND A BABYDOG BIRTHDAY BONANZA: WASHINGTON SHRUGS AT SHUTDOWN OPTICS

There was also a big Senate GOP bash planned over Columbus Day weekend in Kiawah Island, a barrier island off the coast of South Carolina. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) was initially scheduled to attend but he had pulled out, per Punchbowl News.

That trip, too, had long been on the books, according to fundraising appeals from earlier in the year. Federal Election Commission disclosures show that the Fund for America's Future, a Republican-aligned PAC, gave the Kiawah Island Golf Resort $5,640 on Oct. 3.

The United States says it has seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela in back-to-back actions in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday the U.S. has “maximum leverage” over Venezuela's interim authorities and will dictate their decisions, adding that Venezuelan oil marketing is already underway “for the benefit” of both countries.

The Interim President Delcy Rodriguez said on the Government Television that there's a stain on a relationship between Venezuela and the United States.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela's petroleum worldwide.

Trump's administration intends to control the distribution of Venezuela's oil products globally following its ouster of President Nicolás Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid. Besides the United States enforcing an existing oil embargo, the Energy Department says the “only oil transported in and out of Venezuela” will be through approved channels consistent with U.S. law and national security interests. 

That level of control over the world's largest proven reserves of crude oil could give the Trump administration a broader hold on oil supplies globally in ways that could enable it to influence prices. Both moves reflect the Republican administration's determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources after Trump pledged the U.S. will “run” the country.

Vice President JD Vance said in an interview the U.S. can “control” Venezuela's “purse strings” by dictating where its oil can be sold.

“We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime, you're allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America's national interest,” Vance said in an interview to air on Fox News Channel's “Jesse Watters Primetime.”




The vice president added, “And that's how we exert incredible pressure on that country without wasting a single American life.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that the oil taken from the sanctioned vessels seized in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea would be sold as part of the deal announced by Trump on Tuesday under which Venezuela would provide up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S.

Venezuela's interim authorities “want that oil that was seized to be part of this deal,” Rubio told reporters after briefing lawmakers Wednesday about the Maduro operation. “They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States.”

U.S. European Command said on social media that the merchant vessel Bella 1 was seized in the North Atlantic for “violations of U.S. sanctions.” The U.S. had been pursuing the tanker since last month after it tried to evade a blockade on sanctioned oil vessels around Venezuela.




Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revealed U.S. forces also took control of the M Sophia in the Caribbean Sea. Noem said on social media that both ships were “either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it.” 

The two ships join at least two others that were taken by U.S. forces last month — the Skipper and the Centuries.

The Bella 1 had been cruising across the Atlantic nearing the Caribbean on Dec. 15 when it abruptly turned and headed north, toward Europe. The change in direction came days after the first U.S. tanker seizure of a ship on Dec. 10 after it had left Venezuela carrying oil.

When the U.S. Coast Guard tried to board the Bella 1, it fled. U.S. European Command said a Coast Guard vessel had tracked the ship “pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court.”

As the U.S. pursued it, the Bella 1 was renamed Marinera and flagged to Russia, shipping databases show. A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, said the ship's crew had painted a Russian flag on the side of the hull.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said it had information about Russian nationals among the Marinera's crew and, in a statement carried by Russia's state news agencies Tass and RIA Novosti, demanded that “the American side ensure humane and dignified treatment of them, strictly respect their rights and interests, and not hinder their speedy return to their homeland.”

Separately, a senior Russian lawmaker, Andrei Klishas, decried the U.S. action as “blatant piracy.”

The Justice Department is investigating crew members of the Bella 1 vessel for failing to obey Coast Guard orders and “criminal charges will be pursued against all culpable actors,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

“The Department of Justice is monitoring several other vessels for similar enforcement action — anyone on any vessel who fails to obey instructions of the Coast Guard or other federal officials will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Bondi said on X.

The ship had been sanctioned by the U.S. in 2024 on allegations of smuggling cargo for a company linked to Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, is “selectively” removing sanctions to enable the shipping and sale of Venezuelan oil to markets worldwide, according to an outline of the policies published Wednesday by the Energy Department.

The sales are slated to begin immediately with 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil. The U.S. government said the sales “will continue indefinitely,” with the proceeds settling in U.S.-controlled accounts at “globally recognized banks.” The money would be disbursed to the U.S. and Venezuelan populations at the “discretion” of Trump's government.

Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA said it is in negotiations with the U.S. government for the sale of crude oil.

“This process is developed under schemes similar to those in force with international companies, such as Chevron, and is based on a strictly commercial transaction, with criteria of legality, transparency and benefit for both parties,” the company said in the statement.

Acting President Delcy Rodríguez on Wednesday night tried to normalize the latest chapter in U.S.-Venezuela economic relations, calling them “neither extraordinary nor irregular.”

“Venezuela must diversify its relations and have relations with all the countries of this hemisphere, just as it should with Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe,” she said during a televised meeting with lawmakers and senior government officials.

The U.S. plans to authorize the importation of oil field equipment, parts and services to increase Venezuela's oil production, which has been roughly 1 million barrels a day. 

The Trump administration has indicated it also will invest in the electricity grid to increase production and the quality of life for people in Venezuela, whose economy has been unraveling amid changes to foreign aid and cuts to state subsidies, making necessities, including food, unaffordable to millions.

Meanwhile, Trump abruptly changed his tone about Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Trump said Wednesday that they had exchanged a friendly phone call and he had invited the leader of the South American country to the White House. Trump had said earlier this week that “Colombia is very sick too” and accused Petro of ”making cocaine and selling it to the United States.” 

Noem said both seized ships were part of a shadow fleet of rusting oil tankers that smuggle oil for countries facing sanctions, such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran.

After the seizure of the now-named Marinera, which open-source maritime tracking sites showed was between Scotland and Iceland earlier Wednesday, the U.K. defense ministry said Britain's military provided support, including surveillance aircraft.

“This ship, with a nefarious history, is part of a Russian-Iranian axis of sanctions evasion which is fueling terrorism, conflict, and misery from the Middle East to Ukraine,” U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said.

The capture of the M Sophia, on the U.S. sanctions list for moving illicit cargos of oil from Russia, in the Caribbean was much less prolonged.

The ship had been “running dark,” not having transmitted location data since July. Tankers involved in smuggling often turn off their transponders or broadcast inaccurate data to hide their locations.

Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, said his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document that at least 16 tankers had left the Venezuelan coast since Saturday, after the U.S. captured Maduro. 

The M Sophia was among them, Madani said, citing a recent photo showing it in the waters near Jose Terminal, Venezuela's main oil export hub.

Windward, a maritime intelligence firm that tracks such vessels, said in a briefing to reporters the M Sophia loaded at the terminal on Dec. 26 and was carrying about 1.8 million barrels of crude oil — a cargo that would be worth about $108 million at current price of about $60 a barrel.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Steve Kerr upset his mother. 

Ann Kerr was mortified by the behavior of her 60-year-old coaching son, for the first time in quite a while.

She didn't approve of Kerr's ejection in the fourth quarter of a one-point loss to the Clippers on Monday night, when the Warriors coach was held back from the officials by Gary Payton II, Gui Santos and assistant Terry Stotts.

“All good other than my mom being terribly disappointed in me,” Kerr said of his 91-year-old mom before Golden State's home game Wednesday against Milwaukee. “She was at the game, she looked horrified afterwards. She asked me if I was going to hit the referee. I said, ‘Mom, I've never hit anybody in my life,' and she said, ‘it looked like you were going to hit him, why were all of those men holding you back?' That's all part of the theatrics. She didn't understand. I was a little alarmed that she thought I was actually going to hit somebody, that scared me.”

Kerr received back-to-back technical fouls and his fifth career ejection after becoming angry with official John Collins over a missed goaltending call, according to Stotts.

“I'm happy she got on Steve, that's great,” Draymond Green said.

Two days later, Kerr didn't want to discuss exactly what set him off, saying, “there's a reason Terry did media the other night” after the game.

“I was upset about a couple calls,” he added. 




Stephen Curry appreciated Kerr's outburst, even if it disappointed his mom. And Curry has been scolded by his mom plenty of times, too.

“I've seen worse for sure, I couldn't tell you exactly when but I know it's been worse, but that's a good mother-son relationship and that she's watching every game and locked in and cares as much as she does to call him out,” Curry said. “But we needed that fire, so Mrs. Kerr, we forgive him for sure.” 

Bucks coach Doc Rivers joked he was disappointed in Kerr.

“He acted like a fool, and I'm done with that from Steve,” said Rivers, who upset his late mother, Bettye, a time or two. “My mom was a church-going lady and I wasn't using the right language one game and she called and let me have it. It's interesting ‘cause you say ‘I'm sorry' but do you know the next day you're going to do it again. So it's a tough one.”

Kerr said his mom had questioned him before whether he was going to hit someone, but it had been a while.

“Maybe my little brother,” Kerr said with a grin, making his exit from pregame duties.

            It took just a few seconds and a violent, unnecessary death to drag a snowy residential street in Minneapolis into America's new age of political brutality.
    


            Soon, all of America was sharing the horror, as bystander video of an ICE agent's point-blank shooting of 37-year-old American Renee Nicole Good flashed onto millions of mobile device screens.
    


The grainy scene — with its older homes, ice underfoot and green-clad government agents closing on a civilian car — seemed a little unreal. It evoked old news footage from a repressive Soviet state more than the land of the free.
    


            But the killing quickly became the latest explosive incident in the second term of Donald Trump that is dragging politics to a bitter breaking point.
    


            Minneapolis' Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey, plainly outraged by a killing just a day into a federal crackdown sending 2,000 federal agents to his city, told ICE to “get the fuck out.”
    


            But Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem mobilized to define their own misleading narrative. “It was an act of domestic terrorism,” Noem said. A more conventional public servant might have promised inquiries, offered solace and called for calm. 



            Trump was more inflammatory. He posted on social media that a woman seen screaming in a video was a “professional agitator” and that Good “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense.” None of the available video is so unequivocal.
    


            It was left to Good's mother to try to reclaim her humanity. Donna Ganger told the Minneapolis Star Tribune her daughter was “not part of anything like that at all” and was compassionate, forgiving and affectionate.
    


            This was the latest sickening example of violence arising from politics that is draining America's morale and marks a savage chapter in modern history. It follows two assassination attempts against Trump in 2024; the killings of a beloved Minnesota Democratic lawmaker, Melissa Hortman, and her husband last year; the alleged murder of a health insurance executive on a New York street in 2024; and the abhorrent gunning-down of MAGA hero Charlie Kirk in September.
    


            The lesson of past horrors is that politics may thwart national closure.
    


            Normally, an investigation would be expected to probe the mindset and decisions of the officer who killed Good. It might examine whether the force used was excessive or whether current rules of engagement with suspects encourages escalation. But Trump and Noem may have already prejudged any federal inquiries.
    


            At a later news conference in Minneapolis, Noem didn't leaven her initial assessment. But she said: “Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that in this situation, it was preventable.”
    


            Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “you can accept that this woman's death is a tragedy while acknowledging it's a tragedy of her own making.” Vance also said that he, Trump and the entire administration were behind ICE agents.
    


            This was only the latest encounter between citizens and the ICE agents who've fanned into major cities. Often wearing masks, the agents sometimes dragnet American citizens as well as undocumented migrants. Social media videos show car rammings by federal agents or pro-immigration activists. ICE officials told CNN in October that attacks against agents rose 1,000% last year. Noem said one officer involved on Wednesday was dragged by the car of an “anti-ICE rioter” in June.
    


            This all poses a searching question: Is an immigration crackdown that Trump insists will make American safer in fact making it far more dangerous?
    


            Putting the particulars of Wednesday's incident aside, it's possible that any American, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, is in peril. A a few wrong choices by either party in the heat of the moment could spell disaster.
    


            Is that level of danger and risk really tolerable in a democratic society? And is America beginning to resemble some authoritarian states where lives of individuals are a trifle compared to the political ambitions of strongmen? Trump has, after all, declared that America is under “invasion” by foreign migrants and has authorized warlike tactics in response.
    


            It's too early to assess lasting political impact, if any, from Wednesday's shooting.
    


            But the killing took place only a mile from the street corner where another bystander's video was filmed before going viral and creating a mass movement: that of George Floyd, who died with a police officer's knee on his neck in 2020.
    


            One reason Trump was elected in 2024 was that millions of Americans believed that former President Joe Biden lost control of the southern border. Trump has honored a pledge to stem undocumented migration. And a country that fails in enforcement won't make its people feel safe.
    


            But horrible scenes like the one in Minnesota on Wednesday seem far removed from Trump's campaign pledge to first go after criminals, rapists, drug traffickers and the worst of the worst. Looking back in months to come, the Minnesota shooting could appear as a turning point when more voters in a midterm election year rejected his excesses.
    


            Political consequences may, however, be in the eye of the beholder. Administration critics will see state-authorized violence, repression and due process being crushed. Supporters may find enough in the videos to argue that the officer concerned opened fire because he felt his life was at risk. And advocates of Trump's policy will highlight murders committed by illegal migrants.
    


            But Trump's critics say the risks of misunderstandings, violent encounters and innocents being harmed mean his ordering of thousands of armed agents onto the streets is reckless.
    


            “When do things stop being about politics and start being about actual human decency?” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said to reporters. “We can all hypothesize on what all of their political reasons are. But meanwhile, a woman died being shot in her car, and everything that they're doing is making it worse and not better.”
    


            If the crackdown's intent is at least partly performative, public safety risks become even more questionable.
    


            “I have been worried – not that federal law enforcement activity was happening, but how that enforcement was taking place in the city,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN's Erin Burnett. “And I have specifically said I've been worried we would have a tragedy in our community.”
    


            But former Vice President Mike Pence told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that “today should be a cautionary tale that people ought not to, as reports in this case suggest … be harassing ICE officers.”
    


            Good's death came against a backdrop of Trump's dystopian attempts to portray Democratic-run cities as hellholes where migrant gangs run riot and regular Americans fear for their lives. He's used such depictions to justify draconian tactics like the dispatch of the National Guard into some cities last year.
    


            The federal government is also currently locked in a clash with Minnesota over claims in conservative media that Somali-run child care centers have fraudulently taken funding earmarked for low-income families. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, just announced he was dropping his reelection bid over the controversy.
    


            Minnesota Democratic leaders fear any unrest in protest at Wednesday's events could result in a more intense crackdown.
    


            Frey dismissed administration depictions of the shooting as “garbage” but asked Minnesotans not to give Trump a pretext for an even greater show of force.
    


            Walz had a similar message. “They want a show. We can't give it to them. We cannot,” he said. “If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can't give them what they want.”
    


            By nightfall on Portland Avenue, where Minnesota skyscrapers loom in the distance, residents held a vigil for yet another American victim drawn to their death by political forces that, once unleashed, cannot be tamed.

SCHIPHOL, Netherlands (AP) — More than 1,000 stranded passengers spent the night at Amsterdam's international airport as snow and ice that is pummeling parts of Europe grounded hundreds of flights and choked highways and railroads Wednesday.

In Paris, a skier slid along the snowy bank of the Seine river and roads and parks around the Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum were blanketed in snow, which also snarled traffic in parts of France.

There was good news for some Berlin residents during the cold snap as power was being restored to thousands of households in the German capital that had been without electricity in freezing temperatures for four days following a suspected far-left attack on high-voltage lines, authorities said.

Schiphol Airport, on the outskirts of Amsterdam, set up hundreds of field beds overnight and served breakfast to weary travelers as staff worked to clear snow from runways and deice airplanes. At least 800 flights were canceled Wednesday at the airport, one of Europe's busiest aviation hubs.

Sonja Wurmlingel, trying to make her way home to Argentina, had to endure repeated disappointments and still was not sure how she would get back. She originally was supposed to fly via the German city of Düsseldorf, but that flight was canceled. Then she was rerouted through Paris, but that was canceled, too. The next option was taking a train to Düsseldorf.

“I've come from the train and they told me there's no train,” she said, adding, after a long pause: “I don't know.”




National airline KLM said that lines at the airport were decreasing, in part because passengers were warned on time that their flights were canceled, so they didn't head to the airport.

The Dutch rail and road networks were also hard hit by fresh snowfall during the morning rush hour and more squalls later in the day.

Rail operator NS urged travelers to “delay your journey if possible.” It warned of fewer trains operating as problems caused by the snow and icy temperatures in the Netherlands hit train travel harder than expected. Both domestic and international trains were affected, NS said.

Drivers braving the snowy conditions didn't fare much better, with more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) of traffic jams clogging the country's roads as trucks slid across highways and slow-moving snow plows cleared the roads.

France's national weather service, Meteo France, said large parts of northern and western France, including the Paris region, were on alert for snow and black ice. French authorities advised people to work from home and avoid using their cars in the snow-hit regions. Trucks and school buses were banned from using the roads. Bus traffic was suspended in Paris on Wednesday morning.

Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said that more than 100 flights were canceled Wednesday at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport and about 40 others at Paris Orly airport.

French railway company SNCF warned passengers about disruptions and delays because of weather conditions, saying that “snow on the tracks is forcing us to limit train speed and cancel trains or adjust traffic.” Eurostar trains between Paris, London and Brussels were also being delayed.

Even countries more accustomed to harsh winter weather reported problems as the snowy snap endured over large parts of Europe.

There was heavy snow in western Sweden, and authorities in Göteborg took all the city's trams out of service Wednesday morning because of the weather, broadcaster SVT reported. Snow banks churned up by passing trams posed a risk to other traffic.

In Finland, difficulties starting diesel buses that had been standing in the cold over the holidays and poor driving conditions led to bus cancellations and delays in the Helsinki area, Finnish broadcaster Yle reported.

            A prominent tycoon wanted by United States federal prosecutors for allegedly running one of Asia's largest transnational criminal networks has been arrested and extradited to China, Cambodian authorities said Wednesday.
    


Chen Zhi, 38, a national of China and Cambodia, was extradited on Tuesday after a months-long investigation by the two countries, Cambodia's Interior Ministry said in a statement. Chen's Cambodian citizenship had been revoked, the ministry added.
    


            The operation was conducted at the request of the Chinese government, the ministry said, though it is unclear what charges Chen faces in China. He was arrested alongside two other Chinese nationals.
    


            Chen is the founder and chairman of Prince Group, which bills itself as one of Cambodia's biggest conglomerates, with investments in luxury real estate, banking services, hotels, and major construction developments.
    


            But US federal prosecutors say his business empire was fueled by forced labor and cryptocurrency scams that conned victims the world over and at one point were allegedly earning Chen and his associates $30 million every day.
    


            In October, the US Treasury Department and UK Foreign Office sanctioned Prince Group and dozens of its affiliates, designating them transnational criminal organizations. Chen was charged in absentia in New York with money laundering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, along with several associates.
    


            Prosecutors also seized $15 billion in cryptocurrency from Chen following a years-long investigation, in what the Justice Department said was the largest forfeiture action in its history.
    


            Since the indictment was announced, several other jurisdictions including Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan announced seizures or freezes of hundreds of millions of dollars in assets linked to Chen.

            CNN has reached out to lawyers representing Prince Group for comment on Chen's arrest. Prince Group has previously denied engaging in unlawful activity, calling the allegations “baseless” and “aimed at justifying the unlawful seizure of assets,” according to a statement published on its website.
    


            China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said “relevant Chinese authorities” would release information regarding the case at a later date.
    


            “For a period of time, China has been actively cooperating with Cambodia and other countries to combat cross-border telecommunications and online fraud, achieving significant results,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press briefing Thursday.
    


            Cambodia has recently come under more pressure to act against the scam networks operating within its borders. In its statement, the interior ministry said Chen's arrest was “within the scope of cooperation in combating transnational crime.”
    


            The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has said the criminal networks that run the scam hubs are evolving at an unprecedented scale, despite highly publicized crackdowns last year.
    


            “This arrest reflects sustained international pressure finally reaching a point where continued inaction became untenable for Phnom Penh,” said Jacob Sims, visiting fellow at Harvard University's Asia Center and a transnational crime expert.
    


            “It defused escalating Western scrutiny while aligning with Beijing's likely preference to keep a politically sensitive case out of US and UK courts.”
    


            Analysts say Chen's extradition to China will mean it is “highly unlikely” he will face justice in the US, at least in the short term. China does not have an extradition treaty with the US and the two countries are embroiled in a deepening geopolitical and economic rivalry.
    


            “This outcome effectively shields Chen from US jurisdiction,” said Sims.
    


            The global scam industry, much of it centered in Southeast Asia, is estimated to be worth between $50 billion and $70 billion. In 2023 it conned victims in the United States alone out of at least $10 billion dollars.

            The massive industry relies on hundreds of thousands of people who have been trafficked or lured to work in heavily guarded scam compounds, where they are forced to carry out investment or romance scams known as “pig butchering,” to con ordinary people out of their life savings.
    


            US prosecutors allege Chen and others operated at least 10 forced labor camps across Cambodia since 2015 to engage in cryptocurrency investment schemes under the threat of violence.
    


            Authorities allege they laundered criminal proceeds through the business and bribed government officials to stay ahead of criminal investigations and raids on the compounds.
    


            Prince Group, American and British authorities allege, was the umbrella for more than 100 shell companies and entities allegedly used to funnel laundered cash across 12 countries and territories from Singapore to St Kitts and Nevis.
    


            Chen and others used the stolen money to buy Picasso artwork, private jets and properties in upscale neighborhoods of London, ﻿as well as supplying bribes to public officials, according to prosecutors in New York.
    


            Analysts say Chen faces a number of outstanding legal issues in China, though the charges remain opaque and have not compelled his extradition until now.
    


            “What is clear, however, is that Beijing has strong incentives to handle this quietly and internally, given the political sensitivities surrounding his business empire, its regional ties, and in particular, a number of reported ties to various Chinese government officials,” Sims said.

Fox News senior foreign policy correspondent Gillian Turner reports on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assessment of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine on ‘Special Report.' 

President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a presidential memorandum directing the U.S. to withdraw from 66 international organizations, ordering executive departments and agencies to cease participation in and funding of entities the administration says no longer serve U.S. interests.

The memorandum follows a State Department review ordered earlier this year under Executive Order 14199 and applies to 35 non-United Nations organizations and 31 United Nations entities, according to the White House.

In the memorandum, Trump said he reviewed Secretary Rubio's findings and determined it is "contrary to the interests of the U.S. to remain a member of, participate in, or otherwise provide support" to the listed organizations.

The order directs all executive departments and agencies to take immediate steps to effectuate the withdrawals as soon as possible. For United Nations entities, withdrawal means ceasing participation in or funding to the extent permitted by law.

The administration framed the move as part of Trump's broader "America First" agenda aimed at restoring American sovereignty and ending taxpayer support for organizations it views as wasteful, ineffective or contrary to U.S. interests. 

Review of additional international organizations remains ongoing, according to the White House.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the withdrawals fulfill a key commitment of Trump's presidency.

"Today, President Trump announced the U.S. is leaving 66 anti-American, useless, or wasteful international organizations," Rubio said in a post on X. "Review of additional international organizations remains ongoing."

Rubio said the administration concluded the institutions were "redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity."

"It is no longer acceptable to be sending these institutions the blood, sweat, and treasure of the American people, with little to nothing to show for it," Rubio said. "The days of billions of dollars in taxpayer money flowing to foreign interests at the expense of our people are over."

The list includes organizations involved in areas such as climate, energy, development, governance, migration and gender policy, according to the White House. The White House published the full list alongside the order.

Rubio said the withdrawals reflect a shift in how the administration views international engagement.

"We will not continue expending resources, diplomatic capital, and the legitimizing weight of our participation in institutions that are irrelevant to or in conflict with our interests," Rubio said. "We seek cooperation where it serves our people and will stand firm where it does not."

The White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

            Trump administration officials on Wednesday began outlining a makeshift strategy for taking indefinite control of Venezuela's oil sales, as they race to maintain stability within the nation after overthrowing its leader.
    


            The ambitious, multi-part plan centers on seizing and selling millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil on the open market, while simultaneously convincing US firms to make expansive, long-term investments aimed at rebuilding the nation's energy infrastructure.
    


            The US would maintain control over the initial revenue generated from the oil sales, officials told lawmakers and energy executives, with plans to ensure that those funds “benefit the Venezuelan people.”
    


            Yet just days after President Donald Trump authorized the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and declared the US “in charge,” those scrambling to map out a long-term plan for the country are still facing far more questions than they have answers.
    


            In an interview with The New York Times published Thursday, Trump said “only time will tell” when asked how long the United States will demand direct oversight of Venezuela. He also acknowledged that it would take years to revive the nation's neglected oil sector, according to the publication.
    


            One oil and gas industry source in touch with top Trump officials said, “The United States will have a lot of challenges thinking that they're just going to bring US companies down into Venezuela and they're going to operate and turn this around,” adding, “That's not reality.”
    


            The vision laid out by senior Trump officials, led by Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would represent an unprecedented exertion of control over a foreign country's oil resources with no clear timetable or guarantee of success.
    


            It raises immediate logistical challenges as well as a range of thorny legal and national security dilemmas, according to interviews with a range of industry sources and lawmakers as well as current and administration officials, threatening to entangle the US in a messy foreign policy project that could turn politically disastrous.
    


            Wright and Rubio nevertheless expressed confidence Wednesday in their approach, with Rubio telling reporters after a classified briefing on Capitol Hill that the administration was “not just winging it.”
    


            Wright, who spent the day in Miami meeting with industry executives at a Goldman Sachs conference, told CNN that he was getting “barraged” by companies telling him, “We're interested. How can we get involved?”
    


            But pressed on the specifics of the strategy, they offered only a vague sketch of a monthslong campaign that appeared still very much a work in progress.
    


            Rubio, in private briefings and conversations with lawmakers, has stressed the importance of the next several weeks in managing Venezuela's transition, including cutting off US adversaries like Russia and China from the nation's oil supply and quickly generating revenue that can be used to keep its critical services running.
    


            The administration is planning to oversee the sale of an initial 30 million to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that was already under sanction, generating an initial windfall that Rubio told lawmakers would be funneled back into the country. Over time, the US would sell more oil as it's produced, with the proceeds supporting investments in Venezuela that officials view as crucial to maintaining the interim government's stability.
    


            But the administration has so far declined to lay out a timeline for how long it will keep control of Venezuela's premier export, nor has it officially secured the cooperation of interim President Delcy Rodriguez or Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela.
    


            “The immediate thing that we've got to do is to make sure that this current operational government that's there today has got to have some resources to pay their bills,” said GOP Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Senate's Armed Services Committee. “The intent is to make sure that it doesn't go into chaos.”
    


            Petróleos de Venezuela said Wednesday that it was in negotiations to sell oil to the US, while Wright told oil executives in Miami that the administration was in “active dialogue” with Venezuela's leadership.
    


            Also unclear is the legal authority for such an arrangement, which administration officials have openly acknowledged is being negotiated with Rodriguez under the threat of paying “a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she doesn't agree, as Trump put it.
    


            Trump officials on Wednesday were also still working out how to manage the revenue generated from its sales of Venezuelan oil, telling lawmakers that the US would not rely on the Treasury Department but utilize a collection of international oil traders and offshore bank accounts to sell the oil and manage the resulting cash.
    


            The unorthodox scheme alarmed some lawmakers, raising questions over how the government would manage oversight of the money, as well as decide who gets the funds and track their distribution.
    


            “I have never in my entire life in public service and as a former (Office of Management and Budget) employee, ever heard of anything like this,” said Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico.
    


            One former US diplomat with extensive experience in the region told CNN that it didn't make sense for the Treasury Department to handle the kinds of transactions the administration appears to have in mind.
    


            “The US Treasury is not set up to handle commercial transactions like this,” the former diplomat said. “The Treasury takes in receipts from people who pay taxes, tariffs and fees. They take in money in a way that is consistent with its legally authorized mission and then it disperses those in a way which is governed by law.”
    


            Wright told CNN on Wednesday evening that the administration was “still working out the logistics” of how it plans to sell the oil and deposit the proceeds.
    


            “There's some legal things that are involved in that,” Wright said. “But whichever account this ends (up) in — I'll know in 24 hours — is going to be controlled by the United States government.”
    


            Ahead of a Friday meeting at the White House between Trump, members of his Cabinet and a handful of oil executives, there remain a number of questions about how any of this will work, such as who would control the proceeds, how much say the Venezuelan government would have, and what the visibility into the entire process would look like.
    


            “Right now, the private sector has nothing official to go on to have any sort of assurance, or any sort of confidence that whatever is going to happen, how is it going to be authorized based on US sanctions,” said Roxanna Vigil, who served as a senior sanctions policy advisor at the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    


            “My biggest concern related to all of this is how are the Venezuelan people going to benefit?” said Vigil. “Because the most vulnerable player in all of this and the one that so far has had the least say is the Venezuelan people.”
    


            Within the administration, the push to manage the immediate aftermath of Maduro's ouster has masked another looming problem: Despite Trump's insistence that US oil companies would pour into Venezuela, officials have no ready plan for convincing firms to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in rebuilding the nation's energy infrastructure.
    


            Wright held one-on-one meetings with oil executives on Wednesday after pitching the industry on Venezuela's potential, which he said would require “tens of billions of dollars and significant time.” Trump is set to host the CEOs of several major energy companies at the White House Friday in a further effort to juice enthusiasm within the sector.
    


            One energy lobbyist described frantic outreach from administration officials to the oil industry in recent days, starting with a flurry of calls on Monday aimed at fulfilling Trump's assertion that companies would quickly pledge massive investments toward restoring Venezuela.
    


            But those conversations have been largely one-sided, industry sources familiar with the discussions said.
    


            The administration is “trying to sell us on engaging and getting in,” the energy lobbyist said. “It's, ‘Hey look what we did for you. Now step up.'”
    


            That push has been met with trepidation in public and even deeper skepticism in private, the industry sources said, driven by doubts that Trump can provide the stability and security needed for companies to set up operations — and that the potential profits will be worth the risk.
    


            “Nobody wants to piss off Trump, but he's put them in a difficult position,” said another energy lobbyist, noting that executives have been spooked by reports of government repression and roving militias in the aftermath of Maduro's capture. “No company is going to say, I'll invest $3 billion and I'll go out and do the infrastructure without security.”
    


            Those concerns have extended even to some within the Trump administration, where one official told CNN it wasn't clear in the immediate hours after Maduro's capture who was in charge of coming up with a plan for the oil production — even as Trump publicly promised massive new investments.
    


            The official noted that before anything can happen, the United States will first have to ensure they can work with Rodriguez and her interim government. Wright and other officials in the meantime will have to develop a far more extensive sales pitch to convince companies to sign on to a project that some experts say could take a decade and $100 billion before it pays off in greater oil production.
    


            The Department of Energy has conducted some analysis on what exactly would need to be done in Venezuela to rebuild the oil infrastructure, including on the nation's energy grid.
    


            But industry experts told CNN that the country needed both equipment and expertise, both of which have largely dried up since the former President Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil companies in 2007 and seized their assets.
    


            “They all got screwed,” the administration official said of what, for many companies, was their last experience in Venezuela. “It's not clear yet what we we'll offer them to spend the billions needed to rebuild the infrastructure, and it's clearly a risk.”

            The Trump administration is pulling the United States out of the bedrock treaty that underpins international cooperation on climate change, along with dozens of other global bodies, according to a memorandum released by the White House Wednesday evening and an accompanying social media post.
    


            Such an action, if successful, would leave the US out of international climate change talks and could raise tensions with US allies for whom climate action is a priority.
    


            The agreement in question is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, which the US joined and Congress ratified in 1992, when George H.W. Bush was in the White House. The agreement does not require the US to cut fossil fuels or pollution, but rather sets a goal of stabilizing the amount of climate pollution in the atmosphere at a level that would “prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-caused) interference with the climate system.”
    


            It also set up a process for negotiations between countries that have come to be known as the annual UN climate summits. It was under the UNFCCC's auspices that the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1995, and the Paris Agreement in 2015 — two monumental moments of global cooperation and progress toward limiting harmful climate pollution.
    


            In addition, the agreement requires the submission of an annual national climate pollution inventory, which the Trump administration notably skipped this year.
    


            The exit from the climate treaty, and a slew of other international agencies, is another step back from the US on international cooperation.
    


            “We will not continue expending resources, diplomatic capital, and the legitimizing weight of our participation in institutions that are irrelevant to or in conflict with our interests,” Sec. of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. “We seek cooperation where it serves our people and will stand firm where it does not.”
    


            Former Sec. of State and US climate envoy John Kerry blasted the move as an expected one, yet damaging to American interests globally, calling it “a gift to China and a get out of jail free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.”
    


            President Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement for a second time on his first day in office. With Wednesday's move, the US will now become the first country to withdraw from the climate treaty, since virtually every country is a member, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
    


            Because the Senate ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, it is a legal gray area as to whether President Donald Trump can unilaterally pull the country out of it. However, if Congress plays a role, the Republican majority would presumably back the move.
    


            If successful, the withdrawal would prevent the US from officially participating in subsequent annual climate summits and could call into question the country's commitment to other longstanding agreements to which it is a party. It may also prompt other nations to reevaluate their commitments to the UNFCCC and UN climate talks, risking not just US climate progress but that of others.
    


            A US withdrawal could make it difficult for a future president to rejoin the Paris Agreement, since that agreement was struck under the auspices of the UNFCCC.
    


            The decision came following a review of major international agreements that the State Department had undertaken based on an executive order. In total, the White House directed the withdrawal of the US from 66 international organizations “that no longer serve American interests.”
    


            The list covers a wide swath of organizations and groups, including 31 UN entities, such as UN Water, UN Oceans, UN Population Fund, and the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.
    


            Trump also moved to withdraw the US from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC — a Nobel Prize-winning group that publishes reports on global warming. While the president likely can't bar US scientists from participating in IPCC reports, the move could have ramifications for federal scientists who would otherwise contribute.
    


            The list also included a number of non-UN related groups, including but not limited to the Global Counterterrorism Forum, the Pan American Institute of Geography and History, and the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine.
    


            The Trump administration has long denounced international organizations and has already withdrawn from some, like the World Health Organization.

A series of mild eruptions at the most active volcano in the Philippines has prompted the evacuation of nearly 3,000 villagers in a permanent danger zone on its foothills, officials said Wednesday.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A series of mild eruptions at the most active volcano in the Philippines has prompted the evacuation of nearly 3,000 villagers from a danger zone on its foothills, officials said Wednesday.

Authorities raised the 5-step alert around Mayon Volcano in the northeastern province of Albay to level 3 on Tuesday after detecting intermittent rockfalls, some as big as cars, from its peak crater in recent days along with deadly pyroclastic flows — a fast-moving avalanche of super-hot rock fragments, ash and gas.

Alert level 5 would indicate that a major explosive eruption, often with violent ejections of ash and debris and widespread ashfall, is underway.

“This is already an eruption, a quiet one, with lava accumulating up the peak and swelling the dome, which cracked in some parts and resulted in rockfalls, some as big as cars,” Teresito Bacolcol, the country's chief volcanologist, told The Associated Press.

He said it is too early to tell if Mayon's restiveness would worsen and lead to a major and violent eruption given the absence of other key signs of unrest, like a spike in volcanic earthquakes and high levels of sulfur dioxide emissions.

Troops, police and disaster-mitigation personnel helped evacuate more than 2,800 villagers from 729 households inside a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) radius from the volcano's crater that officials have long designated a permanent danger zone, demarcated by concrete warning signs, Albay provincial officials said.

Another 600 villagers living outside the permanent danger zone have evacuated voluntarily to government-run emergency shelters to be safely away from the volcano, Claudio Yucot, regional director of the Office of Civil Defense, said.




Entry to the permanent danger zone in the volcano's foothills is prohibited, but thousands of villagers have flouted the restrictions and made it their home or maintained farms on and off for generations. Lucrative businesses, such as sand and gravel quarrying and sightseeing tours, have also thrived openly despite the ban and the mountain's frequent eruptions — now 54 times since records began in 1616.

The 2,462-meter (8,007-foot) volcano is one of the Philippines' top tourism draws because of its near-perfect cone shape. But it's also the most active of the country's 24 restive volcanoes.

A terrifying symbol of Mayon's deadly fury is the belfry of a 16th-century Franciscan stone church which protrudes from the ground in Albay. It's all that's left of a baroque church that was buried by volcanic mudflow along with the town of Cagsawa in an 1814 eruption which killed about 1,200 people, including many who sought refuge in the church, about 13 kilometers (8 miles) from the volcano.

The thousands of people who live within Mayon's danger zone reflect the plight of many impoverished Filipinos who are forced to live in dangerous places across the archipelago — near active volcanoes like Mayon, on landslide-prone mountainsides, along vulnerable coastlines, atop earthquake fault lines, and in low-lying villages often engulfed by flash floods.

Each year, about 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines, which lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of fault lines along the Pacific Ocean basin often hit by volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

Business Insider is taking on CES 2026.

I'm on the ground in Las Vegas from Tuesday to Thursday, taking in all there is to know about the latest in the driverless space.

Robotaxis and self-driving cars have already had an outsize presence at the tech conference, especially in the previous hype cycle of the late 2010s and early 2020s.

Things have changed since then. The industry has largely moved on from mere concepts and technology validation to: How are we going to realistically scale autonomy?

It's day one of the conference, and there's already a lot to take in.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Alpamayo family, which will serve as an autonomous-driving stack for OEMs to deal with those stubborn edge cases — or the "long tail" of self-driving.

Uber and Nuro showed off an early look at the Lucid Gravity SUV that the companies hope public riders will be able to take by late 2026.

I'll be spending less time at keynotes and speaker events and more on real-life demonstrations and meetings with industry leaders and commentators in autonomy

Think of this as my personal notebook, where I jot down everything I've learned and seen at the conference.

Check back in for more updates.

This is the first year Zoox, an Amazon-backed robotaxi company, will be giving live demonstrations of its service during CES.

I got to take a ride in one on Monday night in front of Resorts World. (The company tagline that I saw from an ad at the Harry Reid International Airport was: "Don't just do the Strip. Zoox it.")

My immediate thoughts were that Zoox feels unlike any other robotaxi or pseudo-robotaxi on the market. It felt more like I was on a theme park ride than in an everyday car we're familiar with.

Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Zoox is not a regular car you could buy that's been retrofitted with sensors. The Zoox car is bi-directional — meaning there's no real front or back of the car — and the inside has no steering wheel, just seats.

The robotaxis were clearly a great tourist attraction from what I saw. My Uber driver wasn't too happy about them.

Uber, Lucid, and Nuro had a swanky cocktail hour at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, where they quite literally wined and dined a room full of reporters, analysts, and investors: endless glasses of wine and an open bar, lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, too many appetizers to count, and a giant charcuterie board — the works.

Maybe understandably so? 2026 will be a big year for the three companies.

Uber's plan is to roll out a robotaxi service by late 2026. The first market is San Francisco, where Uber will directly compete with Waymo. These two companies are partners in other markets, like Austin.

"We've been moving very, very quickly," Nuro's co-CEO and cofounder Dave Ferguson said. "We signed this partnership last July. We're already testing the production-intent vehicles on public roads. And very soon, we're going to have tens of thousands of them worldwide."

A quick image to get a sense of how big CES's mobility division is at West Hall of the convention center: There's a 60,000-pound combine from John Deere that's sitting in the middle of the showroom.

The combine is one of the world's largest on the market, according to Julian Sanchez, an engineer at the machinery company.

Even so, John Deere doesn't even have the largest footprint on the floor. This year, it's Hyundai.

The combine isn't autonomous in the way we think about self-driving cars, Sanchez told me, but it is self-steering.

There's a lot of talk of self-driving cars in the automotive industry, but the scope of what it can realistically achieve has narrowed down in the last decade or so.

Paul Costa, an ex-Apple veteran of 25 years who worked on the company's abandoned self-driving car project, gave me a bit of interesting color from what he saw at CES in 2015 — when the driverless car hype was reaching its peak — and what's different now.

"My sense at the time was that people really wanted to focus on Level 5 autonomy," Costa, who now leads Ford's electrical engineering team, told me. Level 5 is the highest level of autonomous driving set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers. That means full autonomy in all weather conditions and no geofences. Waymo is currently Level 4.

The tone has been brought down to reality, according to Costa. The focus is on highly advanced driver assistance systems and eyes-off driving or Level 3 systems, he said.

"Now, I feel like here in 2026, L3 is extremely interesting," Costa said. "It's interesting for me to see how the industry — its focus has changed over the years."

AV operators, like Waymo, Uber, or Lyft, need to know the lifespans of their vehicles to determine the true cost of staying in business.

Stephen Hayes, VP of Lyft's autonomous vehicle program, told me that the "lifetime mileage" the company can accrue on a robotaxi is still unknown.

"How long will an AV last?" Hayes said. "Today, we're in the early innings, obviously, of the autonomous transition and very few AV players have vehicles on the road that have run hundreds of thousands of miles."

Part of the business proposition for ride-hailing companies like Lyft is reselling its fleet of vehicles, also known as remarketing. Lyft owns a fleet through its subsidiary called Flexdrive. For robotaxis, remarketing remains an "unknown," Hayes said.

"There's no market for it," he said. "There's no secondary market where it's like, 'Hey, I want to go buy a used AV.' Ten years from now, it's going to look completely different, but we don't know in what ways."

Hyundai Motor Group has the largest footprint at CES this year, showcasing the company's latest in robotics development.

The booth contains Hyundai's Ioniq 5 robotaxi developed through a joint venture between the automaker and Motional.

However, the star of the show is undoubtedly Atlas, the humanoid robot built by Hyundai's Boston Dynamics unit.

I was told by a Boston Dynamics representative on a Wednesday afternoon that the wait-time to step inside the booth was around two hours.

Ford announced on Wednesday that it will be making in-house hardware and software to deploy eyes-off driving capabilities by 2028.

This comes about a month after Rivian announced it would be pursuing fully-autonomous driving by making its own silicon chip.

Ford's rationale is that going in-house is cheaper than seeking outside suppliers and provides greater oversight on how the technology is deployed.

I talked to Chris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, to get some insight behind why automakers might want to pursue an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) on their own instead of licensing software from companies that are ahead of the curve.

Ahn said automakers need to decide what level of autonomy their customer base wants and that won't look the same across the board.

"People who own Fords, own Fords for certain reasons that are probably different reasons on why people who own Mercedes own Mercedes," he said. "And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today, which is a fundamentally different way to think about AV than what we were thinking about three, four, five years ago, which was just level five autonomy everywhere."

The U.S. government is considering investing in a company's critical minerals mining projects in Greenland, its CEO has told CNBC, ahead of high-stakes talks between Washington and Danish officials over the island's future.

The projects are run by mining company Amaroq, which operates in South Greenland and is involved in extracting or exploring gold, copper, germanium and gallium, among other critical mineral deposits.

Discussions with U.S. government bodies about the potential investment opportunities are ongoing and haven't been finalized, Amaroq CEO Eldur Olafsson told CNBC in an interview.

Deals could involve "offtake agreements, infrastructure support and credit lines," Olafsson added, though he declined to comment on what specific projects the U.S. government was interested in.

When asked to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told CNBC: "The United States is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland.

"President Trump reiterated the importance of Greenland to U.S. defense and underscored his commitment to the relationship by designating Governor Landry as Special Envoy to Greenland."

CNBC approached the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) for comment but had not received a response as this article went live.

Olafsson's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up talk of acquiring Greenland, which he sees as integral to national security, following a dramatic military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday.

European nations have been scrambling to respond to escalating rhetoric about Greenland from the U.S., which has refused to rule out military action.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to meet with officials from Denmark next week to discuss Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.

The White House sees Greenland's deposits as a potential way to break China's dominance in the critical minerals space.

Rare earth companies with projects in the Arctic island surged earlier this week on U.S. comments about acquiring the Arctic island.

Trump has mainly emphasized national security when discussing Greenland in recent days, but former national security advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News in January 2025 that U.S. interest in the island was about "critical minerals."

Some experts have cautioned that extracting critical minerals from Greenland isn't economically viable due to the harsh conditions and lack of infrastructure, but Olafsson told CNBC that it was realistic with proper planning and logistics.

He compared the process to significant critical minerals mines in Russia and Alaska, which, he said, were built in similar conditions.

He said that "one of the biggest challenges in any mining project is usually some [transporting minerals] long distances on land," but added that many of Greenland's mineral deposits were near "deep fjords," meaning they could be easier to ship. 

Climate change has transformed some parts of Greenland, with ice melting to reveal wetlands, areas of shrub and barren rock. 

This has made some of the island's strategic minerals more accessible for mining firms.

The Senate on Thursday voted 52-47 to block President Donald Trump from further military action in Venezuela. 

The move came less than a week after Trump authorized a strike that captured the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro.

The measure, known as a War Powers Resolution, only needed a simple majority to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate and would require Trump to seek the approval of Congress before using the U.S. military again in Venezuela. The measure was brought by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. 

The vote in the Senate was procedural, but it indicates that the measure has the votes to pass when it comes to a final vote in the Senate. It would then go to the House, where Republicans have a razor-thin majority.

"Make no mistake, bombing another nation's capital and removing their leader is an act of war plain and simple. No provision in the Constitution provides such power to the presidency," Paul said in a statement.

The Constitution vests Congress with the authority to declare war. 

Trump and his allies in Congress have argued he did not need to consult Congress on the strike that captured Maduro, which they say was a law enforcement operation. Maduro is now facing drug-related charges in New York. 

The Senate shot down a similar resolution in November, after only two Republicans — Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska —  joined all Democrats in voting for it. Trump engaged in a months-long military buildup around Venezuela before the action that captured Maduro.

Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, voted for the measure.

"While I support the operation to seize Nicolas Maduro, which was extraordinary in its precision and complexity, I do not support committing additional U.S. forces or entering into any long-term military involvement in Venezuela or Greenland without specific congressional authorization," Collins said in a statement.

President Donald Trump's renewed focus on housing affordability has found a clear villain: institutional investors that own large swaths of single-family homes in fast-growing Sun Belt cities, where would-be homeowners increasingly find themselves bidding against Wall Street.

Trump argued in a social media post Wednesday that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans, saying he's immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes. 

The message may be aimed at places like Atlanta and Jacksonville, metropolitan areas where investor ownership is far higher than the national average. 

While institutional investors only own roughly 2% of the nation's single-family rental housing stock, their presence is far more concentrated in parts of the Southeast. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates, for example, that investors control about a quarter of Atlanta's single-family rental market, more than a fifth of Jacksonville's and sizable shares in Charlotte and Tampa.

Those concentrations trace back to the aftermath of the financial crisis, when large investors moved aggressively into housing markets flooded with foreclosures. By buying homes in bulk, they helped stabilize prices in hard-hit regions experiencing sharp declines, particularly across the Sun Belt, according to Wolfe Research. 

"While their overall footprint is limited, ownership is heavily concentrated in Sun Belt cities, likely reflecting expectations of stronger home price appreciation," analysts at Wolfe said in a recent note to clients.

The idea of curbing Wall Street's role in housing isn't new. Analysts at BTIG note that Congress has seen multiple efforts in recent years to rein in institutional homeownership, ranging from tighter regulations and financing limits to outright ownership bans and even forced liquidations. 

"Bureaucratic limitations have historically hindered the legislation in Congress, and as it stands now most bills remain in the 'Introduced' phase," BTIG said in a note. 

Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. The president said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.

CrowdStrike announced Thursday that it is buying identity management startup SGNL in a deal valued at nearly $740 million as the cybersecurity provider beefs up defenses in the age of artificial intelligence cyberattacks.

Shares fell nearly 4%. 

The acquisition will help users of CrowdStrike's Falcon cloud security platform better manage human and AI identity access requests and real-time risks, the company said. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of the 2027 fiscal year.

"This is a massive opportunity for our customers to be able to protect themselves, and a massive opportunity for us to disrupt the identity market," CEO George Kurtz said in an exclusive interview with CNBC. 

He said the deal will help advance CrowdStrike's foothold in the multibillion-dollar identity security business, which totaled $435 million at the end of the second quarter and has become one of the most significant attack vectors. 

Companies have been bolstering identity security defenses as AI heightens the sophistication of cyberattacks. 

Last year, Microsoft was hit with a wave of attacks targeting its SharePoint collaboration tool and large language model startup Anthropic disclosed the first documented AI-led cyberattack in November.  

SGNL, which is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, raised $30 million in an early funding round in February. The company's backers include Cisco Investments and Microsoft's Venture Fund. 

The company was founded in 2021 by Scott Kriz and Erik Gustavson, whose previous startup was acquired by Google in 2017. Both founders worked at the search giant for more than four years.

Cybersecurity providers such as CrowdStrike have ramped up acquisitions in recent months to offer a fuller suite of capabilities to customers in an increasingly competitive market. 

Businesses are also leaning into more autonomous agent-powered AI solutions to manage cybersecurity tools. 

Last year, competitor Palo Alto Networks scooped up Israeli startup CyberArk for $25 billion in a big bet from CEO Nikesh Arora and Google landed cloud security startup Wiz for $32 billion.

In 2025, CrowdStrike announced plans to buy AI agentic security platform Pangea and Spanish data startup Onum. 

Kurtz said the company's acquisition strategy is to buy successful teams and innovative technology over legacy tools. 

"We want to offer the most value to our customers where they can consolidate on CrowdStrike — less vendors, less complexities, less cost and with a better outcome of stopping breaches," he said.

Thirty million. It's a big number. Maybe not in the context of business news, where we usually talk about company valuations that are in the billions, or even trillions. But when we're talking about people, 30 million is a very big number. 

Thirty million is the number of people that the National Organization of Rare Disorders estimates are living with a rare disease in the United States.

Defining a rare disease can be tricky. In the U.S., a disease is considered rare if fewer than 200,000 Americans are diagnosed with it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that works out to be less than 7 in 10,000 people. In the European Union, a disease is classified as rare if it affects no more than 5 in 10,000 people. In China, it's 1 in 10,000. Any way you define it, patient populations within the rare disease community are smaller than those diagnosed with more well-known diseases like Alzheimer's, which the Alzheimer's Association estimates stood at more than 7 million in the U.S. as of last year. But when you consider that there are more than 10,000 rare diseases, and as many as 400 million people suffering from them worldwide, you start to take notice.

That's why we're launching CNBC Cures, a new initiative to help raise awareness of rare diseases and improve patient outcomes for people living with them. Led by "Squawk Box " anchor Becky Quick, the initiative was inspired by her family's own rare disease journey. 

Quick's youngest daughter, Kaylie, was just 7 months old when Becky first suspected that something wasn't right. 

"She was not meeting some of her developmental milestones, and I was worried about it," Quick said.

Kaylie visited several doctors, and at first, none of them seemed concerned. But after several months, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician diagnosed Kaylie with global developmental delay, a broad term given to a child that is significantly delayed in hitting developmental milestones, like walking and talking. But the diagnosis didn't point to a cause. 

Her family was left grasping for answers until just before Kaylie's third birthday, when a genetic test revealed the root cause of Kaylie's struggles. She had SYNGAP1, a rare genetic disease that has only been diagnosed in about 1,700 people in the world.

"Our neurologist didn't know what it was," said Quick. "She told us, 'You'll probably know more about this by the end of the weekend than I do.' And we did."

"We ran to Google and started googling things," Quick explained. "There were researchers who were already doing work, and thank God they had been. That's why we knew as much as we did about SYNGAP1."

SynGAP is a protein crucial to brain development. It helps with learning and memory, and also with regulating communication in the synapses of the brain. Kaylie has a genetic mutation in her SYNGAP1 gene that causes her brain to get only about half the SynGAP protein it should be getting. That makes it difficult for the neurons in her brain to communicate effectively with each other.

Despite SYNGAP1's small patient population, it is thought to be much more prevalent than it once was. Mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene are surprisingly common and are estimated to account for between 1%-2% of all intellectual disabilities. An article published by CURE SYNGAP1 indicates the figure could be as high as 76,000 in the U.S. alone. But because most doctors don't know the symptoms of SYNGAP1, and the vast majority of newborns aren't screened for genetic diseases at birth, it's believed that most cases of SYNGAP1, like many rare diseases, go undiagnosed.

SYNGAP1 is a spectrum disorder, meaning not all patients are affected the same way or with the same severity. It's common for SYNGAP1 patients to have seizure disorders, intellectual disabilities, autism, motor skill delays, difficulty forming speech, balance and coordination issues, and high pain thresholds. Kaylie has all these symptoms.

As Kaylie grew and became more mobile, dealing with her symptoms became more difficult.

"We have all the doors locked all the time so that she doesn't walk out. She doesn't know to call out if she needs help," said Quick. "She used to fall and hurt herself and not even realize it or say anything. You'd see the blood, or you'd see the bruise," Quick added. 

Despite her physical challenges, Quick says Kaylie is still a happy and active kid. "She can do all of these things that people thought maybe she couldn't. She doesn't just walk. She runs. She runs everywhere, through the house, through the outside. She jumps. She's a daredevil. She loves roller coasters … she loves movement," Quick added.

There is no cure for SYNGAP1. There are several treatments in development, though none have yet progressed beyond clinical trials.

Progress has been made in identifying more individuals with SYNGAP1. A 2019 census found just 484 patients worldwide. Shortly after Kaylie's diagnosis, that figure jumped to 1,000. It now stands at more than 1,700 globally. 

Expanded access to genetic screening for newborns, a cause nearly everyone in the rare disease community is rallying behind, could help further identify more SYNGAP1 patients. That's key when dealing with rare diseases because a bigger patient pool can attract more research and funding for treatments. It also helps regulators better understand the scope of a disease, which can ultimately get those treatments to market more quickly.

While there is no treatment that Kaylie can take to reverse her disorder, her parents have put in place a routine anchored by her therapists, her family, and a strong support system to help her battle through the many challenges she faces. 

"She works really hard every day. Every single day Kaylie works harder than any of the rest of us, and that's just who she is," Quick said. 

"She loves her sisters and her brother. She loves her cousins and she loves her family. She's got friends at school … she is just happy every single day, and I am grateful for that."

"I've been amazed at how many people are going through something similar," Quick said. "The idea that this is a universal struggle that so many people are going through … that kind of got the wheels turning for us."

"We're the lucky ones. We have resources," Quick said. She and her family began to think about how they could make a difference for others navigating a rare disease diagnosis.

Rare diseases often go overlooked by investors and pharmaceutical companies. As a result, patients diagnosed with a rare disease usually go underserved by the medical community. Smaller diagnosed patient populations make it difficult to attract funding for research into rare disease treatments. And where promising research does exist, those smaller patient populations make it more difficult for potentially lifesaving treatments to clear regulatory hurdles and get to the patients that need them. 

This is where Quick saw an opportunity to make a difference. 

"We thought, you know, CNBC has a pretty unique audience. It's got an influential audience. It's an audience of people who know how to get things done. Why not tap into what they can bring to the table too?" she said.

CNBC Cures is teaming up with some of the nation's top researchers, doctors, regulators and patient advocacy groups. 

The initiative's goal is to help build a community that can break down barriers that can limit treatment options and isolate those living with a rare disease. Through our storytelling and live events, we'll work to identify the most innovative scientific developments in the rare disease space and put a spotlight on the bottlenecks preventing them from getting to the patients who need them. 

We'll bring you moving and inspirational stories about the individuals changing the way we think about rare diseases and offer a space where you can share your own rare disease journey with us. And we'll share perspectives from the most prominent investors in the space, highlighting where they see opportunities for healthy returns, and for transforming health care as we know it.

Here's how we'll do it:

The truth is that the term rare disease is misleading. The odds are that almost all of us know someone who is impacted by a rare disease, and the millions who make up this community are more connected than we think. Every week scientists are finding new evidence that shows if you can figure out how to effectively treat one rare disease, there are countless others that can be treated using similar mechanisms. And advancements made in rare diseases are offering new hope for breakthroughs in everything from Alzheimer's, to cancer, and heart disease.

These are just a few of the themes we want to explore with CNBC Cures in the coming year. It's a journey we're on together, and together we can make a difference.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday pressed the administration's desire for lower interest rates, saying they are the key to future economic growth.

In a speech he will deliver before the Economic Club of Minnesota, Bessent backed President Donald Trump's economic agenda and said easier monetary policy will help pave the way for gains ahead.

"Cutting interest rates will have a tangible impact on the lives of every Minnesotan," he said, according to excerpts obtained in an official draft from an administration source. "It is the only ingredient missing for even stronger economic growth. Which is why the Fed should not delay."

The Federal Reserve approved three consecutive interest rate cuts in the final four months of 2025, totaling 0.75 percentage point and taking the central bank's key interest rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.

However, the pace of reductions is expected to slow considerably this year, with markets pricing in just two cuts and the most recent projections from Fed officials pointing to just one. 

One wild card in that equation is that the Fed will get a new chair this year, a process that Bessent is overseeing. Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May, and the Treasury secretary has whittled down the candidates to five. National Economic Council leader Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are the two betting favorites to get the position.

While lower interest rates carry the threat of reigniting inflation, they also could help support a slowing labor market.

"In 2025, the President laid the foundation for robust economic growth with: the historic passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, trade deals that rewrote decades of global misalignment; and an ambitious deregulation agenda that empowered American entrepreneurs and businesses," Bessent said. "Now, in 2026, we will reap the rewards of President Trump's America First agenda."

Bessent will deliver the speech at 12:45 p.m. ET.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Kevin Hassett is leader of the National Economic Council.

Happy Thursday. If you can't already tell from reading this newsletter, I'm a big cliché user. So with the S&P 500's first losing day of the year, maybe traders can seek solace from the age-old saying: It's a marathon, not a sprint.

Stock futures are lower this morning after a mixed session.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The Trump administration announced a flurry of market-moving policy plans yesterday that could reshape everything from what we eat to the path to home ownership. 

Here's what to know:

As the fallout from the U.S.' overthrow of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro continues, all eyes are on the country's oil. Trump on Tuesday said Venezuela would turn over up to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S., but sources close to the White House told CNBC yesterday that those were only the first barrels and that shipments would continue indefinitely.

The White House said yesterday that Trump reserves the right to use military force to protect U.S. oil workers in Venezuela. The South American country would also use revenue from its oil sales to purchase American products, Trump said on social media.

Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC yesterday that debts owed by Venezuela to ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil were not an immediate priority for the Trump administration. CEOs from both companies, as well as a representative from Chevron, are expected to meet with Trump on Friday.

Moving across the Atlantic Ocean: Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters yesterday that he would meet with Danish officials about Greenland next week. News of the talks comes as Trump reiterates his threats to take over the island to bolster U.S. national security.

But as CNBC's Dan Mangan notes, Denmark's leaders aren't taking these comments on the chin. On Tuesday, Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said the European country would spend the equivalent of $13.8 billion to rearm Greenland given "the serious security situation we find ourselves in."

In Washington, some congressional Republicans are brushing off Trump's threats. As Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., put it, Trump sometimes negotiates using an "everything is on the table" strategy.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis fatally shot a woman in her car yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Top DHS officials claimed the woman engaged in an "act of domestic terrorism" by attempting to run down ICE agents. But Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey both rejected that description of events, with the latter calling it "bulls---" and "a garbage narrative."

The shooting comes amid increasing tensions in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as more than 2,000 government agents descend on the area for immigration enforcement. Walz and other elected officials called for the agents to leave Minneapolis following the shooting: "I have a simple message: We don't need any further help from the federal government," the governor said. "To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem: You've done enough."

Ford is planning to enter the eyes-off driving arena. The Detroit automaker said last night that it will begin rolling out the technology in 2028 with a $30,000 all-electric vehicle.

As CNBC's Michael Wayland notes, Ford joins a bevy of fellow automakers looking to launch similar systems. But Ford's plan to start with a typical electric vehicle, rather than a higher-priced car, is unique. The move is tied to a strategy of "putting our best and newest technology where the volume is and where the accessibility is," Ford executive Doug Field told CNBC.

Alphabet surpassed Apple in market cap for the first time since 2019 yesterday, the latest sign of how the tech giants are diverging on artificial intelligence. See for yourself how the two have stacked up over the years:

CNBC's Dan Mangan, Amelia Lucas, Kevin Breuninger, Yun Li, Sean Conlon, Spencer Kimball, Jennifer Elias, Brian Sullivan, Garrett Downs, Michael Wayland and Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

Google is adding more Gemini features to Gmail, providing upgrades like artificial intelligence-generated summaries of email threads, the company said Thursday.

The company said its latest updates will be rolled out in phases, and some features will be turned on by default in inboxes, meaning users who don't want them will have to opt out.

"When you open an email with dozens of replies, Gmail synthesizes the entire conversation into a concise summary of key points," Google wrote in a blog post.

The company said AI Overviews, which show up at the top of search results, are also being added to Gmail.

The updates come as Google embeds its Gemini AI technology across its wide portfolio of consumer products. Google is counting on its massive customer base to provide an advantage as the company takes on the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic and others in the booming generative AI market. 

Google says Gmail now has more than 3 billion users.

Last year, Google's Gemini integration in Gmail allowed users to do things like search messages, draft emails from prompts, improve grammar and generate custom responses.

One of the new features is "Suggested Replies," which Google says uses the context of a user's emails to create one-click responses. It's an update to a prior tool called "Smart Replies." The company is also upgrading a proofreading option for checking grammar and making messages more concise. 

Driven by its rapid advancements in AI, Google parent Alphabet topped Apple by market cap on Wednesday for the first time since 2019, continuing a rally that made the stock the best performer among tech megacaps last year. Meanwhile, OpenAI soared to a private market valuation of $500 billion late last year, and Anthropic said Wednesday that it's valued at $350 billion in a new funding round.

The U.S. housing market has yet to pick up steam into 2026, but real estate agents say there's been a real shift toward a more balanced market, according to the quarterly CNBC Housing Market Survey.

Mortgage rates didn't move much at all in the last quarter of 2025, but home prices are steadily easing. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage dropped sharply in the third quarter but then stabilized between 6.2% and 6.4% during the fourth quarter, leaving some buyers on the sidelines with no incentive to jump in.

Now, there are early signs of what could be more activity ahead. 

"The buyers I have seen have been buying because of life circumstances, whether it's having a baby or moving for a job or retiring or downsizing," said Ashley Rummage, a real estate agent in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Of the real estate agents surveyed by CNBC in the fourth quarter, 37.5% said it was a balanced market, rather than the buyer's market they reported seeing in the third quarter. That is up from 30% as of the third quarter and is likely because consumers became less confident in the economy as job losses grew. 

"The people who had been moving and the momentum that we had were definitely slowed down, far, far less by interest rates than the intrinsic factors, the cost of living," said Heather Dell, a real estate agent in Detroit. "Homeowners insurance, car insurance and utilities and medical insurance are the top objections that I hear when a buyer talks about buying." 

The CNBC Housing Market Survey is a national inquiry of real estate agents selected randomly across the United States. Responses for the fourth-quarter survey were collected between Dec. 10 and Dec. 17. This quarter, 72 agents shared their insights. 

While the majority of agents said it is still a buyer's market due to easing prices and more inventory for sale, some agents noted that their buyers and sellers still have very different expectations.

"Buyers tend to think that the market is like 2008 and sellers tend to think that the market is closer to 2021, 2022, and those are diametrically opposed markets and diametrically opposed mindsets," said John Fragola, a real estate agent in Charleston, South Carolina. 

Of course, 2008 was the start of the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to the Great Recession and housing crash, when the market was flooded with distressed homes, giving buyers all the power. Meanwhile, 2021 came shortly after the start of the Covid pandemic, when there was a buying frenzy and inventory dropped to record lows, giving sellers all the power.

The balance in the market now is likely coming due to easing prices. 

More agents, 92%, reported having at least one seller cut their price in the fourth quarter, compared with  89% in the previous quarter, according to CNBC's survey. Nearly half of respondents said the majority of their sellers cut prices. 

"Concessions have gotten bigger, especially in my market," Rummage said. "At the beginning of the year, unfortunately, a lot of sellers were still stuck in the 2021 mindset, but as the year has gone by and their listings sat, they had to get more comfortable with understanding the fact that they were probably going to have to offer some concessions to get the transaction done."

While prices are easing, they are still historically high, but buyers appear to be getting used to that as the new normal. 

When asked how affordability is impacting their buyers, agents said fewer buyers left the market in the fourth quarter than in the prior period, and fewer delayed purchases. They also compromised less on things like home size, features and location.

Cutting prices, however, is not all that palatable to sellers, and more agents reported they had to delist properties than during the third quarter. 

"I personally had some clients who said, 'Let's just pause, pump the brakes here and we'll come back on in the spring market when there's more buyers out,"' said Fragola. 

As for the new year, despite the slow end to 2025, 67.8% of agents said they expected sales to improve in the first quarter. Fully 77% of agents said they expect the full year 2026 to be better than last year. 

There is more inventory on the market now, and some agents said they think consumers are getting used to current economic conditions.

"I think a lot of people are feeling a little bit more comfortable with the unknown," Rummage said. "Sentiment has shifted from anxiety to cautious optimism."

Microsoft wants to overhaul GitHub to compete with AI coding rivals and embrace AI agents, and the company has started reshuffling teams to make that happen, according to people familiar with the changes.

GitHub is a leading software development platform that Microsoft acquired in 2018. GitHub had an early lead because of its popularity as a place to store code. Lately, though, GitHub has faced more competition from AI tools such as Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code.

Microsoft in January 2025 formed a new group focused on building AI tools under ex-Facebook engineering boss Jay Parikh. The group, called CoreAI Platform and Tools, combined Microsoft's developer division, AI platform team, and GitHub.

Still, Microsoft and GitHub have remained somewhat separate, and the company has been moving people and resources around over the past few months to better coordinate efforts such as sales, one of the people said. The latest change, happening this week, is moving a small group of Microsoft engineers over to GitHub.

The goal, the people said, is to better compete with AI coding tools that rival GitHub Copilot, while getting in the race to build AI agents and fulfill Parikh's vision to build an "agent factory."

In an internal meeting late last year, Parikh spoke about needing to overhaul GitHub to compete with Cursor and Claude Code, according to audio reviewed by Business Insider.

"GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code," Parikh said at the time. "We want it to be the center of gravity for all of AI-powered software development."

Microsoft wants GitHub's AI tools to be available wherever developers work, not just inside one app, to wants to make GitHub a kind of dashboard for managing multiple AI agents.

The latest changes are also part of what Parikh said would be new investment in improving the basic parts of GitHub. In the meeting, Parikh said those include making improvements to its GitHub Actions tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code, analytics and insights tools so teams can see how their code is performing, security for keeping the code safe, and making sure the company can meet local data storage rules to offer GitHub in new countries.

Ford said it's developing autonomous capabilities, such as eyes-off driving, that will be ready for public roads by 2028.

The legacy automaker said in an announcement on Wednesday that it will be cheaper to develop self-driving technology in-house than to seek an outside supplier.

"Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable," Ford announced during CES in Las Vegas.

Chris Morse, a spokesperson for Ford, told Business Insider that the cost is compared to "the supplier system that we have on-road today." A specific supplier was not named.

Key team members behind Ford's ADAS ambitions gave Business Insider a broad overview of some of the advantages of an in-house approach.

Sammy Omari, head of ADAS and infotainment at Ford Motor Company, said the company can have greater oversight over how the sensors are utilized and integrated into the vehicles.

"How can we now combine the information from all these sensors in the most cost-effective way to get to the highest performance?" he said. "These are some of the key reasons why we can get to that price point."

Paul Costa, a former Apple employee who now leads Ford's electrical engineering team, told Business Insider that the company can reduce the number of separate computer modules inside its vehicles — an ADAS computer, an infotainment system, an audio system, and a networking computer — into one computer without having to compromise performance.

Costa said Ford has "great suppliers," but seeking third parties doesn't allow for integration of modules, and the size of the computers themselves is larger.

"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers," he said. "We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance."

There are several players in the business of licensing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for car makers, including Nvidia, Waymo, and Wayve, among others. Ford previously announced a partnership with Mobileye in 2020 to develop its ADAS software, called BlueCruise.

A spokesperson for Mobileye declined to comment.

Leading EV companies in the US — namely Tesla and Rivian — have taken an in-house approach to developing their own self-driving technology. Rivian announced earlier in December that it designed its own silicon chip to power the autonomous driving computer inside its future vehicles.

Costa told Business Insider that Ford isn't interested in making its own chip and the automaker is happy with its current suppliers.

"We're not interested in a TOPS war," Costa said, referring to a metric chipmakers commonly like to tout.

"Honestly, I don't want custom silicon," he later added. "If I can get other people's volume on silicon that I need, that is good for democratization."

President Donald Trump took executive action aimed at defense contractors after a series of Truth Social posts.

The president signed an executive order on Wednesday that would ban defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends "until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget."

"Every firm across our economy has a right to profit from prudent investment and hard work, but the American defense industrial base also has the responsibility to ensure that America's warfighters have the best possible equipment and weapons," the order said.

Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said he would "not permit" stock buybacks or dividends from US defense companies in a post on Truth Social.

In his post, the president blasted defense contractors for issuing "massive" dividends and buying back their stock. He said he wouldn't permit such practices until defense firms sped up production.

"Therefore, I will not permit Dividends or Stock Buybacks for Defense Companies until such time as these problems are rectified," he wrote. "MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH!"

Trump also took issue with what he called "exorbitant and unjustifiable" compensation packages for industry executives. Until companies build "NEW and MODERN" production plants, defense execs should be making no more than $5 million, he said, without providing details on how those guidelines would be implemented.

He later singled out Raytheon in a Truth Social post.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.

Defense stocks fell after Trump's Truth Social post on Wednesday. Notable movers include:

General Dynamics: -4%

UPDATED 12:25 EST / JANUARY 08 2026

Digital asset custody and infrastructure firm Fireblocks Inc. has acquired Tres Finance Ltd., a leading provider of crypto accounting, reconciliation and financial management suite for digital assets.

Fireblocks said Wednesday that for years, the cryptocurrency industry has grown from facilitating global payments using digital currency such as stablecoins and generating value using tokenized assets to create a financial ecosystem using the blockchain. With these evolutions, business opportunities continue to grow, creating new operational overheads.

Amid these new needs are tax compliance records for financial operations, and this led the company to ink the deal to buy Tres Finance to build financial controls directly into its infrastructure and virtual asset management platform.

The digital asset regulatory landscape is quickly crystallizing, especially in the United States and the European Union. The U.S. recently passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act in October, providing a framework for banks and businesses to interact with digital assets permissively and the EU passed Markets in Crypto-Assets in 2022, providing a focus on stablecoins.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that maintains parity with another currency, such as the U.S. dollar. This makes stablecoins ideal for retail exchange or as a bridge to more volatile currencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum.

Traditional financial institutions continue to expand their adoption of digital assets and provide them to both businesses and consumers. Banks now tokenize deposits, companies such as PayPal Inc. and Square Inc. offer stablecoin and crypto payments, and neobanks have begun to open treasury and wallets using cryptocurrency and stablecoins.

Blockchain enthusiasts tout that this enables faster settlements, lower costs and the ability to provide payments across borders with less challenge than traditional payment rails.

However, the current cryptocurrency token and cryptocurrency management services lack built-in accounting and reporting systems that interconnect well with existing traditional finance. Fireblocks said this is a gap that Tres Finance will help solve.

Since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, Crypto Twitter has been speculating if the country's regime holds a Bitcoin stockpile and how big it is. 

Venezuela has been haunted by hyperinflation for decades, which has forced its citizens to turn to digital assets and made Venezuela the 11th top country for digital-asset adoption in 2025, according to TRM Labs.

But does the country actually own a large stack of Bitcoin or is it just social media conjecture?

Here's everything we know about Venezuela's supposed crypto riches.

While a much circulated newsletter by Bradley Hope's Whale Hunting suggests that the Maduro regime sits on 600,000 Bitcoin worth billions of dollars, it is just hypothetical and not based on any hard evidence. 

Blockchain forensics firms told DL News that they've struggled to find any Bitcoin at all held by the regime.

“We have not identified any such holdings at present,” Matteo Colledan, VP of business development at blockchain surveillance firm Arkham, told DL News. “We are still assessing whether any holdings exist.”

Global Head of Policy at TRM Labs, Ari Redbord, added that while the firm was looking for a centralised government stockpile, the country's crypto exposure was more “fragmented, opportunistic, and adaptive, rather than the deliberate accumulation of a sovereign crypto reserve.”

Redbord told DL News that while they continue to investigate all credible angles, “we are not currently seeing onchain data that supports the existence of a large, centrally managed Venezuelan state Bitcoin treasury anywhere near the scale being suggested.” 

Venezuela's ties to crypto are real, however. 

In 2018, the government launched the Petro, an oil-backed digital currency that was widely criticised as a sanctions evasion tool that largely failed to gain traction.

TRM Labs said in a December report that state entities were directed to use digital-asset payment mechanisms for oil-related and cross-border transactions. 

Then there's citizen adoption. Venezuela's hyperinflation — the country recorded a 500% inflation rate in 2025 — has driven the local population to stablecoins and Bitcoin as a hedge against the collapsing bolívar. 

Bitcoin mining has also flourished due to the country's cheap energy, although the government has cracked down on unauthorised operations and seized equipment.

Nobel peace prize winner and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who is hoping to lead the country, even spoke in September 2024 of how Bitcoin is a “vital means of resistance” for the Venezuelan people.

But grassroots adoption by desperate citizens scrambling for financial stability is not the same as a secret government Bitcoin treasury. 

The former is well-documented. The latter remains speculation — or an enviable effort in camouflage. 

“If they do have 600,000, then they are really really good at hiding it,” Frank Weert from Whale Alert told DL News.

Geneva, Switzerland, January 8th, 2026, FinanceWire

TRON DAO, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), welcomes the recognition of the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU) in a recent report published by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). As a global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, FATF helps set international standards and drive policy aimed to prevent these illegal activities and the harm they cause to society through national legislative and regulatory reforms. In its latest publication, FATF recognized the T3 FCU as a prime example of an effective public-private collaboration to combat illicit activity on the blockchain, highlighting the initiative's comprehensive monitoring capability, which enables T3 FCU to work across borders, identifying and disrupting criminal operations in real-time, making it an invaluable resource for law enforcement agencies worldwide.

T3 FCU is a first-of-its-kind public-private initiative launched by TRON, Tether, and TRM Labs in September 2024 to combat illicit activities on the blockchain. This groundbreaking public-private partnership works directly with law enforcement agencies around the globe to identify and disrupt criminal networks. Since its inception, and in just over one year, T3 FCU has frozen more than $300 million in criminal assets across five continents, established rapid response capabilities to address threats, and demonstrated how industry collaboration can effectively combat financial crime while supporting blockchain innovation. 

In its report, the Financial Action Task Force noted that the T3 FCU “is designed to expand public-private collaboration to combat illicit activities on the blockchain” and highlighted the unit's role in supporting law enforcement efforts across multiple jurisdictions. The report further detailed that, since its launch in September 2024, T3 FCU has analyzed millions of transactions globally, monitored more than $3 billion USD in total volume, and supported the freezing of over $250 million USD in illicit assets.

In a recent blog post examining the FATF's asset recovery guidance and best practices, TRM Labs notes a shift toward real-time interdiction, observing that traditional post-investigation recovery models are increasingly ineffective for fast-moving virtual assets. It emphasizes the importance of coordinated public-private action, supported by blockchain intelligence and close collaboration among law enforcement, virtual asset service providers, and stablecoin issuers, to identify, restrain, and disrupt illicit funds before they can be dispersed, underscoring the growing role of operational models that enable timely cross-border enforcement.
		



The FATF's recognition affirms T3 FCU as an industry-first model of how blockchain-based systems can reinforce global financial integrity through structured collaboration with public authorities. It further reinforces TRON DAO's commitment to responsible blockchain adoption and effective financial crime prevention, serving as meaningful validation of coordinated, cross-sector efforts to address illicit activity at scale as regulators continue to evaluate the role of public blockchains in the global financial system.

NFT Paris and its sibling summit, RWA Paris, have cancelled this year's events due to market uncertainty. Organisers say the numbers stopped working. Simple as that.

NFT Paris had grown used to calling itself a fixture. Launched in 2022, it quickly became Europe's most visible Web3 gathering, drawing crowds from digital ownership, culture and currency. Twenty thousand visitors were not unusual. There were hundreds of speakers and late-night panels promoting decentralisation.

This year was meant to be bigger than ever. Instead, Alexandre Tsydenkov, the founder and constant presence behind the event, announced the cancellation on LinkedIn. stating, “The crypto and NFT downturn hit hard. Too hard.” 

In its early editions, NFT Paris leaned heavily into visual art. Digital galleries. Over time, the tone changed. Less art. More infrastructure. More talk of chains, platforms, scaling up. The sponsor lists reflected that drift. John Karp, who runs Lisbon's Non Fungible Conference, has pointed out that art made up a sliver of the ecosystem, probably under five per cent of sponsors. From that angle, the cancellation is a verdict on NFT art more than on the machinery built around it.

RWA Paris was meant to steady things. A pivot toward real-world assets. Property, luxury goods, commodities. The promise of bridging traditional finance and decentralised systems. It sounded like an exciting prospect to many. Institutional money hesitated. Compliance costs climbed. Ticket sales never materialised.

Tsydenkov's note to his team carried weariness. “Thank you for everything. You deserved better. Four years. Tens of thousands through the doors. Hundreds of speakers. Connections made, then scattered. Endings are tough. No attempt to dress it up.”

All ticket holders will be refunded. Around $230 for general admission. Just over $1,100 for VIP access.

GR8 Tech has launched Crypto Turnkey, a platform solution that lets operators accept multiple cryptocurrencies without relying on third-party payment providers or extra technical integrations. The platform enables operators to go live faster, maintain uninterrupted operations, and expand globally with native multi-currency support.

"Industry data shows crypto players deposit 35-50% more and bet with 40-60% higher frequency than traditional players," said Denys Parkhomenko, CPO at GR8 Tech. "The operators winning their markets are the ones acting on that data now, not waiting. We built Crypto Turnkey to make that move simple."

By eliminating reliance on external payment providers, Crypto Turnkey reduces the risk of launch delays and service disruptions. Unlike traditional payment infrastructures—where provider outages can halt operations—crypto-based payments allow operators to go live faster and maintain uninterrupted revenue flow around the clock.

The platform supports over 15 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT, while maintaining KYC and responsible gambling compliance. Operators gain control over payment uptime, reducing delays and outages common with traditional payment systems.

Also catering to VIP players, who contributed 47% of turnover on GR8 Tech platforms in 2025, Crypto Turnkey allows users to hold multiple currencies, deposit and withdraw without conversion, and switch currencies instantly. The system automatically handles conversions, balance segregation, and real-time exchange rates.

Crypto Turnkey also eliminates chargebacks entirely and reduces transaction costs from 2.5–5% in fiat payments to approximately 0.5%. Settlement times are reduced to 10–30 minutes, compared with three to five business days for traditional payment methods. The irreversible nature of blockchain transactions also minimizes fraud risk and removes the administrative burden of dispute management.

GR8 Tech noted that the payment advantages are amplified when combined with its broader platform capabilities, including AI-driven personalization, advanced CRM tools, sports margin management, and geo-specific “Champion setups” designed to accelerate performance in target markets.

Crypto Turnkey is available globally for new operators or as an upgrade for existing GR8 Tech clients—no extra integration required.

Interested parties can book a meeting with the GR8 Tech team at ICE 2026 to discuss the advantages of the new crypto functionality in person.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC) fell back below $90,000, dropping sharply from a local high of $91,570 at 01:15 UTC to trade at its lowest level in five days.

The drawdown follows a third failure to break through $94,500 after attempts on Dec. 4 and Dec. 10, with price action mirroring that of the past six weeks.

Bitcoin's trading range is now well defined between $85,000 and $94,500, with the zone providing some stability in recent weeks after prices tumbled on Oct. 6 from a record high of $126,220 to $80,600 by Nov. 21.

Altcoins underperformed on Thursday as privacy coin zcash (ZEC) plunged by more than 16% between midnight UTC and 10:00. PUMP also suffered a double-digit decline over the same period.

U.S. equity index futures also fell. Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures are trading 0.27% and 0.29% lower, respectively, since midnight while the dollar index (DXY) continues its ascent. It has now risen by more than 1% since Dec. 24.

Over $400 million in leveraged crypto futures bets have been liquidated in 24 hours, with bullish bets accounting for most of the tally, a sign that the leverage was skewed bearish.

Overall open interest (OI) in crypto futures has pulled back to $140 billion from more than $141 billion Wednesday, which was the highest in nearly two months.

OI in bitcoin futures increased by 2% alongside positive funding rates. Some traders seem to be buying the price dip.

OI in ETH, SOL, XRP, ZEC and SUI, in contrast, dropped, indicating capital outflows.

Funding rates for most major cryptocurrencies, except BNB, remain positive, indicating dominance of bullish long positions. In altcoins, LINK, XLM, AVAX and CC stand out with negative rates.

On Deribit, BTC and ETH puts continue to trade at a premium to calls, indicating persistent downside bias. The put bias, however, stands notably weakened in short-dated options compared with last month.

Block flows show strong investor bias for volatility strategies such as straddles and strangles in both bitcoin and ether. Ether flows also featured put spreads.

Altcoins suffered one of the most grueling selloffs of recent weeks with ZEC, PUMP and DASH leading the way with drawdowns of above 10%.

DeFi was the worst performing sector, according to CoinDesk Indices data, with the DeFi index (DFX) posting a loss of 3.12% since midnight, closely followed by the memecoin index (CDMEME), which fell 3.09%.

The CoinDesk 20 dropped 2.23%, indicating larger market cap tokens fared better than the more speculative sectors.

This can be attributed to a continued void in liquidity and market depth across the altcoin ecosystem following a liquidation cascade in early October that evaporated $19 billion worth of derivatives positions.

The lack of liquidity was prevalent on Thursday as a $12 million long position was liquidated on zcash (ZEC), causing exaggerated losses compared with the wider market as the order books lacked sufficient bids to absorb the position.

ZEC faces uncertainty after members of its development team quit following a clash with a nonprofit organization created to support the network.

CoinMarketCap's "altcoin season" indicator remains firmly in a bearish zone at 23/100, a far cry from in September when it topped 78/100.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has praised China's central bank digital currency (CBDC) policy, sparking debate during an ongoing regulatory fight. He supported China's move to offer interest on its digital yuan while defending U.S. stablecoin rewards threatened by banking lobby pressure. His remarks drew criticism and raised questions about timing and motives.

On January 8, Armstrong posted on X, praising China's interest model for its digital yuan, calling it a “competitive advantage.” He argued that allowing interest-like rewards on U.S. stablecoins would support consumers and promote innovation. “We are missing the forest through the trees in the U.S.,” he wrote.

China has decided to pay interest on their own stablecoin, because it benefits ordinary people, and they recognize it as a competitive advantage.

I worry we are missing the forest through the trees in the U.S. Rewards on stablecoins will not change lending one bit – but it does… https://t.co/nrpa8eSKUs

— Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 7, 2026



Armstrong said these rewards help regular people and don't harm traditional lending, urging regulators to let markets decide freely. However, Chinese analysts dismissed the comparison, stressing that China's digital yuan is a central bank instrument, not a private stablecoin. They noted that China's interest program responds to low adoption, not competitive strength.

Crypto commentator Phyrex clarified that interest on the digital yuan is subsidized by commercial banks, not China's central bank. He said that the interest rates remain below demand deposit levels and are intended to boost digital yuan usage. Armstrong's interpretation, according to critics, misrepresents the policy's true purpose and context.

The GENIUS Act passed in July 2025 allows platforms to offer yield-sharing on stablecoins, though it bars issuers from direct interest payments. This exception benefits companies like Coinbase that offer “rewards” without violating interest bans. However, U.S. banking groups now seek to eliminate this flexibility through new regulatory proposals.

In November, the American Bankers Association and 52 state associations sent a letter asking the Treasury to close what they call a “loophole.” They claimed that stablecoin rewards could drain bank deposits and risk up to $6.6 trillion in lending. Banks want restrictions extended to platforms partnering with stablecoin issuers.

More pressure followed on January 7, when over 200 community bank leaders wrote to the Senate with similar demands. They asked lawmakers to apply the same rules to affiliates and partners of stablecoin issuers. These efforts challenge Coinbase's ability to maintain a key revenue stream under the current rules.

Armstrong responded sharply on December 26, warning against any rollback of the GENIUS Act's protections for platforms. He said banks earn about 4% on reserves at the Federal Reserve while offering near-zero to customers. He accused them of “mental gymnastics” for framing rewards programs as financial risks.

His comparison to China, though challenged, appears aimed at showing global momentum for digital currency incentives. Armstrong suggests the U.S. should not fall behind on offering consumer benefits. The appeal to China's policy positions Coinbase in opposition to traditional banking power.

While Armstrong's framing of China CBDC policy faces scrutiny, his broader argument remains directed at preserving platform-level stablecoin rewards. The debate now shifts to lawmakers considering whether platforms should retain this exemption. Discussions continue as the Senate reviews the latest letters from banking leaders.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) retreated from recent highs on Thursday as institutional investors locked in profits after a strong start to the year. Over the past 24 hours, the price eased from around $93,000 (£69,175) to just above $90,000, representing a roughly 2.5% pullback, coinciding with notable outflows from major US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Data from SoSoValue shows US spot bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs registered $486m in net outflows on Wednesday. Outflows also hit ether (ETH-USD) ($98.45m) and XRP (XRP-USD) ($40.80m) spot ETFs.

BlackRock's (BLK) IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC products saw the most redemptions, with roughly $129m and $247m in outflows respectively.

Even with the setback, bitcoin (BTC-USD) remains up more than 3% over the past week, while ether (ETH-USD) is still 6% higher over seven days despite falling 3% on the day, according to CoinGecko.

As of publication, bitcoin (BTC-USD) spot ETFs collectively hold $118.36bn in net assets, representing around 6.5% of the total bitcoin market capitalisation.

Analysts argue the latest dip is more about positioning and profit-taking than any deterioration in bitcoin's (BTC-USD) underlying trend.

Wenny Cai, COO of SynFutures, told Yahoo Finance UK that bitcoin (BTC-USD) has entered 2026 with a “more complex setup than in prior cycles” as the asset recovers from a turbulent end to 2025. She noted that after slipping from its October highs near $126,000, price action in early January has shown “renewed momentum” with markets firming across major exchanges.

Cai said the near-term picture suggests a range-bound market, pointing to resistance in the $95,000–$98,000 band. This reflects, she said, a mix of profit-taking and selective re-risking as investors wait for a clearer catalyst.

She also argued that structural forces such as ETF development, digital-asset corporate treasury strategies, and the rise of real-world asset-linked products mean bitcoin's (BTC-USD) trajectory is increasingly tied to macroeconomic dynamics rather than pure speculation.

She added that institutional interest remains a “persistent source of demand” that can support more stable capital flows, even as volatility persists.

Longer term, Cai views fundamentals for the digital asset as still intact, citing bitcoin's (BTC-USD) capped supply, growing institutional adoption, and “digital scarcity” narrative. However, she cautioned that risks around macro conditions, regulation, and shifting risk appetite could amplify volatility. Market participants, she said, should balance optimism with “disciplined risk management.”

Brickken market analyst Enmanuel Cardozo described bitcoin's (BTC-USD) current positioning as a phase of recalibration rather than weakness. Speaking to Yahoo Finance UK he described the current price action as reflecting a market that “has reset after an extended period of risk reduction,” with excess leverage cleared, volatility compressed and ETF flows stabilising.

Cardozo argued that bitcoin (BTC-USD) is behaving less like a speculative trade and more like a “maturing strategic allocation” tied to global liquidity trends and evolving capital market structures. He added that the asset's recent consolidation may be forming a base for the “next leg higher,” supported by steady structural demand.

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered three malicious npm packages that are designed to deliver a previously undocumented malware called NodeCordRAT.

The names of the packages, all of which were taken down as of November 2025, are listed below. They were uploaded by a user named "wenmoonx."

"The bitcoin-main-lib and bitcoin-lib-js packages execute a postinstall.cjs script during installation, which installs bip40, the package that contains the malicious payload," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Satyam Singh and Lakhan Parashar said. "This final payload, named NodeCordRAT by ThreatLabz, is a remote access trojan (RAT) with data-stealing capabilities."

NodeCordRAT gets its name from the use of npm as a propagation vector and Discord servers for command-and-control (C2) communications. The malware is equipped to steal Google Chrome credentials, API tokens, and seed phrases from cryptocurrency wallets like MetaMask.

According to the cybersecurity company, the threat actor behind the campaign is assessed to have named the packages after real repositories found within the legitimate bitcoinjs project, such as bitcoinjs-lib, bip32, bip38, and bip38.

Both "bitcoin-main-lib" and "bitcoin-lib-js" include a "package.json" file that features "postinstall.cjs" as a postinstall script, leading to the execution of "bip40" that contains the NodeCordRAT payload.

The malware, besides fingerprinting the infected host to generate a unique identifier across Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, leverages a hard-coded Discord server to open a covert communication channel to receive instructions and execute them -

"This data is exfiltrated using Discord's API with a hardcoded token and sent to a private channel," Zscaler said. "The stolen files are uploaded as message attachments via Discord's REST endpoint /channels/{id}/messages."

The development of agentic artificial intelligence could give rise to personal shopping ‘AI-gents' within the next five years, according to a new report from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

The data regulator explores how agentic commerce could become the norm, with customers' personal agents anticipating shopping needs and making proactive purchases based on learned and defined preferences or behaviours along with knowledge of upcoming plans - rather than having to have specific prompts.  

This means that personalised digital shopping companions could soon have the ability to check personal bank accounts to ensure a purchase is within a monthly budget, assess how it will affect other spending plans, schedule purchases around seasonal sale events like the January sales and even negotiate a price directly with sellers. Agents may also seek out tailored financing options to present to their human shopper for agreement.  

The ICO is reminding retailers wanting to interact with customers through their own agentic AI systems that they are obligated to make sure data privacy is embedded from the start. It adds that retailers cannot rely on developers alone to do this and cautions against implementing off the shelf or one size fits all agentic solutions which could cause privacy problems in the future. Organisations are encouraged to refer to the ICO's AI guidance. 

William Malcolm, Executive Director of Regulatory Risk and Innovation, ICO, says: “Agentic AI will have the capacity to make decisions and take actions independently. Our own personal AI agents could be paying for goods, booking flights and helping with household finances. While the potential benefits could be transformational, the public needs assurances their personal information is secure and well managed before placing their trust in agentic systems.”  

He adds: “Strong data protection foundations can help build that public trust and can help scale the fast and safe adoption of AI. Throughout 2026 the ICO will actively monitor advancements and work with AI developers and deployers to ensure they are clear on what the law requires of them.”

Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,300 resistance and dipped. ETH is now showing a few bearish signs and might decline toward $3,080.

Ethereum Price Trims Gains

Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,300 and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH price dipped below $3,240 and $3,220 to enter a short-term bearish zone.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $3,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even dipped below $3,150. A low was formed at $3,123, and the price is now consolidating losses. It tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,308 swing high to the $3,123 low.

Ethereum price is now trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls can protect more losses below $3,120, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $3,180 level.

The first key resistance is near the $3,200 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,220 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,308 swing high to the $3,123 low.

A clear move above the $3,220 resistance might send the price toward the $3,250 resistance. An upside break above the $3,250 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,300 resistance zone or even $3,320 in the near term.

More Losses In ETH?

If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,220 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,120 level. The first major support sits near the $3,080 zone.

A clear move below the $3,080 support might push the price toward the $3,020 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,000 region.

Technical Indicators

Our new report released today shows how the rise of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the way we live our lives, with personal shopping ‘AI-gents' potentially arriving within the next five years. 

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence that allows for more activities to be automated - making decisions, interacting with its environment, solving problems in real time and mimicking some types of reasoning and planning. 

So-called agentic commerce is set to become a mainstay of people's busy lives, with customers' personal AI-powered agents anticipating shopping needs and making proactive purchases based on learned and defined preferences or behaviours, along with knowledge of upcoming plans, rather than needing specific prompts.   

This means that digital shopping companions could soon check personal bank accounts to ensure a purchase is within monthly budget, assess how it will affect other spending plans, schedule purchases around seasonal sale events such as the January sales and even negotiate a price directly with sellers.   

This might even extend to agents seeking out tailored financing options to present to their human shopper for agreement.    

William Malcolm, Executive Director of Regulatory Risk and Innovation, said:  

“Agentic AI will have the capacity to make decisions and take actions independently. Our own personal AI agents could be paying for goods, booking flights and helping with household finances.  

“While the potential benefits could be transformational, the public needs assurances their personal information is secure and well managed before placing their trust in agentic systems.  

“Strong data protection foundations can help build that public trust and can help scale the fast and safe adoption of AI. Throughout 2026 the ICO will actively monitor advancements and work with AI developers and deployers to ensure they are clear on what the law requires of them.”

This interaction could help explain both why quantum processes can occur within environments like the brain and why we lose consciousness under anesthesia.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the mid-1990s, cognitive scientist David Chalmers pondered what he referred to as the “hard problem of consciousness,” which (to put it simply) asked why humans have subjective experience—a far cry from the integration of information that can be described by modern neuroscience. In the ensuing three decades, scientists and philosophers alike have developed numerous theories that are a possible answer to this “hard question,” with names like Global Workspace Theory and Integrated Information Theory. 

However, there are a subset of scientists and thinkers who think that the true answer lies in the quantum realm—more specifically, in our anatomical mind's interaction with that realm. Nobel Prize-laureate Roger Penrose believed that these quantum interactions could explain consciousness, and the resulting theory (along with his work with Stuart Hameroff) eventually became Orchestrated Objective Reduction. 

Now, a new study is proposing its own answer to the problem, but similarly relying on the quantum realm for its explanation. In the study published in the journal Frontiers of Human Neuroscience, Joachim Keppler (research director of the DIWISS Research Institute in Germany) suggested that macroscopic quantum effects could be at play in our minds. Specially, Keppler said, neurological circuits known as cortical microcolumns could be coupling directly with the zero-point field—the lowest-state of quantum fields, whose existence helps explain certain phenomena like the Casimir effect and why helium doesn't freeze even at absolute zero. 

“In this theory, the vacuum is not empty but filled with a fluctuating ocean of energy known as the electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF),” Keppler wrote for Phys.org. “Quantum Electrodynamics-based model calculations demonstrate that specific frequencies (modes) of the ZPF can resonate with glutamate, the brain's most abundant neurotransmitter.”

According to Keppler, glutamate-ZPF coupling answers a few outstanding questions about quantum interactions and consciousness. It's been long stated that the brain is too “warm and wet” for quantum coherence, which (at least in quantum computers) requires extremely cold temperatures—though, thinkers like Hameroff dispute this point. But because a large number of molecules vibrate in unison in this model, coherence domains are protected by large energy gaps, which resist decoherence even in environments like the brain. 

This coupling could also explain the effects of anesthesia, which can pretty effectively sever a human's subjective conscious experience. According to Keppler, anesthesia disrupts the brain's self-organized criticality, which would explain why we experience unconsciousness. 

In response to Penrose's own quantum theory, the great physicist's collaborator Stephen Hawking once wrote that “his argument seemed to be that consciousness is a mystery and quantum gravity is another mystery so they must be related.” Could it be that quantum theories of consciousness are examples of some kind of Holmesian fallacy? It's certainly possible, but until we do finally answer that ever-elusive “hard problem,” all ideas are on the table.

Jellyfish and sea anemones are curious creatures: these organisms evolved without a brain and, as scientists discovered only in the past few years, don't need one to sleep. The animals do, however, have neurons—nerve cells that appear interconnected throughout their body. And now a new study shows that how these animals sleep is surprisingly similar to humans, suggesting that sleep may have evolved before even the most primitive brains.

The findings, published on Tuesday in Nature Communications, also help answer one of science's prevailing mysteries: Why do animals sleep? They add to past evidence from other animals and humans that sleep provides a “window” for maintenance on the brain and body, helping to repair DNA damage and maintain neuronal health.

“This confirms that sleep allows a window for key housekeeping tasks,” says Philippe Mourrain, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, who studies sleep. Mourrain was not involved in the new study.

The new work shows this function of sleep has been conserved across evolution, he says, from the animals, such as primates, that have one of the most complex brains to cnidarians, such as jellyfish, which have none.

Curiously, the study finds that jellyfish appear to enter a sleeplike state for around eight hours a day and generally at night—a schedule many humans might recognize. Sea anemones also appear to sleep for around a third of the day.

The researchers also showed that when these animals' neurons incurred additional damage induced by the team they slept more, a finding that Mourrain says gives clues to what makes us fall asleep in the first place.

Xenotransplantation of gene-edited pig kidneys offers a promising solution to the shortage of kidneys for organ transplantation. We recently performed a gene-edited pig kidney transplantation into a living human recipient with end-stage kidney disease. Here, using transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and multiplexed imaging, we conducted high-dimensional immune profiling in this individual. Despite profound depletion of circulating T cells, early T cell-mediated rejection occurred within 1 week after transplantation, likely driven by subtherapeutic immunosuppression and the presence of residual CD8+ T cells in lymph nodes. This T cell-mediated rejection event was reversed by intensified immunosuppression. After treatment, adaptive immunity remained suppressed, whereas innate immune activation, characterized by sustained monocyte and macrophage activity along with elevated levels of interleukin-1 beta and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, persisted. Comparative transcriptomic analysis showed that xenograft rejection profiles resembled those typically observed in human allograft rejection, while also revealing unique innate immune signatures. We did not detect antibody-mediated rejection. The levels of circulating pig donor-derived cell-free DNA rose during the initial rejection episode and declined with treatment, supporting the potential of cell-free DNA measurements as a noninvasive biomarker of xenograft rejection. These findings define the distinct immune landscape of kidney xenotransplantation and highlight the need for regimens targeting both innate and adaptive immunity to improve outcomes.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 25 million individuals in the USA, with many progressing to end-stage renal disease1. For these patients, kidney transplantation remains the gold standard treatment. However, the severe shortage of transplantable organs forces most patients to rely on dialysis. While dialysis is essential for maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality risks2,3. Alarmingly, more than half of the patients on the transplant waiting list will succumb to the disease within an average of 5 years1—a prognosis worse than many cancers—or become too ill to undergo transplantation by the time a kidney becomes available.

Xenotransplantation, the transplantation of organs from nonhuman species into humans, offers a promising solution to the critical organ shortage. If genetically engineered pig kidneys can demonstrate sustained safety and functional superiority over dialysis, they could provide a scalable and transformative alternative for the tens of thousands of patients awaiting life-saving transplants. Advances in gene editing have enabled the development of pigs with enhanced immunological compatibility with human recipients4. These donor pigs, raised under stringent controlled conditions, provide kidneys similar in size and function to human organs while harboring genetic modifications designed to mitigate immune rejection.

On 16 March 2024, a historic milestone in transplantation was achieved at Massachusetts General Hospital with the xenotransplantation of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living human recipient5. In this groundbreaking procedure, a Yucatan pig kidney containing 69 genetic modifications (EGEN-2784) was successfully transplanted into a 62-year-old male patient. While nonhuman primate models have shown promising xenograft survival with optimized immunosuppressive regimens across different swine donors4,6,7,8,9, the human immune system presents greater immunological challenges, including a high frequency of memory cells driven by prior vaccinations, diet and infections. As rejection remains an important obstacle, comprehensive characterization of immune responses following xenotransplantation is crucial for guiding future strategies.

The complexity of human immune responses is influenced by diverse factors such as genetic variability, age, chronic infections and environmental exposures. A comprehensive, multidimensional, longitudinal systems immunology approach is essential to uncover connections between biological pathways, the immunosuppression regimen and clinical outcomes. Here we employed different layers of biological information to systematically perform high-dimensional profiling of the evolving immune landscape in this human kidney xenotransplantation. By integrating longitudinal immune monitoring with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we aimed to unravel the complexities of human-xenograft interaction, define the immunological consequences, and identify key molecular pathways driving rejection and their correlation with clinical parameters. The findings provide critical insights into xenogeneic immune responses and have the potential to refine immunosuppressive strategies and possibly future porcine genetic edits, ultimately improving clinical outcomes in xenotransplantation.

To comprehensively assess the immune response triggered by kidney xenotransplantation, we characterized the recipient's immune profile using proteomics, metabolomics and clinical measurements (Fig. 1a). Using an unbiased, longitudinal, multilayered integrative approach, we identified three distinct immune clusters associated with xenotransplantation (Extended Data Fig. 1). Cluster analysis based on silhouette scores confirmed that three clusters provided the optimal separation (Supplementary Fig. 1): one cluster was defined by a progressive decline in analytes over time (Extended Data Fig. 1a), another showed an increase post-transplantation (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and the third displayed no clear temporal pattern (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

The orange line represents the normalized levels (z-scored) of the indicated clinical measurements at different times. Pre-Tx, pre-transplantation.

Focusing on the cluster of analytes that declined over time (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a), we hypothesized that the immunosuppressive regimen was a key driver of these changes. The regimen included rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG), rituximab (anti-CD20), high-dose steroids and an anti-C5 antibody (ravulizumab) as induction therapy, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with Fc-modified anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (tegoprubart), tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and prednisone (Extended Data Fig. 2). Network analysis with those declining features demonstrated that this cluster was enriched for pathways related to effector immune responses, cytokine-mediated signaling and T cell proliferation and activation (Fig. 1c). Notably, when investigating individual features, we found that several downregulated proteins corresponded to specific effects of immunosuppressive drugs, including CD19 (rituximab), CD8A and CD4 (ATG), interleukin-2 RA (IL-2RA) (tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid), GZMB and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid), CD80 (mycophenolic acid), ITGAM and CXCL9/10 (tegoprubart) (Fig. 1d). CD19 was selected over CD20 as a marker of B cell depletion because it is more broadly expressed across B cell subsets and remains a stable and reliable surrogate following rituximab treatment, whereas CD20 expression can be variably affected by antibody binding.

This immune modulation was associated with improved graft function, reflected by declining creatinine and cystatin C levels. Additional laboratory trends, including reductions in glucose and magnesium and a fluctuating lactate dehydrogenase pattern, were also observed (Fig. 1e), though these are influenced by multiple factors beyond allograft status. Several T cell-associated metabolites, such as homocysteine10, caproic acid11 and oxoglutaric acid12, also showed substantial reductions following xenotransplantation (Fig. 1c). In addition, we observed a decrease in indoxyl, a metabolite linked to chronic kidney disease13,14 and end-stage renal disease15, correlating with improved kidney function observed in our xenotransplant recipient5. Together, these findings demonstrate a striking shift in the circulating immune composition following xenotransplantation, consistent with the selective targeting of adaptive immunity by the immunosuppressive regimen.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at six time points to gain a high-resolution view of the systemic cellular immune dynamics. After quality filtering, approximately 36,000 high-quality cells were analyzed. To better identify the immune subsets, we integrated the longitudinal recipient samples with 22 external healthy control samples from public PBMC datasets. Integrative analysis identified 17 unsupervised distinct cell clusters based on their transcriptomic profiles (Fig. 2a). Using Louvain clustering, we annotated PBMC subsets and mapped their dynamic proportions over time (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3). Integration of longitudinal scRNA-seq data into a temporal UMAP embedding revealed a progressive decline in adaptive immune cells, accompanied by an increase in innate immune cells observed at all post-transplant time points relative to baseline (Fig. 2b). Specifically, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells exhibited a profound reduction compared to pretransplant (Fig. 2c). A xeno-crossmatch assay, incubating the recipient's serum with donor pig PBMCs, detected no xenoantibodies (Extended Data Fig. 4), consistent with B cell depletion and ongoing blockade of CD40–CD40L costimulation.

In contrast to adaptive immune cells, innate myeloid populations, including CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and conventional dendritic cells, were proportionally increased over time relative to pretransplant (Fig. 2c). A detailed characterization of monocyte subsets revealed distinct gene expression profiles over time, using the pretransplant time point as baseline. We identified three major gene expression patterns: gene set 1 (red) included genes upregulated after transplantation; gene set 2 (green) comprised genes that were downregulated; and gene set 3 (purple) contained genes predominantly expressed by CD16⁺ monocytes (Extended Data Fig. 5). Most differentially expressed genes were associated with the migration and differentiation of circulating monocytes into peripheral tissues, including DDIT416, IL1R217, C1QB18, CX3CR119, DUSP520 and EGR121.

Flow cytometry validated the scRNA-seq findings, revealing a pronounced decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Treg cells and B cells (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2), along with a relative expansion of CD14+ monocytes and conventional dendritic cells compared to pretransplant levels (Fig. 2d). These findings indicate a profound shift in the systemic immune landscape, characterized by a suppression of adaptive immunity and the emergence of an innate immune signature.

The second immune cluster identified through multi-omics analysis consisted of analytes that increased following xenotransplantation (Fig. 3a). This cluster was enriched for pathways associated with innate immune activation, including the Toll-like receptor 4 cascade, IL-1 signaling and Fc-receptor signaling (Fig. 3b). Key signaling molecules within these pathways, such as BIRC2, MAPK8, MAP2K3, IKBKB and IKBKG were upregulated (Fig. 3b). Moreover, levels of inflammatory metabolites, including L-kynurenine22 and eicosenoic acid23, also increased following xenotransplantation (Fig. 3b).

To further investigate the functional implications of these findings, we measured cytokine production in response to innate immune stimulation (Fig. 3c). From analysis of 65 cytokines, we detected increases in IL-1β (Fig. 3d), IL-6 (Fig. 3e), IL-8 (Fig. 3f) and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Fig. 3g) following PBMC stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. This cytokine surge paralleled the expansion of monocytes and conventional dendritic cells, suggesting heightened TLR and NF-κB signaling post-xenotransplantation. Furthermore, we identified an increase in type I interferon-related molecules, including IRF5, TIRAP and ISG15, as well as the metabolite adenine24 (Fig. 3b). Taken together, these findings indicate that despite potent immunosuppression targeting adaptive immunity, innate immune activation persists and is augmented over time, highlighting the need for tailored immunosuppressive regimens and/or additional gene editing strategies that mitigate the innate immune responses in xenotransplantation.

Within the first week post-transplant, the recipient developed a Banff grade 2A T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), confirmed by a biopsy on day 8. This rejection occurred despite a marked reduction in circulating adaptive immune cells, shown by our longitudinal scRNA-seq and flow cytometry analyses. Examination of T cell depletion in secondary lymphoid organs revealed that while T cells were effectively depleted from circulation at the time of transplant, persistent CD8+ T cells were still detected on draining lymph nodes (Extended Data Fig. 6). These findings suggest that circulating immune cell counts may not fully reflect the extent of depletion or the risk of rejection. We reasoned that the presence of activated T cell populations that were primed in the secondary lymphoid organs and then migrated to the graft likely contributed to the early rejection episode. However, this hypothesis requires formal investigation.

To manage the rejection, the recipient was treated with two pulses of glucocorticoids, anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody therapy on day 8, and T cell depletion with ATG on days 9 and 10, along with an increased dosage of tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid (Fig. 4a). Due to C3 deposition observed in the biopsy sample5, the C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan was administered from day 12 to day 28.

We performed bulk mRNA analysis using the NanoString nCounter platform to assess molecular immune changes associated with rejection. Transcriptional profiles from the rejection biopsy (day 8) were compared to those from a stable, nonrejection (nonR) time point (day 34) and the contralateral kidney of the donor pig (donor, day 0) (Fig. 4b). Representative hematoxylin and eosin stains of the kidney xenograft biopsies are shown in Fig. 4c. We compared these findings with transcriptomic data from archival human kidney allograft biopsies described in ref. 25, which included 15 samples from living donor biopsies, 84 from stable time points post-transplant, 36 from TCMR and 89 from chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR). Compared to the day 0 biopsy, xenograft rejection was associated with increased expression of both adaptive and innate immune transcripts. Adaptive immunity markers included elevated CD4+ (Fig. 4d) and CD8+ T cell signatures (Fig. 4e). Innate immune responses were characterized by increased natural killer (NK) cells (Fig. 4f), M1 (Fig. 4g) and M2 macrophages (Fig. 4h) and TLR signaling (Fig. 4i). These immune signatures closely resembled those observed in human kidney allograft TCMR and were partially resolved at the subsequent nonR time point (day 34, Fig. 4d–i). In addition, the rejection biopsy also showed transcriptomic evidence of activation of other pathways, including adaptive immunity, IL-12 family signaling, cytokine signaling, innate immune system, type I interferon signaling, MHC class I antigen presentation, cytosolic DNA sensing, NOTCH signaling and programmed cell death. The levels of these pathways were comparable to or higher than those seen in human allograft TCMR samples (Extended Data Fig. 7a–i). Our data demonstrate that xenograft rejection shares key molecular features with human allograft rejection, including adaptive and innate immune activation within the tissue microenvironment.

To complement transcriptomic profiling and provide spatial resolution of the immune infiltration, we performed multiplexed tissue immunofluorescence to characterize the cellular landscape of xenograft rejection. Kidney tissues from day 0 (donor), day 8 (TCMR) and day 34 (stable, nonR) post-transplantation were stained for glomerular and tubular markers (podocin and β-catenin), total leukocytes (CD45), endothelial cells (CD31), T lymphocytes (CD4 and CD8), macrophages (CD68 and CD163) and NK cells (NKG2A). Compared to the day 0 biopsy, rejection was marked by severe interstitial inflammation and mild glomerulitis (Fig. 5a). The immune infiltrate was characterized by increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, M1 (CD68+) and M2 (CD163+) macrophages, and NK cells (Fig. 5a,b). CD4+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages were the most prominently upregulated subsets during rejection (Fig. 5a,b). Notably, while T cells, M1 macrophages and NK cells declined after rejection treatment, M2 macrophages remained persistently elevated in the xenograft microenvironment (Fig. 5b). Human-specific HLA class I staining indicated that the majority of macrophages were of human origin (Extended Data Fig. 8), reflecting heightened innate immune activity. These spatial findings corroborate transcriptomic data, confirming that xenograft rejection is driven by coordinated infiltration of T cells and macrophages, mirroring patterns observed in human allograft rejection. Persistent M2 macrophage presence post-treatment highlights potentially ongoing innate immune activity within the graft.

Gating strategies are detailed in Methods. Quantification was independently repeated twice with similar results.

To determine whether immune events within the graft were reflected systemically, we assessed correlations between tissue immune activation and circulating immune cell dynamics. Since PBMCs were unavailable on the day of rejection (Fig. 1a), we inferred immune cell subsets from bulk RNA-seq data using the CIBERSORT tool (Fig. 6a). Consistent with the tissue findings, we observed increased proportions of CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, CD16+ monocytes and CD14+ monocytes on day 8 compared to pretransplant (Fig. 6b). While CD4+ TEM cells and total monocytes declined following rejection treatment, the subset of CD14+ monocytes remained persistently elevated. This continuous elevation may reflect ongoing innate immune activity associated with tissue repair or subclinical inflammation, underscoring the need for further studies to clarify their role in postrejection graft outcomes.

The dashed line highlights the separation between rejection and nonR clusters.

To investigate broader systemic immune changes, we compared peripheral blood gene and protein expression profiles during rejection (day 7) and at a stable, nonR time point (day 26). This analysis identified 207 differentially expressed genes and proteins, including 181 upregulated and 26 downregulated targets (Fig. 6c). Upregulated signatures were enriched in pathways related to myeloid cell signaling, IL-6 and IL-12 signaling, and effector T cell activation (Fig. 6c). Key upregulated targets included CXCL10, STAT1, STAT3, CD163 and NLRP3 (Fig. 6d). Downregulated pathways were related to glycosylation (Fig. 6c), with reduced expression of B3GAT1, B4GAT1 and ST6GALNAC4 (Fig. 6d). These findings indicate that xenograft rejection is associated with coordinated transcriptional and proteomic changes involving both adaptive and innate immune activation, detectable in the peripheral blood.

In addition to immune cell and transcriptomic profiling, we assessed whether levels of porcine donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), a circulating marker of tissue damage widely used in allotransplantation26, correlated with graft injury in the xenotransplantation setting. We tracked both porcine-derived cfDNA and recipient-derived human cfDNA. At the time of rejection, porcine dd-cfDNA levels increased markedly (~1,000-fold by day 9), indicating xenograft injury (Fig. 6e). A modest, delayed rise (~10-fold) in human cfDNA was also observed, potentially reflecting recipient immune cell turnover associated with rejection and immunosuppressive treatment, including T cell depletion. Following treatment, porcine dd-cfDNA levels declined substantially, consistent with histological resolution of the immune response and restoration of graft stability (Fig. 6e). These findings suggest that species-specific cfDNA may serve as a dynamic noninvasive biomarker for early detection and monitoring of xenograft injury.

Lastly, we investigated whether the blood transcriptional profile observed during xenograft rejection in kidney xenograft recipients resembled those observed in human kidney allograft rejection. Using the publicly available dataset GSE120649 (ref. 27) from human kidney transplant recipients, we compared blood transcriptomics from our xenograft recipient with a previously described transcriptional rejection signature of human allograft rejection28. Distance correlation analysis, which captures nonlinear relationships, revealed that the xenograft rejection sample (day 7) clustered with human kidney allograft rejection profiles, while the nonrejection sample (day 26) aligned with human nonrejection states (Fig. 6f). These results demonstrate significant molecular overlap between xenograft and allograft rejection in both tissue and peripheral blood, suggesting conserved immune pathways that could guide future strategies for immune monitoring and therapeutic intervention in xenotransplantation.

Here we report the high-dimensional immune characterization of a gene-edited pig kidney xenotransplantation in a living human. Using longitudinal transcriptomic, proteomic analyses and spatial analyses, we observed a profound shift in adaptive immunity, while innate immune activation persisted despite immunosuppression. The recipient experienced a TCMR episode within the first week post-transplant, marked by the presence of T cells and macrophages in the tissue, which improved following treatment. This study provides critical insights into xenogeneic immune responses, highlighting the need to optimize immunosuppressive strategies and potentially guide future porcine donor gene editing to improve clinical outcomes in xenotransplantation.

We identified key differences in immune dynamics between our kidney xenograft patient, xenotransplantation in decedent recipients and human allograft rejection, particularly regarding the type and timing of rejection. Potential factors contributing to the observed differences include variability in donor animals, patient selection criteria, immunosuppressive regimens, baseline inflammation and immune alterations associated with brain-dead donors. Our xeno recipient developed TCMR within 1 week of transplant, which is a rare occurrence in human allotransplantation when T cell depletion with thymoglobulin is used. However, a reduced dose of ATG (1.5 mg kg−1 versus standard 4.5 mg kg−1) was administered in our case due to significant lymphopenia and hypersensitivity reaction after the first ATG dose29. TCMR was absent in most reports using decedent models30,31, except for one group that used a low-dose ATG induction therapy (~2.5 mg kg−1) and reported a mixed TCMR and antibody-mediated rejection32. Despite differences in timing, the xenograft biopsy profile resembled human allograft rejection, with prominent T cells and macrophages, and transcriptional upregulation of IFNγ, IL-1 and IL-6 signaling pathways25. The rejection episode was successfully treated with standard immunosuppressants, indicating that xenograft TCMR responds to conventional rejection therapies. However, xenograft rejection also showed distinct peripheral blood features, including heightened innate immune activation involving TLR signaling and type I interferon pathways. These findings suggest that xenograft rejection engages unique immune mechanisms that may require tailored therapeutic interventions, and greater T cell depletion might be needed to prevent TCMR.

In nonhuman primate (NHP) and human decedent xenotransplantation models, circulating B cells were detected post-xenotransplant31 and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) was typically the dominant rejection mechanism rather than TCMR4,30,33. By contrast, our patient showed no histological or serological evidence of AMR, likely due to effective pretransplant B cell depletion and ongoing CD154 costimulation blockade. Our observation of a lack of AMR compared to preclinical primate models may be explained by species-specific differences in humoral immunity and drug efficacy. Human IgM natural antibody binding to 3KO pig cells is significantly lower than that observed in Old World monkeys34, and human transgenes introduced in 3KO pigs may function more effectively in humans than in NHPs. In addition, the greater cross-reactivity of clinical immunosuppressive agents in humans may contribute to improved control of AMR in our clinical setting, despite the use of similar immunosuppressive regimens. However, persistent CD8⁺ T cells in lymph nodes highlight residual cellular immunity. Peripheral blood monitoring failed to detect early rejection, whereas porcine dd-cfDNA levels correlated with graft injury, suggesting species-specific cfDNA as a promising noninvasive biomarker. These findings emphasize the need for improved monitoring tools, such as dd-cfDNA assays and advanced imaging, to detect rejection before clinical dysfunction.

We observed persistent innate immune activation despite effective suppression of the adaptive immune response. This was characterized by a sustained increase in monocyte and macrophage populations, upregulation of TLR/NF-κB signaling and type I interferon responses, and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels following TLR stimulation. This is corroborated by observations in decedent models showing human innate immune cells rapidly infiltrate pig xenografts following transplantation30,31,35. Similar systemic inflammation has also been reported in NHP xenotransplantation models36, and it may have contributed to the early onset of TCMR post-xenotransplantation in our patient. Potential drivers of this innate immune response include xenograft-derived damage-associated molecular patterns, which stimulate monocytes and macrophages, and incomplete immune regulation by current immunosuppressive strategies. Existing therapies primarily target T and B cells while largely neglecting innate immune pathways. Although our xenotransplant recipient developed a fatal cardiac event on day 51, no acute myocardial infarction was found on autopsy5. Rather, chronic myocardial fibrosis, likely related to prior microvascular disease from prolonged dialysis, was identified and may have predisposed the patient to arrhythmia. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the potential contribution of xenograft-associated systemic inflammation to cardiovascular risk.

Notably, M2 macrophages remained elevated in the xenograft microenvironment even after rejection treatment. This is consistent with transcriptional signatures in circulating monocytes indicative of migration and differentiation into peripheral tissues. Persistent macrophage infiltration has been reported in human kidney transplantation, where their presence is associated not only with the resolution of inflammation but also with progression to fibrosis and poorer long-term graft survival, partly through pathways such as transforming growth factor β1 signaling37,38. This dual role highlights the importance of monitoring macrophage polarization in xenotransplantation, as sustained M2 infiltration may signal a risk for chronic graft injury and impaired outcomes. Clinically, these findings highlight that current immunosuppressive regimens targeting adaptive immunity are insufficient to control innate immune activation in xenotransplantation. Future xenograft recipients may benefit from therapies specifically targeting innate immunity, such as IL-1 or IL-6 blockade, to improve graft outcomes.

In addition to pharmacologic strategies, future engineering of porcine donors could focus on reducing innate immune activation by targeting key inflammatory pathways identified in this study. Given the prominent upregulation of IL-1 signaling (also observed by Kawai et al.5), graft-specific expression of human IL-1 receptor antagonist could offer localized suppression of cytokine-driven inflammation. Introducing immunoregulatory molecules such as PD-L1 may further help modulate residual T cell and macrophage activity through checkpoint inhibition. These strategies, combined with existing transgenes that address complement activation, coagulation and macrophage phagocytosis, could provide a comprehensive approach to reducing xenograft-induced innate immune activation. Collectively, such next-generation genetic modifications hold promise for enhancing graft compatibility, reducing reliance on systemic immunosuppression and improving long-term outcomes in clinical xenotransplantation.

This study is limited by its single patient design, necessitating validation in larger xenotransplantation trials to confirm the generalizability of our findings. The short follow-up period also limits our understanding of long-term immune adaptation and graft survival. In addition, the limited number of biopsies restricted the ability to fully monitor tissue-based immune responses. Given the importance of the tissue microenvironment in graft outcomes, future studies should incorporate more frequent and systematic biopsy sampling to comprehensively assess immune dynamics over time.

In summary, this study provides a detailed high-dimensional immune characterization of pig-to-human kidney transplantation into a living recipient. While demonstrating the feasibility of kidney xenotransplantation, our findings reveal that targeting adaptive immunity alone may be insufficient. Achieving durable graft survival and favorable patient outcomes will require refined strategies to modulate innate immune activation, prevent early T cell-mediated rejection, and implement more sensitive and dynamic monitoring approaches. Advancing xenotransplantation as a sustainable solution to organ shortage will require next-generation immunosuppressive regimens and real-time diagnostic tools.

An EGEN-2784 gene-edited pig kidney was transplanted into a 62-year-old male patient with end-stage kidney disease, recently described in ref. 5. A Yucatan miniature pig was genetically engineered with 69 genomic modifications. These included the deletion of three major glycan antigens, the inactivation of porcine endogenous retroviruses and the insertion of seven human transgenes (TNFAIP3, HMOX1, CD47, CD46, CD55, THBD and EPCR). The immunosuppressive protocol included antithymocyte globulin (ATG, 1.5 mg kg−1 on days −2 and −1), rituximab (anti-CD20, 1,000 mg on day −3), Fc-modified anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (tegoprubart, 20 mg kg−1 on days −3, −2, −1, 1, 3, 7 and weekly thereafter) and anti-C5 antibody (ravulizumab, 3,330 mg on days −1, 7 and 28). This regimen was combined with standard maintenance immunosuppression consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid (540 mg twice daily) and glucocorticoids starting on day 0. On post-transplant day 8, a biopsy revealed Banff grade 2A TCMR without signs of thrombotic microangiopathy or antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment included a 500-mg pulse of methylprednisolone and anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab, 8 mg kg−1). Additional 500-mg methylprednisolone pulses were given on days 9 and 10, along with ATG (1.5 mg kg−1). Tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid doses were increased. Due to C3 deposition seen in the biopsy, pegcetacoplan, a targeted C3 and C3b inhibitor, was administered. However, as there was no evidence of antibody-mediated rejection, no further doses of tocilizumab were given.

Peripheral blood was collected for serum and plasma at pretransplantation (day −3), post-xenotransplantation (days 13, 20, 26, 33 and 51) and during suspected rejection (day 7 post-transplantation). Blood was collected in heparinized tubes for PBMCs isolation at pretransplantation (day −3) and post-xenotransplantation (days 13, 20, 26 and 33). Blood was also collected in Paxgene tubes for RNA profiling (days −3 and 7) and post-xenotransplantation (day 26). The sample collection schedule is shown in Fig. 1a. The patient provided written informed consent, as approved by the MGH Human Research Committee (IRB no: 2023P003631).

PBMCs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque solution (GE HealthCare), counted and cryopreserved in heat-inactivated Human AB serum (GeminiBio) with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in liquid nitrogen. The serum was isolated and stored at −80 °C until further analyses.

Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and washed two times with PBS ×1. Cells were then counted using a Countess II Automated Cell Counter and loaded for scRNA-seq using ×10 Genomics Chromium Single Cell 30 Kit (v3.1 Chemistry). We preprocessed the reads with pyroe 0.9.0, Salmon 1.10.3 and alevin 0.10.0 packages with the reference genome GRCh38.p14 v46 from Gencode, and performed the downstream analysis with Seurat 5.1.0.

Longitudinal recipient samples were integrated with 22 external healthy control samples from 3 publicly available PBMC datasets (GEO accessions GSE165080, GSE171555 and GSE192391) using Harmony 1.2.0. The GSE165080 dataset consisted of 6 female samples and 5 male samples with a mean age of 43.1 ± 7.94 years39; the GSE171555 dataset included 3 female and 2 male samples40; and the GSE192391 dataset consisted of 4 female and 2 male samples41. Age information was not available for the GSE171555 and GSE192391 datasets.

Before integration, each dataset underwent independent quality control filtering followed by normalization using the Seurat SCTransform function. Based on an empirical evaluation of the distributions of the number of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) (nCount_RNA), number of detected genes (nFeature_RNA), log-transformed gene-to-UMI ratio (log10GenesPerUMI) and mitochondrial gene expression ratio (mitoRatio), the following filters were applied: GSE165080: nCount_RNA ≥ 1,800; nFeature_RNA ≥ 900 and <2,500; log10GenesPerUMI ≥ 0.84 and mitoRatio < 22%. GSE192391: nCount_RNA ≥ 1,800; nFeature_RNA ≥ 1,000 and <2,500; log10GenesPerUMI ≥ 0.84 and mitoRatio < 10%. GSE171555: nCount_RNA ≥ 1,800; nFeature_RNA ≥ 900 and <2,500; log10GenesPerUMI ≥ 0.84 and mitoRatio < 8%. Recipient samples: nCount_RNA ≥ 350; nFeature_RNA ≥ 300 and <2,500; log10GenesPerUMI ≥ 0.84 and mitoRatio < 10%. An additional gene filtering step was applied to each dataset, retaining only genes expressed (that is, nonzero counts) in at least 10 cells.

After integration, marker genes for each cluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function following PrepSCTFindMarkers. Clusters were manually annotated into cell types based on the expression of the marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 3). A first round of annotation was performed at clustering resolutions of 0.2 and 0.4, resulting in 13 annotated cell types: CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, erythrocytes, B cells, CD16+ monocytes, megakaryocytes/platelets, naive-like CD8+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conventional dendritic cells, two subsets of CD14+ monocytes and two subsets of NK cells. A second round of annotation was performed after sub-clustering aggregated monocyte and T cell subsets, followed by marker gene identification. This round annotated a third subset of CD14+ monocytes, naive-like CD4+ T cells, CD8+ MAIT cells and Treg cells. Single cells expressing canonical marker genes of at least two major cell types were assumed to be doublets and excluded from the Seurat object.

Gene sets of interest across time were identified empirically by calculating the average log2 fold change at each time point relative to the pretransplant baseline. This analysis was performed separately for CD14+ monocyte subsets, CD16+ monocytes and NK cell subsets. Genes were then ranked based on the absolute average log2 fold change to prioritize those with the most pronounced temporal shifts in expression.

Venous blood collected at different time points and stored in PAXgene tubes at −80 °C were used for bulk RNA-seq. To process the bulk RNA-seq, we used FastQC 0.12.0 with standard parameters to evaluate the quality of the reads. We trimmed the adapters with Fastp 1.0.1 and quantified the abundance of transcripts with Salmon 1.10.3. We used the human reference transcriptome and the annotation named GRCh38.p14 v.46 from Gencode as the transcriptome reference. We used tximport 1.32.0 to import the abundance files and DESeq2 was used to harmonize samples. The same process was used for the public dataset (GSE120649 (ref. 27)). We used SRA tool 2.10.7 to download the public fastq files.

To perform proteomics analysis from serum samples, 11,000 markers were measured using SomaScan analysis (SomaLogic). This analysis was performed at the BIDMC Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Center using the SomaScan Assay Kit for human serum, covering ~11,000 proteins. The expression counts were standardized using the median of hybridization controls. The outliers were flagged based on the limit of variation of 0.4–2.5 of the ratios.

Untargeted metabolite analysis was performed using a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer equipped with a HESI II probe and coupled to a Vanquish binary ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample underwent two chromatographic separations. For both methods, 5 µl of the sample was injected into a BEH Z-HILIC column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters). The first separation was conducted at pH 9, using 15 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Merck) in 90% water and 10% acetonitrile as mobile phase A, then 95% acetonitrile and 5% water as mobile phase B. The gradient was applied at a flow rate of 0.225 ml per min, following a method adapted from42, and the mass spectrometer operated in negative mode. The second separation followed the method of Mülleder et al.43, with mobile phases A and B buffered with 10 mM ammonium formate and 45 mM formic acid (pH 2.7). Mobile phase A consisted of a 1:1 acetonitrile to water mixture, while mobile phase B contained 95:5:5 acetonitrile to water to methanol. Chromatography was conducted at 40 °C (column oven) and 4 °C (autosampler), with a gradient flow rate of 0.4 ml per min as follows: an initial hold at 95% B for 0.75 min, a linear decrease to 30% B from 0.75 to 3.00 min, followed by a 1.00 min isocratic hold at 30% B. Mobile phase B was then returned to 95% over 0.50 min, with re-equilibration under initial conditions. Mass spectrometry was performed in positive mode. Data acquisition was carried out in full-scan mode, with the spray voltage set to 3 kV (negative mode) or 3.5 kV (positive mode). The capillary temperature was maintained at 320 °C, the HESI probe at 300 °C, the sheath gas at 40 U, the auxiliary gas at 8 U and the sweep gas at 1 U. The resolving power was set to 120,000. An untargeted metabolite library was generated using top-15 DDA acquisitions on a pooled study sample, with MS1 and MS2 resolutions of 60,000 and 30,000, respectively.

Raw data files (.raw) were processed using MZmine 4.544 and emzed45. Metabolite MS2 spectra were compared against HMDB, GNPS, MassBank and MoNA databases using spectral library matching (ref to DDA_library). In addition, retention times and m/z values from full-scan acquisitions of a pooled study sample were cross-referenced with an in-house database containing retention times of authenticated standards (Human Endogenous Metabolite Compound Library Plus L2501, TargetMol). Internal standards were integrated via emzed, and raw peak areas were normalized by dividing by sample biomass and the mean internal standard area.

On the day of the transplant, an iliac lymph node was harvested during the surgery for cell isolation. A lymph node from a patient who did not receive ATG was used as a control. The tissues were minced and digested with 500 U ml−1 collagenase D (Roche) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 0.1 M EDTA in PBS, pH 7.2, buffer for 5 min before a final suspension in 5 mM EDTA (Gibco), 1% FBS (Gibco) in × 1 PBS, pH 7.2 (Boston BioProducts). Isolated cells were then mechanically dissociated through a 70-μm cell strainer (Corning) in a 50-ml tube, and red blood cells were lysed using hypotonic ACK buffer (Gibco). Cells were then counted and cryopreserved in heat-inactivated human AB serum (GeminiBio) with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in liquid nitrogen.

Monitoring of immune cells over time was performed using 100 μl of whole blood. Cells were stained with surface antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with 1× BD FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at room temperature for lysing red blood cells. We also stained cells isolated from human lymph nodes. Cells were thawed, washed twice and Fc-blocked (TruStain FcX, combination of anti-human CD16 (clone 3G8), CD32 (clone FUN-2) and CD64 (clone 10.1) antibodies, BioLegend, cat. no.: 422302) for 20 min before staining for surface markers for 30 min in FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS × 1) on ice. The information about the antibodies used is shown in Supplementary Table 1. Stained cells were analyzed on an LSR Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) for all experiments. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) in all experiments. Viable cells were selected based on the staining with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, cat. no.: L23105) before Fc-blocking. Gating strategies for PBMC analysis were as previously described and can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2.

Recipient's PBMCs from different time points were thawed and washed twice with RPMI 1640 (Gibco) containing 10% FBS (GeminiBio) and ×1 pen/strep (Gibco) (complete RPMI), and then resuspended in complete RPMI. In a 96-well round-bottomed tissue culture plate at a volume of 100 μl, 4 × 105 cells per well were seeded. Cells were stimulated with 100 μl of either complete RPMI (controls) or a mixture of bacterial and viral TLR ligands (0.025 μg ml−1 LPS, 10 μg ml−1 Pam3CSK4, 4 μg ml−1 R848, 25 μg ml−1 poly I:C—all from Invivogen). PBMCs from each sample were stimulated in duplicates. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, supernatants were obtained for Luminex analysis using the premixed ProcartaPlex Human Immune Monitoring Panel 65-plex (Thermo Fisher), including APRIL, BAFF, CXCL13, CD30, CD40L, CXCL5, CCL11, CCL24, CCL26, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), CX3CL1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CXCL1, hepatocyte growth factor, IFNα, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-2, IL-20, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-27, IL-2R, IL-3, IL-31, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, CXCL10, CXCL11, LIF, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, lymphotoxin-alpha, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, MDC, MIF, CXCL9, CCL3, CCL4, CCL20, MMP-1, nerve growth factor beta (NGF-β), SCF, SDF-1α, TNF, TNF-RII, TRAIL, TSLP, TWEAK and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). We read the assay in a Luminex200 machine, and data with a bead count <20 were excluded. Samples from the time points from one individual were measured on the same plate to mitigate the effect of potential plate-based technical variation on calculated fold changes between time points.

Bulk mRNA analysis was performed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded xenograft biopsies and a sample from the nontransplanted contralateral donor kidney, using the nCounter instrument (Nanostring) combined with the Banff Human Organ Transplant panel, following the methods and data analysis previously documented for human allograft biopsies25. The probe sequences were screened for homology with pig and NHP transcripts by a specialist at the manufacturer company (NanoString). We used probes from the panel that had >85% homology with porcine sequences for parenchymal cells or endothelium (n = 235 probes) and all probes for human leukocytes, similar to those used previously in pig-to-human xenografts5,30. Normalization was performed using seven housekeeping probes with >90% homology with the corresponding porcine transcripts. Pathways were manually curated from prior publications25,46,47,48 and KEGG Pathways (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html), Gene Ontology (geneontology.org) and Reactome (reactome.org) repositories. Cell types from tissue bulk were assessed with marker genes49.

Biopsy tissue was processed using standard kidney biopsy methods for light microscopy. hematoxylin and eosin samples were scored using the current Banff criteria50,51.

Frozen slides from the donor collateral kidney biopsy and xenografts at days 8 and 34 were processed for multiplex imaging on the Orion platform (RareCyte), following Lin et al.52. An Orion multiplex antibody panel was used to profile immune cell subsets (Supplementary Table 2). In brief, slides were thawed at room temperature and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min. They were washed in Tris‑buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X‑100 in Tris‑buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature, washed once in Tris‑buffered saline and once in PBS, and treated with 4.5% H2O2/24 mM NaOH in PBS (hydrogen peroxide solution) to reduce autofluorescence. After a surfactant wash and enhancer treatment, slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with ArgoFluor‑conjugated antibodies and Hoechst 33342. The next day, slides were washed extensively in PBS, mounted in ArgoFluor mounting medium (RareCyte 42‑1214‑000), and imaged on an Orion microscope. Fluorophores were then quenched with hydrogen peroxide solution, and a second round of overnight 4 °C staining was performed with a different set of ArgoFluor‑conjugated antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) plus Hoechst 33342, followed by mounting and imaging.

Image stitching, segmentation and single‑cell quantification were carried out using the MCMICRO pipeline53. A Gaussian mixture model implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks)54 excluded cells exhibiting excessive autofluorescence. Gating strategies were defined as follows: CD4 T cells: HLA‑ABC+, CD45+ and CD4+; CD8 T cells: HLA‑ABC+, CD45+ and CD8+; M1 macrophages: HLA‑ABC+, CD68+ and CD163−; M2 macrophages: HLA‑ABC+ and CD163+; NK cells: HLA‑ABC+, CD45+ and NKG2A+. The HLA‑ABC marker recognizes human MHC I, thereby excluding from counts the few residual donor pig kidney-resident M2 macrophages with which the CD163 antibody cross‑reacts (Extended Data Fig. 7).

After pig donor blood collection, PBMCs were isolated using Lympholyte-Mammal Cell Separation Media (Cedarlane) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Using a V-bottom 96-well-plate, serum was serially diluted in PBS ×1 as follows: 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64 and 1:128. Serum from a healthy human control and a Baboon previously transplanted with a pig kidney were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, along with different time points of the recipient serum. To avoid nonspecific binding sites, pig PBMCs (5 × 105 cells per well) were blocked with 10% heat-inactivated goat serum (R&D Systems, cat. no.: S13110H) for 20 mins at 4 °C. After two washes, pig PBMCs were incubated with serially diluted serum for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times in cold PBS × 1. Next, pig PBMCs were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-human IgG Fc-APC (clone M1310G05, BioLegend). After two washes, cells were resuspended in a staining buffer (PBS, 1% of bovine serum albumin, 0.09% sodium azide). Stained cells were analyzed on an LSR Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) for all experiments. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) in all experiments.

Karius retrieved porcine and human cfDNA using a protocol similar to that described by Blauwkamp et al.55. Briefly, plasma samples were initially processed by centrifugation to remove residual cells, after which cfDNA was extracted using a modified Mag-Bind cfDNA kit in automated liquid handling platforms. Sequencing libraries were prepared with dual-indexed Ovation Ultralow System kits and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq sequencers. The resulting reads underwent stringent bioinformatics processing, including alignment against human, porcine and microbial reference databases to distinguish human and porcine cfDNA fragments accurately. The concentration of each species' cfDNA was quantitatively estimated by normalizing against synthetic internal control molecules (WINC molecules), ensuring precise measurement of cfDNA abundance in plasma samples

We normalized all the data series to z-score with scikit-learn 1.6.156. To analyze the data in time, we used scikit-fda 0.9.157. With this package, we excluded outliers using the MS-Plot Outlier Detector method. We then used Fuzzy C-Means with l2-distance to cluster. We defined the optimal number of three clusters, calculating the silhouette score with scikit-learn 1.6.1. To plot the time series, we calculated the median with NumPy 2.2.0 and plotted the line and the violins with Matplotlib 3.8.0.

For the three clusters defined by functional data analysis, we used the z-score normalized proteomics data to calculate the nearest neighbors with scikit-fda 0.9.1, calculated the Louvain communities with NetworkX 3.4.258 based on the connectivity of the nearest neighbor's graph, followed by an enrichment analysis for each community with GSEApy 1.1.759. After annotating the clusters based on GSEApy results, we trained a k-neighbors classifier with scikit-fda 0.9.1 on proteomics Louvain labels. We predicted the Louvain communities for z-score normalized metabolomics data. To plot networks, we used Netgraph 4.13.1 to annotate the nodes. We used the package adjustText 1.3.0 (https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText).

After preprocessing the whole-blood bulk transcriptomic data, we normalized the expression counts with DESeq2. Next, we used the R package IOBR 0.99.860 to estimate the population abundance on whole blood using the LM22 and LM6 matrices without tumor optimization.

We calculated the log2 fold change between days 7 and 26 (log2[D7/D26]) for both transcriptomics and proteomics. Since we have only one sample, we selected the most relevant fold change by the first quartile of negative fold changes and the third quartile of positive fold changes to define downregulated and upregulated molecules, respectively. We found the intersection using Python native functions and performed an enrichment analysis with GSEApy 1.1.759. To plot the Venn diagram, we used the venn 0.1.3 package.

A chord diagram was constructed using the circlize package 0.4.1661 in R 4.4.2 to illustrate relationships between differentially expressed genes and proteins. Sectors representing upregulated and downregulated genes and proteins were color coded, and interconnections were drawn based on shared elements between sets. Edge transparency and arrow annotations were applied to improve interpretability.

To maintain consistency, we reprocessed the public dataset GSE120649 (ref. 27) from whole-blood human kidney transplant recipients using the same pipeline used for the xenotransplant samples. We used a previously described transcriptional profile of human allograft rejection28 to compare allo and xenotransplantation gene expression. To detect nonlinear correlation, we clustered the samples using the complete linkage method on the distance correlation metric with SciPy 1.11.462. We used seaborn 0.13.263 to plot the cluster heatmap.

Three distinct analyte clusters were identified based on their temporal dynamics: one characterized by a progressive decline over time, which included 3433 features (a), another by a posttransplantation increase with 2599 features (b), and a third that exhibited no consistent temporal pattern, including 2792 features (c). The lines connect the median of features for each day for the three functional data analysis (FDA) clusters to highlight the different directions of each cluster. The clusters were defined by the semi-supervised clustering, which is based on FuzzyCMeans with pairwise L2 distance. The silhouette score optimized the number of clusters. More details about algorithms are in the methods section of the paper.

Donor porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated with serial dilutions (1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128) of recipient serum collected at pre-transplant and days 7, 12, 21, and 26 posttransplant. Controls samples included serum from a healthy human individual and serum from a baboon previously transplanted with a porcine kidney (sensitized). Fluorescently labeled anti-human IgG antibody was used to quantify donor-specific antibody (DSA) levels by flow cytometry. The graph represents total IgG binding to porcine donor PBMCs, measured by geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI). Data expressed as mean ± SD. Experiments were performed in triplicate.

Gene expression profiles were analyzed in CD14⁺ and CD16⁺ monocyte subsets using the pre-transplant time point as baseline. Genes were ranked by the absolute average log2 fold-change across all time points to prioritize those with the most pronounced temporal shifts. Three major gene expression patterns were identified: gene set 1 (red) comprised genes upregulated after transplantation; gene set 2 (green) included genes that were downregulated; and gene set 3 (purple) contained genes predominantly expressed by CD16⁺ monocytes. Related to Fig. 2a–c.

Mpox virus particles (purple) seem to be spreading more easily between people.Credit: NIAID/SPL

As mpox continues to spark localized outbreaks in Africa and, on occasion, in other parts of the world, researchers are racing to understand how the virus managed to spread globally in 2022 — and how it might do so again.

A study published in December found that the strain that caused the 2022 outbreak persisted in the testes of mice for weeks after infection and caused tissue damage1, highlighting the possibility that the virus could impact male fertility. This has not yet been studied in people.

The study was posted on the preprint server bioRxiv and has not yet been peer reviewed. Meanwhile, the virus continues to evolve. In December, health officials reported a strain of the mpox virus that combines genetic elements of two existing types, or clades, for the first time. Although it is normal for viruses such as mpox to evolve, the more opportunities they are given to spread, the more likely they are to eventually evade protection from vaccines and treatments.

Taken together, these data show that scientists “still have a lot to learn” about existing strains, let alone new strains, says Boghuma Titanji, an infectious-disease physician at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Mpox belongs to the poxvirus family, which also includes smallpox, “so we should not underestimate what it can do if it's allowed to become firmly entrenched in human populations and continue to adapt”, she adds.

Mpox infections can cause painful, fluid-filled lesions on the skin, fever and, in severe cases, death. There are four known clades of the mpox virus: clades Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb (see ‘Quick guide to the clades of mpox virus').

The virus has been infecting humans since the 1970s. Historically, it rarely spread widely, but this all changed in the late-2010s, when a clade II strain caused a large outbreak in Nigeria. A similar clade IIb strain sparked the 2022 global outbreak, in which more than 100,000 people were infected. It is still ongoing.

Clade Ia: this clade has been spreading in Central Africa since the virus was first discovered to infect humans in 1970. Most infections have been in children, and, until the past few years, transmission occurred mainly from animals to humans.

Clade Ib: this clade has caused a surge of cases in Central Africa since its discovery in late 2023. It is known to spread from person to person, through means including sexual contact.

Clade IIa: the least-studied mpox clade. It has spread mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire. Modes of transmission are not fully understood; there is no documented evidence of sexual transmission, but it is likely that all forms of close contact contribute to its spread.

Clade IIb: the clade responsible for the still-simmering 2022 global outbreak. It is known to spread from person to person, through means including sexual contact. The most-affected population has been men who have sex with men.

In 2025, there was a large increase in infections with clade I mpox, which historically caused sporadic but deadly outbreaks in rural parts of Central Africa. A new subtype of clade I, called Ib, began spreading between people in dense urban areas in late 2023, possibly through sexual contact. This spread has worried scientists because the sudden emergence of clade Ib mpox mirrors the trajectory of clade II before it went global, Titanji says.

Over the past couple of years, researchers have been racing to understand how the new mpox clades, Ib and IIb, differ from their predecessors. Data from rodents infected with mpox offer evidence to support a theory that these clades are less lethal but more adept at spreading from one person to another because they cause milder illness2.

Rats infected with clade Ib mpox had higher survival rates than those infected with clade Ia, yet they transmitted just as much infectious virus. And the onset of visible skin lesions was significantly delayed in clade Ib infections, the researchers found.

These findings help to explain why the virus “might be quite efficient in spreading through sex”, as people could be unknowingly transmitting the virus before they are symptomatic, Titanji says.

Another group of scientists studied how clade IIb mpox infects mice1. They found high levels of infectious virus in the rodents' testes for at least three weeks after infection, suggesting that the male reproductive tract might act as a reservoir for the virus, and helping to explain why the virus is so efficiently transmitted through sexual contact.

The infection caused tissue damage that led to the loss of sperm production, the researchers found.

“We were expecting to see some inflammation or disorganization, but to see that potentially this infection was affecting male fertility was shocking,” says study co-author Alyson Kelvin, an emerging-virus specialist at the University of Calgary in Canada.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that households burn plastics to manage waste and help satisfy their energy demand. To examine the prevalence, extent, and reasons for using plastic waste as household fuel, we report on a survey with 1018 key informants from cities in 26 countries in the Global South. Informants were purposively selected due to their familiarity with the living conditions in their communities. One-third of respondents reported being aware of plastic waste burning, with some reporting that their households engaged in this practice. Analyses of the data reveal significant correlations of plastic waste burning with both supply factors, such as, the massive amount of waste generated (p = 0.000), expensive clean fuels (p = 0.004), and demand factors, including self-management of waste (p = 0.000). Expanding essential public waste management services and implementing programs that enhance the affordability of clean energy technologies, especially among marginalized and low-income communities, could reduce this health- and environment-damaging practice.

The management of plastic waste, with over half a billion tons of plastic produced annually and rising, is a major global environmental challenge1,2,3. Meanwhile, in cities across much of the Global South, waste management systems are grossly inadequate, with the quantity of unmanaged plastic waste therefore increasing4,5. The term Global South, as used in this study, refers to the low- and middle-income countries in the regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania6. These trends are thought to contribute to the increased burning of plastic waste. While some governments are now introducing policies and regulations to limit plastic use and disposal, including targeting its combustion, the gap between policy formulation and effective enforcement, especially in marginalized areas, is substantial7. Most mitigation efforts have thus far proven ineffective or inadequate. Plastic continues to accumulate in many settings8, and households need to find new ways to manage the waste surrounding them.

At the same time, clean fuels and technologies whose emissions meet the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide(CO) levels recommended in the World Health Organization's (WHO) global air quality guidelines9, such as electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, natural gas, and ethanol, remain largely unaffordable for people living in extreme poverty. This compels them to depend on traditional solid biomass fuels such as firewood, charcoal, crop residues, and animal dung10. However, many urban residents with lower socioeconomic status in the Global South are finding biomass fuels to be increasingly scarce, due to population growth and limited access to these traditional fuels11.

Thus, there are growing concerns that energy-poor, solid fuel-dependent households who must self-manage their own and their communities' plastic waste may turn to burning plastic waste as a no or low-cost alternative for cooking and heating12. For instance, Nigeria's Multi-Tier Framework for Energy Access survey data reveals that roughly 13% of 3511 surveyed households reported garbage as one of their household fuels over the prior 12-month period13, and similar practices have been reported in other locations14. While it is generally believed that plastic is used primarily to ignite cooking fires15,16,17, households living through humanitarian crises and in urban settings more generally, have reported burning plastic waste as a primary cooking fuel18,19.

Despite the considerable potential health, environmental, and socioeconomic risks associated with plastic waste burning4,19,20, the extent and prevalence of its use as a household fuel remain poorly understood12. The scarcity of data and evidence limits a comprehensive understanding of the issue, complicating the design of effective strategies to mitigate its impacts21. To address this gap, we conducted a primary survey among purposively selected key informants across 26 countries in the Global South. All participants were familiar with urban living conditions, particularly those of low-income communities, where the practice of burning plastic waste is suspected to be most common. Although this approach does not yield a population-representative sample in the settings considered, the survey does reveal that the burning of plastic waste is widespread. It offers a starting point for future research on the underlying drivers and impacts of this behavior21. As such, it represents a crucial step towards developing targeted programs to counteract the harmful effects of global plastic waste burning.

The Global South is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate, creating an urgent demand for rapid expansion of infrastructure, services, and economic opportunities. However, many low-income countries face acute resource constraints that hinder their ability to keep pace with this growth22,23. By 2050, an estimated two-thirds of the global population is expected to reside in urban areas, with much of this growth occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)24. Historically, this rapid urbanization has led to the proliferation of informal settlements within these nations. Access to reliable energy, effective waste management systems, and modern water and sanitation services remains very low in some cities in the Global South25,26. These infrastructure deficiencies pose serious health and environmental risks and exacerbate social inequalities and unrest27. In response to these systemic gaps, informal solutions, such as plastic waste burning, have emerged as a means to address the lack of proper waste management and energy access needs28.

Continued use of traditional stoves enables the burning of waste plastic as fuel. Low-income households migrating to informal settlements to escape high rental costs often face barriers in accessing affordable, clean fuels. Moreover, the rapid growth of densely populated settlements intensifies pressure on local forests and other natural resources, driving up the costs of traditional fuels such as wood and charcoal29. One notable consequence is the increased scarcity of biomass fuels, which has become a contributing factor to accelerating the energy transition in many urban environments. This transition is occurring at a highly unequal rate30. However, it is leaving lower socioeconomic status and marginalized communities behind31, and exacerbating energy insecurity for those least able to afford clean commercial fuels10 and forcing them to look for no- or low-cost fuels, which can include unmanaged solid waste.

As a readily available waste product that combusts easily, plastic is a potentially attractive fuel source for low-income households struggling to meet their energy needs. Plastic waste is difficult to manage as it does not decay like organic waste, nor does it have the resale value that metals have; this makes burning or incineration a widely accepted method of management1,28. Unfortunately, burning waste, particularly plastic waste, releases many harmful toxins that negatively affect household environments and spill over to contribute to poor urban air quality20,32. The harms from plastic burning extend beyond direct human exposure to toxic emissions via inhalation. Secondary impacts, including ingestion of contaminated food, documented in environmental analyses, underscore additional risks associated with plastic combustion33. For example, chicken egg samples from an electronic waste site in Ghana, where plastic and cables were burnt in an open fire, have been found to contain toxins34,35. Additionally, the technologies and tools used to burn plastic waste, along with how individuals interact with these tools, likely play a critical role in influencing the environmental and health impacts of this practice, both within households and across broader communities.

While systematic evidence on the prevalence and extent of plastic waste burning as a household fuel remains limited, anecdotal and localized studies indicate that the practice could be widespread15,16,36. Systematic and comprehensive data gathering on this topic, including results from this survey, is needed to advance understanding of the complex dynamics of plastic waste burning and to inform policies and targeted programs aimed at mitigating its risks21.

Responses were obtained from 1018 key informants familiar with the context of their cities were analysed in this study; see Table 1 for sample summary statistics (and “Methods” for additional details). Respondents were asked about the general prevalence of plastic waste burning in their city. Among 931 responses for this question, 22% indicated that plastic burning was slightly prevalent, 35% reported it was moderately prevalent, 26% responded it was very prevalent, and 8% described it as extremely prevalent (Fig. 1a).

a Reported prevalence of burning plastic waste; b Agreement that plastic waste is used as a cooking fuel; c Agreement that plastic waste is commonly burned in traditional stoves; and d Awareness of burning plastic waste as a fuel. The numbers above the bars indicate the percentages for each response. Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding.

Respondents were also asked about the use of plastic waste as a household fuel through three questions. Among the 989 respondents who answered a first question on burning of plastic cooking fuel as a replacement for other fuels, 19% somewhat agreed and 8% strongly agreed, indicating notable agreement to this practice (Fig. 1b). Meanwhile, 22% neither agreed nor disagreed, while the remaining respondents either disagreed (21%) or strongly disagreed (30%) with the statement.

In a second question, 32% of participants somewhat agreed, and 24% strongly agreed that burning plastic waste in traditional stoves is common practice (N = 985). By contrast, 16% disagreed, and 13% strongly disagreed (Fig. 1c). These responses suggest a higher prevalence of plastic waste burning compared to the first survey question, which may indicate that plastic burning is used primarily to manage household plastic waste, rather than as a primary or preferred energy source for cooking.

The third question asked respondents whether they were aware that plastic waste was used as a household fuel in their cities, with three response options: yes, unsure and no. Affirmative answers to this question appear to lie between those on the two other questions: out of 998 respondents who answered the question, 37% reported being aware of this practice, 37% were unsure, and 27% were unaware (Fig. 1d).

The 365 respondents who indicated awareness of plastic waste burning for energy purposes in their city, from the final question ‘Are you aware of burning waste plastic as fuel', were also asked follow-up questions regarding the specific purpose of this practice. Out of the total respondents, 16% reported burning plastic for at least one purpose, 10% reported using it for two purposes, and 5% for three different purposes.

Nearly half (48%) reported witnessing others burn plastic waste as a cooking fuel, while 14% responded that they had done so themselves. Another 13% indicated they had heard about the practice but had not seen it firsthand (Fig. 2a). Regarding the burning of plastic waste for heating purposes, 37% had seen others doing it, 12% had done it themselves, and 18% had only heard about it being done (Fig. 2b). A smaller proportion of respondents were aware of plastic being burned to prepare cattle feed: 12% had witnessed it, 11% had heard about it, and 4% had engaged in the practice (Fig. 2c). The lower awareness of the latter likely reflects the relatively limited cattle ownership in the urban areas that were the focus of our survey.

Percentage of respondents aware of plastic waste being burnt and used as (a) cooking fuel, (b) heating, (c) heating cattle feed, (d) by mixing with other fuels like firewood, (e) deter pests, (f) fire starter. This is a follow-up question asked only to respondents who indicated they were aware of burning plastic (Fig. 1d) waste as fuel (N = 365). The numbers above the bars indicate the percentages for each response. Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding.

Fuel stacking, the use of multiple fuel types to meet household energy needs, is a well-documented practice in low-income settings37. However, this behavior can contribute to increased toxic emissions, especially when polluting fuels such as plastic are mixed with other materials38. To explore this further, the survey examined the extent to which plastic is combined with other fuels in household fires. Among those aware of plastic burning, 22% reported burning plastic with different fuels, 46% had witnessed this practice, and 14% had heard about it (Fig. 2d). Integrating plastic waste into household fuel use for multiple purposes appears to be relatively common among respondents familiar with plastic combustion.

The survey also investigated whether burning plastic waste is employed to deter pests and insects, as smoke emissions from polluting energy sources are sometimes considered effective in doing so39. While only 6% of respondents reported burning plastic waste for this purpose, 17% had witnessed it, and 19% had heard about it (Fig. 2e). The survey also investigated whether plastic waste is used for lighting fires. The survey found that 38% of respondents had used plastic as a fire starter, 40% had witnessed this use, and 13% had only heard about it (Fig. 2f).

The extent to which plastic waste is used as a household fuel varies by country, with patterns that correlate with regional and national income levels. Figure 3 show the proportion of respondents who agreed that plastic waste is used as a fuel substitute, acknowledged plastic burning to be a common practice, and reported awareness of plastic waste combustion for energy purposes according to country income (Fig. 3a, c) and by region (Fig. 3b, d). The measures were converted from a Likert scale – previously discussed in Fig. 1—to a binary variable indicating some or strong agreement. Plastic waste combustion is more prevalent in low-income countries, except for heating purposes (Fig. 3b), which likely reflects differences in climate. Regional differences are also notable, with respondents in Sub-Saharan Africa reporting a higher prevalence of these practices compared to those in other regions, for all purposes (Fig. 3d). Additionally, the disaggregated data suggest that fuel substitution with plastic (the first measure) may be somewhat over-reported in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and Southeast Asia (SEA). This is indicated by higher rates of agreement (represented by the orange bars) compared to direct awareness of plastic waste combustion for energy needs (green bars).

Respondents who reported awareness of burning plastic waste as a household fuel (N = 366) were asked additional questions about the specific types of plastic materials being burned, the product(s) they originated from, and the stoves used for their combustion. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE) is the most frequently reported type of burned plastic waste, followed by low-density Polyethylene (LDPE). PET and LDPE are common single-use plastics found in beverage bottles (e.g., water and juice bottles) and bags (Fig. 4a). They are the most common plastic materials found in household waste and accumulating in the oceans bordering Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia40,41,42. The third most frequently reported plastic being burned is high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a material frequently used for chemical containers. The fifth most frequently used plastic material is polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is mostly used in plastic plumbing pipes, and is a major cause of dioxin emissions43.

a Mean of the rank value of plastic materials. The y-axis indicates the mean rank value, where 7 is the most frequently burned and 1 is the least frequently burned plastic material (the rank value flipped from the original scale), as reported by those aware of plastic burning for fuel (N = 306). b Relative frequency of plastic products burned for fuel among those aware of plastic burning (N = 318). c Percentage of responses by stove type most commonly used by households to burn plastic (N = 323). A 3-Stone (Three-Stone) stove is a primitive traditional stove where three stones are arranged to support a pot; a mud stove is an enclosed stove built from mud; an improved cooking stove (ICS) is a more efficient, safer and less polluting stove; and a charcoal stove is designed to use charcoal as fuel.

In terms of product origin, nearly two-thirds of respondents reported burning food wrappers, followed by chemical packaging materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and cleaning liquid containers (Fig. 4b). Food wrappers, made from polypropylene (PP), account for the largest share of waste generation by polymer type14,44,45, and are reported as the most frequently burned plastic product. Other commonly burned plastic items included non-food household plastics like buckets and plastic bags (35%), construction materials such as pipes (32%), and components from tyres and white goods, i.e., household electrical appliances (26%). Traditional cooking stoves such as those using 3-stone and charcoal are among the most widely used stoves for burning plastic waste (Fig. 4c).

Energy consumption is influenced by household socio-demographic characteristics. To better understand the socio-demographic factors associated with burning plastic waste as a fuel, respondents were presented with a set of factors and asked to rate the likelihood that individuals with these characteristics could burn plastic waste as fuel, on a scale from −10 (not likely) to +10 (most likely).

Households that include people with disabilities—with the term ‘disabilities' left undefined in the survey question—were seen as less likely to burn plastic waste, possibly due to their limitations in collecting plastic waste (Fig. 5a). By contrast, respondents indicated that households in areas excluded from waste management services could be most likely to burn plastic waste, followed by those experiencing poverty and those living in informal settlements. Additionally, households with members working at waste sites, such as waste pickers, were perceived to be more likely to burn plastic waste as fuel. The regionally disaggregated results highlight variations in the perceptions of these socio-demographic correlates with the burning of plastic waste as fuel.

Overall (bar graph) and disaggregated by region (heatmap). a Percentage of respondents who believe burning plastic waste is positively associated with various socio-demographic groups. Responses were measured using a scale ranging from −10 to +10 (where −10 indicates a strong and negative association, i.e., low likelihood of burning plastic waste as household fuel; and +10 indicates a strong and positive association, i.e., high likelihood of burning plastic waste), converted binary variable that takes value of 1 for respondents with positive response (1 to 10) otherwise zero. b Percentage of respondents who somewhat agree or strongly agree about the reasons for burning plastic waste overall (bar graph) and disaggregated by region (heatmap). Responses measured using a scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree rescaled as a binary that takes the value of 1 for respondents who select somewhat agree or strongly agree, otherwise 0. LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; SEA = South Asia SA = South Asia; SAF = Southern Africa; WAF = Western Africa; EAF = Eastern Africa; MAF = Middle Africa. The MAF and LAC numbers are based on responses from a single country in each region, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, respectively.

In compact neighborhoods lacking waste management services, some residents may be concerned about the open burning of plastic waste. In such instances, households may choose to burn plastic waste in their traditional indoor stoves to avoid drawing concern. Respondents were asked to indicate why households might burn plastic waste as a household fuel, based on their levels of agreement with the question “Below are some reasons why households might burn plastic waste for household fuel. Please rate the extent to which you agree with these statements”. Respondents indicated strong agreement that a lack of awareness of the health impacts of burning plastic was a reason for burning plastic waste, a finding that is also consistent across regions (Fig. 5b). The second highest level of agreement was for two other reasons: to “manage waste” and cope with “expensive clean fuel”. Respondents expressed lower agreement on the role of low availability of traditional fuels as a reason for burning plastic. They generally disagreed that plastic is a versatile fuel or that the burning of plastic waste as a fuel is socially acceptable. In the regionally disaggregated results, respondents from Latin America and the Caribbean tended to highlight a lack of waste management and a lack of awareness as the main reasons for burning plastic. In contrast, respondents from Asia, Southern Africa, and West Africa also tended to emphasize the role played by the low availability of traditional fuels.

Awareness of these risks was assessed, for four different types of risks, based on agreement with the statement “What do you believe are the major risks of burning plastic for households?” (the level of agreement was recorded on a Likert scale ranging from extremely unlikely (1) to extremely likely (5)). Respondents strongly agreed on the risks and impacts of toxic emissions inhalation, fire hazards, and food contamination, with results also consistent across regions (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). While a detailed understanding of the risks from burning plastic waste to the environment and human health is limited, there was a high degree of awareness that these impacts could be harmful, with both direct and indirect consequences.

More specifically, out of 936 respondents, 40% indicated that they thought burning plastic was extremely likely to contribute to fire hazards, and 40% stated this was somewhat likely. Regarding the risk of toxic emissions and air pollution from burning plastic, 62% indicated that this was extremely likely, and 26% indicated that it was somewhat likely. Roughly 6 in 10 respondents thought it was extremely likely that toxic chemicals from burning plastic waste could contaminate food and water, while 29% indicated it was somewhat likely.

Given the higher exposure rates for household members who spend more time indoors, respondents were also asked to indicate the likelihood of greater risks of exposure for females, children, people living with disabilities, and senior citizens. Forty-six percent of respondents reported that increased risk of exposure was extremely likely, and 34% reported that it was somewhat likely (See Supplementary Fig. 1).

Energy use, including the burning of plastic waste, is contextual, and addressing energy poverty requires localized solutions that are appropriate to their specific context46,47. Respondents were asked to rank what they believed was the most important solution to the issue of burning plastic waste as household fuel in their city. As shown in Fig. 6, the average rankings (where lower values indicate higher effectiveness) suggest that improved and expanded solid waste management services for informal settlements (waste management) are seen as the most effective solution to the problem, followed by increased access to clean energy technologies and raising awareness about the negative effects of burning plastics for fuel. Bans on the use of plastic were also ranked as having high importance, whereas the supply of traditional fuels and the conversion of plastic to a safe fuel were among the lower-ranked solutions. There are regional variations in perceptions of these solutions. Respondents from South Asia and Southern Africa ranked a ban on plastic use as the most effective solution, possibly due to plastic ban policies. Respondents in Latin America and the Caribbean considered waste management and clean cooking to be more important than awareness. In East and Central Africa, access to clean energy was ranked as the most important solution among low-income households. While these results are subjective and may be subject to differing interpretations of this question, the result underscores the need for contextual strategies.

Responses were ranked in order of importance (1 = the most effective solution and 7 = the least effective solution) (N = 832). LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; SEA = South Asia SA = South Asia; SAF = Southern Africa; WAF = Western Africa; EAF = Eastern Africa; MAF = Middle Africa. The MAF and LAC numbers are based on responses from a single country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, respectively.

Individuals active in socially engaged professions, e.g., community-based organization personnel, community workers, or teachers, were significantly more likely to agree that plastic waste burning occurs in their communities (p = 0.003). However, they did not report direct awareness of others or themselves engaging in it (Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 4). Respondents who perceived municipal solid waste management fees as unaffordable (p < 0.007, Column 1; p < 0.019, Column 2) were also more likely to report that plastic burning occurs and that they engage in it. A perception of clean fuels as expensive was also positively correlated with these outcomes (p < 0.000, Column 1; p < 0.000, Column 2; p < 0.004, Column 3). Meanwhile, city-level factors such as quantities of plastic waste (p < 0.023, Column 2; p < 0.008, Column 3), and population without waste collection services (p < 0.000, Column 2; p < 0.000, Column 3) were positively correlated with direct awareness of others' or individuals' own plastic waste burning for energy purposes. The insignificant correlations between the volume of mismanaged plastic waste in the city and the population without waste collection, on one hand, and respondents' general agreement that plastic is burned for energy purposes, on the other, may be related to overreporting of general awareness compared to direct awareness.

Agree (green) shows the odds ratios from the logistic regression for respondents' agreement on the use of plastic as fuel. The dependent variable is binary, converted to indicate if respondents somewhat or strongly agreed with the statements “It is common practice to burn plastic waste (like polythene bags) in the fire of traditional stoves,” as 1, and otherwise 0. Aware (purple) presents the odds ratios for the dependent variable for awareness of plastic waste burning based on the third question in Fig. 1, which takes the value of 1 if respondents answered ‘yes' to the question: “Are you aware of households burning plastic waste as fuel to meet their household energy needs (e.g., fire starters and for cooking and heating)?”, otherwise 0. Used (lavender) shows the odds ratio of respondents' own burning plastic waste for various purposes, where the dependent variable takes a value of 1 if respondents reported burning plastic themselves (yes, I have done it) for cooking, heating, mixed energy use, preparing cattle feed, deterring pests, or starting fires. To improve the readability of coefficient estimates and odds ratios in the coefficient plot, variables measured in percentages (no waste collection and basic sanitation services) and grams (total waste and plastic waste generation) were rescaled (robust 95% confidence interval in bar). Errors are clustered at the city level. See Supplementary Table 3 for summary statistics of variables and Supplementary Table 4 for full results).

Fuel supply factors (availability and accessibility to clean fuels), urban waste management (linked to economic development), and demand drivers (e.g., higher development and income levels reducing reliance on polluting fuels) all influence plastic burning practices. Interpreted together, they highlight the link between inadequate waste management systems, expensive clean cooking fuel, and reliance on plastic waste as a household fuel. A perception that waste management services and clean fuels are expensive highlights and reiterates the vital importance of affordability. Reliance on traditional fuels and stoves also contributes to household vulnerability, which in turn facilitates the domestic burning of plastic as a fuel. While open burning of plastic waste is a well-known and common waste management strategy in many cities in the Global South, the widespread prevalence and correlates of domestic burning of these materials have not previously been documented. These results reinforce the importance of cross-cutting programs to improve waste management systems (SDG11.6) and expand access to affordable, clean cooking solutions to low-income households (SDG7).

The energy sources used by households are determined by the context in which they live, as well as the availability and affordability of alternative options. Given the combustible nature of plastic, the increasing volumes of this material in waste, and the reality that many households in the Global South must self-manage their waste, the use of plastic as a domestic fuel may be on the rise. However, a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the scale and distribution of plastic waste burning has heretofore been missing, impeding efforts to plan and develop effective strategies to mitigate the problem.

The results of this study lend stronger credence to this conjecture; a survey of key informants from 26 countries in the Global South reveals that plastic waste has been integrated into household energy practices in numerous and diverse ways in many urban communities. Four key insights emerge from this study. First, the use of plastic as a household fuel is prevalent in cities of the Global South. Though the study statistics should not be interpreted to be representative at the population level in the survey locations, owing to the purposive sampling strategy that was utilized to select knowledgeable community informants as respondents, 16% of respondents reported burning plastic as a fuel in their own households, and awareness of such practices was much higher. Importantly, key community informants are likely to have a higher local socioeconomic status, and their reported rate of burning plastic as fuel be lower than less advantaged groups. Nonetheless, the reported prevalence of this practice is comparable to that found in the World Bank's Multitier Framework Survey conducted in Northwest Nigeria, where 13% of surveyed households reported burning waste, including plastic, as a household fuel, or in smaller-scale surveys in Eswatini and Guatemala15,19.

Second, the reported burning of plastic waste was found to be prevalent in many countries and cities in this study, suggesting that this practice does not result solely from energy poverty, but also represents a vital informal solution in many settings to cope with systemic municipal service gaps and a high rate of mismanaged plastic. Low-income households living in precarious urban conditions are often forced to self-manage waste21, and frequently rely on low-cost and easily accessible methods for disposal of accumulating and non-biodegradable waste. The risk that more households will resort to burning plastic waste as fuel could increase unless these service gaps are addressed. Third, combustion of waste, including plastic, can help households living in extreme poverty to satisfy their energy needs in the face of growing scarcity of other traditional low-cost fuel sources. The survey results help illustrate how burning plastic waste emerges as such a zero- or low-cost option and the challenges in deciding between cooking a meal for the family and exposure to potentially hazardous emissions. Poverty, deep inequality and unmanaged urbanization within cities, reduced availability of traditional fuels, and increasing plastic pollution could intensify such practices.

Fourth, our analysis serves to underscore the synergistic relationship between United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): making cities more sustainable (SDG11) and access to clean energy (SDG7). Efforts to achieve SDG11, through the provision of adequate housing and improved and inclusive waste management in other cities, will weaken the supply driver of highly available plastic waste and the need for self-management of that waste. SDG11.6 specifically targets increased waste collection services, management of waste in controlled facilities, and reduction of fine particulate matter concentrations in cities. Reducing the burning of waste plastic as fuel is thus a potential channel and area of action to lower emissions through improved waste management. Meanwhile, on the demand side, willingness to burn plastic waste as a fuel or use a traditional stove to manage it is limited if viable and affordable alternatives are present. At the core of this practice is the necessity to satisfy energy demands and to eliminate plastic pollution, at low or zero financial cost. Therefore, progress towards achieving SDG7, which has been greater in urban than in rural settings48,49,50 but has largely overlooked the persistent deprivation of low-income neighborhoods in cities in low- and middle-income countries, will weaken the demand element of this practice.

The design of practical solutions to tackle this complex problem requires a deep and contextual understanding of the interlinked problems of household energy poverty and inadequate waste management services, coupled with a willingness to test programs or policies that address those problems. For example, improved solid waste management, specifically waste collection, could decrease the need for burning of plastic as a waste management strategy, but effectively delivering such services in crowded, low-income areas, where collecting waste management fees is difficult and trust in formal government institutions is low, remains a challenge. Similarly, addressing energy insecurity requires new, low-cost clean energy innovations or well-targeted financial support that renders existing solutions more affordable. Moreover, tackling each of these problems in isolation—or incompletely—risks failure. Restrictions on open burning alone, for instance, could push households to burn even more plastic waste inside their homes.

This study took an initial step toward filling critical knowledge gaps in this domain; however, three main limitations should be addressed in future work to enhance understanding and inform decision-making. First, as noted above, the study used a purposive sampling strategy to select knowledgeable community informants as respondents and thus does not provide a population-representative understanding of the scale and distribution of plastic waste burning to meet households' waste management and energy needs. Such respondents may have a biased view of practices in their communities. To build on and validate this work, further investigation is recommended using representative household samples from across the Global South, including plastic waste hotspots and notspots, underserved communities, and informal settlements. This investigation should incorporate plastic as a fuel category and consider local waste management and settlement contexts. Such work could also investigate these practices in rural areas, which our study did not consider. Second, and relatedly, this study employed a relatively short, internet-based survey due to resource and logistical constraints, which limits the extent to which we could more fully investigate the nature and drivers of this practice. Third, the study does not identify the impacts of these practices on household health and well-being, as well as environmental quality, nor is it suitable for identifying practical strategies to mitigate harmful effects. Work on the former requires attention to research designs that allow valid inferences on the specific impacts of plastic waste burning, which typically co-exists with many other harms, on individuals' and overall social welfare20,51. The latter, meanwhile, requires careful impact evaluations of pilot and scaled-up efforts—combining improved energy access and waste management elements—to reduce the prevalence of this practice. Such studies must devote attention to measuring emissions, food contamination risks, and health and welfare endpoints, to provide deeper insights into the behavioral, economic, and systemic drivers compelling households to use plastic waste for fuel.

Indeed, key factors identified in this study—such as inadequate waste management, energy poverty, limited accessibility and affordability of clean and alternative fuels, cultural norms, and systemic deficiencies in waste management, inclusive urban governance, sustainable human settlement and energy infrastructure—warrant closer examination. A thorough understanding of the prevalence and behavioral aspects of this issue can inform the development of targeted, context-specific programs. These may include educational campaigns highlighting the health and environmental hazards of burning plastic, improving access to clean and affordable energy alternatives, strengthening waste management systems, introducing cost-effective technologies for cleaner plastic combustion, and other viable strategies. As rapid urbanization continues to outpace the expansion of essential services in many regions, the urgency of implementing these measures will only intensify.

The analysis presented in this paper draws on survey data collected from key informants purposively recruited by the research team, which included researchers based in each of the 26 study countries. These informants provided diverse perspectives on plastic waste burning practices in urban areas across 11 countries in Asia, 1 in Latin America, and 14 in Africa. In each country, efforts were made to survey expert individuals from seven groups that included: a) researchers affiliated with universities or research institutes; b) local government officials or civil service personnel; c) socially engaged professionals, such as doctors and lawyers; d) community leaders (e.g., ward leaders or traditional leaders); e) personnel from NGOs or community-based organization (e.g., cooperatives); f) private sector representatives, such as waste collection managers; and g) other knowledgeable individuals who, while not belonging to the above groups, possess valuable insights into urban realities. The sample is not nationally representative; however, the perspectives of these knowledgeable and community-engaged informants capture a broad range of practices across surveyed countries. (Refer to Supplementary Table 1 for a full list of study countries).

The survey was conducted between July and November 2024. Country collaborators distributed the survey via email or by sharing flyers containing links and QR codes to an online Qualtrics form. These flyers were circulated through personal connections and during seminars, conferences, and community meetings to target respondents with relevant knowledge of local urban realities and the survey topics. A survey guideline provided potential respondents with an overview of the study and instructions for completing the questionnaire. Respondents also had the option to request in-person support from a local collaborator for completing survey questions if needed, e.g., for language interpretation or if they were unable to read the questions in the instrument. In such cases, a collaborator or trained enumerator conducted the survey in person or via phone and recorded the responses using the online survey platform.

The survey was implemented in two languages: French and English. The French version was used in Togo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while the English version was used in all other participating countries. The study was approved by the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (approval number HRE2024-0177). Where required, a reciprocal ethics application was used by a country collaborator.

The questionnaire was structured into multiple sections covering waste and plastic pollution management, cooking fuel use, and the practice of burning plastic (Supplementary Data 1). It included questions on respondents' awareness of direct observations of plastic burning in their communities for household energy needs. Additionally, respondents were asked to rank potential solutions to address plastic burning. The final section gathered information on respondent characteristics and socio-demographic details. The full survey instrument is provided in the Supplementary Information.

Respondents were asked to respond to “In your opinion, how prevalent do you think burning waste plastic is in your city?” on a Likert scale (Not prevalent at all (1) to extremely prevalent (5)) (Q8.1) to understand the general prevalence of burning plastic waste in their local community.

There were three questions in different sections of the survey about the burning of waste plastic by households for fuel, which were designed to triangulate on perceptions of this practice within each study location.

The first question asked respondents to indicate their level of agreement, on a Likert scale (1 to 5), with the statement “Plastic is used for cooking fuel as a replacement for other fuels.” (Q3.1.6). This question sought to assess whether respondents believed that some households in their city burn plastic, at least partially, to meet cooking fuel needs beyond simple ignition.

Second, participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement, using a Likert scale (Strongly disagree (1) to Strongly agree (5)), with the statement: “It is common practice to burn plastic waste (like polythene bags) in the fire of traditional stoves” (Q3.3.2). This question aimed to evaluate the prevalence of burning plastic waste in household stoves, in a way that might also capture burning for purposes of igniting the fire or simply to eliminate plastic waste.

The third question, “Are you aware of households burning waste plastic as fuel to meet their household energy needs (e.g. fire starters and for cooking and heating)?” (Q5.1), with responses of no, unsure/maybe and yes, was aimed to understand respondent awareness about the practice of burning waste plastic as fuel in their locality.

A follow-up question was asked to the respondents who selected yes to the third question to capture more directly their source of awareness on various purposes of burning waste plastic as fuel. The follow-up question asked “Please indicate whether you are aware of the following scenarios occurring” (Q5.2) where respondents selected among several options—‘No'; ‘Unsure'; ‘Yes; I have done it; ‘Yes, I have seen it'; and ‘Yes, I have heard about it'—for a) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fuel for cooking / preparing food (Cooking); b) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fuel for heating (Heating); c) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fuel for cattle feed preparation (Cattle feed); d) Plastic waste is burnt alongside other fuels like firewood (Mix fuel); e) Plastic waste being burnt and used to produce smoke that will deter pests e.g. mosquitos (Deter pest); and f) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fire starter (Fire starter).

Respondents were also asked about the type of waste plastic burned (Q5.5 and Q5.6), the type of stove used for burning (Q5.7), the reason for burning waste plastic as fuel (Q6.1), perceptions of likelihood of burning by different socio-demographic characteristics (Q7.1), and associated risks (Q7.2) and solutions (Q8.2).

A total of 1188 respondents started the survey, but 170 (14% of the sample) responses were not usable (Supplementary Fig. 2). Among these unusable responses, 26 were from individuals who did not consent to participate, 26 came from non-sample countries (likely provided through email referrals), and the remaining responses were from individuals who initially agreed to participate but abandoned the survey after answering only a few questions. This drop-off may have been caused by challenges encountered while completing the survey on some types of mobile devices. After data cleaning, 1018 responses were finally retained for analysis (86% of total responses), though some of these responses contained missing data for specific questions. The lowest number of responses came from South Africa (15 responses), while the largest number was from Indonesia (132 responses). The median number of responses in each country is 34, with a mean of 39 responses.

Of the 904 respondents with fully complete survey data, 35.5% were researchers at universities or research institutes, 20.8% were affiliated with local government or civil service, 6.8% were socially engaged professionals (e.g., teacher, health care provider), 1.9% were community leaders, 9.4% worked for NGOs or CBOs, and 11.6% were employed by private operators and companies (Table 1, Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Data 2). The remaining 14% were from other categories such as consultants, politicians, contractors and animal scientists.

The coverage of respondents' work organizations included: 18% in multinational organizations, 45% in national organizations, 20% at municipal or city-level structures, and 17% working at the sub-municipal or community level. Slightly less than half (43%) of the survey respondents were female, and the mean respondent age was 33 years (s.d. = 10.4 years). Most respondents (85%) held a bachelor's degree, while 13% had attained a Doctoral or equivalent degree, and 33% held a Master's or equivalent degree. In terms of primary domains of expertise, 16% of respondents reported specializations in the natural sciences, 25% in engineering, 10% in agricultural sciences, and 8% in medical/health sciences. Finally, regarding experience, 43% of respondents reported having more than five years' experience in their field.

We employed logistic regression for all models reported in Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 4. The first model reported as green points with horizontal confidence interval bars in Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 4 (Column 1) examines the correlation between respondents' perceptions of burning plastic waste in general and for energy purposes and various demographic, institutional, and city- and country-level variables. Odds ratios were estimated for agreement and awareness regarding the use of plastic waste as household fuel. The first variable focuses on respondents' subjective agreement, where the dependent variable reflects respondents' agreement that plastic waste is burned in household fires, based on Fig. 1b. Specifically, the dependent variable is assigned a value of 1 if the respondent somewhat or strongly agreed with the statement “It is common practice to burn plastic waste (like polythene bags) in the fire of traditional stoves.”

The purple points with horizontal confidence interval bars in Fig. 7 examine the correlation between respondents' awareness regarding the burning of plastic waste as fuel and various demographic, institutional, and city- and country-level variables. Specifically, the dependent variable is assigned a value of 1 if the respondent selected yes to the question “Are you aware of households burning waste plastic as fuel to meet their household energy needs (e.g., fire starters and for cooking and heating)?”.

The dependent variable in lavender points with horizontal confidence interval bars in Fig. 7 takes the value 1 if the respondent selected ‘Yes, I have done it' for any of the six different purposes of burning plastic waste as fuel and otherwise is 0. In our dataset, 16% of respondents reported their own burning of plastic waste as fuel.

All models use the same set of independent variables. The independent variables include respondent demographics and respondent subjective perceptions of the cost of clean fuel and solid waste management. City-level independent variables include the waste generated per capita, plastic waste generation and percentage of population without waste collection services28. Country-level data includes basic access to sanitation services (% of urban population)52. These variables represent both supply- and demand-side factors that may influence the prevalence of plastic waste burning while controlling for respondent characteristics. For variables with missing data, we imputed a country median where applicable and controlled for missing data in the regression model. Standard errors in all regression models are clustered at the city level.

We note that the survey is not representative of the population in the study locations, and that all responses should be interpreted as being based on respondents' subjective views of the practice and implications of burning plastic waste as a fuel in their cities. Though these respondents are knowledgeable about the contexts they live in, they may nonetheless have a biased view of practices in their communities. The core objective of the study—understanding the prevalence of burning plastic waste as fuel at the Global South scale—should be kept in mind when interpreting the results presented in this research.

This collaborative study consists of local researchers from survey countries, multidisciplinary experts and early career researchers. All members of the research team – representing the various included study countries (see authorship list)—met during a series of collaborative planning meetings to discuss the survey objective and agree on the framework for the survey design and flow to ensure that the questions asked and answered were locally relevant. A core subset of those researchers contributed directly to drafting the survey questions, designing the survey guidelines, translating study materials, analysing the data, and writing the draft manuscript. All co-authors were given the opportunity to comment on the questionnaire, the survey guidelines, and the draft manuscript.

More specifically, the draft survey was circulated for comments and improvement and revised before formatting in Qualtrics. In response to collaborator feedback, the survey was translated into the French language, and a survey implementation guideline was prepared to facilitate the process. The survey question was then piloted, and we discussed the implementation plan several times to ensure it was easy and smooth for both researchers to disseminate and for respondents to answer.

Local researchers were responsible for local distribution of the survey and were given discretion in deciding whether to implement the survey or not, and where to focus the data collection in each of their countries to ensure the survey does not involve risk to health, safety, security or other risks to researchers and also the research is locally relevant. Contributors from different countries also helped distribute the survey link where relevant. In several countries, for example, Benin and Mongolia, the local researchers could not implement the survey due to a number of reasons, such as difficulty in translation of questions and time constraints.

We collected responses using an online format designed in Qualtrics. Each researcher was provided with an email template, flyer and QR code for respondents to use in accessing the survey. Risks to respondents were negligible. First, it focused on subjective perceptions of respondents regarding plastic pollution and the burning of plastic waste as household fuel, which are not particularly sensitive topics. Second, the survey did not involve animals or pose a bio-risk. Third, the survey did not ask for personal identifiers: name, phone number, email or postal address. Respondents were only asked to write their city name and select the name of their country. Thus, the survey was fully anonymised; we could not track who responded. Fourth, respondents were free to ignore the request to respond to the survey, could decline participation on the consent form, or could halt the survey at their will. Finally, the survey did not collect any biological materials, cultural artifacts or associated traditional knowledge.

We obtained overall ethics approval for the study from the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number HRE2024-0177), with all team contributors included as co-PIs. All local researchers were requested to consult their institutions and comply with local regulations before starting the survey. Where appropriate, an ethics application was filed by the in-country collaborators to ensure local compliance, but in many cases, the anonymous nature of the survey and the approval from Curtin University meant that additional approvals were not required. This was true for the researchers affiliated with partner institutions in Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, India, Lao PDR, Thailand, DR Congo, Eswatini, Rwanda, Botswana, Vietnam, Uganda, the Gambia and India. Other partner institutions do not have an ethics committee and instead defer to the judgment of ethics review teams at the PI institution (e.g., at Curtin University). In such cases, the local researcher obtained permission from their institution before implementing the survey without carrying out a full review by a formal ethics board. Local researchers, such as in Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana, applied for and received full ethics approval, whereas a researcher from Sri Lanka applied for ethics approval at their institution and received an exemption. Note that the surveys were undertaken at different times, as some of the collaborators had to go through the ethics approval process, while others did not.

After the collection of data, we analysed the results and presented them to the research team members. All contributors were included as contributors of the paper and have access to the dataset. Results are disaggregated at the regional level to ensure that they are not stigmatizing or pose a risk to the researchers or participants. The manuscript has used localized evidence and has taken local research relevance into account to build its arguments.

As people return to gyms or start new fitness routines in the new year, new research suggests that even a short burst of intense exercise could play a role in protecting against cancer. Scientists report that as little as 10 minutes of hard physical activity may help slow cancer growth.

The study found that brief, vigorous exercise quickly changes the mix of molecules circulating in the bloodstream. These rapid shifts appear to suppress bowel cancer cell growth while also speeding up the repair of damaged DNA.

How Exercise Changes the Bloodstream

Researchers at Newcastle University discovered that exercise raises the levels of several small molecules in the blood. Many of these molecules are known to reduce inflammation, support healthy blood vessels, and improve metabolism.

When scientists exposed bowel cancer cells in the lab to blood containing these exercise-driven molecules, they observed widespread genetic changes. More than 1,300 genes shifted their activity, including genes involved in DNA repair, energy production, and cancer cell growth.

Published in the International Journal of Cancer, the findings help clarify how physical activity may lower bowel cancer risk. The research shows that exercise sends molecular signals through the bloodstream that influence genes controlling tumor growth and genetic stability.

The results add to growing evidence that staying physically active is an important part of cancer prevention.

New Possibilities for Cancer Treatment

Dr. Sam Orange, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Exercise Physiology at Newcastle University and lead author of the study, said: "What's remarkable is that exercise doesn't just benefit healthy tissues, it sends powerful signals through the bloodstream that can directly influence thousands of genes in cancer cells.

"It's an exciting insight because it opens the door to find ways that mimic or augment the biological effects of exercise, potentially improving cancer treatment and, crucially, patient outcomes.

"In the future, these insights could lead to new therapies that imitate the beneficial effects of exercise on how cells repair damaged DNA and use fuel for energy."

Slowing Cancer Growth at the Cellular Level

The research team found that exercise increased the activity of genes that support mitochondrial energy metabolism. This helps cells use oxygen more efficiently.

At the same time, genes linked to rapid cell division were turned down, which may make cancer cells less aggressive. Blood collected after exercise also boosted DNA repair, activating a key repair gene known as PNKP.

The study included 30 volunteers, both men and women between the ages of 50 and 78. All participants were overweight or obese (a risk factor of cancer) but otherwise healthy.

Each volunteer completed a short but intense cycling test that lasted about 10 minutes. Researchers then collected blood samples and examined 249 proteins. Thirteen of those proteins increased after exercise, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which plays a role in repairing damaged DNA.

Why Even One Workout Matters

Dr. Orange, a Clinical Exercise Physiologist at The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: "These results suggest that exercise doesn't just benefit healthy tissues, it may also create a more hostile environment for cancer cells to grow.

"Even a single workout can make a difference. One bout of exercise, lasting just 10 minutes, sends powerful signals to the body.

"It's a reminder that every step, every session, counts when it comes to doing your best to protect your health."

Bowel Cancer Rates and Physical Activity

Bowel cancer is the 4th most common cancer in the UK, after breast, prostate and lung cancer.

In the UK, one person is diagnosed with bowel cancer every 12 minutes, adding up to nearly 44,000 cases each year. Someone dies from the disease every 30 minutes.

Researchers estimate that regular physical activity lowers bowel cancer risk by about 20%. Exercise does not have to mean gym workouts or sports. Walking or biking to work, along with everyday activities such as gardening or cleaning, can also contribute.

Looking ahead, the research team plans to examine whether repeated exercise sessions lead to long-lasting biological changes. They also aim to study how exercise-related effects interact with common cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

New satellite images of what was once the largest iceberg in the world show warning signs of its imminent demise, revealing extensive pools of aquamarine blue water melting on its surface.

NASA's Earth-observing Terra satellite captured an image of what remains of iceberg A-23A in Antarctica, which suggests it may have sprung a leak and is only days away from completely disintegrating.

The iceberg is breaking apart while drifting in the South Atlantic between the eastern tip of South America and South Georgia Island.

Iceberg A-23A has had a long and arduous journey. It first broke off from Antarctica's Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986. Afterwards, the iceberg remained lodged on the seafloor of the southern Weddell Sea for decades before breaking free in the early 2020s and drifting northward.

In March 2024, it was caught in a rotating ocean vortex in the Drake Passage before spinning out and becoming lodged again on the shallow coastal shelf south of South Georgia Island. The iceberg freed itself once more before coming to its final rest stop north of the island.

When it was first detached, the iceberg was around the size of Rhode Island, measuring roughly 1,500 square miles (4,000 square kilometers). Today, the iceberg is around 456 square miles in size (1,182 square kilometers), still larger than New York City.

Scientists have been tracking the iceberg's journey for years using satellite imagery, allowing them to document its disintegration over time. Today, scientists estimate that the iceberg won't be around for much longer, giving it days to weeks before its complete disintegration.

“I certainly don't expect A-23A to last through the austral summer,” Chris Shuman, a retired scientist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, said in a NASA statement. “A-23A faces the same fate as other Antarctic bergs, but its path has been remarkably long and eventful.”

Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite, scientists observed the remains of the waterlogged iceberg. The image shows pools of meltwater on its surface, turning the iceberg a haunting blue color.

An astronaut on board the International Space Station (ISS) has also captured a closer image of the iceberg, revealing streaks of blue and white that likely accumulated when the ice was part of a glacier dragging across Antarctic bedrock. “The striations formed parallel to the direction of flow, which ultimately created subtle ridges and valleys on the top of the iceberg that now direct the flow of meltwater,” Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow & Ice Data Center, said in the statement.

“It's impressive that these striations still show up after so much time has passed, massive amounts of snow have fallen, and a great deal of melting has occurred from below,” Shuman said.

The MODIS image also reveals that the iceberg may have sprung a leak. The weight of the water pooling at the top of the iceberg would have created enough pressure at the edges to push through, resulting in a white area on the left side of the image.

A-23A is currently on thin ice, floating in water that's around 37 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) and heading toward even warmer temperatures. “It's hard to believe it won't be with us much longer,” Shuman said.

Open-source database software support firm Percona is refocusing its business on structured, services-led engagements aimed at solving performance and AI-readiness challenges for enterprise database teams.

Last month, the company announced the launch of Percona Packages, a suite of structured consulting and support offerings for enterprise IT and DBA teams. The initial offerings — Quickstart, Performance Optimization, and AI Readiness — target critical database challenges with structured, time-bound engagements.

The new packages address the accelerating adoption of AI as enterprises face a critical talent bottleneck. McKinsey reports that 77% of companies lack the data engineering, architecture, and data management skills required to scale data transformations. Meanwhile, IDC estimates that the IT skills gap could cost organizations $5.5 trillion by 2026, driven by shortages in data management, cloud, and AI talent.

According to Percona, this talent crunch leaves teams overstretched, slowing database modernization and increasing the risk of costly downtime, inefficient operations, and stalled AI initiatives. The company's latest release helps database users eliminate performance roadblocks through optimization and future-proofs databases with AI readiness.

Percona's new Packages release returns the company to its roots of empowering organizations with database services, CEO Peter Farkas noted.

“Our goal is to be a one-stop shop for open-source database technology, providing support across MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Valkey/Redis, and beyond. These packages tackle the most urgent database challenges while delivering fast, measurable results, so our customers can focus on innovation, not infrastructure headaches,” he explained.

One of the primary benefits is the specific, measurable results customers see within the first 30 days, depending on the package and the business problem being addressed, according to Nick Herring, SVP of global services at Percona. Fast results apply to scalability, performance, AI readiness, and overall environmental stability.

“In all cases, these engagements are designed to deliver fast, actionable outcomes,” he told LinuxInsider.

Herring reported that a SaaS provider joined Percona last year due to long-standing performance issues stemming from instability. The company's staff worked on the problem independently and with other vendors for months without resolution, resulting in a significant impact on customers. Within 30 days, Percona identified a specific bug and solved a recurring issue that others had failed to resolve.

Performance Optimization does not lend itself to a single, universal percentage reduction in query latency. Instead, improvement depends on the customer's goals, workload characteristics, architecture, and how the application interacts with the database layer, according to Herring. It can address a wide range of performance issues, including slow queries, recurring outages, and failover instability.

“We have eliminated or significantly reduced these problems for customers across on-premises and cloud environments, spanning all major verticals,” he said.

One core challenge is insufficient tuning of the underlying database infrastructure before introducing AI workloads, which compounds the problem. A second hurdle is a lack of familiarity with AI database tooling that leads to configuration problems at the critical intersection of AI workloads and the data they depend on, he explained.

“Our AI Readiness package is designed to proactively address both challenges, helping customers move faster while avoiding costly rework and downstream performance issues,” Herring added.

However, the AI Readiness package is currently limited to PostgreSQL and the pgvector extension. He sees customers most often using PostgreSQL for AI workloads. Thus, Percona is meeting customers where they are.

“We don't have anything to share yet about our future roadmap to bring AI-ready packages to MySQL or MongoDB. We will continue to evaluate our customers' and potential customers' needs, as well as the success of the PostgreSQL AI offering, to inform future plans,” Herring said.

Well-known AI companies, gaming companies, financial institutions, and SaaS providers come to Percona to assess the health of their environment after experiencing difficulty scaling with their customer base and new application functionality. Such scaling trouble puts additional strain on their database environment.

“This is where Percona shines, and after these initial engagements, most ultimately become long-term customers of our various services,” he said.

Herring shared that some customers plan to handle their own cloud-to-on-premises migration, a MySQL 5.7-to-8.0 upgrade, or a new Valkey deployment. They look to Percona to reduce risk through expert guidance and validation.

“In these cases, Quickstart is a good fit. However, if customers want a turnkey solution for an upgrade, migration, or new deployment, all but the simplest scenarios demand a greater level of hands-on execution and customization,” he advised.

Except for the PostgreSQL AI Readiness package, the other Percona Packages apply to all technologies Percona supports: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, and Valkey/Redis.

These packages were specifically designed to solve common business challenges our customers face, regardless of technology.

Snowflake plans to acquire Observe, an observability platform that has been built on Snowflake's databases from day one. (Observability platforms help companies monitor their software systems and data for performance issues and bugs.)

The cloud data company announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Observe, subject to regulatory approval, on January 8. Snowflake will integrate Observe's product into its own to give customers a unified place to collect and store their telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces from software systems) and better spot potential bugs and issues in their data and software.

Observe was founded in 2017 by Jacob Leverich, Jonathan Trevor, and Ang Li and launched its first observability product built on a centralized Snowflake database in 2018. The company was incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures and has since raised nearly $500 million in venture capital from firms including Snowflake Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, and Madrona, among others.

Notably, both Snowflake and Observe were incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures, with Sutter Hill managing director Mike Speiser serving as Snowflake's founding CEO from 2012 to 2014.

Jeremy Burton, the current CEO of Observe, has served on Snowflake's board of directors since 2015.

Integrating Observe into Snowflake allows users to proactively monitor their data stack and spot and fix issues 10x faster than before, according to a Snowflake blog post — a task that has become harder to scale due to the sheer volume of data generated by AI agents.

The acquisition also creates a unified framework for telemetry data, which is automatically collected, built on Apache Iceberg and OpenTelemetry architectures.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. According to reports, the deal is valued at around $1 billion, which would make it Snowflake's largest acquisition to date, surpassing its $800 million purchase in March 2022 of Streamlit, an open source framework that allows developers and data scientists to quickly build and share data applications without needing expertise in front-end development.

Observe was most recently valued at $848 million as of July 2025, according to PitchBook data. TechCrunch has reached out to Snowflake for more information on the deal.

Last year saw a wave of consolidation in the data industry as data companies looked to build out their product offerings to make themselves more attractive one-stop-shop partners in the age of AI.

This deal could be a sign that data company consolidation will continue in 2026. Snowflake has been particularly active, completing and announcing several AI-related acquisitions in 2025, including Crunchy Data and Datavolo, and Select Star, a data governance and metadata management platform that helps organizations understand and trace their data at scale.

A Bellevue, Wash.-based startup is moving closer to commercialization of a handheld scanning device that it says could change one of the most dangerous and controversial procedures in policing: the physical pat-down for weapons.

Lassen Peak‘s radar-based imaging system allows officers to detect concealed guns, knives and other weapons from several feet away, without touching a person. The technology — similar to full-body scanners used in airport security checkpoints — is built around a custom-designed semiconductor chip that operates at extremely high radio frequencies, enabling detailed imaging through clothing.

Intended for use by law enforcement, military, and private venues, the device could help reduce use-of-force incidents during pat-downs — known as Terry frisks — while addressing long-standing concerns about privacy, bias and officer safety.

“We want to reduce the use of force. That's our goal,” Lassen Peak Chairman and CEO Hatch Graham told GeekWire. “And to help build trust between society and law enforcement. Hopefully this does that. That's our mission.”

Graham, a longtime inventor, engineer and entrepreneur, co-founded the company in 2019 alongside Chief Scientist Dr. Ehsan Afshari, a professor at the University of Michigan and an expert in ultra-high frequency microelectronics.

The company announced $10 million in debt and equity financings this week led by Menlo Park, Calif.-based Structural Capital. Lassen Peak, which was a finalist for Innovation of the Year at the 2025 GeekWire Awards, is also backed by Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group, among others, and has raised about $40 million to date.

At the heart of Lassen Peak's system is a proprietary imaging radar chip that operates in the so-called “terahertz gap,” at frequencies around 300 gigahertz — far higher than conventional radar used in autonomous vehicles or wireless communications.

At those frequencies, the wavelength of the signal shrinks to about a millimeter, allowing dozens of antennas to be integrated directly onto a standard chip.

The current chip integrates 24 receiver antennas and eight transmit antennas, enabling the system to capture multiple perspectives of an object simultaneously. The approach works similarly to human vision, using triangulation to infer shape and location.

“You close one eye and somebody hits you a baseball, it'll hit you in the forehead,” Graham said. “But by having two eyeballs, you can triangulate.”

Raw radar data is processed using a combination of digital signal processing and artificial intelligence software that reconstructs images and highlights suspicious objects, such as the outline of a handgun or a knife. The system is designed to show only abstract shapes and bounding boxes, rather than anatomical details.

The system also includes a cloud-based backend that stores scan data, images and metadata such as time and location. That data can be retained for evidentiary purposes, similar to body-camera footage.

The Terry stop and Terry frisk, named for a 1968 Supreme Court case, are brief detentions and pat-downs that allow officers to conduct an outer-clothing search for weapons when they have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.

The frisk has long been criticized as invasive and is widely regarded by officers as one of the most dangerous moments in an encounter.

It's when officers and those being detained can get hurt, according to Carl Rushmeyer, Lassen Peak's vice president of public safety and a former law enforcement officer.

Instead of putting hands on a detainee, an officer standing six or eight feet away can remotely scan and verify an individual using the Lassen Peak device.

“You're still going to do a secondary search before you get them in a patrol car,” Rushmeyer said. “But this is a very, very good initial search without having to contact or touch somebody.”

Graham said Lassen Peak has been endorsed by a number of law enforcement professionals as well as rights advocates. The scanner has generated interest from law enforcement agencies across the U.S. and internationally, especially in the U.K. and countries where knife violence is a rising concern.

The company has focused on large police departments with more than 1,000 sworn officers, narrowing its initial target market to about 160 agencies nationwide. Graham said Lassen Peak has met with 62 of them in the past year.

The company has about 15 employees and another 10 consultants and is not generating revenue yet, but expects to do so through a subscription model. Lassen Peak plans to conduct demonstrations and beta testing with police departments in early 2026, with initial shipments targeted for midyear.

While the first commercial product is a handheld scanner, Lassen Peak's long-term vision centers on the chip itself, which can be embedded into multiple platforms. These include drones that could assess a potentially dangerous situation from the air or ceiling-mounted dome cameras with “eyes” on a hospital, school, courthouse or other sensitive location.

“It has to be a product that goes out into the world and does not come back,” Graham said. “And that's as difficult in these life-and-death applications as anything. We're heading into 2026 and we believe we're in the final stages of commercializing.”

"Bose blows" is a popular comment amongst the audiophile community but, to me, it seems like they don't blow at all[0]. In fact quite the opposite: this is a fantastic example for other companies to follow. Top marks, Bose![0] What is actually true is that they are opinionated about sound reproduction in ways that a bunch of people don't agree with but which in the right context are often effective and enjoyable to listen to.

That comment is not wrong, you are imo just not making an important distinction that the criteria on which audiophiles judge Bose as “blowing” (which is almost purely the sound profile + a few other smaller things like physical comfort/connectivity/price/etc.) vs. what you judge it on (which is more in the long-term technical user/community product support, idk how to describe that area much better) are almost entirely disjoint.It is perfectly fine and valid for an audio product to “blow” from an opinionated audiophile perspective, while being exceptionally great from the long-term product/user/community product support perspective.I heavily agree with you btw, Bose should be heavily lauded for making a decision to open-up their speaker firmware after it reaches  the official end of support deadline. The fact that this is an exceptional practice is imo, a little bit sad, because I believe that it should be way more common.

The most amusing anti-example of this was the Switch generation: $60 for a cartridge, or $60 for a digital license. Guess which is actually more valuable?

If a speaker reproduces some music with 100% accuracy and the result is unpleasant, doesn't that just mean the original music—as created by the artist—is unpleasant?Where possible, I'd prefer a speaker that respects the artist's decisions instead of inserting itself into the creative process.

Hi-fi speakers, tube amps, and other accessories generally "degrade" the sound with added harmonics and natural smile EQs. That's what makes them sound more pleasing.(I'm not disagreeing with you, just adding more color.)

Maybe the general rule should be like, if something isn't in the users control and the user doesn't want it anymore or can no longer function despite not being damaged, then the company should take back the hardware and refund the user.So the company still have two options, either refund or open-source the systems needed for the device so that the user or third-party can continue supporting it.

The same can be said about a lot of games, and should be the case with them as well. Big MMOs for example. See the plethora of WoW private servers as an example of how it can be done.I think the stop killing games initiative in the EU was pushing for it but not sure how far they've gotten, but like with hardware, once a game studio no longer wants to run the servers for their game, they should be forced to turn it over to the community so the players can continue playing long after the studio is gone.

No, the law must mandate that. You either provide active support, or if you end it you must open-source all tools necessary to perform maintenance.

When my kid was born, I bought a brand-new Snoo. After six months, I wanted to sell it since we no longer needed it. That's when I discovered stories of people whose used Snoos had been bricked by the company. For such an expensive product, that is such a waste. If I'd known about this beforehand, I never would have made the purchase in the first place.

I have to try and get them working again. The only solution I've heard of is to get an old version of the Sonos app APK, a dedicated old single purpose Android phone to acts as a bridge between your speakers and phone and connect that way.Stay away from Sonos.

It sounds like there are two main pieces to me:1.  Removal of cloud dependency2.  Making usable the API (and providing documentation)With a minor 3rd piece:3.  The official app will be updated to support the "offline" mode without losing as many features as possible now that the cloud service is going away.All very laudable things IMHO.  I'm actually going to buy one of these

Sanitizing an existing documentation for public release might take notable time and effort if there are 100s of endpoints. But I would assume that is not the case with an API for a speaker.

reply

This is making them controllable.The headline may be inaccurate, but I'm not clear on what source code you'd even want. To the firmware do you mean?A documented API seems like the most useful option here.

Secondly, these devices are basically one step above embedded. It's highly unlikely you can load and run anything custom on them.Since they are opening up the API, you can keep using them for what they were made for, which is at least a solid basic liberty

Seeing that, I expected the ability to build and run a custom firmware, like with an Android device with its bootloader unlocked. But it is not that, and they didn't open source their app either.What they did is that they removed dependence on their servers, and opened their device to be controlled by third party apps. That is, they let users use their device past its end of life, including when the first party app will stop being maintained, but not to the point of letting user add features.In understand why they would do that, they don't want users to backport features only available on their latest models that are sold at a premium, therefore competing against themselves. After all, the value in smart speakers is not the sound producing device, which I think is a problem that has been solved more than a decade ago at the consumer level, it is all about software features.

One time I got a free Harman Kardon bluetooth speaker from Microsoft (the Invoke from 2017). They were $100* but went on sale for $50 and I snagged one.Then Microsoft discontinued Cortana for it, but they didn't kill the speaker. They released firmware that turned it into a perfectly good bluetooth speaker (which I still use today.) And they sent me a $50 gift card* to buy something else from Microsoft. Good will! I was a big fan of Microsoft hardware. Shame about the software...* Apparently $200 initially but they had some steep sales because Cortana as a voice assistant wasn't reviewing well. Reviews are a bit negative on the sound quality. Probably true enough at $200, but for $0-50, I think it's actually really good sound quality.* https://news.harman.com/releases/releases-20200730

I was the engineering lead on that product, and built a SW platform from scratch for it (Microsoft provided an SDK to Cortana which they developed in parallel.)The internal build could actually run Cortana, Alexa and Google Assistant simultaneously and you could e.g. set an alarm with one of them and query it with another, and they could interrupt each other based on priority. Obviously nobody wanted that feature, but it was hella cool that it worked. Oh, and you could make Skype calls from across the room, and the microphone array lived up to Skype's tough certification requirements which took weeks of testing in Microsoft's anechoic chamber for the DSP/algorithm team to fine tune.I tried to push for open-sourcing the platform but it was tricky because 1) the director of engineering in Harman didn't know what open source meant and for a hardware focused business to understand the value was a hard sell, 2) it used a HW module that came with a SW stack I mostly got rid off but a few parts were remaining that would need to be replaced which would require additional resources, 3) I was burned out at that point and had limited energy left to fight the good fight. Really too bad, it could have been a cool voice agent development platform, and I honestly think it would have sold in large volumes as a developer-friendly device.Glad you like it, sorry about the remaining Bluetooth bugs nobody got around to fix, since it basically flopped instantly.

With this, they just became the best value proposition on the used market. Flashing these with a minimal distro running snapclient (for multiroom audio) and shairport-sync (AirPlay 2) makes them infinitely better than they were on stock firmware. eBay prices are probably going to double by tomorrow morning.

[Editor's Note: Agents of Transformation is an independent GeekWire series and 2026 event, underwritten by Accenture, exploring the people, companies, and ideas behind the rise of AI agents.]

Microsoft is making its own bid to turn AI conversations into agentic commerce, announcing a new feature called Copilot Checkout that lets users complete purchases directly within its AI chatbot, without being redirected to an external website.

The company is betting that its existing enterprise technology footprint and established relationships with large retailers will give it an edge over OpenAI, Google, and Amazon in winning over merchants wary of giving up control to retail rivals or AI intermediaries.

“We've designed it in such a way that retailers own those relationships with the customers,” said Kathleen Mitford, corporate vice president of global industry marketing at Microsoft. “It is their data, it is their relationship, and that's something that's really important to us.”

It's part of a broader AI rollout by Microsoft at NRF 2026, the retail industry's annual conference in New York. Microsoft is also launching Brand Agents, pitched as a complete solution for Shopify merchants to add AI assistants to their websites, along with new AI tools to assist store employees and help retailers enhance their online product listings and metadata.

Copilot Checkout works by surfacing products from partner retailers within Copilot search results. Purchases can be completed without leaving the conversation. Microsoft says the retailer remains the merchant of record, handling fulfillment and customer service.

The bigger question for the tech industry is whether chat-based commerce is actually the next big thing. Forrester analyst Sucharita Kodali, for example, previously told GeekWire that “e-commerce isn't a problem that needs to be fixed.” She added that it's unclear what value chat-based commerce is bringing to retailers, “other than disintermediating Google.”

Microsoft's Mitford offered a different take in an interview this week, saying that consumer behavior is shifting faster than it may seem. She drew a parallel to how quickly businesses moved from experimenting with AI to putting it into operation over the past year.

“I see the same thing happening with consumers … it just takes a little bit of time,” Mitford said, predicting that the speed of consumer adoption will eventually match the rapid uptake seen in the business world. 

Copilot Checkout is rolling out now in the U.S. on Copilot.com, with PayPal, Shopify, and Stripe handling payment processing. Etsy sellers will be among the first available on the platform. Shopify merchants are set to be automatically enrolled following an opt-out window.

That last detail is notable given the backlash Amazon has faced over its “Buy for Me” feature, where brands complained about being included without consent and seeing inaccurate listings. 

Microsoft's approach is more tightly connected to its partners — the company said Shopify will management the opt-out process for its merchants — but automatic enrollment seems to raise the potential for some of the same concerns. (We've contacted Shopify for more information.)

More broadly, Microsoft is playing catch-up on the consumer side. 

OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT last September, partnering with Shopify and Stripe to let users buy from more than a million merchants. Google followed in November with its own “Buy for Me” feature which lets its Gemini assistant purchase products on a user's behalf.

Despite its inroads with businesses, Copilot has a fraction of ChatGPT's market share with consumers. Recent data from Similarweb's Global AI Tracker showed ChatGPT with about 68% of AI chatbot web traffic, with Google Gemini at 18% and Copilot in the single digits.

But Microsoft has its advantages: Unlike Amazon and Google, which compete directly with retailers through their own marketplaces, it isn't a retailer. And retail has long been a major vertical for its enterprise cloud and software business, with large chains running on Azure and Microsoft 365.

Mitford said Microsoft is leaning on its existing trust and long-standing relationships with retailers, along with a commitment to responsible AI, to help differentiate itself from rivals.

Microsoft is making the broader case for AI to retailers based on return on investment. A Microsoft-commissioned study from IDC, released in November, found that retail and consumer packaged goods companies are seeing a 2.7x return on every dollar spent on generative AI. 

Mitford, a former fashion designer who has been in the technology industry for most of her career, said she sees the retail sector among the leaders in AI uptake across the business world. 

The technology, she said, is being “adopted at a pace that I've never seen.”

Old becomes gold in Akihabara Electric Town.

A major Japanese PC and electronics store is pleading with customers to sell their old PC gear. “As a favor, if you buy a new one, please sell your gaming PC to our company,” begged the X-account of Sofmap Gaming in Akihabara, the Electric Town district of Tokyo (machine translation, h/t PC-Watch). The store shared a photo of some almost barren shelves, presumably taken at its triple-floor retail establishment.

ゲーミングPC、中古も本当に在庫なくて今これあの、お願いなので買い替えたらぜひ弊社にゲーミングPCを売ってください...結構高く買い取っていますので...ゲーミングのデスクでもノートでも、もちろんゲーミングじゃない普通のでもPCなら大体買い取っているので... pic.twitter.com/IinBuGgRV7January 7, 2026

“Gaming PCs, even used ones, are really out of stock right now,” wrote Sofmap, as an explanation for its call for old rigs. In the above Tweet, it asks customers to come in and sell their old PCs, highlighting that “We buy them back at pretty high prices...”

Moreover, the company underlined that it wasn't going to be fussy. “Whether it's a gaming desktop or a laptop, or even a regular non-gaming one, we pretty much buy any PC...”

These are clearly the words of a PC retailer facing consumer demand that it just can't meet. We reported on Akihabara store trying to limit new RAM, SSD, and HDD sales back in November.

The memory supply crunch impacted the PC industry faster and more deeply than many would have predicted. The insatiable demand for memory from AI data center makers, with their deep circular-funded pockets, caused the first pricing jolts in the PC memory market. That's reasonable, as consumers and industry both need to be fed product from the same big-three memory makers.

Consumers saw the first impacts on modern DDR5 pricing. Some DDR5 kits, if you can find them in stock, like this Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-5200 16GB (2x8GB) on Amazon is now $235. That price is more than 3.5X what it cost last October ($66).

However, there remains some hope that DDR4 pricing and availability, thanks to old stocks and upgraders already having DIMMs, could provide a safe haven for continued PC building. This perception even seems to permeate PC component makers, with more DDR4-supporting motherboards being manufactured, plus hints about new processors for DDR4 platforms.

However, we are continuing to feel RAM crunch aftershocks. Prices of pre-built PCs were the next market affected. Graphics cards with more generous VRAM quotas are also strongly rumored to be facing constraints. We should at least expect a price rise for GPU-restocks, with next-gen GPUs rumored to be delayed…

Now, underlined by this Japan retail report, it even seems like stocks of old used PCs are being snapped up by consumers.

 




Of course, some old PCs are too old for retailers like Sofmap, even during today's PC drought. We'd expect retailers that dabble in used PCs for non-enthusiast users to limit their purchases to DDR4 platforms, with hardware support that slots above the Windows 11 minimum requirements (Intel 8th Gen, AMD Ryzen 2000).

There's an entirely different market for really old PCs, though. Vintage computers of certain eras have been increasingly pricey for quite a long time now. I was in Japan this time last year and astonished by the bountiful supplies of old PCs at used electronics retailers like Hard-Off. Hopefully, these computing gems (see the above picture), many of which live in the awkward zone between vintage and modern, will remain plentiful and affordable for PC retro-fans and tinkerers alike.

The BlackBerry is back, sort of. Mobile keyboard maker Clicks Technology last week announced its debut phone, the $499 Communicator, which sports a physical keyboard. The company is also offering a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that fits on any device.

At CES, TechCrunch chatted with Clicks' chief marketing officer and co-founder, Jeff Gadway, and went hands-on with the latest prototype of the upcoming smartphone.

The device offers a BlackBerry-like keyboard and messaging-focused touchscreen, and runs Android 16 under the hood, which means the Communicator can run any Android app. The company has partnered with the minimalist launcher, Niagara Launcher, to display apps on the homescreen. Other apps are within easy reach via a scrollable list.

Reception for the new devices has been better than expected, Gadway told TechCrunch. Although he declined to share sales numbers, he said that over the past week, the company was making a sale every 6.5 seconds between both devices.

While the prototype we tried was not a fully functional phone, it's the same size and weight as the device that's preparing to ship later this year, giving an initial feel for what it would be like to use the Communicator. Onboard storage lands at 256 gigabytes, with expandable microSD storage of up to 2 terabytes of data. The device will also sport a 4000mAh silicon-carbon battery and is currently weighing in around 170 grams (or 6 oz). Underneath the back is where your nano-SIM card will go. 

The phone also comes with interchangeable back covers that you can pop off to change its look. While not present on the prototype, the cover will have a small notch at the top and then a little finger pick at the bottom.

In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device's final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.

The device's screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.

That's where the device's light-up side button can help. Called the “Signal Light,” the button can be configured to glow with different colors or patterns when you receive messages from certain people, groups, or apps. So you can be sure to respond if it's your boss or the kids contacting you and ignore less important notifications.

The tactile, physical keys feel good, though the prototype's version may actually be a little less “clicky” than the final product. (There's a debate on whether the keys should have 110 grams of pressure or 120 or 130 grams, and feedback so far is that the latter figures are winning.)

With less pressure, the keys feel softer, which could be more accessible for those who haven't used a BlackBerry before. But people who type fast tend to prefer more clicky keys because there's more feedback.

“This is the stuff that Michael Fisher and myself and Kevin Michaluk fight over all the time,” said Gadway, referring to his co-founders. “We're fighting over grams.” 

The keys and the screen are also at the same vertical height, so you can seamlessly move from the keyboard to the touchscreen. 

The Clicks Communicator comes with a fixed-focus, hole-punch front camera that can capture 24-megapixel photos. The rear camera features optical image stabilization and electronic image stabilization for video, and can capture 50-megapixel images.

The phone runs on a 4-nanometer, MediaTek 5G IoT processor, with 8 gigabytes of RAM.

The Communicator will have a 4.03-inch AMOLED display at 1,080 x 1,200 resolution. Wired charging is supported at up to 18 watts, and wireless charging at up to 15 watts. The device is also Qi compatible and Android Strongbox-ready, which will appeal to security-minded customers.

The phone has other standard features too, like GPS and NFC, and will offer five years of security updates as well as Android updates through Android 20.

The device is expected to ship in the second half of 2026.

A medical issue affecting a Crew-11 astronaut aboard the International Space Station (ISS) has forced the agency to postpone Thursday's spacewalk indefinitely and consider bringing the crew home early.

In a statement issued Wednesday, NASA said the agency is monitoring a health concern affecting a member of Crew-11 that arose Wednesday afternoon aboard the orbital laboratory. An emailed update to Space.com received early Thursday morning stated that NASA is “actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11's mission.” The agency has not disclosed what the health issue is nor which crew member is affected out of respect for their medical privacy.

“These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely,” the statement to Space.com reportedly reads. “We will provide further updates within the next 24 hours.”

Crew-11, which consists of space station commander Mike Fincke (58), flight engineer Zena Cardman (38), Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui (55), and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov (39), launched to the ISS aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on August 1. The four astronauts are in the final weeks of their mission, scheduled to return to Earth in mid-February. As of now, that's still the official plan.

NASA has never returned an astronaut from the ISS early due to a medical issue, but the agency is always prepared for the unlikely event it needs to do so. In this case, bringing Crew-11 home early would be relatively straightforward, as their Crew Dragon spacecraft is still docked to the ISS.

All four of the crew members would board the Dragon capsule and likely head for reentry and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, as they would have in February. A SpaceX recovery vessel based in Southern California would then retrieve the spacecraft and crew.

Crew-11's early departure would not leave the ISS uncrewed. NASA astronaut Chris Williams and two Russian cosmonauts—Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergey Mikayev—who launched to the space station in November aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft would remain on the space station.

It is unusual for NASA to postpone a spacewalk due to a medical issue, but they have previously been pushed back due to minor concerns, such as a pinched nerve or spacesuit discomfort.

NASA's Fincke and Cardman were supposed to emerge from the space station's Quest airlock at approximately 8 a.m. ET on Thursday. It would have been Cadman's first spacewalk and Fincke's 10th, tying him with Peggy Whitson for the most spacewalks by a NASA astronaut.

Their primary task was to prepare the 2A power channel for future installation of a roll-out solar array. This array will provide additional power to support the last few years of operation and, ultimately, the lab's deorbit. Cardman and Fincke would have also installed jumper cables, photographed station hardware, and swabbed the exterior of the ISS to collect potential microorganism samples, according to NASA.

Another spacewalk is scheduled for 7:20 a.m. ET on Thursday, January 15, sending another pair of NASA astronauts outside the space station to replace a high-definition camera, install a new docking aid for visiting spacecraft, and relocate several cooling hoses. The names of the participating astronauts were supposed to be announced after the January 8 spacewalk. It's currently unclear whether this medical issue will force NASA to postpone the January 15 EVA.

Spangle, an AI e-commerce startup founded by former Bolt CEO Maju Kuruvilla, has raised $15 million in a new funding round, valuing the company at $100 million after the investment.

Led by NewRoad Capital Partners, the all-equity Series A round comes over a year after the Seattle-based startup raised a $6 million seed round at a $30 million pre-money valuation. Madrona, DNX Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and strategic angel investors also participated, bringing total funding to $21 million, according to the startup.

Retailers are facing changes in how consumers discover products online, as AI tools, social platforms, and recommendation engines increasingly influence buying decisions before shoppers reach a brand's website. Kuruvilla (pictured above) aims to address this with Spangle — positioning it as software that helps retailers personalize shopping experiences based on that context as shoppers move through their sites, using real-time, AI-generated product recommendations and layouts.

Since emerging from stealth in March of last year, Spangle has signed nine enterprise customers, including fashion retailers Revolve, Alexander Wang, and Steve Madden, whose combined online sales total about $3.8 billion, Kuruvilla said in an interview.

Traffic flowing through Spangle's platform has grown about 57% month-on-month, with all customers expanding their use of the software, and the startup said it quadrupled its annualized revenue in the fourth quarter, though it did not disclose revenue figures.

At the core of Spangle's approach is a simple idea: Instead of sending shoppers to pre-built product or category pages, brands route traffic to what is essentially a blank page. Spangle's AI fills that page in real time using a proprietary model called ProductGPT, drawing on signals such as where the shopper came from, what they searched for or clicked on, and how similar visitors have behaved, to surface products, recommendations, and content tailored to that moment.

Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that brands using Spangle are seeing close to a 50% increase in revenue per visit, a doubling of return on ad spend, and a 15% increase in average order value.

“We are future-proofing the brand,” Kuruvilla said, adding that Spangle trains its AI model on each retailer's catalog and performance data, allowing shopping experiences to adapt automatically.

Spangle's software has helped Revolve adapt shopping experiences in real time, driving about a 60% improvement in return on ad spend and a 50% increase in revenue per visit, said Ryan Pabelona, the retailer's vice president of performance marketing.

Before starting Spangle in 2024, Kuruvilla served as CEO of the one-click checkout company Bolt and earlier spent more than a decade at Amazon, where he worked on large-scale commerce and AI systems. He founded the startup alongside CTO Fei Wang, a former Amazon principal engineer who worked on Alexa and customer service technologies and later served as CTO at Saks Off 5th.

Kuruvilla said their experience running commerce and payments platforms shaped Spangle's focus on building infrastructure rather than incremental fixes. Some, he added, view the startup as a kind of Shopify for AI-powered commerce.

Spangle's approach also aligns with a shift toward shopping mediated by AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and several browser-based agents. As consumers increasingly rely on chatbots and automated agents to search for and compare products, Kuruvilla said brands will need software that can respond dynamically to both human shoppers and machines, rather than serving the same static pages to every visitor.

Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that Spangle became viable only in the past two years as three major shifts converged: consumers growing comfortable discovering products through AI tools, a rapid proliferation of discovery channels beyond Google and Meta, and advances in AI technology that have sharply lowered the cost and latency of generating real-time experiences. Together, he said, those changes made it possible to replace incremental fixes with an AI-native commerce system that can adapt instantly as shopping behavior evolves.

Currently, Spangle has six full-time employees, underscoring how AI tools are allowing startups to scale enterprise software with relatively small teams.

With the fresh funding, Kuruvilla said Spangle plans to invest further in research and development, expand its engineering team, and build out its sales organization.

Google has unveiled a new AI Inbox for Gmail that's designed to provide a personalized overview of your tasks and keep you informed about important updates. Gmail is also launching AI Overviews in search and a Grammarly-like “Proofread” feature. Additionally, Gmail is bringing to all users several AI features that were previously available only to paid users.

The new AI Inbox tab features two sections: “Suggested to-dos” and “Topics to catch up on.” The first section displays summaries of top priority emails that require an action, such as a reminder that you have a bill due tomorrow or that you need to call your dermatologist to confirm your mailing address so they can ship your prescription refill.

Under the “Topics to catch up on” section, you'll see updates such as “Your Lululemon return is being processed, and your order of Metal Vent Tech shirts has been delivered” and “Your end-of-year statement is now available from Wealthfront.” These different updates are grouped into different categories, such as “Finances” and “Purchases.”

“This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back, showing you what you need to do and when you need to do it,” said Blake Barnes, VP, Product at Google, in a briefing with reporters. “Don't worry, the traditional inbox will remain available. This is simply a new view you can toggle in and out of as you please to cut through the noise of your incoming mail.”

Google is rolling out the AI Inbox feature to trusted testers before making it more broadly available in the coming months. 

With the new AI Overviews in Gmail search, users can now search their inbox using natural language questions to get a quick answer instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information.

For example, you can ask “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” You will then get an AI Overview that pulls answers from your emails and highlights the key details you need.

“We scour every email in your inbox, and we give you the answer to your questions right at the top,” Blake said. “So just like AI Overviews in Google Search, you can ask natural language questions to get an AI-powered response. However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.”

This new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. 

Google says all of Gmail's AI features are optional, that it doesn't use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment.

As for the new Proofread feature, Google says it's designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure. It offers one-click suggestions for word choice, conciseness, active voice, and splitting complex sentences. 

For instance, if you write something like “might inflict disturbance,” Gmail will suggest changing it to “might disturb.” It'll also flag instances where you use the wrong word, like “weather” instead of “whether.” It's essentially similar to popular proofreading services like Grammarly.

By rolling out its own proofreading tool, Google likely hopes people will stop turning to third-party tools or plugging their emails into ChatGPT to fix them.

Proofread is rolling out to subscribers of its paid subscription tiers Google AI Pro and Ultra.

While these new features are only launching to select users, Google announced that Gmail's “Help Me Write,” AI Overviews for threaded emails, and “Suggested Replies” are rolling out to all users. These features were previously only available to paying subscribers.

Help Me Write can help you compose an email from a single prompt, while AI Overviews for threaded emails provide summaries of longer email threads with multiple replies. Suggested Replies use the context of conversations to offer relevant responses that match your tone and style.

We've got a plethora of new SSDs and RAM modules on the scene, with storage solutions for mobile devices on display, too.

Patriot just dropped a plethora of new memory modules and SSDs, as well as several storage solutions for mobile devices and gaming handhelds. Despite the ongoing DRAM and storage pricing squeeze, the Tom's Hardware team checked out Patriot's booth at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Nevada, to check out 15 new DDR5 RAM kits, as well as a DDR5 SODIMM with a maximum capacity of 48GB (1x48GB).

Out of all the displayed modules, the company's Viper Xtreme 5 Aurum stood out with its delightfully opulent, flashy exterior. The company said that it designed the color specifically to blend well with both light and dark builds, ensuring that it wouldn't stand out as either too bright or too dark. But, you might need to wear a pair of gloves to not litter it with pesky fingerprints. Patriot also showed off a prototype with the same eye-catching heat-spreader, running in a 2x24GB configuration, at speeds of up to 10,000 MT/s.

There are also four Viper-branded SSDs — the Viper VP4300 Lite PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD available in 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities, and the Viper PV563 PCIe 5.0 x4 SSD, which you can get in either 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB capacities. Additionally, the PV563 can be had with either a graphene strip or a full heatsink. Lastly, there's the top-of-the-line Viper PV593, offering up 14,000 and 13,000 MB/s sequential read and write speeds, plus a random read speed of up to 2,000K IOPS, Patriot claims. We have no word on how much the memory or storage might cost you; however, as pricing for both DRAM and NAND storage remain extremely volatile. An IDC report suggests that PC prices may jump as much as 8% as a result.

Aside from these PC components, it also released a wide range of USB flash drives and enclosures for those that need portable memory on the go. The company also introduced a Storage Hub designed for mobile devices. This plugs in to your gear via a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 connector, giving you one HDMI port capable of 4K@60Hz and a USB-C PD 3.0 port that accepts up to 100 watts of power. More importantly, it will give you extra storage options in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB capacities, allowing you to turn your phone or tablet into a proper productivity tool.

Nintendo Switch 2 owners are also getting another microSD Express option with the Patriot EP Express. This PCIe 3.0 x1 expansion card delivers sequential read and write speeds of up to 800 MB/s and 600 MB/s, allowing you to quickly load games directly from it. Aside from that, it also supports 4K and high-bitrate video recording, allowing you to use it with video recording and photography equipment as well, available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB capacities. The company also showed off a DDR5-10000 engineering sample with a 48GB (2x24GB) capacity. While this is still being tested, it gives us a glimpse of what Patriot has in store for us in the future. But you might want to start saving up now if you have your eye on any of the new products.

Alphabet's market capitalization was $3.88 trillion at the close of trading on Wednesday—just a tiny bit higher than Apple's $3.84 trillion. According to CNBC, it was the first time this happened since 2019.These companies were not in a steel cage with one another. Wall Street trading is not like dropping coins in a pair of coffee shop tip jars labeled “Chappell Roan” and “Taylor Swift.” Nonetheless, the timing makes it hard not to ignore the symbolic power of this milestone. After all, Apple is in the middle of a predictable stretch—on the verge of, well, releasing a lot of iPhones, including, reportedly, a long-awaited foldable iPhone that, if the newly leaked information is accurate, meets or slightly exceeds years of hype. Looking for surprises from Apple? 2026 may not be your year. But may I interest you in Apple's updated smart home hub called a HomePad, or perhaps the AirTag 2?Meanwhile, what has Alphabet been up to lately? For what it's worth, unexpectedly body slamming OpenAI in the frontier AI model race. And on the transportation side, Alphabet earned a whole lot of press by filling San Francisco with disabled Waymo robotaxis. Hey, no publicity is bad publicity. I don't mean to create a dichotomy where Apple sounds wholesome and Alphabet/Google sounds scary—tech companies this size are all scary from a certain perspective. But this is a business environment where Apple, the company famous for making familiar physical objects that people exchange money for (often too much money) feels like more of an underdog than Google, the company famous—currently—for investing in speculative and risky new tech that the public, broadly speaking, isn't stoked about.

It's no surprise to see investors favoring the latter over the former, but it's also not comforting.

Seattle startup Avalanche Energy is raising new funding to develop its compact fusion energy devices. A new SEC filing reveals a fresh $14.9 million round. 

A company spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by GeekWire.

Avalanche and dozens of companies around the world are vying for scientific breakthroughs that would allow them to generate electricity from fusion reactions on a commercially viable scale. The sun and stars are the masters of fusion, smashing together light atoms under high-pressure, super hot conditions to produce energy.

Avalanche is pursuing a different strategy than many of its competitors, building desktop-sized energy devices and working multiple angles for revenue generation. That includes:

Avalanche had previously raised $50 million from investors that include Chris Sacca's Lowercarbon Capital, Founders Fund, Toyota Ventures, Azolla Ventures and others.

The fusion industry produced surprising headlines shortly before Christmas with the announcement of a $6 billion planned merger between Trump Media & Technology Group and California fusion company TAE Technologies. 

The partnership aims to site and begin building what it calls the world's first utility-scale fusion plant this year, with Trump Media committing $300 million in near-term funding. President Trump is the largest shareholder of Trump Media, the publicly-traded parent company of the social media platform Truth Social.

Avalanche is part of a fusion hub in the Pacific Northwest that includes two additional Seattle-area companies working to harness fusion power.

GeekWire Studios has partnered with AWS for the Guide to re:Invent. This interview series took place on the Expo floor at AWS re:Invent 2025, and features insightful conversations about the future of cloud tech, as well as partnership success stories.

Depending on how “hardcore” you want to be, an entire apparatus for a full-fledged gaming racing wheel and pedals is a must for any racing aficionado. Nothing will come close to a simulationist setup, but GameSir may have the answer to make racing with a controller feel far more tactile and, dare I say it, more enjoyable.

The GameSir Swift Drive, announced during CES 2026, is a surprisingly complete controller by itself. You've likely already noticed the giant steering wheel stuck into the center of the controller. When I first wrapped my hands around it, I expected to thumb a loose-feeling circle laid awkwardly in the middle of the device. In reality, the wheel hums with force feedback you usually get with high-end racing wheels. When a car rolls over gravel or rocky terrain, you'll feel the push and pull of the wheel under your thumbs. That's due to the miniaturized drive motor and an additional three haptic motors to offer a visceral feel. No, you won't be tricked into imagining you're driving a real Ferrari at 200 mph. It's simply a more enjoyable way to take your digital car out for a drive.

I spoke with GameSir's CEO and the controller's lead designer, Betta Core. He told me his initial concept for the device came from his youth as a racing game player. He said he wished he could have a full-feedback racing device without the massive haul of simulationist controls you need to get there.

For the sake of that feel, the controller has to make a few sacrifices. Chief amongst those is the right thumbstick. Instead of the usual flat lily pad for your thumb, there's a right nub you'll use for checking your six o'clock when in a car's cockpit. The stick and nub are both Hall effect to reduce the chance of stick drift, but you won't use this controller for anything but racing.

The controller won't be available until the second half of this year. The initial iteration of the design still needs a few tweaks and finishing touches. Core told me he and his team had only finished the prototype shortly before coming to CES. As for price, the designer told me GameSir was targeting a price of somewhere north of $200.

Even if you're not a racing fan, I can imagine this controller would make dodging cops in Grand Theft Auto VI feel extra visceral. We'll know how well both the controller and game perform when they (hopefully) launch later this year.

A dose of the gym might do wonders for both an ailing body and mind. A report out today finds that exercise can provide similar benefits for depression as other widely used treatments.

Scientists in the UK reviewed the medical literature on exercise and depression, examining dozens of clinical trials. They found convincing evidence that exercise can reduce depression symptoms, at least in the short term, as well as evidence that its effects match that of therapy or antidepressants. Though more research is needed to fully quantify these benefits, exercise should be considered part of the toolbox used to help treat depression, the researchers say.

“Exercise provides an option for people experiencing depressive symptoms, along with pharmacological treatments or psychological therapies,” lead study author Andrew Clegg, a professor at the University of Lancashire, told Gizmodo.

Clegg and his team's study was conducted on behalf of the Cochrane Library, a British-based research organization known for its comprehensive reviews of clinical trial data related to important public health topics.

They examined 73 randomized trials that collectively involved almost 5,000 adults with depression. Fifty-seven trials directly compared exercise to either no treatment or a control; ten trials compared exercise to therapy, and five compared exercise to antidepressants.

All in all, Clegg's team determined that exercise is reliably better at reducing depression compared to no treatment, though this reduction is likely modest on average. That said, the long-term benefits of exercise for depression are less clear.

This Is How Long Your Walks Should Be to Keep You Healthiest, Study Finds

They also concluded there is “probably little to no difference in depressive symptoms” among people who regularly exercise compared to people taking therapy. The same seems to be true when comparing exercise to antidepressants, but the evidence there is less certain.

The team's findings also suggest that light or moderate intensity exercise might be more effective for depression than vigorous exercise. And though no single form of exercise seemed to be substantially better than others, a mixed exercise program or resistance training might be better than aerobic exercise alone, according to the researchers.

The Cochrane review is the latest research to indicate that exercise can reduce depression symptoms at least as well as other conventional treatments. But the authors say there are still important aspects that could be understood better with larger, higher-quality randomized trials.

Outdoor Exercise Might Be Better Than Hitting the Gym—at Least for Your Brain

“If additional research were to be funded, it should consider which type of exercise is most effective in the long-term, how much exercise should be undertaken and for how long. Also, to look at who benefits from exercise, as it may benefit some people but not others,” explained Clegg.

Exercise is undoubtedly one of the best things you can do for your overall health, however, and it's likely to come with few side effects (the review noted that reported “adverse events” from exercise were uncommon). Some research has also suggested that combining exercise with other interventions like therapy can be even more effective than either alone.

People dealing with depression should ultimately be encouraged to pursue the treatments they're most comfortable with, Clegg says. But that list of options can certainly seem to include exercise.

Tom's Hardware sat down with AMD's SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Nevada, to get AMD's response surrounding Intel's new speedy Panther Lake mobile CPUs. Tikoo revealed that AMD is not afraid of Intel's new chips, claiming its lineup of high-performance Ryzen AI Max (Strix Halo) APUs and mainstream Ryzen AI series chips fulfill the market's needs more effectively.Tikoo said that Intel's Panther Lake competition isn't anything for AMD to worry about. "Strix Halo, or Ryzen AI Max will kill it. [...] It's not even a fair fight at that point, because it's discrete-level graphics." the exec remarked. He said that AMD is in the most optimal position possible in the market, and that the company is meeting market demands better by providing two distinctly different lines of chips that provide very specific performance requirements for the demands of power users/prosumers and mainstream consumers. "...And then, our strategy, okay, Strix Halo [and] Ryzen AI Max competes against that (Panther Lake 12 Xe), and it's better than that in terms of graphics performance, all of that. And then, for the mainstream of the market, that don't value that much graphics [power], because honestly, most of the people that are using Notebooks, that are outside of the creator or gaming spaces are, you know, they don't need that graphics performance."Tikoo clarified that he believes shoppers will make decisions based on their needs, rather than looking for a chip that can do a little bit of everything. "...So, like, people make choices, right? When they go into this space, they're like, Okay, here's the applications I'm using... or here's the gaming I'm doing."The AMD lead also didn't miss the chance to jab Intel a bit, noting how Intel did not add any Strix Halo APU models into its benchmark comparisons — limiting its benchmarking runs strictly to its lower-end Ryzen AI series chip and its own previous-generation chips."There's a reason why they didn't compare it right there. [...] they compared their highest-end to our midpoint." He also subtly exposed that Intel's pricing for Panther Lake won't be pretty: "And, oh, by the way, that 12 Xe [Panther Lake]... Wait until you see the price point on that. It's gonna be, you know. Enough said." Panther Lake is Intel's latest and most powerful mobile CPU platform to date, built on its new 18A process node, with high-performance Cougar Cove P-cores, Darkmount E-cores, and Intel's highly potent Xe3 integrated graphics engine. The flagship Core Ultra X9 388H comes with 16 cores in total (four P-cores, eight E-cores, and four LP-cores), 18MB of L3 cache, Arc B390 iGPU with 12 Xe cores, and support for up to 96GB of LPDDR5x-9600 memory.Intel's slides claim that the X9 388H packs 10% more performance for the same power as the previous-gen Arrow Lake-H Ultra 9 285H, and 60% more performance in the same metric as Intel's Lunar Lake Ultra 9 288V. Intel claims the Arc B390-equipped X9 388H is 77% faster on average than the Ultra 9 288V in gaming tests. Intel's new Xe3 iGPU flagship is so fast, in fact, that Intel claims the X9 388H gets roughly similar performance to an Nvidia RTX 4050 laptop GPU in most games at a 60W sustained power envelope, with the X9 388H operating at just 45W sustained.If you want a better perspective, Intel's Xe3 B390 iGPU was able to pull off 80 FPS in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p high settings with XeSS set to Balanced mode in our hands-on testing.

Astronomers say they've found an asteroid that spins faster than other space rocks of its size.

The asteroid, known as 2025 MN45, is nearly half a mile (710 meters) in diameter and makes a full rotation every 1.88 minutes, based on an analysis of data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. “This is now the fastest-spinning asteroid that we know of, larger than 500 meters,” University of Washington astronomer Sarah Greenstreet said today at the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting in Phoenix.

Greenstreet, who serves as an assistant astronomer at the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab and heads the Rubin Observatory's working group for near-Earth objects and interstellar objects, is the lead author of a paper in The Astrophysical Journal Letters that describes the discovery and its implications. It's the first peer-reviewed paper based on data from Rubin's LSST Camera in Chile.

2025 MN45 is one of more than 2,100 solar system objects that were detected during the observatory's commissioning phase. Over time, the LSST Camera tracked variations in the light reflected by those objects. Greenstreet and her colleagues analyzed those variations to determine the size, distance, composition and rate of rotation for 76 asteroids, all but one of which are in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. (The other asteroid is a near-Earth object.)

The team found 16 “super-fast rotators” spinning at rates ranging between 13 minutes and 2.2 hours per revolution — plus three “ultra-fast rotators,” including 2025 MN45, that make a full revolution in less than five minutes.

Greenstreet said 2025 MN45 appears to consist of solid rock, as opposed to the “rubble pile” material that most asteroids are thought to be made of.

“We also believe that it's likely a collisionary fragment of a much larger parent body that, early in the solar system's history, was heated enough that the material internal to it melted and differentiated,” Greenstreet said. She and her colleagues suggest that the primordial collision blasted 2025 MN45 from the dense core of the parent body and sent it whirling into space.

Astronomers have previously detected fast-spinning asteroids that measure less than 500 meters wide, but this is the first time larger objects have been found with rotational rates that are faster than five minutes per revolution. The Rubin team's other two ultra-fast rotators have rates of 1.9 minutes and 3.8 minutes.

What would it be like to take a spin on 2025 MN45? Imagine riding on a Ferris wheel — say, the Seattle Great Wheel, which typically makes three revolutions in 10 to 12 minutes. Now make the wheel more than 10 times taller, and make the rotation rate at least twice as fast. It'd feel as if you were going more than 40 mph.

“If you were standing on it, it would probably be quite the ride to be going around on the outside edge of this thing that's the size of eight football fields,” Greenstreet said.

But the significance of the study goes beyond imagining an extraterrestrial amusement ride.

“This is only the beginning of science for the Rubin Observatory,” Greenstreet said. “We are already seeing that we can study smaller asteroids at farther distances than we've ever been able to study before. And being able to study these fast rotators further, we're going to learn a lot of really crucial information about the internal strength, composition and collisional histories of these primitive solar system bodies that date back to the formation of the solar system.”

The study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, “Lightcurves, Rotation Periods, and Colors for Vera C. Rubin Observatory's First Asteroid Discoveries,” lists 71 co-authors. Authors from the University of Washington include Greenstreet as well as Zhuofu (Chester) Li, Dmitrii E. Vavilov, Devanshi Singh, Mario Jurić, Željko Ivezić, Joachim Moeyens, Eric C. Bellm, Jacob A. Kurlander, Maria T. Patterson, Nima Sedaghat, Krzysztof Suberlak and Ian S. Sullivan.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. The University of Washington was one of the founding members of the consortium behind the project, which benefited from early contributions by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and software executive Charles Simonyi. The observatory's Simonyi Survey Telescope was named in honor of Simonyi's family.

This year's flu season is turning out to be brutal. As a new variant known as subclade K spreads rapidly, a study out today offers clues as to how to avoid the annual sickness. 

Researchers from University of Maryland Schools of Public Health and Engineering in College Park and the School of Medicine in Baltimore wanted to find out how the flu spreads, so they put college students already sick with the flu into a hotel room with healthy middle-aged adult volunteers. The result? No one caught the flu. 

"At this time of year, it seems like everyone is catching the flu virus. And yet our study showed no transmission – what does this say about how flu spreads and how to stop outbreaks?" said Dr. Donald Milton, professor at SPH's Department of Global, Environmental and Occupational Health and a global infectious disease aerobiology expert who was among the first to identify how to stop the spread of COVID-19.

The study, out today in PLOS Pathogens, is the first clinical trial in a controlled environment to investigate exactly how the flu spreads through the air between naturally infected people (rather than people deliberately infected in a lab) and uninfected people. Milton and his colleague Dr. Jianyu Lai have some ideas about why none of the healthy volunteers contracted the flu. 

"Our data suggests key things that increase the likelihood of flu transmission – coughing is a major one," said Dr. Jianyu Lai, post-doctoral research scientist, who led data analysis and report writing for the team. 

The students with the flu had a lot of virus in their noses, says Lai, but they did not cough much at all, so only small amounts of virus got expelled into the air. 

"The other important factor is ventilation and air movement. The air in our study room was continually mixed rapidly by a heater and dehumidifier and so the small amounts of virus in the air were diluted," Lai said. 

Lai adds that middle-aged adults are usually less susceptible to influenza than younger adults, another likely factor in the lack of any flu cases. 

Most researchers think airborne transmission is a major factor in the spread of this common disease. But Milton notes that updating international infection-control guidelines requires evidence from randomized clinical trials such as this one. The team's ongoing research aims to show the extent of flu transmission by airborne inhalation and exactly how that airborne transmission happens. 

The lack of transmission in this study offers important clues to how we can protect ourselves from the flu this year. 

"Being up close, face-to-face with other people indoors where the air isn't moving much seems to be the most risky thing – and it's something we all tend to do a lot. Our results suggest that portable air purifiers that stir up the air as well as clean it could be a big help. But if you are really close and someone is coughing, the best way to stay safe is to wear a mask, especially the N95," said Milton. 

The team used a quarantined floor of a Baltimore-area hotel to measure airborne transmission between five people with confirmed influenza virus with symptoms and a group of 11 healthy volunteers across two cohorts in 2023 and 2024. A similar quarantine set-up was used in an earlier study and exhaled breath testing was used in several pioneering studies by Milton and colleagues on influenza transmission. 

During the most recent flu study, participants lived for two weeks on an isolated floor of the hotel, and did daily activities simulating different ways that people gather and interact – including conversational ice-breakers, physical activities like yoga, stretching or dancing. Infected people handled objects such as a pen, tablet computer and a microphone, before passing the objects among the whole group. 

Researchers measured a wide range of parameters throughout the experiment, including participant symptom monitoring, daily nasal swabs and saliva samples and blood collection to test for antibodies. The study measured the viral exposure in volunteers' breathing area as well as the ambient air of the activity room. Participant exhaled breath was also measured daily in the Gesundheit II machine, invented by Milton and colleagues at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 

Finding ways to control flu outbreaks is a public health priority, says Milton. Flu is responsible for a considerable burden of disease in the United States and globally – up to 1 billion people across the planet catch seasonal influenza every year and this season has seen at least 7.5 million flu cases so far in the United States alone, including 81,000 hospitalizations and over 3,000 deaths. 

Researchers at UMD's interdisciplinary Public Health Aerobiology Lab – Kristen Coleman, Yi Esparza, Filbert Hong, Isabel Sierra Maldonado, Kathleen McPhaul and S.H. Sheldon Tai – contributed to this study, as well as colleagues from UMD Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, the University of Hong Kong and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

A new meeting report was published in Volume 17, Issue 12 of Aging-US on December 23, 2025, titled "Cellular senescence meets infection: highlights from the 10th annual International Cell Senescence Association (ICSA) conference, Rome 2025."

Led by Stefanie Deinhardt-Emmer from Jena University Hospital and Marco De Andrea from the University of Piemonte Orientale and the University of Turin, the report summarizes key discussions from the 10th International Cell Senescence Association conference held in Rome in September 2025. It focuses on how infections can trigger cellular senescence, a state in which cells stop dividing and release inflammatory signals. This link is important since it connects infectious diseases with aging, chronic inflammation, and lasting tissue damage.

Although cellular senescence is best known for its role in aging and cancer, the meeting highlighted its emerging importance in infection biology. Researchers described how viruses and bacteria can induce senescence in infected cells and spread its effects to nearby tissues. This process, known as infection-driven senescence (IDS), can help limit pathogen replication but may also prolong inflammation and slow recovery, particularly in older adults and during chronic infections.

Several sessions focused on respiratory viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Researchers showed that these viruses can promote senescence in lung cells, contributing to persistent inflammation and reduced healing. Experimental models suggested that decreasing the amount of senescent cells improved lung repair, even after the virus was cleared, offering insight into why some patients experience long-lasting respiratory symptoms.

Chronic viral infections were another major theme. Human cytomegalovirus and HIV were shown to drive senescence in immune and vascular cells. In people with HIV, viral proteins were associated with biological changes resembling accelerated aging, despite effective antiviral therapy. These findings help explain why age-related conditions occur earlier and more frequently in this population.

In the meeting, it was also demonstrated that senescence is not limited to viral infections. Researchers reported that the bacterium Mycobacterium abscessus induces senescence in immune cells during chronic infection. These senescent cells increased inflammation and susceptibility to further infection. Removing them reduced bacterial levels in experimental models, suggesting new directions for treating persistent bacterial disease.

"Mechanistically, IDS integrates DNA damage responses, inflammatory signaling, and metabolic stress, with consistent activation of p16INK4a, p21, and NF-κB pathways."

Across the conference, speakers discussed therapies that either remove senescent cells or reduce their harmful inflammatory signals. These approaches, known as senolytic and senomorphic strategies, showed promise in preclinical studies as potential tools to limit infection-related tissue damage and chronic inflammation.

Overall, the meeting report presents infection-driven senescence as a unifying concept linking infection, immunity, and aging. The discussions at ICSA 2025 highlight a growing field with important implications for understanding chronic disease and the long-term health effects of infections.

Despite the immense amount of genetic material present in each cell, around three billion base pairs in humans, this material needs to be accurately divided in two and allocated in equal quantities. The centromere, located in the middle of each chromosome, is known as the site where cellular equipment attaches to divide chromosomes successfully, but the specific mechanisms behind this remain unknown.

In a major new study reported in The EMBO Journal, researchers at The University of Osaka have identified an additional pathway by which the DNA-packaging histone CENP-A associates with and specifies the location of the centromere. This process is vital for ensuring chromosomes are structured and genes are expressed appropriately.

The study was based around the Holliday Junction Recognition Protein (HJURP), a so-called chaperone protein that ushers centromere-identifying cell components to the correct site on chromosomes. They found that HJURP did not localize at the centromere when the expression of both of two cell components, CENP-C and Mis18C, were eliminated following a double knockout process.

Although it was known that Mis18C recognizes the chaperone HJURP to enable CENP-A's deposition onto centromeres, we found that CENP-C can actually occupy Mis18C's role in this process, providing a parallel pathway that helps ensure successful and timely mitosis or meiosis. We also identified the particular residues of HJURP that enable its binding to CENP-C."

Tatsuo Fukagawa, senior author

The team then built on these findings through analyses in DT40 chicken cells, confirming that these interactions are essential for centromere function during cell division. These analyses showed that when HJURP and CENP-C did not interact, this led to errors in mitosis, slowing cell growth. The combination of no interaction and the removal of Mis18C meant that CENP-A could not be incorporated into chromatin, preventing cellular machinery from knowing the supposed location of the centromere.

"Our work reveals that this sequence-independent epigenetic mechanism of centromere specification has greater diversity than previously thought," explains lead author, Tetsuya Hori. "Given how biologically fundamental the processes of mitosis and meiosis are, our finding that the cell has independent pathways for flagging the location of each chromosome's centromere is valuable."

The key findings of this work, regarding the existence of dual pathways for recruiting HJURP for CENP-A deposition, can provide a solid foundation for future studies on the mechanisms behind centromere functioning and on diseases involving errors of cell division.

Researchers at the University of Southampton have developed a promising new way to bolster the body's immune system response to cancer.

In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers used specially engineered multi-pronged antibodies to better activate cancer-killing T cells.

The antibodies work by 'grabbing' and 'clustering' multiple immune cell receptors – boosting the signal which tells the T cell to attack the cancer.

The team from the University of Southampton's Centre for Cancer Immunology focused their efforts on an immune receptor called CD27. CD27 needs a matching key (ligand) to activate T cells. This ligand is produced naturally in response to infection, but cancers lack this signal and T cells can only elicit a weak response against the cancer cells.

Antibodies can work a bit like a master key, but most commonly used antibodies are Y-shaped molecules with two prongs, meaning they can only engage two receptors at the same time.

While antibodies have revolutionised cancer treatment, some cancers don't respond because T cells don't receive all the signals they need to become fully active. 

The antibodies developed by the researchers have four prongs, allowing them to grab onto more receptors. They also enlist the help of a second cell, forcing all the CD27 receptors they are holding to clump together. This amplifies the signal and mimics the natural way CD27 is activated in the body.

Professor Aymen Al‑Shamkhani at the University of Southampton, who led the study, explains: "We already understood how the body's natural CD27 signal switches on T cells, but turning that knowledge into a medicine was the real challenge. Antibodies are reliable molecules that make excellent drugs. However, the natural antibody format was not powerful enough, so we had to create a more effective version."

In lab studies using mice as well as human immune cells, the new antibodies were more effective in switching on CD8⁺ T cells – the 'special forces' of the immune system, than standard Y-shaped antibodies, delivering a more robust anti-tumour response.

By making CD27 more responsive to therapeutic targeting, the findings provide a blueprint for developing next‑generation immunotherapies that harness the immune system to fight cancer more effectively.

This approach could help improve future cancer treatments by allowing the immune system to work closer to its full potential."

A controlled crossover study shows that simply working in natural daylight, rather than standard artificial lighting, can stabilize daily glucose swings, boost fat oxidation, and subtly tune the body's metabolic clock in people with type 2 diabetes.

In a recent study published in Cell Metabolism, researchers investigated whether spending office hours in natural daylight, rather than artificial office lighting, can improve health indicators in people with type 2 diabetes.

They found that exposure to natural light shifted metabolism toward greater fat oxidation, modulated select circadian outputs, and altered molecular metabolic signatures. People with greater natural light exposure also experienced a modest but statistically significant increase in the time when their glucose levels remained in the normal range.

The human circadian system synchronizes metabolism and physiology to the day–night cycle, with light acting as its most powerful regulator. The central biological clock in the brain coordinates peripheral clocks in organs, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, influencing glucose metabolism, energy use, and insulin sensitivity.

Disruptions to circadian rhythms, which are common in modern lifestyles dominated by indoor living, have been strongly linked to metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes. Individuals typically spend 80 % to 90 % of their time indoors, where lighting is dimmer, spectrally static, and poorly aligned with natural daylight patterns.

Previous studies suggest that artificial light exposure can influence glucose and lipid metabolism; however, these studies rarely reflect real-world daylight conditions and often focus on short-term or isolated metabolic outcomes.

Researchers aimed to comprehensively assess metabolic, circadian, and other physiological responses to natural daylight exposure. They used a randomized crossover trial that included 13 older adults with type 2 diabetes who completed two 4.5-day intervention periods. One period involved exposure to natural daylight while indoors through large windows, and the other involved exposure to constant artificial office lighting intentionally low in melanopic and short-wavelength content.

There was a washout period of four weeks or more between interventions. During each intervention, participants stayed continuously in a research facility, followed standardized sleep schedules and meal timings, and maintained consistent medication use.

Natural daylight exposure occurred during office hours (08:00–17:00), while artificial lighting provided 300 lux at eye level. Evening light exposure was tightly controlled in both conditions, and glasses that blocked blue light were used when participants left the controlled environment.

Continuous glucose monitoring was used throughout the intervention to assess glycemic control. Whole-body energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were measured using indirect calorimetry, which included assessments in a respiration chamber and ventilated hood.

Blood samples were collected over a 24-hour period for metabolic profiling, and a mixed-meal tolerance test assessed postprandial metabolism. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained to examine clock gene expression and circadian properties in cultured muscle cells. Multi-omic analyses, including lipidomics, metabolomics, and monocyte transcriptomics, were performed in an exploratory, hypothesis-generating framework to capture systemic molecular responses.

Exposure to natural daylight did not alter average glucose levels but resulted in a greater proportion of time spent within the normal glucose range, indicating improved glycemic stability.

Computational modeling showed that natural light reduced the amplitude of daily glucose fluctuations, which was associated with better glucose control. Whole-body energy expenditure was similar between lighting conditions. However, natural daylight consistently shifted metabolism toward greater fat oxidation and lower carbohydrate oxidation throughout the day and following a mixed meal, reflecting improved metabolic flexibility, or the ability to switch efficiently between fuel sources.

Although 24-hour levels of plasma glucose, triglycerides, and free fatty acids did not differ significantly between conditions, postprandial metabolic dynamics differed, with natural light promoting a metabolic profile consistent with enhanced lipid utilization. Evening melatonin secretion was higher following natural daylight exposure, suggesting subtle circadian effects, although the timing of melatonin onset remained unchanged.

At the molecular level, biopsies of skeletal muscle showed increased expression of specific clock genes following natural light exposure. Primary muscle cells cultured from these biopsies exhibited a phase-advanced circadian rhythm, suggestive of persistent alterations in peripheral clock properties, as observed ex vivo under controlled laboratory conditions, indicating a potential cellular-level memory of prior light exposure.

Multi-omic analyses revealed consistent daylight-associated patterns in circulating metabolites, lipid classes, and immune-cell gene expression, particularly involving lipid metabolism pathways. However, most individual molecular features did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing.

These findings demonstrate that exposure to indoor natural daylight favorably influences glucose regulation, metabolic flexibility, circadian biology, and molecular metabolic signatures in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

This study suggests that chronic lack of natural light may be one contributing factor to poorer metabolic health in people with type 2 diabetes.

Compared with standard artificial office lighting, exposure to natural light increased the time that participants showed glucose readings within a normal range and promoted greater fat oxidation, indicating improved metabolic flexibility.

These benefits were accompanied by reduced daily glucose fluctuations, higher evening melatonin levels, suggestive advances in skeletal muscle circadian phase, and exploratory changes in circulating metabolites, lipids, and immune-cell gene expression linked to insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism.

A key strength of the study is its randomized crossover design, which features tightly controlled light exposure, meals, and activity. However, the small sample size, short intervention duration, older study population, seasonal restriction, and reliance on subjective sleep measures limit generalizability and warrant cautious interpretation of causality.

Overall, the findings highlight natural daylight as a potentially modifiable environmental factor that may support metabolic control in type 2 diabetes and warrant longer, larger, and more naturalistic real-world studies, particularly in working-age populations and real office environments.

A new study of over 32,000 US Veterans has found that the longer people stay on medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine, methadone, or extended-release naltrexone), the greater the probability of short- and medium-term survival. This benefit continues to increase at least for four years of ongoing treatment, considerably longer than most patients currently stay in treatment.

People with opioid use disorder run the risk of dying from accidental overdose but opioid use disorder also increases the risk of death from other health conditions, most notably infectious disease. People who receive buprenorphine and other medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) have fewer drug cravings, improved social functioning, and better quality of life than those who do not, and those improvements decrease their risk of mortality.

It's unusual for patients to stay on MOUD for four years, or even for one year. Most standards of care specify 6 months as the minimum target for treatment duration, and more than 25% of patients say they want even shorter durations. This study shows that to get the greatest benefit from MOUD, the recommended treatment duration should be years longer. Encouraging patients to continue treatment for at least four years will significantly increase their chances of survival.

This study, published in the scientific journal Addiction, measured relative predicted survival probability as the ratio of the predicted probability of surviving to 6 years if a patient were treated for 1 year instead of 6 months, 2 years instead of 6 months, and so on. Longer time on therapy increased expected relative survival, with larger gains in longer time horizons. Higher-risk patients saw greater benefits over shorter time horizons than lower-risk patients.

For example (see figure), a 50-year-old male with no other health risk factors who remained in MOUD treatment for two years had a 4 % higher survival probability than a 50-year-old male who stopped treatment at six months. In contrast, a 30-year-old female with no other health risk factors was not projected to achieve a 4 % greater survival probability until around 5 years of MOUD duration. Additionally, for the lowest risk patients, the improvements in relative survival for each additional year of therapy started to diminish as duration increased, with no statistically discernible difference beyond 4 years.

The study included 19,666 buprenorphine users, 8,675 methadone users, and 4,007 extended-release naltrexone users. After four years of receiving MOUD, additional time in treatment may not continue to increase the relative predicted probability of survival.

In early 2025, around 4.9 million British adults - almost one in ten - are estimated to have recently used, or expressed interest in using, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist medications to support weight loss. The findings, which are based on a nationally representative household survey of 5,260 British adults, are published in BMC Medicine.

GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP medications help lower blood sugar, support weight loss, and reduce the risk of heart and kidney complications. The GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP medications liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide are licensed for weight loss in the UK but only around 220,000 people will be eligible for treatment with these on the NHS between 2025 and 2028.

Sarah Jackson and colleagues investigated the prevalence of use and interest in GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP medications among British adults - with an average age of 49 years - using survey data collected between January and March 2025 as part of the Smoking Toolkit Study. The authors found that 2.9 % of participants reported using GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications within the previous year to support weight loss. Of those who had not recently used these medications for weight loss, 6.5 % were interested in doing so within the next year. Extrapolating from these figures, the authors estimate that around 1.6 million British adults may have used GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications to support weight loss between 2024 and early 2025 and that a further 3.3 million were interested in doing so at the start of 2025. Among those who used a GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medication to support weight loss within the previous year, 15 % reported using a medication that was not licensed for weight loss in the UK. The authors speculate that this could be due to off-label prescribing or individuals acquiring medications through non-medical routes such as online purchases.

The authors found that GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medication use and interest was more prevalent among women, those aged between 45 and 55 years, and those who reported experiencing moderate to severe levels of psychological distress within the previous month. Interest in GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications was also higher among individuals reporting difficulties with their finances, and who were not in work due to long-term illness or disability.

The findings highlight substantial demand for GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications to support weight loss in Britain. The authors recommend regular monitoring of their use, health outcomes, and broader impacts on the British healthcare system, and to ensure that they are provided safely, appropriately, sustainably, and fairly.

Cell division is an essential process for all life on earth, yet the exact mechanisms by which cells divide during early embryonic development have remained elusive – particularly for egg-laying species. Scientists from the Brugués group at the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) at TUD Dresden University of Technology have revealed a novel mechanism that explains how early embryonic cells may divide without forming a complete contractile ring, traditionally seen as essential for this process. The findings, published in Nature, challenge the long-standing textbook view of cell division, revealing how parts of the cytoskeleton, and material properties of the cell interior (or cytoplasm) cooperate to drive division through a 'ratchet' mechanism.

In most species, cells divide by forming a contractile ring from a structural protein known as actin at the cell equator. This ring contracts like a purse-string, pinching the cell's contents to result in two new cells. Although the 'purse-string' model of cell division is observed in many organisms, this is not the case for species with very large embryonic cells such as sharks, platypus, birds and reptiles. In these cases, the actin ring cannot fully close due to the cell's immense size and large yolk sac. How exactly cell division takes place in these organisms remained an open question in the field, until now.

"With such a large yolk in the embryonic cell, there is a geometric constraint. How does a contractile band, with loose ends, remain stable and generate enough force to divide these huge cells?" asked Alison Kickuth, a recently graduated PhD student from the Brugués group at the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) and lead author of the study. Their experiments, published in a seminal new study in Nature, have found an answer to this question.

The scientists studied zebrafish embryos, which divide rapidly and share the characteristic of having large, yolk-filled cells during early development. By precisely cutting the actin band with a laser, Alison observed that the band continued to ingress despite being severed, suggesting that anchoring points were distributed along the band, rather than at the ends. In addition, it seemed that microtubules, another essential part of the cytoskeleton, appeared to bend and splay in response to the laser cuts, and had a critical role in stabilizing the band during contraction.

To clarify the role of microtubules in this process, the authors disrupted them in two separate experiments: by chemically inducing depolymerization (effectively stopping new microtubules from forming), and by physically disrupting them using an obstacle, in the form of a microscopic oil droplet. Without microtubules, the actin band collapsed, proving that microtubules are essential for holding the band in place, and provided both mechanical support and signaling during its formation.

Changes in the cytoskeleton are known to happen in other species as cell cycles progress. Importantly, the cell cycle is separated into distinct phases of activity; a mitotic phase (M-phase) where the DNA is divided, and an interphase, where a typical cell grows and replicates its DNA. After DNA has been divided, large structures made of microtubules called asters grow to span the entire cytoplasm. These asters are essential during interphase for deciding where the actin band will form and start contracting, marking the future cleavage plane.

Given that microtubules are known to stiffen the cytoplasm in various cellular contexts, the authors sought to explore if asters would contribute to stiffening to help anchor the actin band. To investigate, the authors employed magnetic beads and observed their displacement under magnetic forces. These experiments allowed the scientists to measure changes in cytoplasmic stiffness during cell cycle stages.

They found that the cytoplasm becomes stiffer during interphase, acting as a scaffold to stabilize the actin band. In turn, it becomes more fluid during M-phase, allowing the band's ingression between the two future cells. These dynamic changes in stiffening and fluidization play a key role in the division process.

Only one question remained: How did the band remain stable throughout M-phase despite the cytoplasm becoming more fluid-like? By imaging the ends of the actin band over time, the team observed that although the band is unstable during M-phase while contracting, it did not collapse fully. Instead, this retraction is "rescued" due to the fast cell cycles in these early stages. In the following interphase when the cytoplasm stiffens again due to the asters reappearing, the band becomes re-stabilized. Then, the actin band continued ingressing during the next fluid-phase.

These cycles of instability during M-phase and stabilization during interphase repeated over several cell cycles until division was complete. This alternating pattern acts like a 'mechanical ratchet', driving cell division without needing a fully-formed contractile ring. In this case, division is possible through the alternating material properties of the cytoplasm, and takes place over multiple cell cycles instead of just one.

"The temporal ratchet mechanism fundamentally alters our view of how cytokinesis works", emphasized Jan Brugués, corresponding author of the study. This finding provided an effective solution for early cell divisions in cells that were too large for conventional cell division, and have rapid cell cycles.

Zebrafish are a fascinating case, as cytoplasmic division in their embryonic cells is inherently unstable. To overcome this instability, their cells divide rapidly, allowing ingression of the band over several cell cycles by alternating between stability and fluidization until division is complete."

Alison Kickuth, Technische Universität Dresden

This discovery represents a novel paradigm for understanding cell division in large embryonic cells and may apply broadly across species with yolk-rich embryos. Additionally, this study highlights temporal control of material properties in the cytoplasm as an important contributor to cellular processes, a role that may be expanded in future studies. Understanding these mechanisms will open new perspectives for studying development in different species.

An artificial saliva in the form of a mouthwash, produced with the CANECPI-5 protein extracted from sugarcane and modified in a laboratory, can aid in treating teeth in patients with head and neck cancer. In these cases, radiotherapy very close to the mouth can destroy salivary glands and compromise saliva production, which is essential for controlling bacteria and disease.

According to research conducted at the Bauru School of Dentistry at the University of São Paulo (FOB-USP) in Brazil, CANECPI-5 forms a protective "shield" for the teeth, guarding the enamel against weakening acids found in juices, alcoholic beverages, and even stomach acids. The results were published in the Journal of Dentistry. 

The study was conducted during Natara Dias Gomes da Silva's doctoral studies at FOB-USP. She collaborated with researchers from the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), also in Brazil; the University of California in San Francisco, in the United States; and Yonsei University College of Dentistry, in South Korea.The work is part of the Thematic Project "Modulation of acquired pellicle to control dental mineral loss: unveiling mechanisms to make therapies possible", which is coordinated by Professor Marília Afonso Rabelo Buzalaf from FOB-USP. 

We tested the mouthwash developed with CANECPI-5 by applying this solution to small pieces of animal teeth once a day for one minute. Based on these results, we'll conduct further research so that we can think about applications of this product."

Natara Dias Gomes da Silva, first author of the article

"This is the first product that uses the concept of acquired pellicle [a thin protective layer that quickly forms on the tooth surface] to treat xerostomia, which is the sensation of a dry mouth caused by a lack of saliva. We use substances that will reformulate the composition of the proteins that bind to the teeth," explains Buzalaf.

"We've developed a process in which CANECPI-5 binds directly to tooth enamel, helping to make teeth more resistant to the action of acids produced by bacteria," Silva points out.

The data published in the article showed that the CANECPI-5 protein is most effective when combined with fluoride and xylitol. In these tests, the artificial saliva spray significantly reduced bacterial activity and tooth demineralization – the process by which teeth lose calcium and phosphate, making them more susceptible to cavities. 

This discovery is significant because patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer do not yet have access to a specific product on the market that can help combat and treat the most aggressive cavities that develop after radiation therapy.

"Artificial saliva improves the sensation of dry mouth and sores. This helps with discomfort and also combats bacteria. In some cases, the use of this type of product is only for a short time. In others, it's permanent, because many individuals lose the ability to produce saliva," adds Buzalaf.

The patent for the CANECPI-5 protein was filed a few years ago. According to the researchers, the challenge now is to scale up in partnership with companies interested in the technology so that the artificial saliva can be produced.

"We've already tested the solution as a mouthwash, gel, and orodispersible film, which is a type of plastic that's placed on the tongue and dissolves, releasing the protein. We've tested it in several vehicles and found that CANECPI-5 works very well in all of them. We'll continue testing other technologies within the Thematic Project to use not only this protein, but others as well," says Buzalaf.

According to Flávio Henrique Silva, a professor in the Department of Genetics and Evolution at UFSCar, who worked on developing the CANECPI-5 protein, the work with cystatins (a family of proteins involved in various biological processes) is linked to research carried out under the Sugarcane Genome Project (SUCEST, FAPESP). His laboratory is part of that project.

"At that time, our group identified and produced, in a recombinant form in bacteria, the first cystatin from sugarcane. We named it CANECPI-1. We then identified and produced five other cane cystatins, including CANECPI-5, which had potent inhibitory activities against cysteine peptidases, which are its target enzymes. Throughout our work, we noticed that this protein bound strongly to smooth surfaces, such as the quartz cuvettes used in activity measurements. This led us to conduct tests in partnership with Professor Marília Buzalaf on the binding of the protein to tooth enamel."

According to the researchers, the discovery that CANECPI-5 protects tooth enamel while also regulating the oral microbiota makes it a highly promising molecule for dentistry research.

"CANECPI-5 has also been used in the work of other colleagues in the field of dentistry, particularly involving periodontitis. We also have a collaborative project with a colleague from the Federal University of Uberlândia, using subcutaneous sponge implants in mice, which has shown that it's capable of reducing inflammation and promoting angiogenesis [the formation of new blood vessels] and fibrinogenesis [the formation of fibrin, a protein essential for blood clotting], important processes in tissue repair, making it a candidate molecule for use in wound healing," Silva points out.

Within the Thematic Project, the researchers will continue trying to understand how CANECPI-5 interacts with other substances. 

According to Buzalaf, one possible avenue is to study CANECPI-5 fused with a peptide derived from statherin, a protein found in saliva, to see if the new hybrid protein is more effective against the acids that weaken teeth when they come from the stomach. Another possible avenue is to try to understand how to combat periodontal disease.

"Another aspect of the Thematic Project is to associate CANECPI-5 with vitamin E because this vitamin acts as a carrier, bringing the protein into contact with the tooth. We imagine that this could facilitate the application of the product directly by the patient at home," says the researcher.

The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT), the leading professional organization for the advancement of cell and gene therapies (CGTs), and the Orphan Therapeutics Accelerator (OTXL), a non-profit biotech focused on completing development and enabling access to stalled rare disease treatments, today announced a partnership to establish CGTxchange, a jointly owned entity that will serve as a clearinghouse and marketplace for deprioritized CGTs.

The new joint venture will address a growing and urgent challenge facing the CGT field: policy and economic shifts in recent years have led biopharma sponsors to halt development of hundreds of CGTs no longer considered commercially viable by traditional industry standards, including many that delivered clear benefits to patients in trials.

CGTxchange leverages the combined capabilities of the organizations in an unprecedented way to engage a broad array of potential partners and funders to efficiently identify, evaluate, finance, develop, and provide sustainable, reliable, and scalable access to potentially transformative CGTs for ultra-rare diseases.

At ASGCT, we have observed that a host of cell and gene therapies are being set aside not because they lack clinical merit, but rather due to the challenges of commercializing these therapies once approved. In partnership with OTXL, we are creating an entirely new way to ensure these CGTs find their way to organizations – whether companies, non-profits or academic institutions – that are ready to take on the challenges of development and commercialization so patients may ultimately benefit."

David Barrett, CEO of ASGCT

Using OTXL's AI-based platform, CGT assets and related information can be input into a secure, searchable database and analyzed, generating listings and profiles of shelved therapies and providing risk-based assessments. From there, listed assets can be matched with prospective investors or partners in the marketplace, thereby expanding the potential to secure funding and new clinical sponsors.

"Typical venture capital and biopharma expectations for returns are set well above what most CGTs for ultra-rare diseases can meet in light of recent policy and market shifts," said Craig Martin, CEO of OTXL. "Yet many of these shelved therapies can still offer meaningful returns to the right partners, as well as tremendous benefits to patients. This partnership allows us to surface high-quality, clinical-stage CGT programs to investors and organizations whose missions, timelines and objectives align with what these therapies can deliver."

Within the partnership, ASGCT will convene and engage its extensive network of CGT leaders, experts, donors and investors, while helping establish CGTxchange as the leading solution for currently 'pre-viable' CGT programs. OTXL will develop the platform for the clearinghouse and marketplace, contributing resources from its AI-based infrastructure and partner network to continue to build, adapt and scale the platform for CGT community adoption and use.

ASGCT and OTXL will initiate development of CGTxchange in early 2026, with a targeted mid-year launch and rollout.

Exercise may reduce symptoms of depression to a similar extent as psychological therapy, according to an updated Cochrane review. When compared with antidepressant medication, exercise also showed a similar effect, but the evidence was of low certainty. 

Depression is a leading cause of ill health and disability, affecting over 280 million people worldwide. Exercise is low-cost, widely available, and comes with additional health benefits, making it an attractive option for patients and healthcare providers. 

The review, conducted by researchers from the University of Lancashire, examined 73 randomized controlled trials including nearly 5,000 adults with depression. The studies compared exercise with no treatment or control interventions, as well as with psychological therapies and antidepressant medications. 

The results show that exercising can have a moderate benefit on reducing depressive symptoms, compared with no treatment or a control intervention. When compared with psychological therapy, exercise had a similar effect on depressive symptoms, based on moderate-certainty evidence from ten trials. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested a similar effect, but the evidence is limited and of low certainty. Long-term effects are unclear as few studies followed participants after treatment. 

Side effects were rare, including occasional musculoskeletal injuries for those exercising and typical medication-related effects for those taking antidepressants, such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems.

Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression. This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important." 

Professor Andrew Clegg, lead author of the review

The review found that light to moderate intensity exercise may be more beneficial than vigorous exercise, and that completing between 13 and 36 exercise sessions was associated with greater improvements in depressive symptoms.

No single type of exercise was clearly superior, although mixed exercise programmes and resistance training appeared more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Some forms of exercise, such as yoga, qigong and stretching, were not included in the analysis and represent areas for future research. Long-term effects are unclear as few studies followed participants after treatment.

This update adds 35 new trials to previous versions published in 2008 and 2013. Despite the additional evidence, the overall conclusions remain largely unchanged. This is because the majority of trials were small, with fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

"Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar," said Professor Clegg. "Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each."

Vaccinating women during pregnancy leads to the transfer of antibodies to their newborns. These antibodies were detected not only in blood, but also in the nasal mucosa, the site where whooping cough bacteria enter the body. This has been shown by international research led by Radboud university medical center. 'The fact that these antibodies reach the nasal mucosa has not been demonstrated before and highlights how effective this vaccination is'.

Since 2019, pregnant women in the Netherlands have been offered a vaccination against whooping cough (pertussis) for their unborn child, known as the 22-week shot. 'We give this vaccine to protect babies from whooping cough right after birth. In the first weeks of life, babies are extremely vulnerable and too young to be vaccinated themselves. That's why we vaccinate the mother during pregnancy,' explains immunologist Dimitri Diavatopoulos of Radboudumc. Antibodies from the mother are transferred to the baby through the placenta. This study now shows that these antibodies also reach the nasal mucosa – exactly where whooping cough bacteria enter the body.

Whooping cough is well controlled in Europe but remains a deadly disease in many parts of the world. Each year, between 200,000 and 300,000 people die from it, mostly young infants in low- and middle-income countries, where good vaccines are not always available. In the study conducted by Radboudumc and the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia, 343 mothers and their babies participated, with half of the pregnant women receiving the whooping cough vaccine. 'Mothers who were vaccinated during pregnancy passed on antibodies through the placenta that were subsequently detected in the baby's nasal mucosa,' says Diavatopoulos.

The study also shows that babies who received a whole-cell whooping cough vaccine at 8, 12, and 16 weeks developed, on average, a stronger immune response than those who received an acellular vaccine. 'The difference is that a whole-cell vaccine contains the complete, but inactivated, whooping cough bacterium, whereas an acellular vaccine contains only a few purified components of the bacterium,' Diavatopoulos explains. 'Acellular vaccines usually cause fewer side effects but often also provide shorter-lasting protection. Our findings suggest that whole-cell vaccines may support longer-term immune protection', says Janeri Fröberg, postdoctoral researcher at Radboudumc.

In Europe, the acellular vaccine has been used since 2005, while most low- and middle-income countries still use the whole-cell vaccine. The researchers emphasize that further studies are needed to determine what these results mean for clinical protection and vaccination policies in different settings.

For the Netherlands, this study underscores the importance of the 22-week shot, which gives babies immediate protection during their most vulnerable period. For lower-income countries, where most deaths occur, the results show that implementing whooping cough vaccination during pregnancy could save lives. And for countries that continue to use whole-cell vaccines, the findings support the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to maintain their use, as they may provide longer lasting immunity.

Higher intake of food preservatives, widely used in industrially processed foods and beverages to extend shelf-life, is associated with a modestly increased risk of cancer, finds a study from France published by The BMJ today.

While further research is needed to better understand these links, the researchers say these new data call for the re-evaluation of regulations governing the use of these additives by the food industry to improve consumer protection.

Preservatives are substances added to packaged foods to extend shelf life. Some experimental studies have shown that certain preservatives can damage cells and DNA, but firm evidence linking preservatives to cancer risk remains scarce.

To address this, researchers set out to examine the association between exposure to preservative food additives and risk of cancer in adults, using detailed dietary and health data from 2009 to 2023.

Their findings are based on 105,260 participants aged 15 years and older (average age 42 years; 79% women) enrolled in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study who were free of cancer and completed regular 24 hour brand-specific dietary records over an average 7.5 year period. Health questionnaires and official medical and death records were then used to track cancer cases up to 31 December 2023.

A total of 17 individual preservatives were analysed including citric acid, lecithins, total sulfites, ascorbic acid, sodium nitrite, potassium sorbate, sodium erythorbate, sodium ascorbate, potassium metabisulfite, and potassium nitrate.

Preservatives were grouped into non-antioxidants (which inhibit microbial growth or slow chemical changes that lead to spoilage) and antioxidants (which delay or prevent food deteriorating by removing or limiting oxygen levels in packaging).

During the follow-up period, 4,226 participants received a diagnosis of cancer, comprising 1,208 breast, 508 prostate, 352 colorectal, and 2,158 other cancers.

Of the 17 individually studied preservatives, 11 were not associated with cancer incidence, and no link was found between total preservatives and cancer incidence.

However, higher intakes of several preservatives (mostly non-antioxidants including potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, and acetic acid) were associated with higher risk of cancers compared with non-consumers or lower consumers.

For example, total sorbates, specifically potassium sorbate, was associated with a 14% increased risk of overall cancer and a 26% increased risk of breast cancer, while total sulfites were associated with a 12% increased risk of overall cancer.

Sodium nitrite was associated with a 32% increased risk of prostate cancer, while potassium nitrate was associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (13%) and breast cancer (22%).

Total acetates were associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (15%) and breast cancer (25%), while acetic acid was associated with a 12% increased risk of overall cancer.

Among antioxidant preservatives, only total erythorbates and specific sodium erythorbate were found to be associated with higher incidence of cancer.

While more studies are needed to better understand these potential risks, the researchers note that several of these compounds can alter immune and inflammatory pathways, possibly triggering the development of cancer.

This is an observational study, so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and the researchers can't rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results.

However, they say this was a large study based on detailed dietary records linked to food databases over 14 years and results are consistent with existing experimental data suggesting adverse cancer related effects of several of these compounds.

As such, they conclude: "This study brings new insights for the future re-evaluation of the safety of these food additives by health agencies, considering the balance between benefit and risk for food preservation and cancer."

In the meantime, they call on manufacturers to limit the use of unnecessary preservatives, and support recommendations for consumers to favour freshly made, minimally processed foods.

From a policy perspective, preservatives offer clear benefits by extending shelf life and lowering food costs, which can be particularly important for populations with lower incomes, point out US researchers in a linked editorial.

However, they say the widespread and often insufficiently monitored use of these additives, with uncertainties of their long term health effects, call for a more balanced approach.

Findings from NutriNet-Santé may prompt regulatory agencies to revisit existing policies, such as setting stricter limits on use, requiring clearer labeling, and mandating disclosure of additive contents, while collaborative global monitoring initiatives, similar to those implemented for trans fatty acids and sodium, could also support evidence based risk assessments and guide reformulation by the food industry, they write.

"At the individual level, public health guidance is already more definitive about the reduction of processed meat and alcohol intake, offering actionable steps even as evidence on the carcinogenic effects of preservatives is evolving," they conclude.

Atlético de Madrid and Real Madrid arrive at the Spanish Super Cup, played for the sixth time in Saudi Arabia, surrounded by uncertainty. Simeone's side come off a draw against Real Sociedad, while Xabi Alonso's Real Madrid arrive after surrendering a four-point lead at the top of LaLiga.









Will Mbappé play against Atlético de Madrid?





Kylian Mbappé did not travel with the squad to Saudi Arabia due to a sprain in his left knee. However, he has not been completely ruled out of returning if Real Madrid reach the final against Barcelona.








Real Madrid vs Atlético de Madrid: Last meeting


Xabi Alonso already faced heavy scrutiny at the end of September, when Real Madrid were thrashed 5–2 by Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano. It marked his second major defeat in a high-profile match as Real Madrid head coach.

That result followed another alarming precedent: a 4–0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer Club World Cup.








When is the Spanish Super Cup Final?


After Barcelona's 5–0 victory over Athletic Club, the Catalan side now await the winner of the Madrid derby.

The Spanish Super Cup Final will be played on Sunday, December 11

Video clips of World Cup games will be broadcast live on TikTok this summer, FIFA said on Thursday.

The collaboration between world football's governing body and the short video-based social media platform will last until the end of 2026 in an attempt to bring fans “closer to the action” with more “relatable perspectives”.

In addition to the live broadcasting of parts of games, FIFA announced that they will provide access to press conferences and training sessions to a select group of creators for fan content, with the app's global head of content saying people are “42 per cent more likely to tune in to live matches after watching sports content on TikTok”.

Match ticket information and “gamification features”, such as filters and stickers, to enhance engagement, will also be available.

“This is an innovative and creative collaboration that will connect more fans across the globe to the FIFA World Cup in unprecedented ways, bringing them behind the curtain and closer to the action than ever before,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said.

“As football grows and evolves — uniting an increasing number of people — so should the way it is shared and promoted.”

The 48-team tournament will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

U.S. President Donald Trump had expressed a desire to ban TikTok during his first term in office to resolve national security concerns. In 2024, U.S. Congress passed legislation to address this as lawmakers from both parties believed the app could blackmail Americans or influence elections.

In December of last year, however, TikTok's chief executive announced they had signed an agreement which has been blessed by Trump, who declared he is “saving” the app.



TikTok, which announced reaching a billion users in 2021, has collaborated in this way for sports tournaments before, notably for the 2023 Women's World Cup which was the first official collaboration with FIFA. Midway through the tournament the official hashtag had 1.8 billion views and similarly featured selected creators, who were able to earn money from their content.

TikTok has also collaborated with Burnley Women, the Women's European Championship, the Club World Cup and the Women's Super League in Bangladesh. Beyond football, they announced a partnership with the tennis ATP Tour and golf's PGA Tour.

The 2026 World Cup will start on June 11, with Mexico taking on South Africa, and finish with the final on July 19.

World Cup

Video clips of World Cup games will be broadcast live on TikTok this summer, FIFA said on Thursday.

The collaboration between world football's governing body and the short video-based social media platform will last until the end of 2026 in an attempt to bring fans “closer to the action” with more “relatable perspectives”.

In addition to the live broadcasting of parts of games, FIFA announced that they will provide access to press conferences and training sessions to a select group of creators for fan content, with the app's global head of content saying people are “42 per cent more likely to tune in to live matches after watching sports content on TikTok”.

Match ticket information and “gamification features”, such as filters and stickers, to enhance engagement, will also be available.

“This is an innovative and creative collaboration that will connect more fans across the globe to the FIFA World Cup in unprecedented ways, bringing them behind the curtain and closer to the action than ever before,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said.

“As football grows and evolves — uniting an increasing number of people — so should the way it is shared and promoted.”

The 48-team tournament will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

U.S. President Donald Trump had expressed a desire to ban TikTok during his first term in office to resolve national security concerns. In 2024, U.S. Congress passed legislation to address this as lawmakers from both parties believed the app could blackmail Americans or influence elections.

In December of last year, however, TikTok's chief executive announced they had signed an agreement which has been blessed by Trump, who declared he is “saving” the app.



TikTok, which announced reaching a billion users in 2021, has collaborated in this way for sports tournaments before, notably for the 2023 Women's World Cup which was the first official collaboration with FIFA. Midway through the tournament the official hashtag had 1.8 billion views and similarly featured selected creators, who were able to earn money from their content.

TikTok has also collaborated with Burnley Women, the Women's European Championship, the Club World Cup and the Women's Super League in Bangladesh. Beyond football, they announced a partnership with the tennis ATP Tour and golf's PGA Tour.

The 2026 World Cup will start on June 11, with Mexico taking on South Africa, and finish with the final on July 19.

HERRIMAN, Utah (Thursday January 8, 2026) - U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player January training camp to be held at the Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif that includes Utah Royals starting goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn. As the January training camp falls outside a FIFA competition window, Hayes named a roster made up entirely of players from the National Women's Soccer League.

McGlynn was selected for multiple rosters with the U.S. Women's National Team throughout the 2025 season and continues that streak, selected for the 26-player roster by Head Coach Emma Hayes. Through consistent excellence at the club and international levels, McGlynn has secured regular selection to the U.S. Women's National Team, continuing to influence the program both on and off the pitch as the 2027 FIFA World Cup approaches.

The USWNT squad is set to play two matches in California against Paraguay on Saturday January 24th at 3:30 pm MT on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo and Peacock in Spanish before taking on Chile Tuesday January 27th at 8 pm MT on TBS and HBO Max in English, Universo and Peacock in Spanish.

The Latest | Jan 08, 2026

KANSAS CITY (Jan. 8, 2026) — Four Kansas City Current players have been called up to the first United States Women's National Team (USWNT) training camp of 2026, as announced by U.S. Soccer on Thursday. Midfielders Claire Hutton and Lo'eau LaBonta, defender Izzy Rodriguez and forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor are on the 26-person roster.

The camp will run Jan. 17-27 at Dignity Health Sports Park (DHSP) in Carson, Calif., and two international friendlies will be played. The first will be at DHSP against Paraguay on Saturday, Jan. 24, at 4:30 p.m. CT while the second will take place at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara at 9 p.m. CT on Tuesday, Jan. 27. The Paraguay contest will air on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English while the match vs. Chile will broadcast on TBS and HBO Max. Both games will be on Universo, Peacock and Futbol de Primera radio in Spanish as well as Westwood One radio in English.

After featuring in the Futures Camp a year ago, Hutton received her first senior national team call-up for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup and has since appeared in all five subsequent camps. This marks the third senior team invitation for both LaBonta and Rodriguez. Sentnor's initial USWNT call-up was in November 2024 and she has been called into all but one senior camp since.

Hutton's first USWNT appearance was in the SheBelieves Cup last year when she started against Australia and played 70 minutes, and she has seen significant minutes in each call-up since. She logged a full match against Ireland on June 26 before she registered her first career assist in another friendly with the Irish on June 29. Three days later, the 19-year-old notched her first international goal in the 36th minute in a 3-0 rout of Canada. She most recently played every minute in both friendlies with Italy during the final camp of 2025.

LaBonta's first appearance for the Stars and Stripes was on May 31, 2025, when she came on as a substitute in the 70th minute to help the team to a 3-0 win against China PR. She became the oldest player to debut for the USWNT in the program's 40-year history at 32 years old. She then subbed in during the 58th minute in a 4-0 shutout over Jamaica on June 3. During her second camp, she entered the match vs. Portugal on Oct. 26 in the 86th minute before playing 23 minutes against New Zealand at CPKC Stadium a few days later.

Rodriguez's consistent performances during the 2025 NWSL season prompted her to receive her first senior team call-up during the summer FIFA window. She made her debut on June 29 in a 4-0 shutout over Ireland, finding the back of the net in the 42nd minute to become the 23rd player in the USWNT's 40-year history to score in their first cap. She was part of the starting lineup in that match and logged a full 90 minutes. The defender was also called into the final camp of 2025 but did not see action in either friendly.

Sentnor earned her first senior team cap in November 2024 vs. England at Wembley Stadium. Her breakthrough came at the 2025 SheBelieves Cup where she finished the tournament with two goals and an assist, including a goal in her first start on Feb. 20 against Colombia to become the first U.S. player to score her first USWNT goal in the SheBelieves Cup Tournament. Her first brace in a U.S. uniform was in a friendly with Jamaica on June 3. Sentnor was named the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year.

Bay FC Communications

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Jan. 8, 2026) – U.S. Soccer announced today that Bay FC goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz has been selected to participate in the upcoming U.S. Women's National Team January training camp from Jan. 17-28. Silkowitz will join the USWNT for training and friendlies in Carson and Santa Barbara, Calif. as the U.S. hosts Paraguay Jan. 24 and Chile Jan. 27.  

Silkowitz's invitation is the second of her career at the senior international level, coming on the heels of her first senior call-up in November 2025. Her selection followed a standout NWSL campaign for Bay FC that saw her rank fifth among all goalkeepers in saves, record four shutouts and win e.l.f. Cosmetics Save of the Week four times on a league-best 12 nominations. She earned her first selection to a national team program at any level in May, representing the U-23 Women's National Team as an overage player for training and matches in Germany.  

The USWNT will close this month's camp with two friendly matches, hosting Paraguay Jan. 24 at Dignity Health Sports Park (2:30 p.m. PT on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo and Peacock in Spanish, on Westwood One radio in English and on Futbol de Primera radio in Spanish) before traveling north to face Chile Jan. 27 at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara, Calif. (7 p.m. PT on TBS and HBO Max in English, Universo and Peacock in Spanish, and on the radio in English on Westwood One and in Spanish on Futbol de Primera). 

The full USWNT roster named by Head Coach Emma Hayes features 26 players, all of which represent NWSL Clubs. Silkowitz is one of three goalkeepers selected to the roster and one of five players on the squad yet to make their senior national team debut.

It seems not all base camps in the Kansas City area are viewed the same by international soccer powerhouses.

When the 48 teams arrive in the United States, Mexico and Canada ahead of the 2026 World Cup, they'll travel to their home away from home before playing a match.

That's the purpose of a World Cup base camp. It's a place where the players can practice and get acquainted to the steamy weather.

Kansas City has three base camp options: Compass Mineral Sporting Fields, where Sporting Kansas City practices; the KC Women's Soccer Training Complex for the KC Current; and the University of Kansas' facilities and Rock Chalk Park.

Pam Kramer, the president of KC2026, said each nation had to give FIFA its top five base-camp choices by Monday. By the end of January, FIFA will assign the base-camp locations, stepping in to settle any disputes over a location.

Location and FIFA rankings will be two key ways to determine which country gets its first choice. That's important following the news that Argentina reportedly is eying Kansas City for its base camp.

Argentina is ranked second in the world by FIFA, one spot behind Spain, which is leaning toward Chicago or Atlanta for a base camp, according to a report in Spain. And Argentina plays a group-stage match at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.

That's bad news for England and coach Thomas Tuchel. Following last month's World Cup draw, The Guardian reported “Tuchel had cleared an FA (Football Association) plan for England to be based in ­Kansas after a pre-tournament ­training camp in Fort Lauderdale, but after the draw ... there are concerns that the Netherlands will be allocated their chosen facility at ­Sporting Kansas City, a ­high-performance centre used by US Soccer.”

The Netherlands also play one of their three group-stage matches at Arrowhead Stadium. But the Netherlands hasn't picked a base camp site yet.

The Guardian story said the World Cup draw was “potentially pitting the FA against the Netherlands and Argentina for bases in the tournament's south‑central region. ... The FA is understood to be exploring alter­natives on the east coast.”

England likely would have stuck with Kansas City if FIFA gave them the first option.

England, which is fourth in FIFA's world rankings, plays group-stage matches in Arlington, Texas; Foxborough, Massachusetts; and East Rutherford, New Jersey.

While England seems to have preferred Sporting Kansas City's training site, it is not known why Tuchel would not consider the KC Current or Rock Chalk Park options for a base camp.

In 1934 and 1978, Fifa's big event was given over to authoritarian aims. There's no more doubt that 2026 will be the same

By 1934, it was entirely evident what Benito Mussolini was up to. Italy's dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup, managing it with a heavy hand and even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn't sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of the decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.

It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla's military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power through systematic detention, torture and murder. Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.

“At last, the world can see the true face of Argentina,” said Fifa president João Havelange at the opening ceremony, newly decorated with a medal from Videla.

Argentina spared no expense in putting on its World Cup, even though the total cost was a state secret. But the right-wing government also didn't bother to slow the pace at which it disappeared political dissidents and opponents. Germany captain Berti Vogts proclaimed that “Argentina is a country where order reigns. I haven't seen a single political prisoner,” though, so no matter.

When Vladimir Putin presided over the opening ceremony to the 2018 World Cup, it had been four years since his forces annexed Crimea from Ukraine and he backed pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas region. Fifa didn't mind.

The problematic nature of these events may have been obvious at the time, but took some time to be fully acknowledged; for there to be no mistaking the actions and intentions of the host government. Years from now, when we look back on the geopolitical context of the 2026 World Cup – shared with Canada and Mexico but hogged by the United States – we'll likely place it in the same category as those others. Hopefully, we have perfect clarity, and this edition of the World Cup will take its place among the most shameful incarnations of the quadrennial tournament.

This conclusion was crystalized by last week's forceful and bloody abduction of the sitting president of Venezuela and his wife, before US president Donald Trump announced that the socialist state was now effectively an American-run territory.

That was, of course, after Trump, or his henchmen, softened their support for Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia; literally blew boats out of the water on mere suspicion of drug trafficking; threatened to invade Mexico and annex Canada (their World Cup co-hosts!), Greenland and the Panama canal; and started a trade war with, well, basically everybody, disrupting the global economy.

We don't yet know how far this administration, which promised isolationism but has instead delivered geopolitical mayhem, will go in a foreign policy that lacks any coherence beyond the governing assumption that it can do whatever it feels like. But it's clear that it may just be getting started.

Still, the World Cup will proceed. Fifa president Gianni Infantino has been immovable in his support for Trump. Unlike Havelange and Videla, the medals and fake awards are going in the other direction.

It's been some time since we had a World Cup without reasonable controversy. The 2010 and 2014 editions in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, were widely panned locally for the strain they put on nations with far more pressing needs. And yet those legitimate complaints seem quaint compared to the 2022 tournament in Qatar, acquired under well-documented corruption and leading directly to many deaths and human rights abuses. The 2030 tournament will inevitably grow notorious for spreading the thing out over three continents, greatly increasing the environmental impact and giving the lie to any claims Fifa once made of caring for the climate. And then there's the 2034 World Cup, which has already been signed over to the Saudi Arabia's strongman de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman.

The US-dominated World Cup fits neatly into this run. This nation isn't presently in a position to lecture anybody else on human rights – nor has it ever been. The Qataris and Saudis are sportswashing outliers no longer. This is just what the World Cup is now: a convenient vehicle for carrying the aims of dangerously self-interested people.

Perhaps some kind of boycott movement from fans toward Fifa events will gather steam, although the slow slide of acceptance to where we are suggests otherwise. One didn't come off before Qatar, either, in spite of a lot of noise. It's doubtful such a boycott would accomplish much by way of embarrassing the men, and the odd woman, who have killed off the parts of themselves that once felt shame anyway.

Soccer has fully gone the way of the Olympics and Formula One, which long ago made their peace with whatever sordid baggage came attached to the highest bidder for their events.

And when the story is told of how the World Cup fully and finally lost its way, they will point to the 2026 edition, played in Canada and Mexico and – problematically, embarrassingly, irredeemably – these United States.

Few U.S. men's national team players, current or former, are better qualified to talk about the World Cup than Clint Dempsey.

After all, he is the only American player to have scored in three tournaments. Deuce, as he is known by friends and teammates, is second only to Landon Donovan in career goals in the world's great spectacle (five to four).

So, when Dempsey, who has become a spokesman for Unilever for the World Cup, talks about the greatest show on earth, we should listen.

In the two of the three World Cups that the 42-year-old forward appeared in, the U.S. men's national team qualified for the knockout round. After failing to move on in 2006, the Americans reached the Round of 16.

In 1994, the U.S. registered a 1-1-1 mark and four points to keep its hopes alive, avoiding becoming the first host side to fail to get out of the group stage in one piece. Eight years later in 2002, South Africa made history by not booking a spot beyond the first round.

 Defining success

The USA cannot afford not to duplicate what the South African team accomplished, the National Soccer Hall of Famer said.

“I'm not going to put a ceiling on what is going to be success for them, but I will put a floor in terms of what will be a disaster,” Dempsey said in a recent interview. “There's more national teams, more teams being in this World Cup. I think it's diluted the quality of the World Cup. In my opinion, it's made the group stage not as exciting. You're having eight third-place teams being able to get out of the group. So, if you're not able to get out of the group in this World Cup, I think that that would be a failure, for sure.

“So, I'm not going to put a ceiling on it. I hope they catch fire at the right time. The last six games, you've kind of seen the improvements. They're undefeated in the last six games, especially with the last result against Uruguay, winning, 5-1. You're seeing more that they're adding to the attack, and you got some exciting friendlies coming up potentially, against Portugal and Germany. I'm looking forward to seeing how they catch fire and get this country believing. Maybe it can be something like what we saw in South Korea [in 2002] from what from the U.S. team in terms of getting to the quarterfinals. But also, what we saw from South Korea in terms of South Korea's being the host country and getting everybody behind him and going on a great run.”

Korea reached the semifinals on its home soil in 2002, losing to Turkey in the third-place match. Still, it was a great run that many U.S. Soccer officials would love to see.

 World Cup effects

There are some soccer officials in this country who feel just hosting the World Cup will boost the sport into a high orbit in this country. Hosting the World Cup in 1994 certainly lifted the U.S. from nothing to something. Two years after welcoming the world, Major League Soccer was born. It just celebrated its 30th season last year.

“I don't know how it's going to transform the sport in the U.S.” Dempsey said. “I mean, I look back at '94. We didn't have the professional league, and it wasn't how the U.S. performed, and the excitement that was around the game because of them getting out of the group with Colombia in it, and the way that they played against Brazil, only losing 1-0. [Brazil] went on to win the World Cup. We were starting to believe again and have a professional league. It gave kids hope that maybe one day they could play soccer professionally and maybe try to play in a World Cup and do what they were able to see.”

A 13-year-old Dempsey was one of those kids in 1994.

“I think having something on home soil right in front of your eyes really inspires the youth, and it inspired me in terms of what this World Cup can bring,” he said. “Hopefully. it's not waiting every four years to move the needle for the game here in the States, I would like to see it every year. It looks like there's more Copa Americas that are starting to be played here. There are talks of it in 2028 maybe being here as well.

“I got to play in one of those. I wish I had had the opportunity to play in more. It's a huge tournament, and it helps bring excitement to the game. So, I just hope that maybe, in terms of domestically, it inspires more kids to take their game to the next level and take it further than the current players have been able to take it. I hope that it moves the needle, and it's more of a mainstream sport every single year.

“Maybe with MLS, it gets rid of the salary cap. Because we see that we're going on the same schedule as the European schedule in terms of dealing with transfers and transfer deadlines, maybe it's a situation where, long as you're within the FIFA financial fair play, then you're able to strengthen your team as much as you want to because of their your ability to be able to do so. So, I think that will allow more players to come to this league in their prime.”

 Big expectations of Pulisic

Speaking or players in their prime, at the age of 27, Christian Pulisic will be in his prime this June. He needs to have a big tournament if the U.S. wants to acquit itself well.

Dempsey has no worries whether Pulisic will excel because he has come through in just about every competition in which he plays.

“One off, I want to say it's a team effort,” he said. “You need a good team behind you to be successful. But what I will say about Christian in big moments, whether it was World Cup qualifying or we're playing in World Cup or playing in Copa America, he's someone that that steps up and scores your goals and gets you assists. So, I'm not worried about what he'll be able to do on the pitch as long as he's healthy. I think he's one of those difference makers. We were lucky to have him; I've been really impressed with what he's been able to do at A.C. Milan in Serie A. So, I hope he keeps, keeps on doing what he's been doing.”

With five months until the U.S.'s opening match against Paraguay at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. on June 12, it will come down to every player keeping fight and healthy, like any other national team.

“I just hope our players stay fit,” Dempsey said. “We have our best, 18, best 11 players to go out there and show what we're capable of.”

 Looking at the USMNT

Dempsey was encouraged that Antonee Robinson, an attacking left back who has set up goals for Fulham in the Premier League, returned from a knee injury.

He said that Robinson “will be huge, something that we could definitely use. It's good to see [Folarin] Balogun's fit and playing really well in the Champions League, and also what he's been able to do in the league and also with the national team. And just that competition for spots in that position with Haji Wright and now [Ricardo] Pepe being more fit again. Then you got the likes of Tyler Adams and what he's doing in the Premier League, and Chris Richards as well at Crystal Palace, winning trophies with them and the confidence he's getting. So I'm really excited about this team and what they can do.”

Years ago, American soccer fans were spoiled by the one-two punch of Landon Donovan and Dempsey in the Starting XI. It was pretty devastating as both players are tied for the all-time U.S. men's goal-scoring lead with 57 goals apiece.

Since both retired it, however, it has been difficult to find a consistent partner for Pulisic. You might even liken the search by whoever is the USMNT head coach, to Diogenes walking through the streets of Athens, Greece, searching for an honest man.

“I think Balogun is going to be the number nine that starts, but he does have competition for that spot with Haji Wright and Pepe,” Dempsey said. “But the reason why I like Balogun is just he's the complete player. He can score with both feet. He's good in the air. Can create goals for himself, create goals for others. He has the pace to be able to stretch the field and bring [the ball] when he gets possession, bring others into play. I just think he's someone who has it all. He has confidence. He's playing really well at Monaco in the league and Champions League, getting goals. Most importantly, when he's with the national team, he's getting goals. That's what's exciting to see. I think there's more depth now than there has been in the past in that number nine position. But for me, he gets the nod as being the number nine, but I'm not the coach, and I don't make the decisions, but it feels up to me. That's the guy I would run with.”

Dempsey's legacy

 Playing in three World Cups is a big deal. Becoming the first American to score in three consecutive tournaments is even a bigger deal.

“I'm really proud of it,” Dempsey said. “I'm proud that any tournament that I was in with this national team. If I look back, I think I scored in it, whether it was every [Concacaf] Gold Cup I was a part of, whether it was Copa America, whether it was [FIFA] Confederations Cup, whether it was World Cups. Almost someone that could stand up and be counted. So that's something that's always meant a lot to me. I took take a lot of pride in.”

Dempsey's first taste of the World Cup came at the age of 13, when he watched Mexico 86 and highlights of the competition on a VCR tape, Hero.

“Seeing players like Diego Maradona, [Michel] Platini, seeing Hugo Sanchez, watching Zico, all these different players from these different teams, and seeing the crowds and seeing how passionate they were for their country, that was pretty cool for me to see that people were as passionate about the same sport as me,” he said. “Which was weird growing up in Texas, because I didn't really feel like I related with a lot of people. Most people they're like, ‘Why aren't you playing baseball, basketball or American football?' It wasn't one of those things that people really believed until after you saw the '94 World Cup and saw this country kind of get behind that team that, hey, there's more people in this country that are like you.”

Regardless of what level Dempsey played for his country, he was going to make the most of it. He made his World Cup debut at the 2006 tournament in Germany.

“I remember like it was yesterday,” he said. “If I'm being honest with you, I remember playing in the U-20 World Cup and not getting much playing time. I remember playing in the World Cup in 2006 the first game, not getting any playing time against the Czech Republic, and thinking to myself, is this going to be another World Cup like the U20s, where a tournament goes by and I really don't have much of a say.”

Then he got an opportunity to play for Italy, which went on to win its fourth World Cup. The U.S. managed a 1-1 draw with the future champions. In the Americans' 2-1 loss to Ghana in their final group stage match, Dempsey found the net for his first World Cup goal.

Dempsey said that the goal “gave us a little bit of a lifeline, because if we beat Ghana, that we would be able to get out of the group, but we came up short. But it was dream come true for me, it's what I dreamed about as a kid, playing in a World Cup, score in the World Cup, and by being able to do that. It's exactly what I just talked about. I was in January camp in 2006, no one would have bet that I'd have been in the starting lineup for any of those games. And because of hard work and determination and taking advantage of the opportunities I had when I got them, that's what allowed me to do that. So, I hope that there's going to be one or two surprises like that that shake this team up and make a real impact.”

The partnership

Dempsey also talked about his partnership with Unilever.

“What drew me to partnering with Unilever was the opportunity to help fans prepare for FIFA World Cup 26,” he said. This tournament is set to be the biggest yet, and with my home country hosting, it makes this a special moment for me, and so many fans. 

“Unilever helps people feel confident, fresh, and ready for the moments that matter most, especially on game day. Having experienced the FIFA World Cup firsthand as a player, it's exciting to now be part of something that helps fans feel closer and more focused on the action.” 

And there is an opportunity for fans to win World Cup tickets through Unilever.  

“Fans can enter for a chance to win FIFA World Cup 26™ tickets, and other prizes, by purchasing gift packs from Dove Men+Care, Degree, or AXE at major retailers or by visiting UnileverWorldCup26.com,” Dempsey said. “They can win things like watch party experiences, home entertainment upgrades, gaming packages and more. It's a fun and easy way to stay fresh while getting ready for the excitement of the FIFA World Cup 26. 

“This is something fans really don't want to miss. With three countries hosting, FIFA World Cup 26 is going to be incredible. It's more than just the game — it's about the energy, culture and bringing people together around their love of soccer. It's an unforgettable experience.”

Bayern Munich's high profile loss in the battle for former Bayer Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz stung the club and gave its critics an opening to examine why the Germany international became the latest talent to leave the country in favor another league.

In this case, of course, Wirtz chose Liverpool.

Wirtz is not alone, though, several big name players have opted to go abroad in recent years, leading Dwight Yorke to make the determination that the Bavarians just are not the domestic draw to player that they used to be.

Omar Marmoush (Eintracht Frankfurt), Huge Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt), Benjamin Šeško (RB Leipzig), and a host of other players from the Bundesliga have jumped to other leagues after being — at least — loosely linked to Bayern Munich in recent years.

For Yorke, that is a trend.

“I think if you look at German football, all of them wanted to come here (to England), didn't they? All the players outside of Bayern, unique players, every one of them used to run to go to Bayern. They don't want to go to Bayern anymore,” Yorke told FootItalia. “The whole world wants to come here to the Premier League. Omar Marmoush, Florian Wirtz and all these guys. Bayern are interested in getting these players. Bayern used to be like Manchester United in taking the best players from the rest of the league, it's not like that anymore.”

There is at least a bit of context needed as some players who Bayern Munich might have interest in can easily look at depth chart and see a very difficult pathway to consistent playing time or a starting job.

While Yorke is correct in that the Bundesliga does lose some players when Premier League clubs come calling, it is not always about the bright lights on the island that is the big draw. Sometimes, it is just comes down to an excessive salary offer or a much stronger chance for a starting gig.

At Bayern Munich, both of those things can be difficult to get at times.

Antoine Semenyo bid farewell to Bournemouth in the best possible fashion, netting a 95th-minute winner at the Vitality Stadium to end his side's 11-match run without a Premier League win. As his team-mate Marcus Tavernier told Sky Sports, "There was no better way for [his last game] to go. That was the type of stuff you write in movies and no man deserves it more than him."

Semenyo's decisive strike against Spurs also perfectly underlined why Manchester City were so happy to have won what was essentially a 'Big Six' battle to sign the Ghana international. It was the winger's 10th goal of the season - only striking duo Erling Haaland (20) and Igor Thiago (16) have more.

The question, of course, is whether Semenyo's £64 million ($86m) move to Manchester has come too late to save City's title hopes, because while Bournemouth fans were celebrating a vital victory on Wednesday night, the home fans still left inside the Etihad were counting the considerable cost of a desperately disappointing 1-1 draw with Brighton...

After a patchy start to the season, City reached the turn of the year in ominously good form. Pep Guardiola's side won eight games in all competitions between November 29 and December 27 - a fantastic run of results that featured a statement victory over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu.

The six-game winning streak in the Premier League was of far greater significance, though, as it saw City cut Arsenal's advantage at the top of the table to just two points.

However, the lead will increase to eight if the Gunners beat Liverpool at the Emirates on Thursday evening - which looks like something of a formality, given the Reds' regression this season.

So, how have City found themselves in the very unusual position of needing Liverpool to win to boost a faltering title tilt?

City rounding out 2025 with a 2-1 win at the City Ground felt hugely significant. Guardiola's side had had to dig deep to defeat Nottingham Forest, with Rayan Cherki's winning goal arriving with just seven minutes of normal time remaining.

There wasn't a doubt in Guardiola's mind that they would have lost that game last season - which only reinforced his belief that his team was back on track after their trophy-less 2024-25 campaign.

"The critical moment changed in the USA at the Club World Cup," the 54-year-old told TNT Sports, referring to City's humiliating 4-3 last-16 loss to Al-Hilal in Orlando in June. "We looked at ourselves and talked and many things changed from there.

"Now, it is a process. When we won a lot of titles at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and here, you had a lot of games of this type. But the body language, the connection of how we are with the fans - they love the keepers, the strikers, the people, because they feel the team wants to do it, want to fight for each other.

"It's more important in football how you suffer, how you defend, accept you're not playing good and can be better and be in the game, otherwise there is no chance. For a long time the team has wanted to do it and it's the last game of the first leg of the season, so it's good to finish with an important three points."

On TNT Sports, Joe Hart called City's victory at Forest a "championship-winning performance", while midfielder Tijjani Reijnders effectively sent a warning to Arsenal.

"We know a lot of clubs suffer here," the Dutch midfielder said. "From what I heard Nottingham Forest at home is always difficult, and I felt it as well today. So, it's a very important win - and we are on the hunt."

And given City's track record of successful pursuits, it was hard not to fear for Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, a side renowned for falling with the finishing line in sight.

However, the title race could be as good as over eight days into the New Year, with City having drawn their first three games of 2026.

After a scoreless stalemate at Sunderland on January 1, City allowed Chelsea to come away from the Etihad with a point three days later, and Brighton followed suit on Wednesday evening. 

Essentially, in less than a week, all of the momentum built up at the tail end of the year had been thrown away, and Guardiola felt the reason for the incredibly damaging draws was very obvious.

"I like a lot of the way we played," the former Barcelona boss told reporters after the Brighton game. "Many new players and good things - I love that.

"But it was quite similar to the second half against Sunderland. Against Chelsea, maybe we had fewer clear chances, but we missed the passes when it was two against one. And so, we didn't score goals. [We are missing] too many clear chances and it's not just one or two players, it's all the players up front.

"Scoring goals is part of our job when we analyse the game. We played exceptionally well and, in the good moments in the past, [we] always take the chances. [But while] we created a lot of chances in the six yard box, we could not score - and not just one player, everyone. That's why we could not win these games."

However, blaming City's struggles solely on profligacy feels like a clear case of over-simplifying the problem.

Remember, Chelsea fully deserved their draw at the Etihad. Enzo Fernandez's equaliser may not have arrived until the 94th minute but it was just reward for a side that created the only three 'big chances' of the entire game.

As Fabian Hurzeler also pointed out, Brighton were excellent in the first half of Wednesday's game and really should have been ahead before Haaland scored from the penalty spot just before the break.

So, while City boast the second-best defensive record in the Premier League (19 goals conceded in just 21 games), there is an undeniable air of uncertainty surrounding the backline.

Injuries undeniably played their part against Brighton, with both Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias unavailable - along with the perma-crocked John Stones.

It's not in the least bit surprising, then, that City are now seriously considering making a move for Marc Guehi, whose Crystal Palace contract expires at the end of the season.

Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has already made it clear that his captain won't come cheap but City are desperate and, after wasting a significant sum of money on two players that weren't anywhere near ready for rigours of English football last January (Vitor Reis and Abdukodir Khusanov), they may well feel that £40m ($54m) is a small price to pay for a proven Premier League performer.

With Semenyo's transfer set to be confirmed in the coming hours, also getting Guehi in the door at some point between now and the close of the winter window would go a long way towards addressing City's issues at either end of the field.

Semenyo's mix of pace, physicality and versatility should add another dimension to City's attack, while Guehi now feels like an absolutely essential addition for a back four that looked makeshift even before the injuries to Gvardiol and Dias because of Guardiola's insistence on converting midfielders into full-backs. Indeed, City have proven vulnerable in transitions all season long (the 5-4 win at Fulham is the most glaring case in point) and the obvious hope is that Rodri's return to full match fitness will eventually rectify that particular problem.

However, while adding Semenyo and Guehi would also significantly boost City's Champions League bid, their Premier League challenge might already be over - and Guardiola knows it too.

The Catalan coach cut a frustrated figure on Wednesday evening, even clashing with Hurzeler at one point, and when asked afterwards about his team winning the league, he replied, "If you don't win games, you cannot think about these things." And certainly not with Arsenal seemingly going from strength to strength at precisely the time we thought they might start exhibiting signs of weakness.

So, while Semenyo and Guehi would be game-changing signings for City, it might actually be a case of too little, too late in terms of the title race.

Perhaps Ole Gunnar Solskjaer should have listened to Kieran McKenna when he learned of the possibility of Cristiano Ronaldo returning to Manchester United in 2021. Many Red Devils' fans had dreamed about Ronaldo coming back to Old Trafford for more than a decade, and the prospect of him playing under another iconic player from United's past was the ultimate hit for nostalgia junkies.

Solskjaer had witnessed Ronaldo's rise as a teenager at Old Trafford up close and he understandably jumped at the thought of the multiple Ballon d'Or winner leading his attack. But the now-Ipswich Town boss McKenna was concerned.

"'How are we going to defend ourselves?' That's the first thing he [McKenna] says," Solskjaer recalled to Norwegian podcast NRK.

No one else at the club wanted to listen to McKenna though, what with all the shirts the club was about to sell, the commercial prospects and the social media frenzy that was building. But with the benefit of hindsight, Solskjaer wishes he had listened to his trusty assistant.

"It was probably a wrong choice for all of us," he admitted. "But we felt it was the right decision then and there."

While Ronaldo's return initially unleashed a wave of euphoria at Old Trafford and he scored plenty of goals in his first season back, he also blew up everything that Solskjaer had been building. The Norwegian's three-year spell in charge of United is often remembered for how it ended, and yet his tenure also witnessed incredible highs. The football, for example, was also the most exciting it has been under any manager since Sir Alex Ferguson. 

And so while many rival fans might be sniggering at the prospect of Solskjaer returning to the United dugout more than four years after he was sacked, his second coming can be a success - as long as he doesn't get taken in by hubris again.

Ronaldo's signing came out of the blue, so much so that one senior United staff member was ordered by Ed Woodward to immediately end his family holiday and head straight back to Manchester to prepare for the announcement. Solskjaer didn't have too long to think about it either. Not that he needed to.

"It was a very quick decision," Solskjaer told the Stick to Footballpodcast. "When it became apparent that he was leaving Juventus, obviously there were other clubs that wanted him – but I was excited. They asked me, 'Would you want us to try this?'. I said yes – obviously we know Cristiano is quality, and he's 37, but we have to manage – he's the best goal-scorer in the world."

United had made a good start to the 2021-22 season, thrashing Leeds 5-1 on the first day while taking seven points from their first three games. Ronaldo had a near perfect debut, too, as he scored twice in a 4-1 win over Newcastle at an ecstatic Old Trafford. But the drawbacks of his return could be seen in the very next game as United were beaten 2-1 by Young Boys in the Champions League.

Ronaldo scored again in a 2-1 win at West Ham, but United lost five of their next seven league games, with Solskjaer sacked after losing 4-1 at Watford in mid-November.

Ronaldo did score important goals in the Champions League which prevented things from getting even worse, but those strikes could not hide the fact that the team had become completely unbalanced by him.

Solskjaer admitted: "We started off straight away thinking, 'how we are going to press and change the little tweaks?'. With the ball, with him in the team, it was no problem. Without him [pressing], we had to change a little bit the different roles we'd gotten used to. We were one of the highest pressing teams before."

While Solskjaer thought that Ronaldo understood the need to be rotated due to his age, the reality was that on the rare occasion that the manager did leave the Portuguese out of the starting line-up, there was a massive backlash. When Ronaldo was on the bench against Everton, Ferguson was seen telling UFC fighter and United fan Khabib Nurmagomedov: "You should always start with your best players."

The incident undermined Solskjaer's authority and underlined the sense that Ronaldo's return had led United to descend into a circus act. 

"Cristiano – when you know him and speak to him, he wanted to play three out of four games, he realised he's getting older as well. But when you leave him out once, he's not happy!" Solskjaer recalled. "I've thought a lot about this... The right thing was to sign Cristiano. But, I think it would've turned out better for Cristiano and for us if he hadn't signed."

It was not just Ronaldo's sauntering pace that was a problem. Soon after his arrival, Solskjaer sensed a drop in morale across the squad.

He told The Athletic: "When you have a group, you need everyone to pull in the same direction. When things didn't go right, you could see certain players and egos came out. Things had soured, the collective had been lost and that's not Man United, where teams are built on the collective. Some players felt they should've played more and weren't constructive to the environment."

Ronaldo's return was a sliding doors moment for Solskjaer's United, but the sour end does not change the fact that the Norwegian remains the club's longest-serving manager since Ferguson left after achieving the best results in the Premier League. In his two full seasons in charge, the team finished third and then second, meaning Solskjaer is the only manager since Ferguson to achieve successive top-four finishes. He brought a smile back to United after Jose Mourinho had darkened the mood and allowed players to believe in themselves again.

That's how Nemanja Matic remembers him. "I felt sorry because Ole was a great guy and we were on the way to doing something big," he told FourFourTwo. "I wasn't his first choice in the midfield and never liked a coach when I didn't play - I'd fight with them. But Ole was the first coach I didn't fight with. He brought the players who weren't in the starting XI together. He knew the club and the fans loved him.

"We finished second and third under him. There was an atmosphere in the team that we weren't happy finishing second, but when you see the results now, we did amazingly. I think Ole deserved more time - and when I say Ole, I also want to mention his staff, like Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna. They were going the right way to bring United back."

Marcus Rashford was also highly complimentary of Solskjaer. "Ole is a fantastic person," he said. "I loved playing under him. I can speak for many of the players at Manchester United when I say that we enjoyed playing for him."

Contrast the positivity players felt for Solskjaer with the negative atmosphere Ruben Amorim created with his outspoken remarks about the squad. Solskjaer is a unifier and he brought instant results, with United winning 14 of their first 17 matches. He had a similar impact when he became coach of Besiktas, winning eight of his first 12 games, including thrashing Athletic Club 4-1 and beating local rivals Galatasaray.

There are doubts about Solskjaer's tactical acumen but, as Amorim's tenure demonstrates, players at massive clubs do not always cope well with being given too many instructions. Solskjaer's counter-attacking style is simple and it is easy to imagine Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo thriving under him. Nor should it be forgotten that Bruno Fernandes' most productive period as a United player, his 26 goals and 19 assists in his first two seasons, came when Solskjaer was in charge.

As well as agreeing to take Ronaldo back, Solskjaer's biggest mistake was thinking that United could play as equals against Manchester City and Liverpool in his final few weeks in charge. Their two biggest rivals destroyed almost every other side that season, amassing 93 and 92 points, respectively, and Solskjaer was naive not to set his side up differently. 

Liverpool thrashed United 5-0 while City simply passed them into oblivion in a 2-0 loss which felt almost as hopeless as the battering by Jurgen Klopp's side. He subsequently told Stick to Football: "Those two home games, I always looked at them as we need to be Manchester United. Don't defend, don't be counter-attacking, just let the players go out there, go toe-to-toe with them because otherwise there's no point being at Manchester United. You've got to, at some point take the next step – and they weren't ready. Just not good enough."

Solskjaer's United were at their best when they played to their strengths, and if he learns from the mistakes of his first spell, he can bring the joy back to a club that lately has been starved of hope.

Barcelona manager Hansi Flick has admitted he is uncertain about Robert Lewandowski's future at the club beyond this summer, casting doubt on the veteran striker's long-term status. The comments came after a stunning 5-0 demolition of Athletic Club in the Spanish Super Cup, a match where the Polish international was surprisingly left among the substitutes.

The celebrations following Barcelona's emphatic 5-0 victory over Athletic Club in Jeddah have been accompanied by fresh questions regarding the hierarchy of the squad. While the Catalan giants produced a devastating attacking performance to book their place in Sunday's final, they did so without their most recognisable goalscorer in the starting line-up.

Lewandowski, who has been the focal point of the Blaugrana attack since his arrival, was restricted to a watching brief for the majority of the encounter. Flick opted to rotate his side, a decision that was vindicated by the result but one that has inevitably fuelled speculation about the 37-year-old's standing at the Camp Nou.

When pressed on whether Lewandowski would still be leading the line for the club next season, Flick offered a candid but non-committal response that hinted at potential changes in the summer.

“If you ask about next season, I don't know. I'm happy with Lewandowski and his work. He's at a good level,” Flick told reporters during his post-match press conference.

Lewandowski's contract expires at the end of the season and there has been much speculation regarding his future, with teams from Saudi Arabia said to be lining up bids for him. Meanwhile, AC Milan reportedly aim to unite him with ex-Real Madrid star Luka Modric and other teams are expected to come in for the Poland international.

The ex-Bayern Munich striker cast doubt on his future recently, saying at the end of December: "I still have time to make a decision. Right now, I don't know where I want to play. There's no need to think about it yet. I don't know which direction to take, but I don't have any pressure.

"I am not talking to the coach about interested clubs. It's not about cutting my salary in half. A lot depends on the club's plan and what I want."

Flick also addressed concerns surrounding Lamine Yamal, who was on the bench in the Spanish Super Cup clash against Athletic Club on Wednesday before being introduced in the 72nd minute.

While the German coach confirmed his absence from the starting XI was down to a fitness complaint, he insisted there is no reason to worry about the teenager.

“He has had some discomfort in recent days, he had not been able to train and that is why he was not in the eleven. But he is okay,” Flick said.

The match itself saw Barcelona record a comprehensive 5-0 win over their Basque opponents. The result stands as one of the team's largest margins of victory in the current campaign. The performance came shortly after the Catalan derby against Espanyol, a match which Flick referenced in his post-match analysis.

The manager contrasted the display against Athletic Club with the team's showing in that previous fixture.

“For me always, my thought is the next game. But I appreciate what we did today because against Espanyol we hadn't been good,” Flick stated. “I like that we play as a team, together. It's fantastic to win 5-0. But it's only one game and the final will be different.”

Flick also spoke at length about the defensive aspect of the performance. While the five goals garnered attention, the German coach highlighted the clean sheet as a significant factor in the result.

“Today we managed to be in control. We needed a few minutes to start working, then we played well. I'm happy because we controlled the game well. We kept the ball and I like that we defended until the end to keep a clean sheet,” Flick explained.

Barca will be eagerly awaiting the result of the semi-final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid on Thursday to determine who they will meet in the final.

The Delaware native is doing everything he can to ensure U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino takes notice ahead of the World Cup later this year. 

Mark McKenzie needed November. 

When he returned to the Philly area for the U.S. men's national team's penultimate game of 2025 against Paraguay, it was a homecoming that he said grounded him. 

Groomed in the Union's academy system and having spent three seasons as a homegrown player on the club's first team, it marked the first occasion in quite some time McKenzie, a native of Bear, Del., returned to his old grounds. 

Well, they were technically all-new grounds, considering that when he came up the ranks, Subaru Park was named Talen Energy Stadium, and the sprawling expanse that is now the WSFS Sportsplex was still a rendering. 

But being back, seeing familiar faces, training with the national team in Chester, and even briefly seeing a few family members brought perspective to what he's ultimately trying to do: find his name among 25 other hopefuls eager to make the American roster ahead of June's FIFA men's World Cup.

At the time, McKenzie, 26, noted that packing in all of that perspective was part of a “business trip,” one that has continued under the watchful eye of U.S. men's coach Mauricio Pochettino as the starting center back for Toulouse, in France's first division. 

“It's always special coming back to Philly,” McKenzie said following the U.S. win against Paraguay at Subaru Park on Nov. 15. “I saw some old friends, my family came by the hotel, and just that time to take a little stroll and grab a bite to eat reminded me of who's been behind me on this journey, and who I'm playing for.”

Playing time has been consistent for McKenzie, who has appeared in 17 league matches for Toulouse this season, starting 16 at center back. That bodes well, as Pochettino has repeatedly noted that consistency in match play is a plus in his eyes. And considering there's not a clear early favorite as the No. 2 center back on the field for the Americans, McKenzie has to know that his chances are as good as anyone's.

“The biggest thing is controlling what I can control,” McKenzie said. “Sure, I think about that stuff, but ultimately it's not up to me. That's my mentality, my attitude going into my performances.”

Defensively, McKenzie is taking control of a Toulouse team that is eighth in the Ligue 1 standings, just two spots outside of qualifying for the UEFA Europa League next season. There's still plenty of time for McKenzie and the team to climb before the season concludes in May, though it will take a better run than the seven points out of a possible 15 the club has collected in its last five league matches. 

“Going back to my [home] club [in Toulouse], that's where a lot of the hard work is done,” he said. “So I'm just handling myself in those ways, and just not trying to worry about the things outside my control. My job is to keep getting selected for my club, play well, and hope it's enough to prove that I deserve the opportunity to represent my country.” 

Trying to qualify for the second-ever men's World Cup in the United States isn't the only thing on McKenzie's mind. Last October he became a dad, and he is trying to find the balance between those early days of fatherhood, his responsibilities to his club, and staying on Pochettino's radar.

It seemingly worked out as McKenzie was called up for every U.S. camp in the  fall cycle in October and November. In October, he told CBS Sports that the birth of his son made him feel like he had “more to play for.” 

And even though his baby wasn't old enough to understand the rigors McKenzie is going through, having his son while going through this process appeared to mean the world to the center back. 

“He can't really hold his head up right now, and he's not really watching …,” joked McKenzie on CBS Sports' Morning Footy show in October, “but when we look back on these moments, this is something that I'll cherish forever; just to say that he's out there watching his daddy play is something that I'll hold dear to my heart.”

If fate has its way, McKenzie would be one of four players in the U.S. player pool who came up in the Union's academy system or spent time on the club's first team who could find themselves on the World Cup roster. 

Currently, that list includes Medford's Brenden Aaronson, Wayne native Matt Freese, and Media's Auston Trusty, the latter also vying for a spot along the back line. Each player has been invited to recent camps, and there's a belief that one, if not all, has a good chance to crack Pochettino's World Cup squad.

But there's still time before that happens. Six months, to be exact — meaning all McKenzie can do is focus on the now. 

After all, it is the only thing in his control. 

“Look, I'm trying to make the decision as difficult as possible [for the U.S. coaching staff],” he said. “I only do that by being at my best when I'm with my club and making the most of my opportunities when I get them. I just plan to do what I do and showcase my talent to the best of my ability, and hope that's enough.”

It was almost grimly predictable. When news broke that the United States military had attacked Venezuela on Saturday, there wasn't even a flicker of activity among the Fifa Council, according to senior sources.

This is despite the primary host of their grand global event launching what is a rare act of aggression for a country staging the World Cup, with the president even talking in a concerning manner about a co-host.  In the aftermath of the Venezuela attacks, Donald Trump spoke about how his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum, is “very frightened of the cartels” and that “something is going to have to be done with Mexico”.

Folarin Balogun says that Mauricio Pochettino has ensured that no U.S. men's national team players feel their place is guaranteed, which only makes the Monaco striker's recent goals feel all the more important. After missing much of 2025 with injury issues, Balogun returned to full fitness in the fall and has been scoring for club and country.

Throughout much of 2025, his first full year as USMNT boss, Pochettino stressed that the door was wide open for anyone and everyone to fight for World Cup spots. That message was only further reinforced following the USMNT's thrashing of Uruguay to close 2025, with Pochettino hitting back at the media over the concept of the team having "regulars" in the player pool.

The message has been heard loud and clear, Balogun says. The striker position is almost always determined by form anyway, but given the culture developed by Pochettino, Balogun says the entire USMNT is feeling the pressure to perform in these final few months before the World Cup.

"I think you have to give credit to Pochettino and his staff," the striker told FIFA. "They have created an atmosphere where nobody feels like their place is guaranteed. I think that is the most important thing you can do when you have such a big pool of players like the USA does. It was easy for maybe some guys who didn't get previously called up to almost psychologically go into a place where you don't feel like you can get picked, you don't feel like your domestic league warrants you getting picked for the national team because that's what you've been shown before.

"But Pochettino has come in with a completely new philosophy and if he thinks someone is playing well and is playing in a division like Major League Soccer then he will pick them. That is a wake-up call for everybody, and naturally, that will get a reaction, but he's also been able to add the smartness and the tactician side to it, and I think both sides are gelling together.

Balogun has been a mainstay in the Monaco XI for much of this season, making his mark in both Ligue 1 and the Champions League. He has four goals and two assists in 848 Ligue 1 minutes while also scoring in each of his last three Champions League appearances for the club. In addition, Balogun has thrived for the USMNT since returning this fall, finding the back of the net in each of his three starts to close 2025.

"I'm content," he said. "I'm still looking to be a lot more decisive in those games. I know I have the opportunity to make a bigger impact in those types of games. But I've scored three in the last three, and this is my first year playing in the Champions League being a starter consistently. I'm able to contribute with important goals that are helping us win games and help us potentially progress to the next round. I'm definitely content, but I definitely want to strive for more."

It's been an up-and-down season for Monaco, who currently sit ninth in Ligue 1 following a loss to Lyon this past weekend. Up next, though, is a French Cup game against US Orleans on Saturday before a league clash with Lorient on Jan. 16. Then comes the big test: the return to the Champions League and a visit to Real Madrid on January 20.

The USMNT, meanwhile, will be back in action in March for their final two friendlies before Pochettino selects his World Cup roster. Those friendles will see the U.S. take on Portugal and Belgium in Atlanta.

...

The U.S. men's national soccer team is now in a World Cup year, which means players are angling for a place on Mauricio Pochettino's 26-man squad. First, though, they will aim to get themselves on the roster for the March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta.

A call-up to the last training camp before Pochettino selects his World Cup team in late May will not come with summer guarantees. Nor will missing out in March preclude selection to the tournament.

Over the next two-plus months, though, Pochettino and his staff will keep a close eye on club performances before sending out invitations. Barring injury, most of the regulars are assured of making the list. Several candidates, however, would bolster their case with strong recitals in European leagues, Major League Soccer and Mexico's Liga MX.

Here are 10 players with the most to gain:

Back in PSV Eindhoven's starting lineup and bubbling with confidence, the Texas-born striker is poised to move up the U.S. depth chart. With Pepi out of the U.S. picture until the end of 2025 — due to injuries and club playing time — Monaco's Folarin Balogun strengthened his top-man status and Coventry City's Haji Wright proved a worthy back-up.

Pepi, who will turn 23 on Friday, is in great form with goals in five of his past six PSV appearances and five goals and two assists in the seven matches before the winter break. Across all club competitions, he has 10 goals and three assists in 21 games. He is also a hot commodity on the transfer market, with PSV reportedly turning down a $35 million offer from Premier League side Fulham.

The enigmatic midfielder bolstered his U.S. status with superb performances in the November window — his first call-up since March. But to help remain in Pochettino's good graces and stay in the World Cup mix, the 23-year-old must continue earning starts for Mönchengladbach, the Bundesliga club he joined from Borussia Dortmund over the summer.

A sub most of the first several months, Reyna started the last four matches before the winter break and received mixed reviews. He has yet to record a goal or assist this season.

Though he has never played for the U.S. team, the 19-year-old center back remains an intriguing character as the World Cup approaches. The Hawaiian-born German American received his first senior call-up in September but did not get into either friendly. Having started almost every game since early October for Augsburg in the Bundesliga, Banks shouldn't be overlooked.

Pochettino's center back corps is not set in stone. He has used Crystal Palace's Chris Richards, Charlotte's Tim Ream, Cincinnati's Miles Robinson, Toulouse's Mark McKenzie and Celtic's Auston Trusty. (Toronto FC's Walker Zimmerman and Vancouver's Tristan Blackmon are also in the pool, and Celtic's Cameron Carter-Vickers is recovering from an Achilles' tendon injury.)

If relying solely on his club portfolio, the 24-year-old center midfielder should be a U.S. regular. In the past two years, he has moved from Brazil's Internacional to Spain's Real Betis and attracted interest from England's Tottenham Hotspur before leaping to Atlético Madrid last summer on a $35 million transfer.

But injuries have hampered his ascent and, oddly, he has never played very well for the national team. His most recent appearances, in the June friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, were forgettable. Regular assignments with Atlético might earn him one last chance with Pochettino.

The 6-foot-4 Connecticut native took a bit of risk last summer by leaving a certain role in MLS for the uncertainties of the English Championship. Had he sat on Derby County's bench, Agyemang would have lost all World Cup hope.

But he has adapted well, recording six goals and three assists in 19 starts, including a two-goal effort against Sheffield Wednesday last month. A good run over the next two months would keep him in contention for a March call-up.

The only Liga MX candidate under serious consideration, the clever, Mexican-born winger has been terrific for Club América and shown flashes of brilliance for the national team. His volleyed goal against Japan in September was all class. However, he withdrew from the October camp with a knee injury and wasn't called up a month later.

Reduced playing time in San Diego last season damaged his U.S. standing, but with a move to Charlotte this offseason, the 27-year-old central midfielder with 32 caps could reenter the conversation. Like most MLS players, though, he will not have much time to make his case: The regular season doesn't start until Feb. 21.

Once a mainstay in the U.S. lineup – 47 caps before he turned 23 – the versatile Musah has faded from the scene since the Nations League finals last March. After joining Atalanta on loan from AC Milan in Serie A this season, he has been used almost exclusively as a sub. His minutes have picked up recently, hinting at a larger role down the stretch.

While Pochettino and U.S. fans have all but given up on the Norwich City striker, there is always that possibility Sargent goes on a crazy scoring surge. After all, he has scored 52 goals the past 3 ½ years in England's second division. Even if he did go wild, though, there is little faith in a U.S. uniform: He hasn't scored for his country since November 2019.

Sometimes a change of scenery does wonders, and in the case of this 6-foot-4, 21-year-old striker with six caps, this week's move to Hamburg on loan from Southampton could do the trick. He started once in the English Championship and hadn't played since Nov. 25.

Madison Keys came from a set and 4-2 down in the Brisbane International third round to defeat Diana Shnaider in three tiebreaks -- the first triple-tiebreak scoreline of her career, and the 12th on tour this decade. Jessica Pegula followed her with her second three-set win of the year.

No. 5 seed Madison Keys was pushed to the limit by No. 12 seed Diana Shnaider in a Brisbane International third-round thriller, coming from a set and 4-2 down to squeak through 6-7(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(5) in 2 hours and 59 minutes.

The result was just the 12th triple-tiebreak scoreline on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz this decade, and the first time either Keys or Shnaider had played a match comprising three tiebreaks. Both players received medical timeouts during the contest -- Keys was treated off court after winning the second set, while Shnaider received treatment on her left wrist trailing 3-2 in the decider. Keys finished with 38 winners, including nine aces, to Shnaider's 17.

Keys' victory sets up a quarterfinal matchup against No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka -- a rematch of last year's Australian Open final, which the American edged 6-3, 2-6, 7-5. Sabalenka leads the overall head-to-head 5-2, including a 6-0, 6-1 revenge in the Indian Wells semifinals.

"That had a little bit of everything," Keys remarked in her on-court interview. "It's good to start the year off with a little bit of drama -- so glad we got that out of the way. Diana played such a great match, I had to come back and figure out how to get myself back into that match.

"It was trying to stay in every single point, and I knew if I could give myself an opportunity, if I had the chance, then momentum switches so quickly. Really trying to keep the score as close as possible and give myself the best opportunity, then when that opportunity finally came round, to take advantage of that."

Shnaider, who had the edge the longer the pair's baseline battles went on, broke first in each set -- only for Keys to strike back and force a tiebreak. Though Shnaider was too solid in the first set, by the end of the second set the American had cleaned up her more errors and begun to land some forehand blows of her own.

In the third set, showing a greater willingness to approach the net, Keys won the longest consecutive streak of games in the match as she won three in a row to lead 3-1. From that point on, the dynamic switched, and it was the reigning Australian Open champion who had to hold off her opponent's fightback. Down 5-4, Shnaider saved the first two match points against her with service winners, but Keys' volleying prowess proved key in snatching victory in the tiebreak.

Keys improved to 3-0 overall against Shnaider, having also won in the 2024 Miami second round and 2025 Queen's quarterfinals.

Keys was followed on Show Court 1 by compatriot Jessica Pegula, who notched yet another three-set victory as she came from 2-0 down in the third set to defeat Dayana Yastremska 5-7, 6-2, 6-3. Thirteen of Pegula's last 15 matches, including both her 2026 outings, have gone the distance; she has won 10 of those.

Yastremska's form oscillated throughout -- the Ukrainian fired 20 winners in the first set, but just four in the second and 12 in the third while tallying 61 unforced errors overall. Pegula remained steady, resetting after dropping the first set from 5-3 up, and found 18 winners to 26 unforced errors. The former US Open finalist also saved her best for the home stretch, stealing some crucial points from Yastremska with anticipation.

Afterward, Pegula joked about having to wait for Keys to finish her marathon victory.

"At least I didn't go that long," she said while glancing at the 2-hour, 16-minute time on her match clock. "When she won the second set I was like, uh ... But I guess if I'm gonna wait for somebody, I guess it's OK that she won the second set!"

Michael Mmoh continued his statement start to 2026 on Thursday at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open, where he upset familiar foe Karen Khachanov 7-6(2), 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals.

The American qualifier notched just two wins on the ATP Tour in 2025, but with his straight-sets victory over the fourth-seeded Khachanov, he has already matched that number in the first week of the new season. It marked Mmoh's first win over a Top 20 opponent since 2023, when he also moved past Khachanov at the US Open.

“Funnily enough, my first ITF junior win was against Karen Khachanov, so we've been battling from the age of 14,” said Mmoh, who now leads World No. 17 Khachanov 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “He's a great guy who's had an unbelievable career, so just to share the court with him, I knew I needed to play at the highest level possible.”

Mmoh, the No. 285 in the PIF ATP Rankings, failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set, but regrouped in a tidy tie-break to advance to his seventh ATP Tour quarter-final. The 27-year-old will next face countryman Marcos Giron, who earlier upset seventh seed and defending champion Alexandre Muller 6-4, 7-6(4).

Earlier, Chinese lefty Shang Juncheng became the first player to reach all three Hong Kong quarter-finals since the ATP 250 returned in 2024. The 20-year-old hit 24 winners in his 6-3, 6-4 victory over fifth seed Lorenzo Sonego.

Shang, who missed six months of the 2025 season due to a foot injury, will next face second seed Alexander Bublik, who opened his 2026 with a laser-focused 6-3, 6-3 win over Botic van de Zandschulp.







Bublik finished 2025 with a 30-9 record since Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, highlighted by titles in Halle, Gstaad and Kitzbuehel. Now at a career-high World No. 11, the Kazakhstani doesn't seem to want to let that form slip as he starts his 2026 quest.
“We tried many things before arriving here,” Bublik said of his preseason. “You never know what's going to happen [in the first match]. We chose a tactic, we stuck to it, and I played well, so I'm really happy with the way I performed.”

It doesn't appear as if Elena Rybakina used the offseason to cool off after her blazing finish to 2025, as she defeated No. 15 Paula Badosa in straight sets in the third round of the Brisbane International. She's now won 13 matches in a row.

If the early returns on Elena Rybakina's 2026 season are any indication, the rest of the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz should be on high alert.

Brisbane: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Rybakina ended 2025 on a tear, sneaking into the WTA Finals as the last qualifier before going on to win the year-end championships. She appears to have carried that momentum into the new year, following a flawless second-round win over Zhang Shuai with an equally impressive straight-sets victory over No. 15 seed Paula Badosa.

The 2024 Brisbane champion needed just 1 hour and 25 minutes to defeat the Spaniard 6-3, 6-2 at Pat Rafter Arena on Thursday, booking her spot in the quarterfinals.

“It's always tough battles against Paula,” Rybakina said after the match. “She has great shots, she plays really fast and has a very good serve, so it was not easy. I started a little bit slow and was struggling with my serve too. But I'm happy that I managed to win.”

Rybakina did indeed get off to a slow start. Badosa won the first seven points of the match and eight of the first nine to capture an early break and a 2-0 lead. But Rybakina quickly steadied herself, breaking right back and fending off Badosa's further advances to level the set at 2-all.

After Badosa saved a break point and held in the next game, Rybakina rattled off four straight games to close out the opening set.

That surge became part of a run of seven consecutive games, as Rybakina raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set. Badosa briefly halted the slide with a hold for 3-1, but it wasn't enough. By match end, Rybakina had won nine of the last 11 games.

“I was trying to focus one [game] at a time,” Rybakina said. “The serve was not helping so much, so I had to manage the points and stay aggressive on the return. I still have a lot of things to work on for the next match, but hopefully it will be better.”

Here are some takeaways from Rybakina's win over Badosa:

Streaks remain intact: Three streaks continued for Rybakina on Thursday.

Consummate ball-striking: On a day where she struggled on serve, Rybakina's ball-striking carried her. Whether she was playing her forehand or her backhand, it didn't matter, as she struck every ball with conviction, especially on big points.

She sealed the first set with a forehand winner on set point, then opened the second set with a hold before drilling a backhand down the line to convert a break point in the next game. She hit 13 winners to just 7 unforced errors in the second set and finished with 24 winners and 21 unforced errors overall.

What's ahead: Rybakina will face No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova in the quarterfinals. The head-to-head is level at 1-1, but their last meeting came all the way back in 2023 at Indian Wells.

Rybakina won that quarterfinal match in three sets.

It doesn't appear as if Elena Rybakina used the offseason to cool off after her blazing finish to 2025, as she defeated No. 15 Paula Badosa in straight sets in the third round of the Brisbane International. She's now won 13 matches in a row.

Alexandra Eala dominated Petra Marcinko in just over an hour to secure her fourth WTA Tour quarterfinal spot. The Filipina notched an almost-flawless 6-0, 6-2 victory, where she was perfect 6-for-6 break-point conversion rate.

Alexandra Eala needed just over an hour to book a place in her fourth career WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz quarterfinal, routing Petra Marcinko 6-0, 6-2 on Thursday at the ASB Classic. 

Auckland: Scores | Schedule | Draws

Though fourth-seeded Eala and the unseeded Marcinko were peers as juniors -- the Filipina is just seven months older than the Croatian, who was ranked World No. 1 in juniors -- the second-round matchup in New Zealand was their first singles meeting at either the international junior or professional level. And she hardly let up after jumping out to an early lead to seal her place in the last eight in 63 minutes. 

"I'm so happy with how I was able to compete and handle the different situations on court," said Eala, who needed 2 hours and 40 minutes to win her opening match. "Every start of the year comes differently: new year, new story, and that goes for everybody.

"I'm happy with how I'm starting. ... It's difficult, everyone at this level gives you certain challenges, but again, I'm happy with how I'm playing."

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Other key figures from Eala's victory included: 

2: Eala is now 2-0 against players from Croatia at WTA main-draw level in her career. Her first win came Tuesday against Donna Vekic. 

6: Eala was a perfect 6-for-6 on break-point opportunities in the match. She also faced six break points herself, but saved five of them. 

7: The World No. 53 started the match by winning the first seven games. She ended the match by winning six in a row, from an early break deficit at 2-1. 

11: Marcinko came into the tilt having won 11 straight matches. She ended 2025 by winning two ITF World Tennis Tour events in the United Arab Emirates -- a W75 in Fujairah and a W100 in Dubai -- before she beat Camila Osorio in the Auckland first round.

12: The World No. 82 won just 12 points in seven service games overall -- a 31% clip.

For a spot in the semifinals, Eala will face No. 5 seed Magda Linette, who defeated unseeded Italian Elisabetta Cocciaretto in three sets, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3. She hopes to beat the 33-year-old for the first time, having lost their two previous matches -- including a match on grass in Nottingham last year.

Serving as player-captain at this year's United Cup in the launch of his final year on tour, Wawrinka has also been able to count on Jakub Paul.

When the Swiss step out for their next match, pay attention to Wawrinka's wardrobe. For a t-shirt that reads “Belinda's World” is among the articles of clothing in his bag.“It's the least I expect. I mean, how do you treat a gift like that?” said Bencic after joking that it was only a travel wearable.“You sure? Okay, done deal. I will be wearing it in Sydney when she's playing,” declared Wawrinka. “No pressure, but now you have to keep playing that good.”Wawrinka has held his own as he awaits word on whether he'll be awarded a main-draw wild card into the Australian Open, the site of his first major triumph 12 years ago. The Lausanne native defeated Arthur Rinderknech to open 2026, pushed Flavio Cobolli to a decisive tiebreaker and went down to Sebastian Baez, 7-5, 6-4, in his most recent outing.

I'm happy where I am right now, and I'm not worried too much about what's going to happen in Melbourne. Stan Wawrinka

He's kept an open line with Craig Tiley and Stephen Farrow since December and will respect Tennis Australia's final decision either way. Coming through qualifying isn't on the table, as Wawrinka accepted a wild card to play Auckland's ASB Classic following the United Cup.“I want to play one more time. Of course, it's my last year. Amazing memories from there, but I'm so grateful I received one last year,” Wawrinka said.“It's a wild card. I had one job to do if I wanted to play one more time, to be in the Top 100, and I'm not.”Switzerland awaits the winner of Belgium and Czechia. Those two nations face off Thursday in Sydney.

Before the United Cup, former World No. 9 Nicolas Massu spoke with his player, Hubert Hurkacz. The Pole was readying for his first tournament in seven months thanks to a knee injury that required surgery last July.

The message from the Chilean was clear.

“Enjoy the competition again,” Massu told Hurkacz. “Look back at where you've been, and all that you passed already in the past seven months. You deserve to be here. Appreciate that. Enjoy the moment. Go step by step, not thinking too much about the results.” 

Since then, Hurkacz has made a dream start to his comeback in Sydney, earning straight-sets victories against World No. 3 Alexander Zverev and Tallon Griekspoor to help Poland reach the quarter-finals of the mixed-teams event.

“I'm really, really happy because we had difficult times. And when you are out of competition seven months — it is a lot of time — you need to be patient,” Massu said. “You need to be strong. It's not too easy because sometimes you want to just start to think about the tournaments. You are missing weeks and then there is a slow recovery.”

Although Hurkacz's game has been sharp inside Ken Rosewall Arena, claiming his 20th win against a Top-10 opponent according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, that does not mean recent months have been perfect. It has been far from it for the Pole, who in two consecutive seasons underwent knee surgery.

“It's not easy to maintain the faith all the time because the days are long, it's a lot of treatment, a lot of recovery,” Massu said. “But at the same time, I'm totally convinced — because I had this in my so many years of Tour, so many years in tennis — that at some point, if you keep strong and you believe and you work hard, you deserve it.”

Massu made clear that Hurkacz has done everything in his power to not only recover physically, but to prepare for his comeback. From Marbella and Malaga to Monaco and Poland, Hurkacz has worked exhaustively to put himself in position for moments like he has experienced in the past week.

“It's incredible, the work ethic of Hubi. He follows everything 100 per cent. If he has to do this, he does that and more,” Massu said. “It's not only on the court, it's outside of the court: how he takes care of the food, of the treatment, all the stretching. So I think that when you work like this, the [positive] things need to come back. You deserve to have these kinds of results.”





For Hurkacz every day was the same. Early mornings, late nights and a lot of hard work. There were moments of pain and fatigue. But as the coach explained, “these things are hard”.

“My experience from my life and from my tennis career is that everything that is strong against you or sometimes it is dark, at the end of the tunnel, you see the light,” Massu said. “You need to keep the faith.” 

The two-time Olympic gold medalist returned to Chile for about three months before returning to Europe in September to help the Pole resume on-court training. They took things quite slowly, prioritising listening to Hurkacz's doctors and physio. A key was to not rush. 

“Everything that we needed to do, we were doing, and we were listening to the right people,” Massu said. “We were strong in the difficult moments and I think that the whole thing for me, from my point of view, that I wanted, is to see him again on the court competing.”

One thing that has certainly not left the Pole is his serve. Hurkacz has hit 42 aces across four sets and faced one total break point against formidable opposition.

"It's a big talent," Massu said. "Also for sure he works a lot. He put a lot of focus there."

But the Chilean was also keen to point out how much of an all-around player Hurkacz is. The World No. 83 stands 6'5", but has more than a big serve.

"I think that he's a very complete player. I still believe that he can play even on clay the same level as on hard court," Massu said. " And of course, we need to improve some little details that can bring him again to fight in the top of the top. But the most important is the health, I still believe that if he's healthy, we can achieve good things."

Hurkacz is just getting started. While he hopes to maintain his great early form this week in Sydney, the overall comeback has just begun. Massu very much believes in his charge.

“I always believe that nothing is impossible if you maintain the work ethic, if you maintain your positive mind,” Massu said. “At some point, you will recover.”

	The Directors Guild of America revealed its feature film nominees Thursday for the 78th DGA Awards, with the helmers behind awards-season stalwarts One Battle After Another, Sinners, Frankenstein, Marty Supreme and Hamnet scoring noms in the Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Theatrical Feature Film category.


	The Theatrical Feature Film nominations mark the first full DGA nom ever for Sinners‘ Ryan Coogler and Marty Supreme‘s Josh Safdie, and the second for Hamnet‘s Chloé Zhao, who won the honor in 2021 for her eventual Oscar Best Picture winner Nomadland. It's also just the second nom for Del Toro, after he won in 2018 for his also eventual Oscar Best Picture winner The Shape of Water. Anderson was previously nominated for There Will Be Blood and Licorice Pizza, and he is coming off a Best Director win at the Critics Choice Awards.

	











	Today's feature film announcement includes nominees for the DGA's First Time Theatrical Feature award, a list that includes Ava Victor for Sorry, Baby, Hasan Hadi for Iraq's Oscar submission The President's Cake, Harry Lighton for Pillion, Charlie Polinger for The Plague, and Alex Russell for Lurker.

	Last year, Sean Baker won the DGA's Theatrical Feature FIlm prize for his Anora, part of a haul that built momentum toward his Best Director and Best Picture wins at the Oscars. He beat out a DGA field that included Jacques Audiard (Emilia Pérez), Edward Berger (Conclave), Brady Corbet (The Brutalist) and James Mangold (A Complete Unknown). 

	











	Last year, RaMell Ross took the First-Time award for his Nickel Boys.


	This year's DGA Awards ceremony is set for Saturday, February 7 at the Beverly Hilton after member voting that runs from now to February 6.

The Directors Guild of America (DGA) has spoken with its own nominees amid a very busy awards season week that started with the Critics Choice Awards and will end with the Golden Globes.

The directors contending for outstanding theatrical feature film are: Paul Thomas Anderson (“One Battle After Another”), Ryan Coogler (“Sinners”), Guillermo del Toro (“Frankenstein”), Chloé Zhao (“Hamnet”), and Josh Safdie (“Marty Supreme”).

The directors in the running for first-time feature film are: Hasan Hadi (“The President's Cake”), representing the only foreign-language film in the mix, here from Iraq; Harry Lighton (“Pillion”); Charlie Polinger (“The Plague”); Alex Russell (“Lurker”); and Eva Victor (“Sorry, Baby”).

The DGA nominations aren't always predictive of the final Oscar five; last year, “The Substance” filmmaker Coralie Fargeat was Academy-nominated instead of DGA pick Edward Berger for “Conclave.” In both scenarios, Sean Baker won for his eventual Best Picture recipient, “Anora.”

The DGA this week already announced its television and documentary nominations; for nonfiction film, they honored Mstyslav Chernov for “2000 Meters to Andriivka,” Geeta Gandbhir for “The Perfect Neighbor,” Sara Khaki and Mohammadreza Eyni for “Cutting Through Rocks,” Elizabeth Lo for “Mistress Dispeller,” and Laura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus for “Cover-Up.” All are on the Oscar shortlist for Best Documentary Feature.

The 78th Directors Guild of America Awards are set to take place at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles on Saturday, February 7. See the full list of feature film DGA nominees below.

It's a conversation about what lasts, what lingers, and what we hope to pass on.

					By Jesse Whittock 

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Alan Chikin Chow and Kareem Rahma agency Underscore Talent is kicking off 2026 by unveiling a slew of hires and promotions, with a former Paramount adult animation exec among them.


	Sachi Ezura, who was VP, Adult Animation at the Skydance-owned U.S. studio between 2021 and 2025, has joined as Talent Manager in the creator-focused talent house's Comedy division. She was among those who exited in last year's redundancies at the company.


	At Paramount, she worked on shows such as Clone High, Ren & Stimpy, Tooning Out the News, Digman! and Everybody Still Hates Chris, and now joins Underscore's new Comedy unit, which we first revealed news of in October last year. Underscore co-founder Michael Green leads the division, which already includes other managers such as Andrew Topel.

	Sachi's hire comes during a significant growth period for Underscore, an L.A.-based creator economy talent house that has been quietly adding the new staff over the past year, with 20 internal promotions and 44 hires. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Eleven of those have been talent managers and six senior leaders. We've reported on several of them, with Nadi Filsoof notably upped to partner in the Entertainment division last year.


	Underscore was launched in 2021 by Michael Green, Reza Izad and Dan Weinstein, and has focused on the burgeoning creator economy space. It represents creators hailing from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, Snapchat, the gaming world and podcasting. 


	Key talent includes former New York Times exec and Subway Takes comedian Kareem Rahma, who Deadline recently named as a creator to watch in 2026. Also on the books among others are true crime and make-up influencer Bailey Sarian, actress and comedian Christina Kirkman, Alan's Series maker Alan Chikin Chow, TikTok personality and former soccer player Noah Beck, preschooler content creators Vlad & Niki, digital comedian Zachariah Porter and retired soccer player Brittany Isenhour.

	











	“We're operating in a fast-moving industry whose potential is expanding faster than other media sectors,” Underscore co-founder Reza Izad told Deadline. “By expanding our leadership team across verticals and shared services, while continuing to promote from within, we've built a team designed to support long-term career architecture, not just moment-driven opportunities. This depth allows us to move faster, think more holistically, and help talent navigate an increasingly complex digital-first landscape heading into 2026.”


	Here's an overview of the hires. TheSoul Publishing-owned company's Entertainment talent management division has welcomed Lloyd Tyler from YMU, Chris Motyl and Zachary Cole from Sixteenth, Eric Schulman from Haven, and Molly Werner from UTA. Also on the management front, Polly Auritt joined the Culinary unit, Neville King the Sports department, Dylan Flinn boarded the AI team and Steph Lechman and Kieran John joined the Gaming unit.


	Other significant hires have seen Kyle Singles join as Talent Partnerships Director at production division Shorthand Studios, as we first reported in October last year; Lisa Bossman as Director of Brand Partnerships & Endorsements, Sports; Emily Salerno as Director, Campaign Management; Zack Evans as VP, Creative Strategy, Shorthand Studios; Scott Rowe as Operations Manager, FAST and Joshua Fasold as Senior Account Manager.


	As for promotions, Kyle Stevens and Chris Burns became Senior Directors of Talent & Co-Heads of Comedy, Cristina Fernandez was upped to Senior Director of Talent, and Sam Schoenberg and Frankie Ray were named Senior Directors of Talent, Entertainment.


	At director level, Zach Cole was named Director of Talent, Entertainment; Athena Nash became Director of Talent, Culinary; and Nick Schlegel upped to Director of Talent, Beauty, Fashion & Lifestyle. There were several manager level promotions with Chaisten France and Megan Valdex promoted in the Entertainment team, Larissa Thorold upped in Sports, Claire Mink rising in Culinary and Mandie Meier promoted in the Beauty, Fashion & Lifestyle Unit. Adrienne Gao and Virginia Dodenhoff rose in the Brand Partnerships unit.


	“These promotions reflect the way we're building Underscore, by investing deeply in our people and giving them room to grow into leaders,” said Dan Weinstein, Co-CEO of Underscore Talent. “As our creators' careers become more complex and ambitious, it's critical that our team grows with them. Developing talent from within, alongside bringing in new leaders, is what allows us to move faster and think bigger.”


	YouTube star managers Weinstein, Izad and Green were all co-founders of Studio71, the digital content studio that was part of Germany's ProSiebenSat.1 Media. They formed Underscore five years, and sold a majority stake to TheSoul Publishing in 2022.


Here's a Q&A with Underscore co-CEOs Izad and Weinstein


DEADLINE: How will the new hires and promotions set Underscore up for 2026?


Izad: We're operating in a fast-moving industry whose potential is expanding faster than other media sectors. By expanding our leadership team across verticals and shared services, while continuing to promote from within, we've built a team designed to support long-term career architecture, not just moment-driven opportunities. This depth allows us to move faster, think more holistically, and help talent navigate an increasingly complex digital-first landscape heading into 2026.

	











	As the creator economy continues to decentralize, it's crucial for us to operate at the highest level at this intersection of talent management, media strategy, and IP development. As platforms fragment and creators build businesses across YouTube, podcasts, film, TV, and owned audiences, management can no longer be transactional or simply reactive.


DEADLINE: Where do you want your team most focused in 2026?


Dan: Our focus is on three things: audience ownership, scalable storytelling, and operational leverage.


	Creators are no longer optimizing for a single platform or viral moment, they're building repeatable formats, serialized content, and communities that travel across platforms and into real-world experiences. At the same time, AI is accelerating creative workflows, lowering friction, and allowing talent to experiment faster and smarter.


	Our team is focused on helping talent understand where attention, influence, and budgets are actually moving, while building systems that let them work smarter, not harder, as their businesses scale.


DEADLINE: How do you feel about the explosion of talent management businesses in the creator economy?


Weinstein: It's a sign of how real and permanent this shift is. As creators rival traditional entertainers in reach and cultural impact, the demand for specialized representation is inevitable.


	What differentiates companies now isn't access, it's strategy. The next era of management is about helping talent build durable media businesses, develop IP, and navigate both digital and traditional entertainment on their own terms. The proliferation of new firms reflects how much opportunity there is, but it also raises the bar for what real management should deliver.


DEADLINE: Where are the biggest opportunities and challenges for creators, especially in film and TV?


Izad: The biggest opportunity is that creators no longer need traditional media as the sole path to legitimacy. YouTube, podcasts, and long-form digital formats are now rivaling TV in both reach and monetization, and creators are entering film and television with built-in audiences and creative leverage.


	The challenge is alignment. Everyone is trying to figure out how they succeed in this digital-first world, especially traditional entertainers, athletes and public personalities. Underscore's team, many of whom crossed over from traditional to digital entertainment, have been critical in helping this group of talent make sense of the digital landscape and how they can operate within it as creators and creatives.


DEADLINE: How do you assess the market opportunities and challenges?


Weinstein: What makes this moment meaningful isn't just the scale of growth, it's the balance of continuity and momentum. We have leaders who've grown with Underscore for years alongside new executives bringing fresh perspectives across every corner of business including AI, publishing, comedy, data, content optimization, and monetization.


Izad: The industry is at a heightened state of maturation and the conversations have evolved from explaining why the creator economy matters to how you can participate effectively and win. We've bolstered our internal team ahead of 2026 to meet major moments head-on and stay ahead of them. 


	From the rise of creator-owned communities on platforms like Substack, nascent AI advancements across music, editing and animation to the role of serialized formats for streamers and marketing, these are just a few of areas that will shape 2026. As creator-led entertainment continues to reshape culture, the companies that win will be the ones built to evolve with it. Our goal is to ensure creators, and the teams that support them, are positioned not just to participate in what's next, but to help define it.

Senior Film Reporter


	On Thursday morning, A24 debuted the first trailer for Undertone, the horror film from first-time feature filmmaker Ian Tuason that they snapped up for worldwide release following its Fantasia Film Festival premiere, as we first reported last August.


Undertone stars Nina Kiri as Evy, a paranormal podcast host who returns home to care for her dying mother. Thereafter, she begins receiving recordings from a married couple plagued by strange noises in their house, pulling her into a spiral of fear and paranoia.


	In her description of the film for Fantasia Fest, programming director Carolyn Mauricette wrote, “Fans of SKINAMARINK and I AM THE PRETTY THING WHO LIVES IN THE HOUSE will love this slow-burn nightmare that will make hackles on your neck rise and your blood chill.”

	











	The trailer has Babic and her co-host introduce viewers to the Undertone podcast, where they're preparing to sift through 10 enigmatic audio recordings sent on an anonymous email. They believe that there are hidden messages to be found in the audio by playing it back in reverse, and only realize in retrospect that they've “unleased something.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“You shouldn't have called out to her,” Babic is later told by an unseen character. “It's what she wants.”


	There were six buyers in the mix for Undertone, sources told us, with A24 closing a deal for the film at mid-7 figures. Pic was produced by Dan Slater for Slaterverse Pictures and Cody Calahan for Black Fawn Films. Exec producers include Steven Schneider and Roy Lee for Spooky Pictures, Chad Archibald for Black Fawn Films, Brit MacRae and Daril Fannin for Kino Studios, DimensionGate, and Will Rowbotham and Luke Maxwell for 3 Arts Entertainment.

	











Undertone helmer Tuason is a Toronto-based creative heretofore best known for his live-action virtual reality horror shorts, which have garnered over 14M organic views on YouTube. Check out the trailer for his debut feature by clicking above.

Senior Film Reporter


Amazon MGM Studios has unveiled the first trailer for The Wrecking Crew, their action comedy starring Dave Bautista and Jason Momoa, which is slated for release on Prime Video on January 28.


	Directed by Blue Beetle helmer Ángel Manuel Soto, and set in the streets of Hawaii, the film watches as two estranged half-brothers, Jonny (Momoa) and James (Bautista), reluctantly reunite after their father's mysterious death. As they set out to uncover the truth, buried secrets resurface and loyalties are tested, unveiling a conspiracy that can tear their family apart. Together, they are ready to wreck anything that gets in their way.

	The trailer opens with the duo being dressed down by a detective played by Barry alum Stephen Root.

	“This doesn't happen here every day,” Root tells them. “I can't have two guys who look like they eat steroid pancakes for breakfast turning my island into Beirut!”


	We subsequently learn that the Yakuza wants the guys dead, as old tensions flare up between them.


	“You just stir up trouble. That's what you do!” says Bautista's James.


	“That's what I do,” says Momoa's Jonny, “because I'm a cop.”


	“Not here, you're not!” James retorts.


	The pair also disagree on the cause of their father's recent death — James think it was a simple hit-and-run, but Jonny isn't so sure. They ultimately agree it was a murder and set out on a mission of vengeance, with Root's detective warning them, “I guarantee you'll end up poking a bear… that doesn't want to be poked.”


	Bautista's James, however, says, “Take my word for it when I tell you… that I'm the bear.”


The Wrecking Crew also stars Claes Bang, Jacob Batalon, and Morena Baccarin. Jonathan Tropper wrote the script with Jeff Fierson, Momoa, Bautista, Matt Reeves, and Lynn Harris producing. Check out the film's trailer above

'This is a company building with intention ... while staying deeply connected to culture,' says the former Motown Records chairwoman and CEO.


													By
												

	Gail Mitchell



Ethiopia Habtemariam is stepping back into the music industry arena as president of music at HYBE America, Billboard can exclusively report. Habtemariam previously served as chairwoman and CEO of Motown Records before exiting that post in 2022.


	Habtemariam, whose appointment is effective immediately, will assist in advancing HYBE America's “longterm strategy, spearheading A&R and artist development initiatives across the company's label ecosystem and identifying new opportunities at the intersection of music, culture and fandom,” as noted in a press announcement. In addition, she will play a pivotal role in broadening HYBE America's presence in Atlanta, where its Quality Control label is headquartered, calling the city “a global epicenter of R&B and hip-hop, further strengthening Quality Control's presence and impact as Atlanta's premier music company.”


	Those initiatives are in tune with the South Korean music company's burgeoning presence in the U.S. market and its genre expansion beyond K-Pop. HYBE launched its Latin American division in 2023 and acquired hip-hop label Quality Control Music the same year. In addition, Habtemariam's new appointment reunites the music executive with Quality Control Music co-founders COO Kevin “Coach K” Lee and CEO Pierre “P” Thomas. While at Motown, she orchestrated a joint venture between QC and Motown in 2015, developing and overseeing the careers of artists such as Migos, Lil Baby, City Girls and Lil Yachty.


	Based in Atlanta and Los Angeles, Habtemariam will report to HYBE America chairman and CEO Isaac Lee. In announcing her appointment, Lee said, “Ethiopia is a once-in-a-generation leader whose impact on artists, songwriters, culture and the music business is undeniable. Her vision, taste and strategic insight make her uniquely suited to help shape the next chapter of HYBE America as we continue building a future-facing entertainment company centered on artists and fans.”


	Under the HYBE banner, Lee also oversees Big Machine Label Group and the company's investments with Universal Music Group in artists such as KATSEYE. As president of music, Habtemariam will also collaborate closely with UMG.


	“I've long admired how HYBE America approaches artists, fans and the future of entertainment,” said Habtemariam in a statement. “This is a company building with intention and investing for the long term while staying deeply connected to culture. I'm excited to contribute my experience as HYBE America continues to shape what's next for music on a global scale.”


	Habtemariam was promoted to chairwoman and CEO of Motown in 2021 after six years serving as president of the iconic label. During her term as chair/CEO, Motown began operating as a standalone label with a roster that included Vince Staples. In addition to partnering with Quality Control Music under Habtemariam's watch, Motown signed Leon Thomas and NBA YoungBoy.


	“Working with Ethiopia again feels full circle,” Coach K said in a statement. “From the early days in Atlanta, we built something special at Quality Control, and it means a lot to see that legacy continue in this next chapter.”


	Added Thomas, “Ethiopia and I have a long history of working together, pushing boundaries and breaking barriers in this industry. Her passion for artists, commitment to culture and deep understanding of the music landscape make her an extraordinary leader. I'm excited for what we will build together in this next chapter.”


	During her more than two-decade tenure with Motown parent company Universal Music Group, Habtemariam held senior executive posts with Capitol Music Group and Universal Music Publishing Group. Advancing from creative manager to president of urban music & co-head of creative at UMPG, she oversaw signings that included Chris Brown, Theron Thomas, J. Cole, Justin Bieber, Ciara, Jhené Aiko and Hit-Boy.

The first official U.S. trailer for “Sirāt” feels like a warning shot, less interested in teasing its unexpected survival plot than in dropping prospective viewers into its fierce landscape of pulsing bass, scorched earth, and emotional freefall. 

Directed by Oliver Laxe (“Fire Will Come,” “You All Are Captains”), the 2025 Cannes standout follows a father and son as they plunge into the rave scene of southern Morocco to search for their missing daughter and sister, only to find an underworld more perilous than they could have expected.

 










Luis (Sergi López) and his son Esteban (Bruno Núñez Arjona) arrive deep in the mountains, clutching a photo of Mar. She disappeared months earlier at one of these sleepless parties, and now her family has no choice but to canvas strangers in a place that feels more lawless than loving or communal. When a tip takes them further into the desert, the pair press on — even as the terrain turns forbiddingly hostile.

That premise only hints at what Laxe delivers. As critic David Katz wrote for IndieWire in his “A-” review, “Sirāt” is a “sui generis” work that resists classification while still nailing visceral, sometimes crowd-pleasing thrills. Born in France but a staple of Moroccan cinema, Laxe has a talent for scaling international borders and belief systems to peer into worlds that feel dangerously tactile and spiritually slippery. The trailer leans hard into tension, juxtaposing profound familial grief with the rhythm of indifference inherent to drugged-up dance culture and an unstable geopolitical backdrop.

 










Critically acclaimed, “Sirāt” is shortlisted in five categories at the 98th Academy Awards, including Best International Feature (Spain), Best Cinematography, Best Music (Original Score), and Best Sound. It won Best Music Score from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and earned nominations from the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards, European Film Awards, and the Gotham Awards. “Sirāt”promises a journey that treats emotional and physical obstacles as equal narrative forces, daring audiences to cross a transcendent bridge between despair and euphoria, without knowing what's on the other side.

Watch the trailer for “Sirāt,” in select theaters on February 6 after a qualifying run last year, below.

EXCLUSIVE: Hannah Hafey & Kaitlin Smith have come aboard to write the live-action theatrical Monster High movie for Mattel Studios, Universal Pictures, and Akiva Goldsman's Weed Road.


	It's the first big development on the project since the M3GAN films' Gerard Johnstone boarded to direct in June 2025. First announced one year prior, the film will be produced by Robbie Brenner, President and Chief Content Officer of Mattel Studios, as well as Goldsman. Darian Greenbaum is overseeing for Mattel, alongside Greg Lessans for Weed Road, with Universal Pictures' Senior Vice President of Production Lexi Barta and Director of Production Development Jacqueline Garell overseeing for the studio.

	











	Plot details for the feature take on Monster High remain under wraps. First introduced via a line of dolls in 2010, the franchise centers around a fictional high school attended by the teenage children of famous monsters, such as Draculaura (daughter of Dracula), Frankie Stein (daughter of Frankenstein's monster), Clawdeen Wolf (daughter of the Werewolf) and Cleo de Nile (daughter of the Mummy). Inclusive, in encouraging fans to embrace their authentic selves and what makes them unique, the franchise has expanded over the years via an animated web series, TV specials, movies, and books.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Hafey & Smith are rising voices in film and television whose work has been recognized on the annual Black List three times, most recently with their new spec script Entertaining on this year's list. Their feature script Rachel Nevada is in development at Paramount, with Ryan Reynolds' Maximum Effort on board to produce. The duo also penned St. Mary's Catholic School Presents The Vagina Monologues for Amazon Studios, with Tanya Wexler directing and Di Novi Pictures producing.

	











	On the television side, the scribes sold Misfit City to HBO Max, with Boom! Studios producing. They are represented by Gersh and Jack Greenbaum at The Arlook Group.


	For the moment, Mattel Studios has dated just one live-action film on the heels of Barbie: Masters of the Universe, which Amazon MGM releases in North America on June 5. Also expected to release this year is Apple, Skydance and Mattel's Matchbox movie starring John Cena.

The Romantic Tour will feature guests Anderson .Paak, RAYE and more.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Bruno Mars is gearing up to bring a little romance to cities all around the world, and Anderson .Paak, RAYE and more big names are coming along with him.


	The superstar revealed on Thursday morning (Jan. 8) that his Romantic Tour will kick off in April following the release of his newly announced The Romantic album. Running through mid-October, the trek will find Mars playing stadiums across North America, Canada and Europe.

	











	His Silk Sonic bandmate will be a featured guest at all of the shows, while “Where Is My Husband!” singer RAYE, Victoria Monét and Leon Thomas will take turns as supporting acts on different dates.


	Fans can now sign up for a ticket presale, which starts Jan. 14 on Mars' website. The general sale begins the day after.


	Mars' tour news comes on the heels of his announcement that, after 10 years, he's finally coming back with his fourth solo album. The Romantic will drop Feb. 27, a full decade after his last LP, 2016's 24K Magic.


	But even though it's been a while since he released a solo full-length, the 16-time Grammy winner has been anything but unproductive in recent years. With .Paak, he formed Silk Sonic in 2021, and the duo scored a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 that same year with “Leave the Door Open.” In 2025 alone, Mars closed out with two of the biggest hits of the year, with his Lady Gaga duet “Die With a Smile” finishing at No. 1 on Billboard‘s year-end Hot 100 chart and ROSÉ collaboration “APT.” coming in at No. 9.

	











	See Mars' tour announcement and full list of dates below.

Rose McGowan's weight was repeatedly checked by “Charmed” executives, the actress claimed in a new podcast interview.

The 52-year-old, who played Paige Matthews on the show from 2001 to 2006, told “We Need to Talk” listeners Tuesday that higher-ups used to “circle around” her to appraise her appearance.

“[They would] check my weight when I came back from season to season,” she recalled, quipping that the men were “inspecting their product.”

The “Grindhouse” star remembered this “chill” behavior being viewed as “completely fine” on the “nasty set” at the time.

She expressed mixed feelings about Hollywood being “different” these days, claiming the industry “pay[s] lip service” to the idea that it has evolved.

Earlier in the interview, McGowan noted that “Charmed” was “hard for” her to film as it was her first time dealing with “super corporate” dynamics.

She once asked “five white dodos in their suits” whether they would “fire [her]” and let her “leave” if she was caught smoking a joint.

“They were like, ‘If you go work at a pharmacy, we'll sue you. No matter what job you get, we'll take your wages for the rest of your life and then we'll go after your family,'” McGowan claimed.

She labeled the entertainment industry “far worse than the [Children of God] cult [she] grew up in.”

In 2018, McGowan said in her “Citizen Rose” docuseries that she needed hypnotherapy to process her time on the WB show.

“I found the repetitive days so opposite my natural rhythms that I became sick over and over,” she told viewers of the “very stressful environment.”

The “Scream” star added, “I started to have panic attacks because of everything I was pushing down. I was sick about four or five times a season. … The pace was grueling. Two years in a row, I had 102-degree fevers and got dumped in trash cans, in a stunt, always on the days that I was the most ill.”

She gained 10 pounds for the role, explaining in her “Brave” memoir that same year that her goal was to appear “super nonthreatening” as Shannen Doherty's character Prue Halliwell's replacement.

When McGowan dyed her hair bright red before her second season, the series's “furious” executives “flipped out.”

However, McGowan “liked it, so [she] kept it.”

Shudder is fueling its post–10-year-anniversary momentum with an instantly unnerving trailer debut — exclusive to IndieWire. 

Recalling the antiseptic dread of Gore Verbinski's “A Cure for Wellness,” but steeped in the lush, suffocating inferno of the deep-green Ontario woods, “Honey Bunch” comes from Canadian filmmakers Madeleine Sims-Fewer and Dusty Mancinelli. The nightmare begins as a discordantly ethereal marriage thriller, set at a strange treatment facility. It twists into something even more like a dark fairytale and reaffirms Shudder as a key tastemaker for international horror in 2026.

 










Streaming on February 13 and in Canadian theaters on January 23, “Honey Bunch” is critically acclaimed, having debuted to positive reception at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival. The promo plays like a noxious breath of fresh air, starring Grace Glowicki and Ben Petrie — the electric duo behind 2025's “Dead Lover” (out of Sundance) — as a husband and wife who don't know each other as well as they think.

The couple appears opposite Jason Isaacs and Kate Dickie for a chilly descent into the instability of intimacy, making a buzzy, fierce first impression on the film festival circuit last year. It also screened at TIFF, Fantastic Fest, and more, making an impressive run that speaks to the film's possible global appeal (this certainly feels like an “Oddity”-type hit) as much as the script's eerie specificity.

When Diana (Glowicki) awakens from a coma with severe memory loss, she and her husband (Petrie) turn to an isolated medical center for experimental trauma treatments. As the procedures grow more invasive, the patient's marriage begins to fracture, and Diana questions not just the nature of the therapy, but the intentions of the man who claims to love her most. In a review for IndieWire, critic Jake Cole called the result a “slow-burn madhouse thriller” that becomes one of the few recent “body horror pictures to recognize the genre's capacity for tragedy over allegorical statement and shock value.”

Sims-Fewer and Mancinelli have emerged as two of the most exciting figures in Canadian horror, and they're part of a broader wave redefining the country's genre output through extraordinary commitment to craft, artistic vulnerability, and emotional extremity. “Honey Bunch” continues that trajectory, and promises to nail the sharp execution and conceptual hook you need for a Shudder sensation. This is what curated cinema should look like — personal, perverse, and unafraid to ask how far love is willing to go.

Rock-brained Gerard Butler thrillers are supposed to be amusingly inane — not uncannily relevant.

Arriving at the end of our first Covid year (good times, good times), 2020's “Greenland” was somehow both at once. An earnest disaster movie about a Scottish-American engineer who tries to keep his family alive as a giant comet screams its way toward our planet, Ric Roman Waugh's resourceful and relatively grounded epic was sober enough to feel like the “Deep Impact” to “Geostorm”'s “Armageddon.” The film crashed down onto Earth at a moment as audiences worldwide reeled from the helplessness of their own global crisis. It was as dumb as the flaming rocks that seemed to follow Butler's character from Atlanta to the Arctic, but it resonated with the broadly recognizable truth of living through a catastrophe that not even a beefcake like King Leonidas could wrestle into submission.

Almost six years later, Butler and Waugh have done it again. And by “it,” I mean “make another exceedingly stupid ‘Greenland' movie that manages to dovetail with one of the most pressing dilemmas of the current moment, and does so with an emotional acuity that belies the programmatic oafishness of its whole general vibe.” Oh, and by “one of the most pressing dilemmas of the current moment,” I thankfully don't mean our demented president's recurrent threats of taking Greenland by force; timely as Waugh's franchise has been, this sequel is very much not about Butler and his fellow survivors defending their post-apocalyptic bunker from a drunk Pete Hegseth and his ultra-embarrassing “Department of War.”

 










Per its title, “Greenland 2: Migration” is a “there but for the grace of god” story about the uncertain search for stability in a world that has us all at its mercy. It's a story about the universal impulse to find a sustainable home for our families, a drive that should affirm the root humanity of exiles, refugees, and various other desperate foreigners rather than inspire the local population to deny it. It's also a story about Gerard Butler being very, very sad.

Screenwriters Mitchell LaFortune and Chris Sparling get to the heart of the matter by flipping the script on the premise of the previous film. That one saw John Garrity (Butler) maximizing his privilege by leading his estranged wife, Allison (Morena Baccarin), and their diabetic son, Nathan, to an extinction-proof shelter that had been reserved for people like them. 

This one starts with that shelter imploding under the strength of a massive radiation storm that displaces the Garrity clan in a hurry, and leaves them on a lifeboat to Europe in the wretched hope that someone on the continent will offer them a safe place to plant new roots. If that doesn't work out, perhaps John can guide his family to the crater left by the comet in southern France; it's rumoured the area has been protected from the poison air, killer waves, and bouncing meteors that have made the rest of the planet such a hellscape.

 










It should go without saying that “Greenland: Migration” doesn't belabor the point. This isn't really an ideas movie. That a Gerard Butler vehicle even gestures toward the short-sighted narcissism of closed borders is enough to make it a categorically different experience than (wonderful) dreck like Jean-François Richet's “Plane” or (plodding) dreck like Waugh's own “Angel Has Fallen,” as the director continues to use this cataclysmic franchise — which operates on a scale, if not a budget, considerably larger than any of his other work — to paint a rather intimate portrait of human perspective at the end of the world. 

To its significant detriment, “Migration” is a far more generic and action-oriented movie than its predecessor, which had the benefit of watching civilization get pulled apart at the seams. John's relationship with Allison was pretty threadbare, to say the least, and their son Nathan was never more than a cherubic insulin crisis waiting to happen, but the chaos around them was galvanized by a real and vivid sense of what happens to people when society reveals the pure survivalism at its core. Although it had its fair share of raining fire and extinction-sized tidal waves, the original “Greenland” hinged on finely wrought displays of separation, selflessness, and betrayal.

 










This sequel doesn't really do any of that — at least not to a meaningful degree. It kicks off with a “Death Stranding”-esque sequence of John scavenging for supplies on Greenland's toxic surface, devotes a few minutes to life inside the Department of Homeland Security bunker (it's bad, and getting worse so fast that Allison has to convince the other survivors to welcome a group of starving outsiders), and spends the rest of the movie chasing the Garrity clan across Europe in a series of ho-hum setpieces that fail to generate the same kind of race-against-the-clock suspense that came easy to the previous movie. They also make the environment seem bizarrely determined to kill these particular characters. 

I get that the Earth has become a hostile nightmare, but the predictability of a windstorm blowing through, or a meteor shower raining down, or a skirmish breaking out every time the Garritys are in a vulnerable moment proves wearying, and the script's emphasis on the spectacle of its natural disasters — rather than on how people react to them — results in a sequel that loses sight of what gave the first “Greenland” its friction. “How will a sexy gun-toting Frenchman react to John and his family?” is a lot more exciting than “will Nathan, now played by Roman Griffin Davis, be able to shimmy across a chasm before the ground crumbles apart on both sides of his ladder?” The answer to the second question is considerably easier to guess than the first. 

 










While the sober tone remains, as does Butler's likably monotone brogue, replicating the road trip structure of the original yields limited returns, and the loss of jagged supporting performances from the likes of Hope Davis and Scott Glenn is too great for the sequel's assorted redshirts to make up (Ken Nwosu's Obi is the exception who proves the rule, as the helpful Nigerian immigrant reinforces the movie's foundation in the five minutes before he's obliterated by a fragment of space rock). 

For their part, the Garrity family is asked to carry more weight with less substance, and their non-characters struggle to support the emotional burden of an intimate life-or-death journey, the destination of which is a lot sillier than it was the last time around. Still, for all of the been-there, survived-that tedium we get here, it's hard to imagine that many other white-bread Hollywood movies this year will so thoroughly internalize the reality that migration is a heroic act of survival. 

Lionsgate will release “Greenland: Migration” in theaters on Friday, January 9.

Paramount Skydance today reaffirmed its $30 a share all cash offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, declining to raise its bid.


	The company led by David Ellison said it “notes [WBD's] decision not to engage on Paramount's fully financed all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD” but called its offer superior to Warner's current deal with Netflix and insisted its financing is sound and that it has been receptive to all WBD's concerns.


	“Throughout this process, Paramount has diligently and constructively addressed each concern raised by WBD. As detailed in Paramount's December 22 amended proposal and subsequent filings, Paramount cured every issue raised by WBD on December 17, most notably by providing an irrevocable personal guarantee by Larry Ellison for the equity portion of the financing. Nevertheless, WBD continues to raise issues in Paramount's offer that we have already addressed, including flexibility in interim operations,” Paramount said in a statement.

	On Wednesday, the Warner Bros. Discovery board advised shareholders to reject an amended takeover offer from Paramount, calling the bid “inferior” to its signed deal with the giant streamer.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix is buying the Warner Bros. Studios and streaming assets for about $27.75 a share in cash and stock. 


	Both transactions would require regulatory approval and both could take up to 18 months to close. In the case of Netflix, WBD would move ahead with a planned spinoff of its linear television business into a separate public company called Discovery Global in the third quarter of 2026. 


	WBD said it believes Paramount's takeover offer carries higher risks and uncertainties.


	Paramount disputed that, insisting it has a better chance at regulatory approval. It cited both a recent dip in Netflix shares as well as the wobbly start of trading this week for Comcast's cable spinoff Versant. The the WBD board “has not disclosed any analysis to help its shareholders value their potential ongoing ownership of the linear company,” Par said. The amount of debt WBD ultimately allocates to a standalone Discovery Global will be key and could shift the final price, Paramount suggested, “as we have interpreted the agreement.”  

	











	“We encourage WBD shareholders to ask the Board of WBD for transparency on this aspect of the deal with Netflix.” 


	Paramount also defended its debt financing with Bank of America, Citibank and Apollo, “each global sophisticated financial institutions, with decades of experience financing companies and borrowers in history's largest, most complicated transactions. They have confirmed that the commitment letter previously delivered by them to provide the previously disclosed $54 billion of debt financing.” 


	Paramount is a much smaller company than WBD, which expressed concern at the large amount of debt Paramount is tapping to finance the deal. Par said it “would welcome the opportunity to engage directly with the WBD Board to discuss the offer and address the Board's latest claims.” 


	Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, David Ellison's father and one of the world's richest people, has agreed to personally backstop the equity portion of the deal.


	“Paramount's offer is superior to WBD's existing agreement with Netflix and represents the best path forward for WBD shareholders. $30.00 per share in cash is easy to value. Netflix's transaction, on the other hand, contains multiple uncertain components and has already decreased in total value. When announced in December, the Netflix transaction offered WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, $4.50 in Netflix stock and a share in the pending spin-off of Discovery Global. Today, Netflix's stock price is trading well beneath the low end of its collar, reducing the value offered to WBD shareholders. 


	“In addition, while the WBD Board has not disclosed any analysis to help its shareholders value their potential ongoing ownership of the linear stub, Versant Media, its closest comparable, debuted shares this week and its performance to date illustrates the challenged path ahead for Discovery Global. Paramount's analysis (detailed below) shows the total value of the Netflix transaction to WBD shareholders today is $27.42 – unmistakably inferior to Paramount's $30.00 in cash.


	“Our offer clearly provides WBD investors greater value and a more certain, expedited path to completion. Throughout this process, we have worked hard for WBD shareholders and remain committed to engaging with them on the merits of our superior bid and advancing our ongoing regulatory review process,” David Ellison said.


	Paramount has taken a tender offer directly to WBD shareholders in an attempt to derail the Netflix agreement. Stockholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount.

It's weird how some people can never take a “no” for an answer.

What a weirdo this dude and his father are.

I really hope they would Bari Weiss in charge of CNN too. That way the world can get unbiased news and entertainment. A win-win… wait a minute…

David is a moron in over his head. Awfully convenient how he never mentions the Saudi funding when they're bankrolling most of this pathetic attempt. Move on, grow up. Netflix won and it's for the best.

Dude. She's not into you. Leave her alone.

Truth hurts doesn't it?

How great it would be if Paramount wins this bid and the control CNN! They could install Bari Weiss and finally the world would get both fair and balanced entertainment and news! It's a win-win…. Wait a minute…

To be eligible for consideration, shows must have accumulated a minimum of 60 episodes across a minimum of five seasons and demonstrated continued or sustained relevance, influence or inspiration.

Executive Editor of Awards


	For the first time in nearly 20 years, the Television Academy is adding a major new Emmy: the Legacy Award, which, the organization announced on Thursday, will be presented to TV programs that have made “a profound and lasting impact” on audiences and remain relevant to society, culture and the industry.


	Candidates for the Legacy Award — which may only be bestowed on a program once — must have (a) accumulated a minimum of 60 episodes across a minimum of five seasons and (b) demonstrated continued or sustained relevance, influence or inspiration to a genre of television, an existing or new audience or society and culture. Franchise properties must be considered as a whole and awarded as such.

	Shows that are no longer running, but made a major impact, such as All in the Family (1971-1979, nine seasons) and Will & Grace (1998-2006, 2017-2020, 11 seasons), clearly are eligible for the honor. So, too, are ongoing programs, such as Grey's Anatomy (2005-, 22 seasons) and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005-, 17 seasons), and soon-to-depart shows like The Late Show (1993-2026, 27 seasons).

	Programs may be nominated for the Legacy Award by members of the TV Academy‘s board of governors or its special awards committee, or, via letters to the TV Academy, members of the industry or even the general public. Recipients will be selected annually by what is currently known as the Governors Award Committee, but is being renamed the Special Awards Committee.

	











	The award, which will come in the form of an engraved Emmy statuette, may be presented during the Primetime Emmys telecast, the Creative Arts Emmys ceremonies, at the TV Academy's Televerse festival or during its Hall of Fame ceremony. That will be determined each year by the TV Academy.

For the first time in nearly two decades, the Television Academy is introducing a new honorary Emmy known as the Legacy Award.

According to the awards body, the new Legacy Award will be presented to television programs that have made a “profound and lasting impact” on audiences and remain relevant to society, culture and the industry. 

The new award comes with small changes within the Television Academy Board of Governors as well. Its Governors Award committee will soon be known as the Special Awards Committee, and that group will be the one to determine candidates for the Legacy Award, and then present them to the Board of Governors for a vote. Entries may be made by members of the Board of Governors, the Special Awards Committee or individuals who may suggest recipients in a letter to the Television Academy.

The Television Academy has already established a strict criteria for which TV shows will be considered below, with the highlights being:

The last time the Academy introduced an award of similar significance was the Television Academy Honors Award in 2007, which recognizes programming that drives positive social change. As with the Governors Award, engraved Emmy statuettes will be bestowed upon the recipients of the new Legacy Award.

“The Legacy Award celebrates groundbreaking programming — programs that have stood the test of time delivering stories that continue to engage audiences and featuring iconic and timeless characters with multigenerational appeal,” said Television Academy Chair Cris Abrego via statement. “The award allows the Academy to honor more of television's rich history and acknowledge the storytellers whose work has resonated with viewers and continues to entertain legions of fans around the globe.”

 










The Television Academy is still determining whether the new award will be presented at the Creative Arts Emmy ceremonies, the Primetime Emmys telecast, the Televerse festival, or the TV Academy Hall of Fame event.

Kimberly Guilfoyle has broken her silence on her ex-fiancé Donald Trump Jr.'s engagement to Bettina Anderson.

Nearly one month after the 48-year-old popped the question, Guilfoyle told the New York Times she is “happy for Don.”

In an interview published Sunday, the US Ambassador to Greece insisted, “I wish him, of course, all the best.”

Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. were an item from 2018 to 2024, with the former couple getting engaged in 2020.

Page Six reported in December 2024 that the pair had called it quits.

“Don and Kimberly haven't been getting along over the past year,” a source told us at the time. “They get argumentative at Mar-a-Lago in front of people. Nothing crazy, but you know when a couple is fighting. They bicker in public.”

By the time news broke of their split, Trump Jr. had moved on with Anderson.

We heard he and the socialite, 39, had been together “for a few months” before their romance made headlines.

“[They] are super cute and happy together,” the source gushed, calling the duo a “natural fit.”

Trump Jr. got down on one knee the following December while celebrating Anderson's birthday at Camp David. 

After Page Six exclusively broke the engagement news, President Trump praised their “young love” at the White House Christmas party.

“They get along very well and they are just announcing through me that they're getting married,” the 79-year-old told guests at last month's bash.

The bride-to-be, for her part, gushed about feeling “like the luckiest girl in the world” at the fête.

Trump Jr., notably, was previously married to ex-wife Vanessa Trump, with whom he shares five children.

The exes ended their union in 2018 after more than a decade of marriage, and Trump Jr. moved on with Guilfoyle later that same year.

Guilfoyle has walked down the aisle before as well, marrying California's governor Gavin Newsom in 2001. They divorced in 2006.

As for Anderson, this will be the socialite's first marriage.

Don't count on seeing Jenny McCarthy back on “The View.”

The “Masked Singer” host, 53, appeared on this week's episode of “The Katie Miller” podcast, where she discussed her brief stint as a host on the talk show in 2013 and 2014.

When asked if she would return for a spot at the show's desk “given where they are politically today,” she said, “The reason why they wanted to bring me on is because they, quote, said it was too polarizing. They thought it was too polarizing back then, you guys!”

She explained that her initial role in the cast was to give “light, fluffy, and fun” commentary on “Dancing with the Stars” and “The Bachelor,” but that “only lasted a whole week.”

“And back then, I didn't consider myself to be a political person, which is why I thought I was perfect for the job. After a week, when they said they wanted to get political, I was like, ‘Oh my God, what am I going to do?'” McCarthy noted. 

She had previously claimed producers of the show told her to “act Republican,” though she does lean towards more conservative views.

The former Playboy model pointed out in her conversation with host Katie Miller that she is “much more political” now because “our latest administration has helped so much.” 

“But, back then? Ooh, I would not, I would never even,” she said. “They've asked me to come back for, like, reunion shows. I was like, over my dead body would I ever step foot in that place.”

McCarthy was part of the permanent hosts of “The View” during Season 17, which also included Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg and Sherri Shepherd.

The “Dirty Love” actress recalled leaving the show in a conversation with Andy Cohen in July 2025.

“They let all of us go,” she recalled on SiriusXM's “Radio Andy,” adding that she was begging to be fired.

“What wound up happening was they came into the offices and Sherri came crying into my dressing room saying, ‘I was just let go.'”

McCarthy remembered thinking she didn't “even want to f–king be here” and wondered why it was Shepherd over her. However, as the day continued, several producers were also let go.

“Then I get the phone call. I was like last to get the phone call from my agent. He's like, ‘You're next.' I'm like, ‘Thank God.' It was a massacre,” McCarthy said. “They got rid of a bunch of people.”

	The BBC is facing “quite a lot of pressure” to come off Elon Musk's X, Director General Tim Davie has said, but he stressed it will remain on the platform.


	Speaking to a UK parliamentary committee about the BBC World Service, Davie made the admission as he set out to prove that the BBC remains active where young people are getting their news. 


	His reference to Musk's social media platform came as X faces criticism around the world over its AI tool Grok and deepfake nudes.


	“I have quite a lot of pressure to remove the BBC from X by the way,” Davie told the Public Accounts Committee this morning. “That is not what I will be doing. Because we need to be on these platforms, we need to give quality information onto the social media platforms and bring people onto them. That is critical because otherwise the Chinese and Iranians are ‘flooding the zone' and they are investing very hard.”

	Davie was responding to a question around how less and less young people now say they get their news from the BBC, preferring social media platforms like X and TikTok. He did not elaborate on who is pressuring him to remove the BBC from the platform. 


	BBC talent's use of X has been a constant source of stress for the corporation, with big stars like ex-Match of the Day host Gary Lineker falling foul of the BBC's impartiality rules over tweets. Elsewhere, in April 2023, X changed a label on the main BBC account, saying it is “publicly funded” instead of “government funded media” after the broadcaster objected to the latter term.

	











More pro-Israel complaints than pro-Palestine


	Davie is set to exit the BBC soon following his shock resignation due to the Donald Trump Panorama scandal. He was sat next to the BBC's interim news boss Jonathan Munro, with Munro having temporarily replaced Deborah Turness – another casualty of the Trump fiasco. 


	Speaking to accusations of pro-Palestinian bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, Munro revealed that the BBC gets more complaints about its coverage leaning pro-Israel than in the other direction. The BBC has previously said it is “taking action” on the BBC Arabic “systemic bias” complaints, which were contained in the excoriating leaked Michael Prescott memo that led to Davie and Turness' departure. Coverage of the Israel-Hamas war and its aftermath has proved difficult for the national broadcaster, causing ructions within New Broadcasting House HQ and beyond.


	“We have more complaints overall in the BBC that we are pro-Israeli than the opposite,” said Munro. “Both complaints piles are relatively chunky as you would expect from a polarizing story but it is not the case that everyone thinks we are leaning in a pro-Arabic or pro-Palestinian way. The opposite is actually true.”


	“For the avoidance of doubt,” Munro added that the BBC doesn't “take any perspective [on Israel-Gaza], but in terms of perceptions of audience, it is important to put that into the discussion.”

The anchor's first official broadcast as anchor improves a bit on the network's season average but still trails ABC and NBC by sizable margins.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	The ratings for Tony Dokoupil's debut as anchor of the CBS Evening News are … fine.


	The Jan. 5 edition of CBS' nightly newscast improved some on the show's season averages, but it did not meaningfully close the gap between CBS and network rivals ABC and NBC. CBS has for years ranked a distant third in the 6:30 p.m. newscast ratings.




	Dokoupil's first weeknight turn in the Evening News anchor chair drew 4.37 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, and 596,000 adults 25-54, considered the key demographic for newscasts. (He actually made his debut a little ahead of schedule on Saturday, Jan. 3, following the U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.)

	The 4.37 million viewers for Monday's CBS Evening News is up about 9 percent from its season average of 4.02 million. The 596,000 adults 25-54 who watched Monday's show improved by 20 percent vs. a season average of about 498,500.


	Both figures, however, trail ABC and NBC by a considerable amount. ABC's World News Tonight, per usual, led the 6:30 p.m. network rankings Monday with 8.24 million viewers, and the NBC Nightly News had 7.21 million. NBC led the 25-54 demographic with just under 1.1 million viewers in that age range, while ABC drew 1.02 million.


	One night of a newscast that runs about 250 days each year is not predictive of much, obviously, but Dokoupil's debut has drawn special scrutiny because his hiring was one of the most consequential moves by Bari Weiss, whose first weeks at the network have generated considerable controversy. Dokoupil's tenure as Evening News anchor will presumably be measured in months and years, and longer-term numbers will tell a more complete story.

	











	Dokoupil was named the anchor of the CBS Evening News in December, with CBS News editor-in-chief saying at the time that the former CBS Mornings co-host would help win back viewers' trust. “Americans hungry for fairness will see that on display night after night,” Weiss said in a statement. He replaced John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois in the anchor chair.


	Both Dokoupil and Weiss have drawn some criticism for the anchor's video, released a few days before he took over as anchor, in which he said news media has “put too much weight on the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on [everyday viewers].” He also pledged that the viewers would come first for him. “Not advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests. And, yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS. I report for you.”

The 'Our Games' teaser will run on the first night of NBC's Olympics coverage and during the Super Bowl pregame show, with a shortened spot set to debut during Sunday's NFL wildcard game.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	NBCUniversal is turning to Matt Damon to hype up Olympic fandom.


	Damon, who will play the legendary Greek king Odysseus in Christopher Nolan's upcoming adaptation of The Odyssey for NBCU's Universal Pictures, is set to star in a new campaign for the company's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics coverage.




	“It's not just sports. This is cinema,” says Jenny Storms, the CMO for NBCUniversal television and streaming, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “It is a cinematic Olympics. Italy is a character where star power is really meeting Team USA, and that's where we're definitely going to continue to push the envelope, especially going into L.A.”

	The “Our Games” campaign, which includes multiple promo spots and teasers, sees Damon standing on the top of an Italian mountain (it was actually shot on the ILM Stage on the company's lot in Universal City), as footage of Olympic athletes past and present play (including the 1980 U.S. Olympic men's hockey team, Mikaela Shiffrin, Lindsey Vonn, Jordan Stolz and Ilia Malinin).

	A cut-down promo version will debut during this weekend's NFL wildcard game, with the full-length teaser set to air during the first night of Olympics primetime coverage and a shorter version during the Super Bowl pregame show.


	“The hero's journey, facing trials, enduring sacrifice, persevering against all odds,” Damon says in the initial spot. “An epic quest to fulfill one's destiny, has led here, to northern Italy, where the story continues.”

	











	Watch:


	Storms notes that NBCU's TV and sports team works closely with Donna Langley's Universal Pictures business, and the timing, location and themes of The Odyssey aligned perfectly with what they were trying to accomplish with their Olympic promotional plans.


	“We have a really incredible partnership with Universal Pictures internally, that close connection with that organization gives us really an unmatched opportunity and access to not only the world's biggest stars, but also helps us tie in with the most talked-about films that are coming forward,” Storms says. “This decade-long voyage of Odysseus, it's about grit and ingenuity, and the Winter Games are absolutely full of those arcs. This is a perfect connection when you talk about athletes solving problems in the moment and the world is watching. That's where this Damon piece really makes it feel epic and human all at the same time. And so we're excited about this one to really land now that some of the Odyssey pieces are out there, and that people can start to see those threads and bring them together.”


	NBCU has been making good use of the ILM Stage for its Olympic promos, which have included stars like Ray Romano, Sebastian Maniscalco, Dua Lipa, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, Glenn Powell, and Scarlett Johansson.


	“Another learning coming out of Paris was consumers want to be immersed in the city and in the country, and Italy is a co-star here they are a huge part and a character of these Olympics, whether it's food, fashion or anything else,” Storms says. “How do we bring Italy into these spots? The best way to do it has been through that ILM Stage … they feel like the characters, the athletes, are there in front of the Duomo and things like that, but it also provides us that opportunity of bigness, it is used in major films, motion pictures.”

	











	And the Milan-Cortina Olympics, with their Italian setting and high stakes, are a perfect place to bring that bigness to life within NBCU's sports portfolio.


	“For night one of the Olympics, we want to make a bold statement about these Games and their power to connect us through the inspiring stories of the world's greatest athletes.” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “Matt Damon, one of entertainment's most incredible storytellers, artfully weaves themes of dedication, sacrifice and inspiration into the heart of this tease, setting the stage for what will be the most unifying event in the world and an unforgettable 17 days of competition.”

The Swedish pop icon stopped by Stephen Colbert's "The Late Show" for a performance of her forthcoming album's title track.

	When it comes to popular music, Sweden punches in a different weight class. Think ABBA. Think Roxette, Ace of Base, the late Avicii and Swedish House Mafia. The great songwriter and producer Max Martin is a Swede. Heck, Spotify emerged from Sweden, as did the rogue searchable content index that changed the game, The Pirate Bay.

	The pop icon returns this March with Sexistential, her seventh studio album, and her first since 2018's Honey.


	With the announcement of it Wednesday, Jan. 8, Robyn shared the project's second and third singles, the shimmering dance-pop anthem “Talk To Me,” and “Sexistential,” which a press release explains is “possibly the world's first rap about having one-night stands while 10 weeks pregnant after IVF.”


	Add to that list of tunes “Dopamine,” which arrived last November and got a remix by Jamie xx, the founder of the Young label, Robyn new label home.


	The Stockholm-born star is wasting no time in getting word out. On Wednesday night, the singer and songwriter stopped by Stephen Colbert's The Late Show for a performance of her forthcoming album's title track, “Sexistential”.


	Her visit to the historic Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City is the latest in a bunch of recent public appearances, which including an intimate live show at Los Angeles' Fonda Theater on Nov. 19 and a sold-out show at Brooklyn Paramount on New Year's Eve.

	











Sexistential drops March 27 and sees Robyn reunite with Max Martin for the first time since they co-wrote her 1997 classic “Show Me Love,” one of her two top 10 appearances on the Billboard Hot 100.

“Fire Country” star Leven Rambin seemingly leveled accusations of infidelity and sex addiction against an unnamed ex in a recent TikTok video.

“Guys, I just went on Live and I dropped the most diabolical lore about my entire like, life, my story, my tea” the actress said in a clip shared Saturday, while sitting at a table. 

“I dropped all of the piping hot tea about my ex, my divorce,” she continued. “How I got cheated on by a sex addict who cheated on me with like eight hundred million people and then married the assistant we had together.”

Rambin, 35, continued, “When I asked them if they'd done anything, she said no,” adding that she'd been told “no” even after allegedly finding “all the emails, all the texts, all the DMs and such.”

She added, “I was like, ‘Did he ever try anything with you?' She was like, ‘No, oh my god this is terrible.'”

“Cut to they're married now” Rambin continued with a brief scream. “They got married. I haven't spoken to either one of them obviously, but that was a tough pill to swallow.” 

Though Rambin did not name the person she accused of cheating on her, Rambin was previously married to “True Blood” actor Jim Parrack, 44 — a fact fans noted in the comments thread. 

“Nooooo not Hoyt,” one person speculated, referring to Parrack's “True Blood” character. “Dayum girl. Spill that tea.”

“You were way too pretty for him,” gushed another, with a third adding, “So what I'm hearing is he played himself on supernatural 🤣.”

Others simply offered sympathy. “I'm so sorry you had to deal with this. But as an extremely nosy person THANK YOU for spilling this juicy tea!!” a fourth person remarked. 

Parrack remarried in 2022, while Rambin tied the knot with photographer Dawson Smith back in July. 

A rep for Parrack did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. 

The “Hunger Games” actress and “9-1-1: Lone Star” actor married in Texas in 2015 and split two years later, in 2017. 

In an Instagram post marking six months since her nuptials to Smith, the “Forever Purge” actress gushed over her marriage. 

“Happy six months of marriage to this sweet guy / my favorite source of entertainment/ donkey trainer @dawsonproductions,” she captioned the PDA-packed upload, adding, “don't worry, I'll always be here to remind you of your age 🤣”

Amy Schumer is retaining a sense of humor following her recent filing for divorce from Chris Fischer. Schumer, 44, posted to her Instagram Stories on Wednesday, showing off a photo of herself wearing a baggy, comfortable outfit that was captured in photos and reported on by the Daily Mail earlier in the day. 

“The comedian opted for comfort,” she jokingly copied directly from the outlet's report, adding her own cheeky callout, “Line up boys,” over the shot.

In the photo, Schumer is bundled up an oversized winter coat, leggings, a hoodie, and “black On running shoes,” all crowned by a droopy red knit hat.

The “I Feel Pretty” star filed documents to end the union with Fischer on Tuesday in New York County, People was the first to report.

Her latest social media post is an about-face from the actress's most recent, highly revealing revenge body posts she has been sharing of late.

She put her weight loss transformation on display looking trim in a slew of bathing suits just over the past weekend, noting “My mom took these photos of me while I was packing for a trip.”

Schumer has not been shying away from sharing her mindset for the new year on the heels of her headline-making split from Fischer.

Divorce speculation swirled in November 2025, with the “Last Comic Standing” alum confirming their breakup the following month.

“Blah blah blah Chris and I have made the difficult decision to end our marriage after 7 years. We love each other very much and will continue to focus on raising our son,” she wrote in December 2025, referencing 6-year-old son Gene.

Earlier that same month, Schumer cryptically clarified via Instagram that “whatever ends up happening” with Fischer, 45, had “nothing to do with” her recent weight loss.

The Golden Globe winner, notably, dropped 50 pounds with the help of Mounjaro, years after a “horrible” experience with Wegovy.

Schumer issued an apology to those “let down” by her slimdown last month, writing, “Sorry for whatever feeling it's giving you.”

Hilary Duff is focusing on her spicy new music after getting pulled into Ashley Tisdale's “toxic” mom group drama.

The actress and singer, 38, posted a video of herself Wednesday looking completely unbothered and singing an unreleased track with NSFW lyrics.

Duff, wearing a butter yellow dress, sang the new song in the middle of a grassy field with the sun shining on her.

The song is about a couple wanting to go back to the exciting part of their relationship after losing their spark.

“I only want the beginning, I don't want the end,” she sings. “I want the part where you say goddamn/Back of a dive bar giving you head/Then sneak home late, wake up your roommates.”

“I want the highlights, 10 out of 10/The butterflies from holding your hand,” she continues to sing. “Before we swept us under the bed/And we became practically roommates.”

More suggestive lyrics include, “I'm touching myself by the front door/But you don't even look my way no more.”

The post comes after Duff's husband, Matthew Koma, took a major shot at Tisdale after the “High School Musical” star criticized her former mom group — which appeared to include Duff, Meghan Trainor and Mandy Moore — in an essay for the Cut that went viral.

Although Tisdale's rep denied that she was talking about Duff, Moore and Trainor, Koma clapped back with an Instagram Story post on Tuesday.

The musician posted a fake mocked-up shot of himself on the cover of the Cut with a headline reading, “A mom group tell all through a father's eyes: When You're the Most Self-Obsessed Tone Deaf Person on Earth, Other Moms Tend to Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.”

He added in a sarcastic caption, “Read my new interview with @thecut.”

A source familiar with the drama told Page Six that “Matthew gave [Tisdale] what she had coming.” 

The source also called Tisdale “insufferable,” adding that the friend breakup “has been a long time coming.”

In Tisdale's essay, she claimed she was excluded from hangouts from her former mom group, which made her feel “not cool enough” and “lost” as to why she was being left out.

The actress, 40, said she eventually texted the group, “This is too high school for me and I don't want to take part in it anymore.”

She said she chose to cut ties with them, though she “never considered the moms to be bad people [except for] maybe one.”

Tisdale shares two daughters with her husband, Christopher French: Jupiter Iris, 4, and Emerson Clover, 1.

Netflix made a brief, presumably futile effort today to convince legions of Stranger Things fans—many of whom have spent the week since the show's finale convincing themselves, with at least some measure of sincerity, that a secret extra final episode of the blockbuster series was forthcoming—that the series is, in fact, over. Per Deadline, the streaming service's social media descriptions briefly updated on Wednesday afternoon into an all-caps, hard-not-to-read-as-harried-sounding “ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING.” (The descriptions have since shifted to promoting the upcoming movie People We Meet On Vacation.)

As we reported back on Monday, a fan theory called “Conformity Gate” has been sweeping through Stranger Things fandom ever since the finale aired, as fans have glommed on to various clues that “prove” that the show's mostly happily ever after ending was a dirty trick being planted in the protagonists' brains by psychic big bad Vecna. The theory went on to suggest that a real finale would air on January 7, 2026, because that's Orthodox Christmas, and all of the other parts of the show's fifth season have been dropped on holidays. (Note to wannabe conspiracy theorists: Maybe don't hinge your hopes and dreams on Netflix scheduling folk knowing a lot about Orthodox Christmas.) As noted by Deadline, the lack of a sudden “real” finale coming to upend the established status quo, undo that final scene the Duffer brothers have been talking about filming for years at this point, and make fools out of everybody who paid to go see the actual finale in theaters on New Year's Eve, has elicited a wide variety of reactions from true believers, from anger, to a rueful belief that the “Vecna mind-controlled everybody” twist could just be how the series ends, to a more general acknowledgement that holding tight to fan theories was a way to keep the show alive just a little bit longer.

What we're seeing, in other words, is a generation of folks for whom this show was foundational, and constituted a lot of firsts, coming to terms with their first instance of highly relatable experience Your TV Show Just Disappointed You With Its Ending. As such, it's hard to be too hard on the young folks signing Change.org petitions, putting together “proof” videos, and otherwise nerding out together to try to figure out why a show that's been with them for a huge chunk of their lives just left them a little hollow feeling at the end. It's a natural part of any evolving TV fan's relationship with the medium: Endings are hard, relatively few projects can manage them with any elegance even before you factor in how many moving parts Stranger Things had there at the end, and coming to terms with the absence of a guaranteed satisfying resolution is a key part of maturing into someone who thinks critically about the art they consume. If that kicks out a few wild conspiracy theories and yarn-covered cork boards in the process, then that's presumably just a byproduct of figuring out how to grow up in the upside down world of modern online entertainment.

	“As someone who grew up loving Sports Illustrated, I'm looking forward to being a part of this weekend where sports and entertainment meet at the highest level,” Ludacris tells Billboard. “Sports Illustrated is known for longevity and excellence, so I plan on matching that energy, delivering a show that people will be talking about long after it's over. This is going to be one for the record books!”




	“We're pumped to return to the Sports Illustrated Super Bowl party after an incredible event last year,” Chainsmokers members Alex Pall and Drew Taggart tell Billboard. “This year we're going all out and can't wait to bring something even bigger for Super Bowl weekend.” 


	In addition to the headliners, the release promises the addition of “special guests” and some “surprise moments” throughout the night, as well as branded activations from partners and a Lexus LX VIP Lounge for VIP ticketholders.


	SI The Party, produced by Authentic Live and Medium Rare, is a wind-up to the big game, often drawing a mix of fans, league owners, franchise execs, athletes and stars. Past A-list attendees have included Alex Rodriguez, Shaquille O'Neal, Justin and Hailey Bieber, Kim Kardashian, Miles Teller, Machine Gun Kelly, Kevin Hart, Leonardo DiCaprio and others.


	Premium all-inclusive tickets, VIP access and VIP tables will go on sale Thursday (Jan. 8) at 10 a.m. PT via the event's website.


	“Across Big Game Weekend and other tentpole moments on the world's biggest sporting stages, our vision with SI The Party has always been to deliver hospitality that feels intimate and insider, even at the largest events in the world, creating the most unforgettable night of Big Game Weekend where the energy and star power of sports truly comes to life off the field,” said Matt Goldstein, EVP of Entertainment and Special Projects at Authentic and head of Authentic Live, the live events division of Authentic and coproducer of the event, in a statement.


	Last year's event at Mardi Gras World in New Orleans was headlined by Diplo and Dom Dolla, with The Chainsmokers, Bebe Rexha and Kygo headlining the 2024 edition at the Wynn Las Vegas' XS Nightclub. The Chainsmokers also co-headlined the 2023 show alongside Machine Gun Kelly.

	











	Super Bowl LX will take place on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

A warning up top, before we dig in here: This article contains usage of the word “snackable” in contexts where it is not being applied to anything that has been fried, battered, or flavor-blasted; we apologize to anyone who's been rendered snackability intolerant by years of modern TV marketing speak.

Anyway, Disney+ is gearing up to get snackable as hell, with Deadline reporting that the streaming service will soon be incorporating a heavy slathering of vertical videos into its digital offerings in order to better colonize our brains. The issue, apparently, being that while people do subscribe to the service—at roughly 200 million subscribers, it's the fourth-biggest streaming service on the planet, competing only with Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney's own Hotstar platform in India for the honor—they aren't logging into it every single day, as part of their regular routines, in order to mindlessly scroll through crap.

Sorry, no, we meant to say, they aren't enjoying vertical videos that are “are really great as daily habits, snackable, short, bite-sized experiences,” according to EVP of product management Erin Teague, who did not go on to just straight-up say “You know, like TikTok, or YouTube Shorts.” The push was presented at CES this week as an enticement to advertisers, who would presumably be very excited to do a little snacking of their own on the brains of legions of people flicking through video after video, potentially pulled from categories like “original short-form programming, repurposed social clips, refashioned scenes from longer-form episodic or feature titles, or a combination.”

All of this, Disney would like you to know, is really just about meeting people “where they are. This is what Gen Z and Gen Alpha are expecting. They are not necessarily thinking about sitting down, watching a long-form, two-and-a-half hour piece of content on their phones.” And, sure, it feels worth noting that the social media platforms this move is presumably meant to mimic are social media platforms—with built-in audiences of millions of content creators churning out all that snackable content for their fellow subscribers to consume, as opposed to, say, one company trying to generate the same effect via chopping and screwing its own limited pool of material to better appeal to our attention-deprived minds. But, on the other hand… Okay, actually, we can't think of a good “on the other hand” here. But, then, we're not big, exciting Disney marketing brains, pushing forward into bold new definitions of the once-innocuous word “snack.”

Fran Drescher is opening up about one of the most defining chapters of her life, reflecting on surviving cancer, processing long-held trauma and how those experiences reshaped her priorities. More than two decades after her diagnosis, the actress says the journey continues to inform how she lives, works and cares for herself today.

In a recent interview with People, the 68-year-old revealed she was diagnosed with uterine cancer at age 42, a diagnosis that initially went unnoticed because she did not fit the typical risk profile, per the Daily Mail. Drescher explained that uterine cancer usually affects postmenopausal or obese women, neither of which applied to her at the time. Because of that, she believes she “slipped between the cracks.” Still, the cancer was caught at stage one, meaning it had not penetrated the uterine lining, something she now views as a stroke of luck.

The diagnosis forced Drescher to confront painful realities, including the loss of her ability to have children. At the time, she was in a relationship with a younger partner and hoped to become a mother for the first time. Instead of freezing her eggs, she had to prioritize cancer treatment, a loss she has described as deeply heartbreaking.

Drescher has also spoken candidly about the emotional weight surrounding her illness. In past interviews, including comments previously shared with CNN, she has said she believes her cancer was linked to a violent sexual assault she survived in her 20s. After the attack, she said she buried herself in work and caregiving, never fully addressing her own pain. Over time, she came to believe that unresolved trauma found a physical outlet.

She has since urged women not to ignore warning signs or put everyone else first at the expense of their own health. “Don't ignore something and hope it goes away,” she has warned, encouraging women to listen to their bodies and seek care early.

In June 2025, Drescher marked a major milestone, celebrating 25 years cancer-free. She shared a makeup-free video from Italy, calling it her “25th anniversary of wellness.” During the trip, she reflected on her recovery, thanked those who supported her through her illness and highlighted the work of Cancer Schmancer, the advocacy movement she launched alongside her 2002 book focused on prevention and early detection.

She also shared her personal philosophy on health, emphasizing the connection between how people live, think and feel, and encouraging gratitude and balance between mind, body and spirit, per Parade.

Today, Drescher says she feels grounded and empowered. She is enjoying a renewed moment in her career, including her role in the film “Marty Supreme,” while continuing to speak openly about survival and self-care. Looking back, she sees her story as one shaped by resilience and hard-earned wisdom. As she put it simply, “You can't stop me.”

      Before we get to the quotes about the biologics, here some info about her:
    


      Dr. Anna Brady-Estevez is a deep tech venture capitalist, founding partner of American DeepTech. She holds a PhD in chemical/environmental engineering from Yale and previously directed SBIR programs at the NSF, investing in space, energy, and blockchain startups. She advocates for UAP transparency
    


      Recently Karl Nell said something that i think is related to her role:
    


Timestamp 40:40:
    


      Karl Nell: "The UAP Disclosure Act (UAPDA) was going to be followed by UAP Whistleblower Protection Act (UAPWPA), which was going to be followed by a UAP Truth and Reconciliation Act (UAPTRA). And several of these are already written. They're ready to go, right?"
    


      Karl Nell: "And so, you know, this program probably still needs to continue. And this idea of eminent domain that a lot of people are kind of concerned about, is a phase in a bigger plan that goes into a consortia phase, and into a regulated market phase"
    


      So i think this Anna Brady-Estevez maybe played that role to get companies interested in the tech. See the purple section on this slide from Karl Nells presentation (mirror)
    


      Now on to what she said in yesterdays interview:
    


Timestamp 35:25:
    


      Martin Willis: "And so I want to ask you first of all how you felt about all that [reverse engineering and biologics] when you first heard about it. Did you think it's a possibility?"
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "[...] I've actually subsequently seen biologics, but I'll get into that [...]
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "[...] I've actually spoken about some of these things before and I've been a little bit uncomfortable talking about it too, but [she whispers] it's been edited out"
    


      Martin Willis: "So, did I hear you say just a minute ago that you have seen biologics?"
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "[... ]does [biologics] mean it's engineered? I mean what does that mean? Why are they using the word biologic? So what I've subsequently seen is... which I understand might be very close to what David had seen is in terms of, not necessarily the same place, not necessarily the same beings, but something perhaps similar, was these exotic biologics"
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "And when I say exotic biologics, they... I went with a doctor... they are not human. The doctor said not human. There's been DNA testing [...] the shared DNA testing which should be validated, is that it's 15% overlap with terrestrial DNA. 30% overlap with terrestrial DNA. Which is very very very very low"
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "So those tests can be complex, on archaeological samples. So it's not that there aren't errors that could be introduced, including having a much, the newer terrestrial DNA being amplified up to a much and it's it doesn't need to be terrestrial"
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "It could be common type DNA. But seeing something that is not human does not make it extraterrestrial, right? So that's why, saying something like exotic biologics, it's not really stating exactly what it is"
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "if anybody's been to the Smithsonian, and they've seen that exhibit where [...] there's the Neanderthalss, there's the Florenis, there's there's these different species, human or homminid type species"
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "[...] it's something that is not human, but that does not mean that it's extraterrestrial. Although there are some indications of some things that are really very very different from human"
    


Timestamp 53:03:
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "[...] how would I develop that? Whether it's NHI, whether it's advanced military... how would I build that? And it can also just be inspiration. I know you've talked about consciousness, so [...] we're looking at why is something much higher performing?
    


      Anna Brady-Estevez: "But on the biologic side some of these things have really bizarre implants. So, is there like medical implants? Is there some utility from those implants? Is that something that would be worth doing? Is it something that you want to stay away from? So, there's biologic impacts of some of these technologies. There's the consciousness, there are people [...]"
    


      She continues to describe that from the hundreds of entrepeneurs and businesses she has funded, some of them report getting their information from "somewhere else".
    


      For all of the above, i do wonder if she is talking about those dried up Peru tridactyl mummies. But those are reported to have 70% human DNA. So not consistent with what she says. They did have implants. I know very little about the tridactyl stuff and this is just what my AI told me. I think its more likely she is talking about those tridactyl mummies than that she had access to biologics from the legacy program. We know Grusch told Burlison to have a look at them, so Grusch must think they are similar to what he has seen.
    


      She said a lot more about the biologics, and i removed about 50% of it to keep the post short. I recommend people to watch it from about timestamp 35:25 onwards
    


      The question of the most convincing UFO sighting ever recorded is complex and often depends on individual belief and the nature of the evidence. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples:
    


      Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail.
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): "Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel."



President Jimmy Carter: "If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one."



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: "I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla..."



President Barack Obama: "What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are."



      While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: "The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting." - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee.
    


      Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling.
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: "Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom."



Corroboration: "I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft."



Triangular Craft Sighting: ["I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/

Uri Geller has offered his island off the coast of East Lothian to Donald Trump as a military base. The spoon-bending psychic, 79, addressed the US president in a bizarre video shared on social media.

His offer came following Trump's announcement he wanted to take over Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, as the 51st US state. The president previously claimed it would be vital to US national security.

Its location, between North America and the Arctic, means it is well-placed for early warning systems should a missile attack occur, and monitoring activity in the region's waters.

Trump first attempted to buy the territory during his first term in the White House in 2019, but was told by Denmark it was not for sale.

Geller bought Lamb Island, located in the Firth of Forth near North Berwick, 18 years ago, and claimed this week it was "blessed by supernatural powers", and had a "mind-blowing" connection to Greenland.

He said in a video on X: "When I bought the island, I knew why, and I still know it today. America needs Greenland."

He added: "Not just America needs Greenland, the whole world needs Greenland."

The video was captioned: "President Trump, I can solve the problem with Greenland. Adopt my Scottish Lamb Island as your 51st state and use it as a military base!

"Dock your navy and aircraft there - and if you get into a war with China, I will come to your rescue. Lamb is protected by mystical forces and you will succeed with its power.

"All Greenlanders can become citizens of Lamb, so Denmark does not need to worry."

The psychic previously said he believed his island, which he declared his own micronation with its own flag and national anthem, had a link to Ancient Egypt and the Great Pyramids of Giza.

A24 is about to expose viewers to the sound of pure terror with its new horror film, Undertone. Right in time for the witching hour, the indie giant released the first trailer overnight, introducing The Handmaid's Tale alum Nina Kiri as Evy, a paranormal skeptic who's about to become a believer. The film follows the host of the titular popular horror-tinged true-crime podcast during a recording session when she's sent a series of terrifying audio files to review for the show. She soon realizes, however, that they are more than just deeply disturbing sounds, but legitimately haunted recordings that turn her life into a waking nightmare.

The footage begins with Evy, the in-house skeptic of the Undertone podcast, doing her intro and teeing up an episode focused on the files shared by her co-host, who's a believer in the supernatural. Everything they received came from an anonymous email, but as the pair starts digging into them, all Evy hears is a jumble of mildly creepy sounds. Her partner, however, believes he can pick up a message when playing the recordings in reverse. Everything quickly takes a turn as more words become discernible, a nerve-shredding version of "Baa Baa Black Sheep" plays, and the hauntings seem to spread into the host's house. The lights start to flicker, there's banging throughout the house, and the clock starts speeding back to 3 a.m., all signs that tell even Evy that something is horribly wrong and they should stop the session. It's too late, however, as the back half of the trailer sees the garbled words of the recordings spread beyond her headphones and throughout her home, teasing a demonic presence that demands to be heard.

Undertone marks the feature directorial and writing debut of Ian Tuason. Like fellow filmmakers Skinamarink's Kyle Edward Ball and Talk to Me's Danny and Michael Philippou, Tuason first gained recognition on YouTube, making virtual reality horror shorts that racked up millions of views and earned showcases at SXSW and beyond. While Kiri will get the bulk of the screentime in his first film and was the only person physically seen in the trailer aside from a haunting background figure, she won't be alone for the horror. The White Lotus and Overcompensating star Adam DiMarco is also on board, alongside Michèle Duquet, Keana Lyn Bastidas, and Jeff Yung. Dan Slater and Cody Calahan are set to produce.

A24 jumped all over Undertone following its much-lauded premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival last year. The slow-burning horror mystery earned rave reviews for its haunting atmosphere and attention to detail, using the in-universe podcast to create a uniquely rich soundscape for terror. Tuason's debut feature was impressive enough that he's already set to make a massive step-up in his career with a legendary found footage franchise — Paranormal Activity. Back in December, he was tapped to helm the upcoming reboot entry being produced by James Wan at Blumhouse-Atomic Monster. Given Undertone's setup, it appears to be a match made in heaven for the filmmaker, and it's moving along quickly at the banner.

Undertone arrives in theaters on March 13. Check out the trailer in the player above.

Nearly six years after the finale, fans are still hoping for a revival of the long-running fantasy TV show, Supernatural, which has had an immense impact on pop culture. Though the two main actors in the series, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, have had successful careers since the conclusion, they have both expressed an interest in returning to the roles that continue to define their reputations.

As a potential revival project continues to be discussed, there are a few obvious characters that fans expect to return to Supernatural, including Misha Collins' Castiel. However, several other side characters from the series will also be hoped for in a reboot. These characters had a significant impact on the Winchesters' arcs and the overall storyline, making them critical players in any new plot.

 Claire Novak is one of the best female characters in Supernatural, first introduced as the little girl of Jimmy Novak, the vessel of the angel Castiel. Years later, Claire comes back as a troubled teen who blames Castiel for her difficult life, including her mother abandoning her and her growing up in group homes. Eventually, she becomes a member of Jody Mills' household, hunting monsters despite the objections of others.

Claire is a controversial Supernatural side character, known for her tough and harsh personality. However, fans would still like to see the Wayward Sisters spinoff, which was proposed and would have focused on Jody Mills and her pupils, including Claire. Despite being a significant character in Castiel's storyline, she was largely overlooked in the last few seasons, appearing only a couple of times as a side plot between the major conflicts.

Some viewers preferred the other side characters and found Claire unlikable, but she's still one of the most fascinating characters, with enough substance to support a Supernatural spinoff series. What is most appreciated about Claire's inclusion is how she represents the next generation of hunters who will take up the torch after those like Sam and Dean. If there is ever to be a revival, the storyline cannot forget about this next generation.

 Garth has one of the best character introductions in Supernatural, appearing in one of the most controversial episodes in the series, yet he still manages to leave an impression. Despite being unorthodox and goofy, he quickly becomes a cherished friend of Dean, who relies on the hunter several times throughout the years. Garth doesn't work like many of the other hunters introduced, but always manages to take down the villain and survive another day.

At one point in Garth's plot in Supernatural, he becomes a werewolf, which typically results in hunters taking their own lives to avoid becoming the monsters they hunt or having another hunter eliminate them. Garth defied the odds, learning to control his impulses as a werewolf. In the end, he is married to another werewolf with children and supports others of his kind who live in peace without hurting humans.

Garth has one of the best story arcs in Supernatural because he provides nuance, proving that not all the monsters of the world are evil and need to be taken out by hunters. Characters like him showed others, like Dean Winchester, that the world is more complex than they initially believed. His role is a crucial representation of the complexities of the overall world-building.

 Rowena MacLeod's story began as a powerful villain in Supernatural, introduced as an ancient witch who keeps herself alive through dark magic and works to get Lucifer out of Hell's cage, hoping it would benefit her. However, she eventually becomes a powerful ally to the Winchesters, especially after Lucifer kills and discards her (from which she resurrects herself with a spell). She is also known as the mother of the demon Crowley, who became the King of Hell to spite his absent mother.

Though Rowena was rarely someone the Winchesters could trust entirely, she had one of the most impressive plot twists in Supernatural. In Season 15, Rowena sacrificed herself by absorbing all the souls from Hell to keep them from destroying Earth. Regardless of all of her bad acts previously, this selfless act solidified the witch as one of the most heroic characters in the TV show.

In another shocking twist, Rowena came back as the Queen of Hell in the final season, thanking Sam Winchester for killing her (which she demanded of him at the time) so she could finally take the position of power she always wanted. Considering Rowena's morally gray characterization, this seemed like the perfect ending for her. However, most fans would love to see her return for a revival, especially if there is another conflict between Heaven and Hell.

Jack Kline is one of the most powerful Supernatural characters ever, fathered by Lucifer and born to a human mother, Kelly Kline, who sacrificed her life to bring him into the world. Born into the world in the appearance of a teenager, Jack had an unusual storyline from beginning to end. As the child of the devil, he was never fully trusted by any of his allies and fought hard to understand his immense power and his place in the world.

Jack is another controversial personality within the fandom due to his questionable actions, including accidentally killing the Winchesters' mother, Mary, but he is still one of the most impressive characters in Supernatural. Despite the odds, Jack ended up siding with good and helped take down God when he tried to destroy the world. Without the Almighty, Jack took over the role and chose to restore balance.

Supernatural's series finale left a lot of fans wanting more, but Jack had one of the most satisfying conclusions of any character. Considering his position in the final season, there is a high likelihood that he will play a role in any revival that brings back Sam and Dean Winchester, who are both in Heaven by the conclusion.

 One of the most devastating stories in Supernatural is that of Jody Mills, the sheriff of Sioux Falls, who loses her son and husband during an encounter with the dark supernatural world around her. It is this experience that connects Jody with the Winchesters and Bobby Singer on a more personal level, becoming a part of their trusted inner circle. Though she occasionally helps them with cases, Jody eventually becomes a respected and skilled hunter.

Jody Mills isn't just one of the best hunters in Supernatural, but an endearing character who fills the role of mother and friend for several characters. She loses her own child to tragedy, but takes in Claire Novak, Alex Jones, a girl raised by vampires, and also Kaia, a girl from another dimension. By the conclusion, she is a safe person for dozens of characters harmed by supernatural beings, but is also the one people can count on to give them tough love as well as endearing encouragement.

Among the hundreds of side characters throughout the fifteen seasons, Jody is one of the overall best characters in Supernatural, beloved as much as significant supporting characters like Bobby Singer and Castiel. As one of the most trustworthy people in the Winchesters' chosen family, a revival could not happen without bringing back Sheriff Mills.

 Ben Braeden played an underrated role in Dean Winchester's character arc, originally introduced as the son of Dean's old flame, Lisa, whom Dean initially thinks is his own child. Though Ben turns out not to be Dean's biological son, he joins their family in Season 6 when he believes Sam is in Hell. Dean's experiences with Lisa and Ben give him a taste of a normal life before he is pulled back into the dangerous world of hunting.

One of the most infuriating storylines in Supernatural is when Dean has Castiel take the memories Lisa and Ben have of him after they're attacked by a demon. Many viewers considered this a cheap and heartbreaking way to end their storyline, especially considering how important they became to Dean. This time, having a family shaped Dean's characterization, though they were rarely mentioned after Season 6.

This is one of the frustrating Supernatural storylines that fans hope get addressed in a revival. While Lisa was also a critical character, there is no denying that Dean had a special bond as a surrogate father to Ben. It would be thrilling to see the boy come back as an adult, potentially taking up monster hunting even after losing his memories of Dean.

I would love to see Claire return and was disappointed we didn't get the Wayward Daughters spinoff but it worked out for the best for Kathryn Newton since she has gone on to become a movie star and if she had done the spinoff show she might never have got the lead role in 'Freaky.' Kathryn still loves 'Supernatural' though and she has said she would return if they brought the show back and she was going to appear in the final episode but the pandemic stopped her.

The lights are not a sign of alien life but rather from a Starlink Satellite. 

The satellites can appear as a string of pearls or a“train” of bright lights moving across the night sky.
