                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This interaction could help explain both why quantum processes can occur within environments like the brain and why we lose consciousness under anesthesia. In the mid-1990s, cognitive scientist David Chalmers pondered what he referred to as the “hard problem of consciousness,” which (to put it simply) asked why humans have subjective experience—a far cry from the integration of information that can be described by modern neuroscience. In the ensuing three decades, scientists and philosophers alike have developed numerous theories that are a possible answer to this “hard question,” with names like Global Workspace Theory and Integrated Information Theory. However, there are a subset of scientists and thinkers who think that the true answer lies in the quantum realm—more specifically, in our anatomical mind's interaction with that realm. Nobel Prize-laureate Roger Penrose believed that these quantum interactions could explain consciousness, and the resulting theory (along with his work with Stuart Hameroff) eventually became Orchestrated Objective Reduction. Specially, Keppler said, neurological circuits known as cortical microcolumns could be coupling directly with the zero-point field—the lowest-state of quantum fields, whose existence helps explain certain phenomena like the Casimir effect and why helium doesn't freeze even at absolute zero. “In this theory, the vacuum is not empty but filled with a fluctuating ocean of energy known as the electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF),” Keppler wrote for Phys.org. According to Keppler, glutamate-ZPF coupling answers a few outstanding questions about quantum interactions and consciousness. It's been long stated that the brain is too “warm and wet” for quantum coherence, which (at least in quantum computers) requires extremely cold temperatures—though, thinkers like Hameroff dispute this point. This coupling could also explain the effects of anesthesia, which can pretty effectively sever a human's subjective conscious experience. According to Keppler, anesthesia disrupts the brain's self-organized criticality, which would explain why we experience unconsciousness. In response to Penrose's own quantum theory, the great physicist's collaborator Stephen Hawking once wrote that “his argument seemed to be that consciousness is a mystery and quantum gravity is another mystery so they must be related.” Could it be that quantum theories of consciousness are examples of some kind of Holmesian fallacy? It's certainly possible, but until we do finally answer that ever-elusive “hard problem,” all ideas are on the table.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sea anemones and jellyfish don't have brains, but the way their neurons behave during sleep shows some surprising similarities to humans Jellyfish and sea anemones are curious creatures: these organisms evolved without a brain and, as scientists discovered only in the past few years, don't need one to sleep. The animals do, however, have neurons—nerve cells that appear interconnected throughout their body. And now a new study shows that how these animals sleep is surprisingly similar to humans, suggesting that sleep may have evolved before even the most primitive brains. The findings, published on Tuesday in Nature Communications, also help answer one of science's prevailing mysteries: Why do animals sleep? “This confirms that sleep allows a window for key housekeeping tasks,” says Philippe Mourrain, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, who studies sleep.

The new work shows this function of sleep has been conserved across evolution, he says, from the animals, such as primates, that have one of the most complex brains to cnidarians, such as jellyfish, which have none. Curiously, the study finds that jellyfish appear to enter a sleeplike state for around eight hours a day and generally at night—a schedule many humans might recognize. Sea anemones also appear to sleep for around a third of the day. Claire Cameron is the Breaking News Chief at Scientific American. Originally from Scotland, she moved to New York in 2012.

Xenotransplantation of gene-edited pig kidneys offers a promising solution to the shortage of kidneys for organ transplantation. We recently performed a gene-edited pig kidney transplantation into a living human recipient with end-stage kidney disease. Here, using transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and multiplexed imaging, we conducted high-dimensional immune profiling in this individual. Despite profound depletion of circulating T cells, early T cell-mediated rejection occurred within 1 week after transplantation, likely driven by subtherapeutic immunosuppression and the presence of residual CD8+ T cells in lymph nodes. This T cell-mediated rejection event was reversed by intensified immunosuppression. After treatment, adaptive immunity remained suppressed, whereas innate immune activation, characterized by sustained monocyte and macrophage activity along with elevated levels of interleukin-1 beta and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, persisted. Comparative transcriptomic analysis showed that xenograft rejection profiles resembled those typically observed in human allograft rejection, while also revealing unique innate immune signatures. We did not detect antibody-mediated rejection. The levels of circulating pig donor-derived cell-free DNA rose during the initial rejection episode and declined with treatment, supporting the potential of cell-free DNA measurements as a noninvasive biomarker of xenograft rejection. These findings define the distinct immune landscape of kidney xenotransplantation and highlight the need for regimens targeting both innate and adaptive immunity to improve outcomes. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 25 million individuals in the USA, with many progressing to end-stage renal disease1. For these patients, kidney transplantation remains the gold standard treatment. However, the severe shortage of transplantable organs forces most patients to rely on dialysis. While dialysis is essential for maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality risks2,3. Alarmingly, more than half of the patients on the transplant waiting list will succumb to the disease within an average of 5 years1—a prognosis worse than many cancers—or become too ill to undergo transplantation by the time a kidney becomes available. Xenotransplantation, the transplantation of organs from nonhuman species into humans, offers a promising solution to the critical organ shortage. If genetically engineered pig kidneys can demonstrate sustained safety and functional superiority over dialysis, they could provide a scalable and transformative alternative for the tens of thousands of patients awaiting life-saving transplants. Advances in gene editing have enabled the development of pigs with enhanced immunological compatibility with human recipients4. These donor pigs, raised under stringent controlled conditions, provide kidneys similar in size and function to human organs while harboring genetic modifications designed to mitigate immune rejection. On 16 March 2024, a historic milestone in transplantation was achieved at Massachusetts General Hospital with the xenotransplantation of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living human recipient5. In this groundbreaking procedure, a Yucatan pig kidney containing 69 genetic modifications (EGEN-2784) was successfully transplanted into a 62-year-old male patient. While nonhuman primate models have shown promising xenograft survival with optimized immunosuppressive regimens across different swine donors4,6,7,8,9, the human immune system presents greater immunological challenges, including a high frequency of memory cells driven by prior vaccinations, diet and infections. As rejection remains an important obstacle, comprehensive characterization of immune responses following xenotransplantation is crucial for guiding future strategies. The complexity of human immune responses is influenced by diverse factors such as genetic variability, age, chronic infections and environmental exposures. A comprehensive, multidimensional, longitudinal systems immunology approach is essential to uncover connections between biological pathways, the immunosuppression regimen and clinical outcomes. Here we employed different layers of biological information to systematically perform high-dimensional profiling of the evolving immune landscape in this human kidney xenotransplantation. By integrating longitudinal immune monitoring with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we aimed to unravel the complexities of human-xenograft interaction, define the immunological consequences, and identify key molecular pathways driving rejection and their correlation with clinical parameters. The findings provide critical insights into xenogeneic immune responses and have the potential to refine immunosuppressive strategies and possibly future porcine genetic edits, ultimately improving clinical outcomes in xenotransplantation. To comprehensively assess the immune response triggered by kidney xenotransplantation, we characterized the recipient's immune profile using proteomics, metabolomics and clinical measurements (Fig. Using an unbiased, longitudinal, multilayered integrative approach, we identified three distinct immune clusters associated with xenotransplantation (Extended Data Fig. Cluster analysis based on silhouette scores confirmed that three clusters provided the optimal separation (Supplementary Fig. 1): one cluster was defined by a progressive decline in analytes over time (Extended Data Fig. 1a), another showed an increase post-transplantation (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and the third displayed no clear temporal pattern (Extended Data Fig. a, Research protocol and sample collection schedule. b, Integrative clustering of proteomics, metabolomics and clinical parameters using Fuzzy C-Means clustering across all time points. c, Network analysis integrating proteomics, metabolomics and clinical data, highlighting modules associated with immune-effector responses, cytokine-mediated responses and T cell proliferation and activation. d, Longitudinal measurements of circulating protein levels impacted by the immunosuppression regimen. e, Longitudinal measurements of clinical biomarkers, including creatinine, cystatin C, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose and magnesium. Focusing on the cluster of analytes that declined over time (Fig. 1a), we hypothesized that the immunosuppressive regimen was a key driver of these changes. The regimen included rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG), rituximab (anti-CD20), high-dose steroids and an anti-C5 antibody (ravulizumab) as induction therapy, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with Fc-modified anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (tegoprubart), tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and prednisone (Extended Data Fig. Network analysis with those declining features demonstrated that this cluster was enriched for pathways related to effector immune responses, cytokine-mediated signaling and T cell proliferation and activation (Fig. Notably, when investigating individual features, we found that several downregulated proteins corresponded to specific effects of immunosuppressive drugs, including CD19 (rituximab), CD8A and CD4 (ATG), interleukin-2 RA (IL-2RA) (tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid), GZMB and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid), CD80 (mycophenolic acid), ITGAM and CXCL9/10 (tegoprubart) (Fig. CD19 was selected over CD20 as a marker of B cell depletion because it is more broadly expressed across B cell subsets and remains a stable and reliable surrogate following rituximab treatment, whereas CD20 expression can be variably affected by antibody binding. This immune modulation was associated with improved graft function, reflected by declining creatinine and cystatin C levels. Additional laboratory trends, including reductions in glucose and magnesium and a fluctuating lactate dehydrogenase pattern, were also observed (Fig. 1e), though these are influenced by multiple factors beyond allograft status. Several T cell-associated metabolites, such as homocysteine10, caproic acid11 and oxoglutaric acid12, also showed substantial reductions following xenotransplantation (Fig. In addition, we observed a decrease in indoxyl, a metabolite linked to chronic kidney disease13,14 and end-stage renal disease15, correlating with improved kidney function observed in our xenotransplant recipient5. Together, these findings demonstrate a striking shift in the circulating immune composition following xenotransplantation, consistent with the selective targeting of adaptive immunity by the immunosuppressive regimen. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at six time points to gain a high-resolution view of the systemic cellular immune dynamics. After quality filtering, approximately 36,000 high-quality cells were analyzed. To better identify the immune subsets, we integrated the longitudinal recipient samples with 22 external healthy control samples from public PBMC datasets. Integrative analysis identified 17 unsupervised distinct cell clusters based on their transcriptomic profiles (Fig. Using Louvain clustering, we annotated PBMC subsets and mapped their dynamic proportions over time (Fig. Integration of longitudinal scRNA-seq data into a temporal UMAP embedding revealed a progressive decline in adaptive immune cells, accompanied by an increase in innate immune cells observed at all post-transplant time points relative to baseline (Fig. Specifically, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells exhibited a profound reduction compared to pretransplant (Fig. A xeno-crossmatch assay, incubating the recipient's serum with donor pig PBMCs, detected no xenoantibodies (Extended Data Fig. 4), consistent with B cell depletion and ongoing blockade of CD40–CD40L costimulation. a, UMAP plot illustrating the PBMC subsets identified by scRNA-seq. b, Proportions of innate and adaptive immune cells in PBMC samples over time. c, The proportion (percentages) of PBMC subsets, derived from single-cell RNA-seq, at the indicated time points. Cell fractions were calculated excluding erythrocytes and megakaryocytes/platelets. d, Circulating immune cell subsets, as quantified by flow cytometry at the indicated time points. Cell fractions represent percentages of viable lymphocytes. 2 for gating strategies related to the flow cytometry analysis. In contrast to adaptive immune cells, innate myeloid populations, including CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and conventional dendritic cells, were proportionally increased over time relative to pretransplant (Fig. A detailed characterization of monocyte subsets revealed distinct gene expression profiles over time, using the pretransplant time point as baseline. We identified three major gene expression patterns: gene set 1 (red) included genes upregulated after transplantation; gene set 2 (green) comprised genes that were downregulated; and gene set 3 (purple) contained genes predominantly expressed by CD16⁺ monocytes (Extended Data Fig. Most differentially expressed genes were associated with the migration and differentiation of circulating monocytes into peripheral tissues, including DDIT416, IL1R217, C1QB18, CX3CR119, DUSP520 and EGR121. Flow cytometry validated the scRNA-seq findings, revealing a pronounced decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Treg cells and B cells (Fig. 2), along with a relative expansion of CD14+ monocytes and conventional dendritic cells compared to pretransplant levels (Fig. These findings indicate a profound shift in the systemic immune landscape, characterized by a suppression of adaptive immunity and the emergence of an innate immune signature. The second immune cluster identified through multi-omics analysis consisted of analytes that increased following xenotransplantation (Fig. This cluster was enriched for pathways associated with innate immune activation, including the Toll-like receptor 4 cascade, IL-1 signaling and Fc-receptor signaling (Fig. Key signaling molecules within these pathways, such as BIRC2, MAPK8, MAP2K3, IKBKB and IKBKG were upregulated (Fig. Moreover, levels of inflammatory metabolites, including L-kynurenine22 and eicosenoic acid23, also increased following xenotransplantation (Fig. a, Integrative clustering of clinical, proteomic and metabolomic data using Fuzzy C-Means clustering across all time points. Normalized multi-omics revealed analytes that increased after xenotransplant despite the administered immunosuppressive regimen. b, Network analysis integrating proteomic and metabolomic data shows several modules enriched for innate immunity pathways. c, Experimental scheme showing that recipient PBMCs obtained at multiple time points were stimulated for 24 h with a regimen of TLR ligands (LPS, Pam3CSK4, R848 and p:IC), following which cytokine concentrations were measured in supernatants using a Luminex device. d–g, Longitudinal concentrations of IL-1β (d), IL-6 (e), IL-8 (f) and GM-CSF (g) following TLR ligand stimulation. To further investigate the functional implications of these findings, we measured cytokine production in response to innate immune stimulation (Fig. From analysis of 65 cytokines, we detected increases in IL-1β (Fig. 3f) and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Fig. 3g) following PBMC stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. This cytokine surge paralleled the expansion of monocytes and conventional dendritic cells, suggesting heightened TLR and NF-κB signaling post-xenotransplantation. Furthermore, we identified an increase in type I interferon-related molecules, including IRF5, TIRAP and ISG15, as well as the metabolite adenine24 (Fig. Taken together, these findings indicate that despite potent immunosuppression targeting adaptive immunity, innate immune activation persists and is augmented over time, highlighting the need for tailored immunosuppressive regimens and/or additional gene editing strategies that mitigate the innate immune responses in xenotransplantation. Within the first week post-transplant, the recipient developed a Banff grade 2A T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), confirmed by a biopsy on day 8. This rejection occurred despite a marked reduction in circulating adaptive immune cells, shown by our longitudinal scRNA-seq and flow cytometry analyses. Examination of T cell depletion in secondary lymphoid organs revealed that while T cells were effectively depleted from circulation at the time of transplant, persistent CD8+ T cells were still detected on draining lymph nodes (Extended Data Fig. These findings suggest that circulating immune cell counts may not fully reflect the extent of depletion or the risk of rejection. We reasoned that the presence of activated T cell populations that were primed in the secondary lymphoid organs and then migrated to the graft likely contributed to the early rejection episode. However, this hypothesis requires formal investigation. To manage the rejection, the recipient was treated with two pulses of glucocorticoids, anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody therapy on day 8, and T cell depletion with ATG on days 9 and 10, along with an increased dosage of tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid (Fig. Due to C3 deposition observed in the biopsy sample5, the C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan was administered from day 12 to day 28. a, An illustration of the immunosuppressive regimen used to treat the recipient who experienced a TCMR, categorized as grade 2A according to Banff criteria, on day 8 post-xenotransplantation. b, Research protocol and the schedule for kidney biopsy collection. c, Hematoxylin and eosin staining of kidney xenograft biopsies at the indicated time points. d–i, Kidney xenograft biopsies were analyzed using the NanoString nCounter platform. Findings were compared to transcriptomic profiles from archival human kidney allograft biopsies25, including 15 living donor samples, 84 stable post-transplant time points, 36 cases of TCMR and 89 cases of CAMR. We compared cell-type-specific and immune-signaling-specific transcriptional signatures including CD4 T cells (d), CD8 T cells (e), NK cells (f), M1 macrophages (g), M2 macrophages (h) and TLR signaling (i). All data points are displayed. We performed bulk mRNA analysis using the NanoString nCounter platform to assess molecular immune changes associated with rejection. Transcriptional profiles from the rejection biopsy (day 8) were compared to those from a stable, nonrejection (nonR) time point (day 34) and the contralateral kidney of the donor pig (donor, day 0) (Fig. Representative hematoxylin and eosin stains of the kidney xenograft biopsies are shown in Fig. We compared these findings with transcriptomic data from archival human kidney allograft biopsies described in ref. Compared to the day 0 biopsy, xenograft rejection was associated with increased expression of both adaptive and innate immune transcripts. Adaptive immunity markers included elevated CD4+ (Fig. 4d) and CD8+ T cell signatures (Fig. Innate immune responses were characterized by increased natural killer (NK) cells (Fig. These immune signatures closely resembled those observed in human kidney allograft TCMR and were partially resolved at the subsequent nonR time point (day 34, Fig. In addition, the rejection biopsy also showed transcriptomic evidence of activation of other pathways, including adaptive immunity, IL-12 family signaling, cytokine signaling, innate immune system, type I interferon signaling, MHC class I antigen presentation, cytosolic DNA sensing, NOTCH signaling and programmed cell death. The levels of these pathways were comparable to or higher than those seen in human allograft TCMR samples (Extended Data Fig. Our data demonstrate that xenograft rejection shares key molecular features with human allograft rejection, including adaptive and innate immune activation within the tissue microenvironment. To complement transcriptomic profiling and provide spatial resolution of the immune infiltration, we performed multiplexed tissue immunofluorescence to characterize the cellular landscape of xenograft rejection. Compared to the day 0 biopsy, rejection was marked by severe interstitial inflammation and mild glomerulitis (Fig. CD4+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages were the most prominently upregulated subsets during rejection (Fig. Notably, while T cells, M1 macrophages and NK cells declined after rejection treatment, M2 macrophages remained persistently elevated in the xenograft microenvironment (Fig. Human-specific HLA class I staining indicated that the majority of macrophages were of human origin (Extended Data Fig. 8), reflecting heightened innate immune activity. These spatial findings corroborate transcriptomic data, confirming that xenograft rejection is driven by coordinated infiltration of T cells and macrophages, mirroring patterns observed in human allograft rejection. Persistent M2 macrophage presence post-treatment highlights potentially ongoing innate immune activity within the graft. a, Representative multiplexed immunofluorescence images of kidney biopsies from the donor pig (day 0) and xenograft tissues on post-transplant days 8 (TCMR) and 34 (nonR). Images were acquired from equivalent regions on each slide using distinct channel combinations. b, Quantification of immune cell subsets (percentage of total cells) across whole-slide sections from donor, TCMR and nonR xenotransplant biopsy samples from a. Gating strategies are detailed in Methods. Quantification was independently repeated twice with similar results. To determine whether immune events within the graft were reflected systemically, we assessed correlations between tissue immune activation and circulating immune cell dynamics. Since PBMCs were unavailable on the day of rejection (Fig. 1a), we inferred immune cell subsets from bulk RNA-seq data using the CIBERSORT tool (Fig. Consistent with the tissue findings, we observed increased proportions of CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, CD16+ monocytes and CD14+ monocytes on day 8 compared to pretransplant (Fig. While CD4+ TEM cells and total monocytes declined following rejection treatment, the subset of CD14+ monocytes remained persistently elevated. This continuous elevation may reflect ongoing innate immune activity associated with tissue repair or subclinical inflammation, underscoring the need for further studies to clarify their role in postrejection graft outcomes. a, Circulating immune cell proportions inferred from blood bulk transcriptomics data using CIBERSORT at Pre-Tx, during TCMR (day 7) and at a stable, nonR time point (day 26). c, Pathways enrichment analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics datasets.

To investigate broader systemic immune changes, we compared peripheral blood gene and protein expression profiles during rejection (day 7) and at a stable, nonR time point (day 26). This analysis identified 207 differentially expressed genes and proteins, including 181 upregulated and 26 downregulated targets (Fig. Upregulated signatures were enriched in pathways related to myeloid cell signaling, IL-6 and IL-12 signaling, and effector T cell activation (Fig. Key upregulated targets included CXCL10, STAT1, STAT3, CD163 and NLRP3 (Fig. Downregulated pathways were related to glycosylation (Fig. 6c), with reduced expression of B3GAT1, B4GAT1 and ST6GALNAC4 (Fig. These findings indicate that xenograft rejection is associated with coordinated transcriptional and proteomic changes involving both adaptive and innate immune activation, detectable in the peripheral blood. In addition to immune cell and transcriptomic profiling, we assessed whether levels of porcine donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), a circulating marker of tissue damage widely used in allotransplantation26, correlated with graft injury in the xenotransplantation setting. At the time of rejection, porcine dd-cfDNA levels increased markedly (~1,000-fold by day 9), indicating xenograft injury (Fig. A modest, delayed rise (~10-fold) in human cfDNA was also observed, potentially reflecting recipient immune cell turnover associated with rejection and immunosuppressive treatment, including T cell depletion. Following treatment, porcine dd-cfDNA levels declined substantially, consistent with histological resolution of the immune response and restoration of graft stability (Fig. These findings suggest that species-specific cfDNA may serve as a dynamic noninvasive biomarker for early detection and monitoring of xenograft injury. Lastly, we investigated whether the blood transcriptional profile observed during xenograft rejection in kidney xenograft recipients resembled those observed in human kidney allograft rejection. Using the publicly available dataset GSE120649 (ref. 27) from human kidney transplant recipients, we compared blood transcriptomics from our xenograft recipient with a previously described transcriptional rejection signature of human allograft rejection28. Distance correlation analysis, which captures nonlinear relationships, revealed that the xenograft rejection sample (day 7) clustered with human kidney allograft rejection profiles, while the nonrejection sample (day 26) aligned with human nonrejection states (Fig. These results demonstrate significant molecular overlap between xenograft and allograft rejection in both tissue and peripheral blood, suggesting conserved immune pathways that could guide future strategies for immune monitoring and therapeutic intervention in xenotransplantation. Here we report the high-dimensional immune characterization of a gene-edited pig kidney xenotransplantation in a living human. Using longitudinal transcriptomic, proteomic analyses and spatial analyses, we observed a profound shift in adaptive immunity, while innate immune activation persisted despite immunosuppression. This study provides critical insights into xenogeneic immune responses, highlighting the need to optimize immunosuppressive strategies and potentially guide future porcine donor gene editing to improve clinical outcomes in xenotransplantation. We identified key differences in immune dynamics between our kidney xenograft patient, xenotransplantation in decedent recipients and human allograft rejection, particularly regarding the type and timing of rejection. Potential factors contributing to the observed differences include variability in donor animals, patient selection criteria, immunosuppressive regimens, baseline inflammation and immune alterations associated with brain-dead donors. Our xeno recipient developed TCMR within 1 week of transplant, which is a rare occurrence in human allotransplantation when T cell depletion with thymoglobulin is used. However, a reduced dose of ATG (1.5 mg kg−1 versus standard 4.5 mg kg−1) was administered in our case due to significant lymphopenia and hypersensitivity reaction after the first ATG dose29. TCMR was absent in most reports using decedent models30,31, except for one group that used a low-dose ATG induction therapy (~2.5 mg kg−1) and reported a mixed TCMR and antibody-mediated rejection32. Despite differences in timing, the xenograft biopsy profile resembled human allograft rejection, with prominent T cells and macrophages, and transcriptional upregulation of IFNγ, IL-1 and IL-6 signaling pathways25. The rejection episode was successfully treated with standard immunosuppressants, indicating that xenograft TCMR responds to conventional rejection therapies. However, xenograft rejection also showed distinct peripheral blood features, including heightened innate immune activation involving TLR signaling and type I interferon pathways. These findings suggest that xenograft rejection engages unique immune mechanisms that may require tailored therapeutic interventions, and greater T cell depletion might be needed to prevent TCMR. In nonhuman primate (NHP) and human decedent xenotransplantation models, circulating B cells were detected post-xenotransplant31 and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) was typically the dominant rejection mechanism rather than TCMR4,30,33. By contrast, our patient showed no histological or serological evidence of AMR, likely due to effective pretransplant B cell depletion and ongoing CD154 costimulation blockade. Our observation of a lack of AMR compared to preclinical primate models may be explained by species-specific differences in humoral immunity and drug efficacy. Human IgM natural antibody binding to 3KO pig cells is significantly lower than that observed in Old World monkeys34, and human transgenes introduced in 3KO pigs may function more effectively in humans than in NHPs. In addition, the greater cross-reactivity of clinical immunosuppressive agents in humans may contribute to improved control of AMR in our clinical setting, despite the use of similar immunosuppressive regimens. However, persistent CD8⁺ T cells in lymph nodes highlight residual cellular immunity. Peripheral blood monitoring failed to detect early rejection, whereas porcine dd-cfDNA levels correlated with graft injury, suggesting species-specific cfDNA as a promising noninvasive biomarker. These findings emphasize the need for improved monitoring tools, such as dd-cfDNA assays and advanced imaging, to detect rejection before clinical dysfunction. We observed persistent innate immune activation despite effective suppression of the adaptive immune response. This was characterized by a sustained increase in monocyte and macrophage populations, upregulation of TLR/NF-κB signaling and type I interferon responses, and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels following TLR stimulation. This is corroborated by observations in decedent models showing human innate immune cells rapidly infiltrate pig xenografts following transplantation30,31,35. Similar systemic inflammation has also been reported in NHP xenotransplantation models36, and it may have contributed to the early onset of TCMR post-xenotransplantation in our patient. Potential drivers of this innate immune response include xenograft-derived damage-associated molecular patterns, which stimulate monocytes and macrophages, and incomplete immune regulation by current immunosuppressive strategies. Existing therapies primarily target T and B cells while largely neglecting innate immune pathways. Although our xenotransplant recipient developed a fatal cardiac event on day 51, no acute myocardial infarction was found on autopsy5. Rather, chronic myocardial fibrosis, likely related to prior microvascular disease from prolonged dialysis, was identified and may have predisposed the patient to arrhythmia. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the potential contribution of xenograft-associated systemic inflammation to cardiovascular risk. Notably, M2 macrophages remained elevated in the xenograft microenvironment even after rejection treatment. This is consistent with transcriptional signatures in circulating monocytes indicative of migration and differentiation into peripheral tissues. Persistent macrophage infiltration has been reported in human kidney transplantation, where their presence is associated not only with the resolution of inflammation but also with progression to fibrosis and poorer long-term graft survival, partly through pathways such as transforming growth factor β1 signaling37,38. This dual role highlights the importance of monitoring macrophage polarization in xenotransplantation, as sustained M2 infiltration may signal a risk for chronic graft injury and impaired outcomes. Clinically, these findings highlight that current immunosuppressive regimens targeting adaptive immunity are insufficient to control innate immune activation in xenotransplantation. Future xenograft recipients may benefit from therapies specifically targeting innate immunity, such as IL-1 or IL-6 blockade, to improve graft outcomes. In addition to pharmacologic strategies, future engineering of porcine donors could focus on reducing innate immune activation by targeting key inflammatory pathways identified in this study. Given the prominent upregulation of IL-1 signaling (also observed by Kawai et al.5), graft-specific expression of human IL-1 receptor antagonist could offer localized suppression of cytokine-driven inflammation. Introducing immunoregulatory molecules such as PD-L1 may further help modulate residual T cell and macrophage activity through checkpoint inhibition. These strategies, combined with existing transgenes that address complement activation, coagulation and macrophage phagocytosis, could provide a comprehensive approach to reducing xenograft-induced innate immune activation. Collectively, such next-generation genetic modifications hold promise for enhancing graft compatibility, reducing reliance on systemic immunosuppression and improving long-term outcomes in clinical xenotransplantation. This study is limited by its single patient design, necessitating validation in larger xenotransplantation trials to confirm the generalizability of our findings. The short follow-up period also limits our understanding of long-term immune adaptation and graft survival. In addition, the limited number of biopsies restricted the ability to fully monitor tissue-based immune responses. Given the importance of the tissue microenvironment in graft outcomes, future studies should incorporate more frequent and systematic biopsy sampling to comprehensively assess immune dynamics over time. In summary, this study provides a detailed high-dimensional immune characterization of pig-to-human kidney transplantation into a living recipient. While demonstrating the feasibility of kidney xenotransplantation, our findings reveal that targeting adaptive immunity alone may be insufficient. Achieving durable graft survival and favorable patient outcomes will require refined strategies to modulate innate immune activation, prevent early T cell-mediated rejection, and implement more sensitive and dynamic monitoring approaches. Advancing xenotransplantation as a sustainable solution to organ shortage will require next-generation immunosuppressive regimens and real-time diagnostic tools. An EGEN-2784 gene-edited pig kidney was transplanted into a 62-year-old male patient with end-stage kidney disease, recently described in ref. A Yucatan miniature pig was genetically engineered with 69 genomic modifications. These included the deletion of three major glycan antigens, the inactivation of porcine endogenous retroviruses and the insertion of seven human transgenes (TNFAIP3, HMOX1, CD47, CD46, CD55, THBD and EPCR). The immunosuppressive protocol included antithymocyte globulin (ATG, 1.5 mg kg−1 on days −2 and −1), rituximab (anti-CD20, 1,000 mg on day −3), Fc-modified anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (tegoprubart, 20 mg kg−1 on days −3, −2, −1, 1, 3, 7 and weekly thereafter) and anti-C5 antibody (ravulizumab, 3,330 mg on days −1, 7 and 28). This regimen was combined with standard maintenance immunosuppression consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid (540 mg twice daily) and glucocorticoids starting on day 0. On post-transplant day 8, a biopsy revealed Banff grade 2A TCMR without signs of thrombotic microangiopathy or antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment included a 500-mg pulse of methylprednisolone and anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab, 8 mg kg−1). Additional 500-mg methylprednisolone pulses were given on days 9 and 10, along with ATG (1.5 mg kg−1). Tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid doses were increased. Due to C3 deposition seen in the biopsy, pegcetacoplan, a targeted C3 and C3b inhibitor, was administered. However, as there was no evidence of antibody-mediated rejection, no further doses of tocilizumab were given. Peripheral blood was collected for serum and plasma at pretransplantation (day −3), post-xenotransplantation (days 13, 20, 26, 33 and 51) and during suspected rejection (day 7 post-transplantation). Blood was collected in heparinized tubes for PBMCs isolation at pretransplantation (day −3) and post-xenotransplantation (days 13, 20, 26 and 33). Blood was also collected in Paxgene tubes for RNA profiling (days −3 and 7) and post-xenotransplantation (day 26). The sample collection schedule is shown in Fig. The patient provided written informed consent, as approved by the MGH Human Research Committee (IRB no: 2023P003631). PBMCs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque solution (GE HealthCare), counted and cryopreserved in heat-inactivated Human AB serum (GeminiBio) with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in liquid nitrogen. The serum was isolated and stored at −80 °C until further analyses. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and washed two times with PBS ×1. Cells were then counted using a Countess II Automated Cell Counter and loaded for scRNA-seq using ×10 Genomics Chromium Single Cell 30 Kit (v3.1 Chemistry). We preprocessed the reads with pyroe 0.9.0, Salmon 1.10.3 and alevin 0.10.0 packages with the reference genome GRCh38.p14 v46 from Gencode, and performed the downstream analysis with Seurat 5.1.0. Longitudinal recipient samples were integrated with 22 external healthy control samples from 3 publicly available PBMC datasets (GEO accessions GSE165080, GSE171555 and GSE192391) using Harmony 1.2.0. The GSE165080 dataset consisted of 6 female samples and 5 male samples with a mean age of 43.1 ± 7.94 years39; the GSE171555 dataset included 3 female and 2 male samples40; and the GSE192391 dataset consisted of 4 female and 2 male samples41. Age information was not available for the GSE171555 and GSE192391 datasets. Before integration, each dataset underwent independent quality control filtering followed by normalization using the Seurat SCTransform function. Based on an empirical evaluation of the distributions of the number of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) (nCount_RNA), number of detected genes (nFeature_RNA), log-transformed gene-to-UMI ratio (log10GenesPerUMI) and mitochondrial gene expression ratio (mitoRatio), the following filters were applied: GSE165080: nCount_RNA ≥ 1,800; nFeature_RNA ≥ 900 and <2,500; log10GenesPerUMI ≥ 0.84 and mitoRatio < 22%. An additional gene filtering step was applied to each dataset, retaining only genes expressed (that is, nonzero counts) in at least 10 cells. After integration, marker genes for each cluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function following PrepSCTFindMarkers. Clusters were manually annotated into cell types based on the expression of the marker genes (Extended Data Fig. A second round of annotation was performed after sub-clustering aggregated monocyte and T cell subsets, followed by marker gene identification. Single cells expressing canonical marker genes of at least two major cell types were assumed to be doublets and excluded from the Seurat object. Gene sets of interest across time were identified empirically by calculating the average log2 fold change at each time point relative to the pretransplant baseline. This analysis was performed separately for CD14+ monocyte subsets, CD16+ monocytes and NK cell subsets. Genes were then ranked based on the absolute average log2 fold change to prioritize those with the most pronounced temporal shifts in expression. Venous blood collected at different time points and stored in PAXgene tubes at −80 °C were used for bulk RNA-seq. We trimmed the adapters with Fastp 1.0.1 and quantified the abundance of transcripts with Salmon 1.10.3. We used tximport 1.32.0 to import the abundance files and DESeq2 was used to harmonize samples. We used SRA tool 2.10.7 to download the public fastq files. To perform proteomics analysis from serum samples, 11,000 markers were measured using SomaScan analysis (SomaLogic). This analysis was performed at the BIDMC Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Center using the SomaScan Assay Kit for human serum, covering ~11,000 proteins. Untargeted metabolite analysis was performed using a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer equipped with a HESI II probe and coupled to a Vanquish binary ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample underwent two chromatographic separations. For both methods, 5 µl of the sample was injected into a BEH Z-HILIC column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters). The first separation was conducted at pH 9, using 15 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Merck) in 90% water and 10% acetonitrile as mobile phase A, then 95% acetonitrile and 5% water as mobile phase B. The gradient was applied at a flow rate of 0.225 ml per min, following a method adapted from42, and the mass spectrometer operated in negative mode. The second separation followed the method of Mülleder et al.43, with mobile phases A and B buffered with 10 mM ammonium formate and 45 mM formic acid (pH 2.7). Mobile phase A consisted of a 1:1 acetonitrile to water mixture, while mobile phase B contained 95:5:5 acetonitrile to water to methanol. Chromatography was conducted at 40 °C (column oven) and 4 °C (autosampler), with a gradient flow rate of 0.4 ml per min as follows: an initial hold at 95% B for 0.75 min, a linear decrease to 30% B from 0.75 to 3.00 min, followed by a 1.00 min isocratic hold at 30% B. Mobile phase B was then returned to 95% over 0.50 min, with re-equilibration under initial conditions. Mass spectrometry was performed in positive mode. Data acquisition was carried out in full-scan mode, with the spray voltage set to 3 kV (negative mode) or 3.5 kV (positive mode). The resolving power was set to 120,000. An untargeted metabolite library was generated using top-15 DDA acquisitions on a pooled study sample, with MS1 and MS2 resolutions of 60,000 and 30,000, respectively. Raw data files (.raw) were processed using MZmine 4.544 and emzed45. Metabolite MS2 spectra were compared against HMDB, GNPS, MassBank and MoNA databases using spectral library matching (ref to DDA_library). In addition, retention times and m/z values from full-scan acquisitions of a pooled study sample were cross-referenced with an in-house database containing retention times of authenticated standards (Human Endogenous Metabolite Compound Library Plus L2501, TargetMol). Internal standards were integrated via emzed, and raw peak areas were normalized by dividing by sample biomass and the mean internal standard area. The tissues were minced and digested with 500 U ml−1 collagenase D (Roche) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 0.1 M EDTA in PBS, pH 7.2, buffer for 5 min before a final suspension in 5 mM EDTA (Gibco), 1% FBS (Gibco) in × 1 PBS, pH 7.2 (Boston BioProducts). Isolated cells were then mechanically dissociated through a 70-μm cell strainer (Corning) in a 50-ml tube, and red blood cells were lysed using hypotonic ACK buffer (Gibco). Cells were then counted and cryopreserved in heat-inactivated human AB serum (GeminiBio) with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in liquid nitrogen. Monitoring of immune cells over time was performed using 100 μl of whole blood. Cells were stained with surface antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with 1× BD FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at room temperature for lysing red blood cells. We also stained cells isolated from human lymph nodes. Cells were thawed, washed twice and Fc-blocked (TruStain FcX, combination of anti-human CD16 (clone 3G8), CD32 (clone FUN-2) and CD64 (clone 10.1) antibodies, BioLegend, cat. Stained cells were analyzed on an LSR Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) for all experiments. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) in all experiments. Viable cells were selected based on the staining with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, cat. Gating strategies for PBMC analysis were as previously described and can be found in Supplementary Fig. Recipient's PBMCs from different time points were thawed and washed twice with RPMI 1640 (Gibco) containing 10% FBS (GeminiBio) and ×1 pen/strep (Gibco) (complete RPMI), and then resuspended in complete RPMI. In a 96-well round-bottomed tissue culture plate at a volume of 100 μl, 4 × 105 cells per well were seeded. Cells were stimulated with 100 μl of either complete RPMI (controls) or a mixture of bacterial and viral TLR ligands (0.025 μg ml−1 LPS, 10 μg ml−1 Pam3CSK4, 4 μg ml−1 R848, 25 μg ml−1 poly I:C—all from Invivogen). PBMCs from each sample were stimulated in duplicates. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, supernatants were obtained for Luminex analysis using the premixed ProcartaPlex Human Immune Monitoring Panel 65-plex (Thermo Fisher), including APRIL, BAFF, CXCL13, CD30, CD40L, CXCL5, CCL11, CCL24, CCL26, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), CX3CL1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CXCL1, hepatocyte growth factor, IFNα, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-2, IL-20, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-27, IL-2R, IL-3, IL-31, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, CXCL10, CXCL11, LIF, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, lymphotoxin-alpha, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, MDC, MIF, CXCL9, CCL3, CCL4, CCL20, MMP-1, nerve growth factor beta (NGF-β), SCF, SDF-1α, TNF, TNF-RII, TRAIL, TSLP, TWEAK and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). We read the assay in a Luminex200 machine, and data with a bead count <20 were excluded. Samples from the time points from one individual were measured on the same plate to mitigate the effect of potential plate-based technical variation on calculated fold changes between time points. Bulk mRNA analysis was performed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded xenograft biopsies and a sample from the nontransplanted contralateral donor kidney, using the nCounter instrument (Nanostring) combined with the Banff Human Organ Transplant panel, following the methods and data analysis previously documented for human allograft biopsies25. The probe sequences were screened for homology with pig and NHP transcripts by a specialist at the manufacturer company (NanoString). We used probes from the panel that had >85% homology with porcine sequences for parenchymal cells or endothelium (n = 235 probes) and all probes for human leukocytes, similar to those used previously in pig-to-human xenografts5,30. Normalization was performed using seven housekeeping probes with >90% homology with the corresponding porcine transcripts. Pathways were manually curated from prior publications25,46,47,48 and KEGG Pathways (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html), Gene Ontology (geneontology.org) and Reactome (reactome.org) repositories. Cell types from tissue bulk were assessed with marker genes49. Biopsy tissue was processed using standard kidney biopsy methods for light microscopy. hematoxylin and eosin samples were scored using the current Banff criteria50,51. Frozen slides from the donor collateral kidney biopsy and xenografts at days 8 and 34 were processed for multiplex imaging on the Orion platform (RareCyte), following Lin et al.52. An Orion multiplex antibody panel was used to profile immune cell subsets (Supplementary Table 2). After a surfactant wash and enhancer treatment, slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with ArgoFluor‑conjugated antibodies and Hoechst 33342. The next day, slides were washed extensively in PBS, mounted in ArgoFluor mounting medium (RareCyte 42‑1214‑000), and imaged on an Orion microscope. Fluorophores were then quenched with hydrogen peroxide solution, and a second round of overnight 4 °C staining was performed with a different set of ArgoFluor‑conjugated antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) plus Hoechst 33342, followed by mounting and imaging. Image stitching, segmentation and single‑cell quantification were carried out using the MCMICRO pipeline53. A Gaussian mixture model implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks)54 excluded cells exhibiting excessive autofluorescence. The HLA‑ABC marker recognizes human MHC I, thereby excluding from counts the few residual donor pig kidney-resident M2 macrophages with which the CD163 antibody cross‑reacts (Extended Data Fig. After pig donor blood collection, PBMCs were isolated using Lympholyte-Mammal Cell Separation Media (Cedarlane) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Using a V-bottom 96-well-plate, serum was serially diluted in PBS ×1 as follows: 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64 and 1:128. Serum from a healthy human control and a Baboon previously transplanted with a pig kidney were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, along with different time points of the recipient serum. To avoid nonspecific binding sites, pig PBMCs (5 × 105 cells per well) were blocked with 10% heat-inactivated goat serum (R&D Systems, cat. After two washes, pig PBMCs were incubated with serially diluted serum for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times in cold PBS × 1. Next, pig PBMCs were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-human IgG Fc-APC (clone M1310G05, BioLegend). After two washes, cells were resuspended in a staining buffer (PBS, 1% of bovine serum albumin, 0.09% sodium azide). Stained cells were analyzed on an LSR Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) for all experiments. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) in all experiments. Karius retrieved porcine and human cfDNA using a protocol similar to that described by Blauwkamp et al.55. Briefly, plasma samples were initially processed by centrifugation to remove residual cells, after which cfDNA was extracted using a modified Mag-Bind cfDNA kit in automated liquid handling platforms. Sequencing libraries were prepared with dual-indexed Ovation Ultralow System kits and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq sequencers. The resulting reads underwent stringent bioinformatics processing, including alignment against human, porcine and microbial reference databases to distinguish human and porcine cfDNA fragments accurately. The concentration of each species' cfDNA was quantitatively estimated by normalizing against synthetic internal control molecules (WINC molecules), ensuring precise measurement of cfDNA abundance in plasma samples We normalized all the data series to z-score with scikit-learn 1.6.156. To analyze the data in time, we used scikit-fda 0.9.157. With this package, we excluded outliers using the MS-Plot Outlier Detector method. We then used Fuzzy C-Means with l2-distance to cluster. We defined the optimal number of three clusters, calculating the silhouette score with scikit-learn 1.6.1. For the three clusters defined by functional data analysis, we used the z-score normalized proteomics data to calculate the nearest neighbors with scikit-fda 0.9.1, calculated the Louvain communities with NetworkX 3.4.258 based on the connectivity of the nearest neighbor's graph, followed by an enrichment analysis for each community with GSEApy 1.1.759. After annotating the clusters based on GSEApy results, we trained a k-neighbors classifier with scikit-fda 0.9.1 on proteomics Louvain labels. We predicted the Louvain communities for z-score normalized metabolomics data. We used the package adjustText 1.3.0 (https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText). After preprocessing the whole-blood bulk transcriptomic data, we normalized the expression counts with DESeq2. Next, we used the R package IOBR 0.99.860 to estimate the population abundance on whole blood using the LM22 and LM6 matrices without tumor optimization. We calculated the log2 fold change between days 7 and 26 (log2[D7/D26]) for both transcriptomics and proteomics. Since we have only one sample, we selected the most relevant fold change by the first quartile of negative fold changes and the third quartile of positive fold changes to define downregulated and upregulated molecules, respectively. We found the intersection using Python native functions and performed an enrichment analysis with GSEApy 1.1.759. A chord diagram was constructed using the circlize package 0.4.1661 in R 4.4.2 to illustrate relationships between differentially expressed genes and proteins. Sectors representing upregulated and downregulated genes and proteins were color coded, and interconnections were drawn based on shared elements between sets. Edge transparency and arrow annotations were applied to improve interpretability. To maintain consistency, we reprocessed the public dataset GSE120649 (ref. 27) from whole-blood human kidney transplant recipients using the same pipeline used for the xenotransplant samples. We used a previously described transcriptional profile of human allograft rejection28 to compare allo and xenotransplantation gene expression. To detect nonlinear correlation, we clustered the samples using the complete linkage method on the distance correlation metric with SciPy 1.11.462. We used seaborn 0.13.263 to plot the cluster heatmap. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Three distinct analyte clusters were identified based on their temporal dynamics: one characterized by a progressive decline over time, which included 3433 features (a), another by a posttransplantation increase with 2599 features (b), and a third that exhibited no consistent temporal pattern, including 2792 features (c). The clusters were defined by the semi-supervised clustering, which is based on FuzzyCMeans with pairwise L2 distance. More details about algorithms are in the methods section of the paper. Bubble plots showing the expression levels and percentage of cells expressing marker genes used for cell type annotation of the 17 clusters observed in the scRNA-seq data. Donor porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated with serial dilutions (1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128) of recipient serum collected at pre-transplant and days 7, 12, 21, and 26 posttransplant. Controls samples included serum from a healthy human individual and serum from a baboon previously transplanted with a porcine kidney (sensitized). Fluorescently labeled anti-human IgG antibody was used to quantify donor-specific antibody (DSA) levels by flow cytometry. The graph represents total IgG binding to porcine donor PBMCs, measured by geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI). Data expressed as mean ± SD. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Gene expression profiles were analyzed in CD14⁺ and CD16⁺ monocyte subsets using the pre-transplant time point as baseline. Genes were ranked by the absolute average log2 fold-change across all time points to prioritize those with the most pronounced temporal shifts. Three major gene expression patterns were identified: gene set 1 (red) comprised genes upregulated after transplantation; gene set 2 (green) included genes that were downregulated; and gene set 3 (purple) contained genes predominantly expressed by CD16⁺ monocytes.

Mpox virus particles (purple) seem to be spreading more easily between people.Credit: NIAID/SPL As mpox continues to spark localized outbreaks in Africa and, on occasion, in other parts of the world, researchers are racing to understand how the virus managed to spread globally in 2022 — and how it might do so again. In December, health officials reported a strain of the mpox virus that combines genetic elements of two existing types, or clades, for the first time. Taken together, these data show that scientists “still have a lot to learn” about existing strains, let alone new strains, says Boghuma Titanji, an infectious-disease physician at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Mpox infections can cause painful, fluid-filled lesions on the skin, fever and, in severe cases, death. Historically, it rarely spread widely, but this all changed in the late-2010s, when a clade II strain caused a large outbreak in Nigeria. A similar clade IIb strain sparked the 2022 global outbreak, in which more than 100,000 people were infected. Most infections have been in children, and, until the past few years, transmission occurred mainly from animals to humans. It has spread mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire. This spread has worried scientists because the sudden emergence of clade Ib mpox mirrors the trajectory of clade II before it went global, Titanji says. Over the past couple of years, researchers have been racing to understand how the new mpox clades, Ib and IIb, differ from their predecessors. Data from rodents infected with mpox offer evidence to support a theory that these clades are less lethal but more adept at spreading from one person to another because they cause milder illness2. Rats infected with clade Ib mpox had higher survival rates than those infected with clade Ia, yet they transmitted just as much infectious virus. These findings help to explain why the virus “might be quite efficient in spreading through sex”, as people could be unknowingly transmitting the virus before they are symptomatic, Titanji says. Another group of scientists studied how clade IIb mpox infects mice1. “We were expecting to see some inflammation or disorganization, but to see that potentially this infection was affecting male fertility was shocking,” says study co-author Alyson Kelvin, an emerging-virus specialist at the University of Calgary in Canada.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that households burn plastics to manage waste and help satisfy their energy demand. To examine the prevalence, extent, and reasons for using plastic waste as household fuel, we report on a survey with 1018 key informants from cities in 26 countries in the Global South. Informants were purposively selected due to their familiarity with the living conditions in their communities. One-third of respondents reported being aware of plastic waste burning, with some reporting that their households engaged in this practice. Analyses of the data reveal significant correlations of plastic waste burning with both supply factors, such as, the massive amount of waste generated (p = 0.000), expensive clean fuels (p = 0.004), and demand factors, including self-management of waste (p = 0.000). Expanding essential public waste management services and implementing programs that enhance the affordability of clean energy technologies, especially among marginalized and low-income communities, could reduce this health- and environment-damaging practice. The management of plastic waste, with over half a billion tons of plastic produced annually and rising, is a major global environmental challenge1,2,3. Meanwhile, in cities across much of the Global South, waste management systems are grossly inadequate, with the quantity of unmanaged plastic waste therefore increasing4,5. The term Global South, as used in this study, refers to the low- and middle-income countries in the regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania6. While some governments are now introducing policies and regulations to limit plastic use and disposal, including targeting its combustion, the gap between policy formulation and effective enforcement, especially in marginalized areas, is substantial7. Most mitigation efforts have thus far proven ineffective or inadequate. At the same time, clean fuels and technologies whose emissions meet the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide(CO) levels recommended in the World Health Organization's (WHO) global air quality guidelines9, such as electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, natural gas, and ethanol, remain largely unaffordable for people living in extreme poverty. This compels them to depend on traditional solid biomass fuels such as firewood, charcoal, crop residues, and animal dung10. However, many urban residents with lower socioeconomic status in the Global South are finding biomass fuels to be increasingly scarce, due to population growth and limited access to these traditional fuels11. Thus, there are growing concerns that energy-poor, solid fuel-dependent households who must self-manage their own and their communities' plastic waste may turn to burning plastic waste as a no or low-cost alternative for cooking and heating12. For instance, Nigeria's Multi-Tier Framework for Energy Access survey data reveals that roughly 13% of 3511 surveyed households reported garbage as one of their household fuels over the prior 12-month period13, and similar practices have been reported in other locations14. While it is generally believed that plastic is used primarily to ignite cooking fires15,16,17, households living through humanitarian crises and in urban settings more generally, have reported burning plastic waste as a primary cooking fuel18,19. Despite the considerable potential health, environmental, and socioeconomic risks associated with plastic waste burning4,19,20, the extent and prevalence of its use as a household fuel remain poorly understood12. To address this gap, we conducted a primary survey among purposively selected key informants across 26 countries in the Global South. All participants were familiar with urban living conditions, particularly those of low-income communities, where the practice of burning plastic waste is suspected to be most common. Although this approach does not yield a population-representative sample in the settings considered, the survey does reveal that the burning of plastic waste is widespread. It offers a starting point for future research on the underlying drivers and impacts of this behavior21. As such, it represents a crucial step towards developing targeted programs to counteract the harmful effects of global plastic waste burning. The Global South is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate, creating an urgent demand for rapid expansion of infrastructure, services, and economic opportunities. However, many low-income countries face acute resource constraints that hinder their ability to keep pace with this growth22,23. By 2050, an estimated two-thirds of the global population is expected to reside in urban areas, with much of this growth occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)24. Historically, this rapid urbanization has led to the proliferation of informal settlements within these nations. Access to reliable energy, effective waste management systems, and modern water and sanitation services remains very low in some cities in the Global South25,26. In response to these systemic gaps, informal solutions, such as plastic waste burning, have emerged as a means to address the lack of proper waste management and energy access needs28. Low-income households migrating to informal settlements to escape high rental costs often face barriers in accessing affordable, clean fuels. Moreover, the rapid growth of densely populated settlements intensifies pressure on local forests and other natural resources, driving up the costs of traditional fuels such as wood and charcoal29. One notable consequence is the increased scarcity of biomass fuels, which has become a contributing factor to accelerating the energy transition in many urban environments. This transition is occurring at a highly unequal rate30. However, it is leaving lower socioeconomic status and marginalized communities behind31, and exacerbating energy insecurity for those least able to afford clean commercial fuels10 and forcing them to look for no- or low-cost fuels, which can include unmanaged solid waste. As a readily available waste product that combusts easily, plastic is a potentially attractive fuel source for low-income households struggling to meet their energy needs. Plastic waste is difficult to manage as it does not decay like organic waste, nor does it have the resale value that metals have; this makes burning or incineration a widely accepted method of management1,28. Unfortunately, burning waste, particularly plastic waste, releases many harmful toxins that negatively affect household environments and spill over to contribute to poor urban air quality20,32. The harms from plastic burning extend beyond direct human exposure to toxic emissions via inhalation. Secondary impacts, including ingestion of contaminated food, documented in environmental analyses, underscore additional risks associated with plastic combustion33. For example, chicken egg samples from an electronic waste site in Ghana, where plastic and cables were burnt in an open fire, have been found to contain toxins34,35. Additionally, the technologies and tools used to burn plastic waste, along with how individuals interact with these tools, likely play a critical role in influencing the environmental and health impacts of this practice, both within households and across broader communities. While systematic evidence on the prevalence and extent of plastic waste burning as a household fuel remains limited, anecdotal and localized studies indicate that the practice could be widespread15,16,36. Systematic and comprehensive data gathering on this topic, including results from this survey, is needed to advance understanding of the complex dynamics of plastic waste burning and to inform policies and targeted programs aimed at mitigating its risks21. Responses were obtained from 1018 key informants familiar with the context of their cities were analysed in this study; see Table 1 for sample summary statistics (and “Methods” for additional details). Respondents were asked about the general prevalence of plastic waste burning in their city. a Reported prevalence of burning plastic waste; b Agreement that plastic waste is used as a cooking fuel; c Agreement that plastic waste is commonly burned in traditional stoves; and d Awareness of burning plastic waste as a fuel. Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding. Respondents were also asked about the use of plastic waste as a household fuel through three questions. Among the 989 respondents who answered a first question on burning of plastic cooking fuel as a replacement for other fuels, 19% somewhat agreed and 8% strongly agreed, indicating notable agreement to this practice (Fig. In a second question, 32% of participants somewhat agreed, and 24% strongly agreed that burning plastic waste in traditional stoves is common practice (N = 985). These responses suggest a higher prevalence of plastic waste burning compared to the first survey question, which may indicate that plastic burning is used primarily to manage household plastic waste, rather than as a primary or preferred energy source for cooking. The third question asked respondents whether they were aware that plastic waste was used as a household fuel in their cities, with three response options: yes, unsure and no. Affirmative answers to this question appear to lie between those on the two other questions: out of 998 respondents who answered the question, 37% reported being aware of this practice, 37% were unsure, and 27% were unaware (Fig. The 365 respondents who indicated awareness of plastic waste burning for energy purposes in their city, from the final question ‘Are you aware of burning waste plastic as fuel', were also asked follow-up questions regarding the specific purpose of this practice. Out of the total respondents, 16% reported burning plastic for at least one purpose, 10% reported using it for two purposes, and 5% for three different purposes. Nearly half (48%) reported witnessing others burn plastic waste as a cooking fuel, while 14% responded that they had done so themselves. Another 13% indicated they had heard about the practice but had not seen it firsthand (Fig. Regarding the burning of plastic waste for heating purposes, 37% had seen others doing it, 12% had done it themselves, and 18% had only heard about it being done (Fig. A smaller proportion of respondents were aware of plastic being burned to prepare cattle feed: 12% had witnessed it, 11% had heard about it, and 4% had engaged in the practice (Fig. Percentage of respondents aware of plastic waste being burnt and used as (a) cooking fuel, (b) heating, (c) heating cattle feed, (d) by mixing with other fuels like firewood, (e) deter pests, (f) fire starter. This is a follow-up question asked only to respondents who indicated they were aware of burning plastic (Fig. Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding. Fuel stacking, the use of multiple fuel types to meet household energy needs, is a well-documented practice in low-income settings37. However, this behavior can contribute to increased toxic emissions, especially when polluting fuels such as plastic are mixed with other materials38. To explore this further, the survey examined the extent to which plastic is combined with other fuels in household fires. Among those aware of plastic burning, 22% reported burning plastic with different fuels, 46% had witnessed this practice, and 14% had heard about it (Fig. Integrating plastic waste into household fuel use for multiple purposes appears to be relatively common among respondents familiar with plastic combustion. The survey also investigated whether burning plastic waste is employed to deter pests and insects, as smoke emissions from polluting energy sources are sometimes considered effective in doing so39. While only 6% of respondents reported burning plastic waste for this purpose, 17% had witnessed it, and 19% had heard about it (Fig. The survey also investigated whether plastic waste is used for lighting fires. The extent to which plastic waste is used as a household fuel varies by country, with patterns that correlate with regional and national income levels. Figure 3 show the proportion of respondents who agreed that plastic waste is used as a fuel substitute, acknowledged plastic burning to be a common practice, and reported awareness of plastic waste combustion for energy purposes according to country income (Fig. The measures were converted from a Likert scale – previously discussed in Fig. 1—to a binary variable indicating some or strong agreement. Plastic waste combustion is more prevalent in low-income countries, except for heating purposes (Fig. Regional differences are also notable, with respondents in Sub-Saharan Africa reporting a higher prevalence of these practices compared to those in other regions, for all purposes (Fig. Additionally, the disaggregated data suggest that fuel substitution with plastic (the first measure) may be somewhat over-reported in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and Southeast Asia (SEA). This is indicated by higher rates of agreement (represented by the orange bars) compared to direct awareness of plastic waste combustion for energy needs (green bars). a Proportion of respondents who somewhat or strongly agree that plastic is burnt as a fuel (blue bar); somewhat or strongly agree that it is common practice to burn plastic waste in traditional stoves (orange bar); and report being aware of burning of plastic as a household fuel (green bar) across LIC = low-income country; LMC = lower-middle-income country; and UMC = upper-middle-income country categories. The MAF and LAC numbers are based on responses from a single country in each region, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, respectively. c Proportion of respondents reporting having seen or burnt plastic themselves for various purposes, among those aware of plastic waste burning (the green bars in Panels (a, b)), by country income category and (d) region. Respondents who reported awareness of burning plastic waste as a household fuel (N = 366) were asked additional questions about the specific types of plastic materials being burned, the product(s) they originated from, and the stoves used for their combustion. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE) is the most frequently reported type of burned plastic waste, followed by low-density Polyethylene (LDPE). They are the most common plastic materials found in household waste and accumulating in the oceans bordering Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia40,41,42. The third most frequently reported plastic being burned is high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a material frequently used for chemical containers. The fifth most frequently used plastic material is polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is mostly used in plastic plumbing pipes, and is a major cause of dioxin emissions43. b Relative frequency of plastic products burned for fuel among those aware of plastic burning (N = 318). c Percentage of responses by stove type most commonly used by households to burn plastic (N = 323). In terms of product origin, nearly two-thirds of respondents reported burning food wrappers, followed by chemical packaging materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and cleaning liquid containers (Fig. Food wrappers, made from polypropylene (PP), account for the largest share of waste generation by polymer type14,44,45, and are reported as the most frequently burned plastic product. Other commonly burned plastic items included non-food household plastics like buckets and plastic bags (35%), construction materials such as pipes (32%), and components from tyres and white goods, i.e., household electrical appliances (26%). Traditional cooking stoves such as those using 3-stone and charcoal are among the most widely used stoves for burning plastic waste (Fig. Energy consumption is influenced by household socio-demographic characteristics. To better understand the socio-demographic factors associated with burning plastic waste as a fuel, respondents were presented with a set of factors and asked to rate the likelihood that individuals with these characteristics could burn plastic waste as fuel, on a scale from −10 (not likely) to +10 (most likely). Households that include people with disabilities—with the term ‘disabilities' left undefined in the survey question—were seen as less likely to burn plastic waste, possibly due to their limitations in collecting plastic waste (Fig. By contrast, respondents indicated that households in areas excluded from waste management services could be most likely to burn plastic waste, followed by those experiencing poverty and those living in informal settlements. Additionally, households with members working at waste sites, such as waste pickers, were perceived to be more likely to burn plastic waste as fuel. Overall (bar graph) and disaggregated by region (heatmap). a Percentage of respondents who believe burning plastic waste is positively associated with various socio-demographic groups. Responses were measured using a scale ranging from −10 to +10 (where −10 indicates a strong and negative association, i.e., low likelihood of burning plastic waste as household fuel; and +10 indicates a strong and positive association, i.e., high likelihood of burning plastic waste), converted binary variable that takes value of 1 for respondents with positive response (1 to 10) otherwise zero. b Percentage of respondents who somewhat agree or strongly agree about the reasons for burning plastic waste overall (bar graph) and disaggregated by region (heatmap). Responses measured using a scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree rescaled as a binary that takes the value of 1 for respondents who select somewhat agree or strongly agree, otherwise 0. The MAF and LAC numbers are based on responses from a single country in each region, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, respectively. In compact neighborhoods lacking waste management services, some residents may be concerned about the open burning of plastic waste. In such instances, households may choose to burn plastic waste in their traditional indoor stoves to avoid drawing concern. Respondents were asked to indicate why households might burn plastic waste as a household fuel, based on their levels of agreement with the question “Below are some reasons why households might burn plastic waste for household fuel. Please rate the extent to which you agree with these statements”. Respondents indicated strong agreement that a lack of awareness of the health impacts of burning plastic was a reason for burning plastic waste, a finding that is also consistent across regions (Fig. The second highest level of agreement was for two other reasons: to “manage waste” and cope with “expensive clean fuel”. Respondents expressed lower agreement on the role of low availability of traditional fuels as a reason for burning plastic. They generally disagreed that plastic is a versatile fuel or that the burning of plastic waste as a fuel is socially acceptable. In the regionally disaggregated results, respondents from Latin America and the Caribbean tended to highlight a lack of waste management and a lack of awareness as the main reasons for burning plastic. In contrast, respondents from Asia, Southern Africa, and West Africa also tended to emphasize the role played by the low availability of traditional fuels. Awareness of these risks was assessed, for four different types of risks, based on agreement with the statement “What do you believe are the major risks of burning plastic for households?” (the level of agreement was recorded on a Likert scale ranging from extremely unlikely (1) to extremely likely (5)). Respondents strongly agreed on the risks and impacts of toxic emissions inhalation, fire hazards, and food contamination, with results also consistent across regions (Supplementary Fig. While a detailed understanding of the risks from burning plastic waste to the environment and human health is limited, there was a high degree of awareness that these impacts could be harmful, with both direct and indirect consequences. More specifically, out of 936 respondents, 40% indicated that they thought burning plastic was extremely likely to contribute to fire hazards, and 40% stated this was somewhat likely. Regarding the risk of toxic emissions and air pollution from burning plastic, 62% indicated that this was extremely likely, and 26% indicated that it was somewhat likely. Roughly 6 in 10 respondents thought it was extremely likely that toxic chemicals from burning plastic waste could contaminate food and water, while 29% indicated it was somewhat likely. Given the higher exposure rates for household members who spend more time indoors, respondents were also asked to indicate the likelihood of greater risks of exposure for females, children, people living with disabilities, and senior citizens. Forty-six percent of respondents reported that increased risk of exposure was extremely likely, and 34% reported that it was somewhat likely (See Supplementary Fig. Energy use, including the burning of plastic waste, is contextual, and addressing energy poverty requires localized solutions that are appropriate to their specific context46,47. Respondents were asked to rank what they believed was the most important solution to the issue of burning plastic waste as household fuel in their city. 6, the average rankings (where lower values indicate higher effectiveness) suggest that improved and expanded solid waste management services for informal settlements (waste management) are seen as the most effective solution to the problem, followed by increased access to clean energy technologies and raising awareness about the negative effects of burning plastics for fuel. Bans on the use of plastic were also ranked as having high importance, whereas the supply of traditional fuels and the conversion of plastic to a safe fuel were among the lower-ranked solutions. There are regional variations in perceptions of these solutions. Respondents from South Asia and Southern Africa ranked a ban on plastic use as the most effective solution, possibly due to plastic ban policies. Respondents in Latin America and the Caribbean considered waste management and clean cooking to be more important than awareness. In East and Central Africa, access to clean energy was ranked as the most important solution among low-income households. While these results are subjective and may be subject to differing interpretations of this question, the result underscores the need for contextual strategies. Mean value for the ranked relative importance of possible solutions. a Energy access-related solutions for the whole sample, and by region. Responses were ranked in order of importance (1 = the most effective solution and 7 = the least effective solution) (N = 832). Individuals active in socially engaged professions, e.g., community-based organization personnel, community workers, or teachers, were significantly more likely to agree that plastic waste burning occurs in their communities (p = 0.003). However, they did not report direct awareness of others or themselves engaging in it (Fig. Respondents who perceived municipal solid waste management fees as unaffordable (p < 0.007, Column 1; p < 0.019, Column 2) were also more likely to report that plastic burning occurs and that they engage in it. Meanwhile, city-level factors such as quantities of plastic waste (p < 0.023, Column 2; p < 0.008, Column 3), and population without waste collection services (p < 0.000, Column 2; p < 0.000, Column 3) were positively correlated with direct awareness of others' or individuals' own plastic waste burning for energy purposes. The insignificant correlations between the volume of mismanaged plastic waste in the city and the population without waste collection, on one hand, and respondents' general agreement that plastic is burned for energy purposes, on the other, may be related to overreporting of general awareness compared to direct awareness. The dependent variable is binary, converted to indicate if respondents somewhat or strongly agreed with the statements “It is common practice to burn plastic waste (like polythene bags) in the fire of traditional stoves,” as 1, and otherwise 0. 1, which takes the value of 1 if respondents answered ‘yes' to the question: “Are you aware of households burning plastic waste as fuel to meet their household energy needs (e.g., fire starters and for cooking and heating)?”, otherwise 0. Used (lavender) shows the odds ratio of respondents' own burning plastic waste for various purposes, where the dependent variable takes a value of 1 if respondents reported burning plastic themselves (yes, I have done it) for cooking, heating, mixed energy use, preparing cattle feed, deterring pests, or starting fires. To improve the readability of coefficient estimates and odds ratios in the coefficient plot, variables measured in percentages (no waste collection and basic sanitation services) and grams (total waste and plastic waste generation) were rescaled (robust 95% confidence interval in bar). Errors are clustered at the city level. See Supplementary Table 3 for summary statistics of variables and Supplementary Table 4 for full results). Fuel supply factors (availability and accessibility to clean fuels), urban waste management (linked to economic development), and demand drivers (e.g., higher development and income levels reducing reliance on polluting fuels) all influence plastic burning practices. Interpreted together, they highlight the link between inadequate waste management systems, expensive clean cooking fuel, and reliance on plastic waste as a household fuel. A perception that waste management services and clean fuels are expensive highlights and reiterates the vital importance of affordability. Reliance on traditional fuels and stoves also contributes to household vulnerability, which in turn facilitates the domestic burning of plastic as a fuel. While open burning of plastic waste is a well-known and common waste management strategy in many cities in the Global South, the widespread prevalence and correlates of domestic burning of these materials have not previously been documented. The energy sources used by households are determined by the context in which they live, as well as the availability and affordability of alternative options. However, a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the scale and distribution of plastic waste burning has heretofore been missing, impeding efforts to plan and develop effective strategies to mitigate the problem. The results of this study lend stronger credence to this conjecture; a survey of key informants from 26 countries in the Global South reveals that plastic waste has been integrated into household energy practices in numerous and diverse ways in many urban communities. Four key insights emerge from this study. First, the use of plastic as a household fuel is prevalent in cities of the Global South. Though the study statistics should not be interpreted to be representative at the population level in the survey locations, owing to the purposive sampling strategy that was utilized to select knowledgeable community informants as respondents, 16% of respondents reported burning plastic as a fuel in their own households, and awareness of such practices was much higher. Importantly, key community informants are likely to have a higher local socioeconomic status, and their reported rate of burning plastic as fuel be lower than less advantaged groups. Nonetheless, the reported prevalence of this practice is comparable to that found in the World Bank's Multitier Framework Survey conducted in Northwest Nigeria, where 13% of surveyed households reported burning waste, including plastic, as a household fuel, or in smaller-scale surveys in Eswatini and Guatemala15,19. Second, the reported burning of plastic waste was found to be prevalent in many countries and cities in this study, suggesting that this practice does not result solely from energy poverty, but also represents a vital informal solution in many settings to cope with systemic municipal service gaps and a high rate of mismanaged plastic. Low-income households living in precarious urban conditions are often forced to self-manage waste21, and frequently rely on low-cost and easily accessible methods for disposal of accumulating and non-biodegradable waste. The risk that more households will resort to burning plastic waste as fuel could increase unless these service gaps are addressed. Third, combustion of waste, including plastic, can help households living in extreme poverty to satisfy their energy needs in the face of growing scarcity of other traditional low-cost fuel sources. The survey results help illustrate how burning plastic waste emerges as such a zero- or low-cost option and the challenges in deciding between cooking a meal for the family and exposure to potentially hazardous emissions. Poverty, deep inequality and unmanaged urbanization within cities, reduced availability of traditional fuels, and increasing plastic pollution could intensify such practices. Fourth, our analysis serves to underscore the synergistic relationship between United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): making cities more sustainable (SDG11) and access to clean energy (SDG7). Efforts to achieve SDG11, through the provision of adequate housing and improved and inclusive waste management in other cities, will weaken the supply driver of highly available plastic waste and the need for self-management of that waste. SDG11.6 specifically targets increased waste collection services, management of waste in controlled facilities, and reduction of fine particulate matter concentrations in cities. Reducing the burning of waste plastic as fuel is thus a potential channel and area of action to lower emissions through improved waste management. Meanwhile, on the demand side, willingness to burn plastic waste as a fuel or use a traditional stove to manage it is limited if viable and affordable alternatives are present. At the core of this practice is the necessity to satisfy energy demands and to eliminate plastic pollution, at low or zero financial cost. Therefore, progress towards achieving SDG7, which has been greater in urban than in rural settings48,49,50 but has largely overlooked the persistent deprivation of low-income neighborhoods in cities in low- and middle-income countries, will weaken the demand element of this practice. The design of practical solutions to tackle this complex problem requires a deep and contextual understanding of the interlinked problems of household energy poverty and inadequate waste management services, coupled with a willingness to test programs or policies that address those problems. For example, improved solid waste management, specifically waste collection, could decrease the need for burning of plastic as a waste management strategy, but effectively delivering such services in crowded, low-income areas, where collecting waste management fees is difficult and trust in formal government institutions is low, remains a challenge. Similarly, addressing energy insecurity requires new, low-cost clean energy innovations or well-targeted financial support that renders existing solutions more affordable. Moreover, tackling each of these problems in isolation—or incompletely—risks failure. Restrictions on open burning alone, for instance, could push households to burn even more plastic waste inside their homes. This study took an initial step toward filling critical knowledge gaps in this domain; however, three main limitations should be addressed in future work to enhance understanding and inform decision-making. First, as noted above, the study used a purposive sampling strategy to select knowledgeable community informants as respondents and thus does not provide a population-representative understanding of the scale and distribution of plastic waste burning to meet households' waste management and energy needs. Such respondents may have a biased view of practices in their communities. To build on and validate this work, further investigation is recommended using representative household samples from across the Global South, including plastic waste hotspots and notspots, underserved communities, and informal settlements. This investigation should incorporate plastic as a fuel category and consider local waste management and settlement contexts. Such work could also investigate these practices in rural areas, which our study did not consider. Second, and relatedly, this study employed a relatively short, internet-based survey due to resource and logistical constraints, which limits the extent to which we could more fully investigate the nature and drivers of this practice. Third, the study does not identify the impacts of these practices on household health and well-being, as well as environmental quality, nor is it suitable for identifying practical strategies to mitigate harmful effects. Work on the former requires attention to research designs that allow valid inferences on the specific impacts of plastic waste burning, which typically co-exists with many other harms, on individuals' and overall social welfare20,51. The latter, meanwhile, requires careful impact evaluations of pilot and scaled-up efforts—combining improved energy access and waste management elements—to reduce the prevalence of this practice. Such studies must devote attention to measuring emissions, food contamination risks, and health and welfare endpoints, to provide deeper insights into the behavioral, economic, and systemic drivers compelling households to use plastic waste for fuel. Indeed, key factors identified in this study—such as inadequate waste management, energy poverty, limited accessibility and affordability of clean and alternative fuels, cultural norms, and systemic deficiencies in waste management, inclusive urban governance, sustainable human settlement and energy infrastructure—warrant closer examination. These may include educational campaigns highlighting the health and environmental hazards of burning plastic, improving access to clean and affordable energy alternatives, strengthening waste management systems, introducing cost-effective technologies for cleaner plastic combustion, and other viable strategies. As rapid urbanization continues to outpace the expansion of essential services in many regions, the urgency of implementing these measures will only intensify. The analysis presented in this paper draws on survey data collected from key informants purposively recruited by the research team, which included researchers based in each of the 26 study countries. In each country, efforts were made to survey expert individuals from seven groups that included: a) researchers affiliated with universities or research institutes; b) local government officials or civil service personnel; c) socially engaged professionals, such as doctors and lawyers; d) community leaders (e.g., ward leaders or traditional leaders); e) personnel from NGOs or community-based organization (e.g., cooperatives); f) private sector representatives, such as waste collection managers; and g) other knowledgeable individuals who, while not belonging to the above groups, possess valuable insights into urban realities. The sample is not nationally representative; however, the perspectives of these knowledgeable and community-engaged informants capture a broad range of practices across surveyed countries. (Refer to Supplementary Table 1 for a full list of study countries). The survey was conducted between July and November 2024. Country collaborators distributed the survey via email or by sharing flyers containing links and QR codes to an online Qualtrics form. These flyers were circulated through personal connections and during seminars, conferences, and community meetings to target respondents with relevant knowledge of local urban realities and the survey topics. A survey guideline provided potential respondents with an overview of the study and instructions for completing the questionnaire. Respondents also had the option to request in-person support from a local collaborator for completing survey questions if needed, e.g., for language interpretation or if they were unable to read the questions in the instrument. In such cases, a collaborator or trained enumerator conducted the survey in person or via phone and recorded the responses using the online survey platform. The survey was implemented in two languages: French and English. The French version was used in Togo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while the English version was used in all other participating countries. The study was approved by the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (approval number HRE2024-0177). The questionnaire was structured into multiple sections covering waste and plastic pollution management, cooking fuel use, and the practice of burning plastic (Supplementary Data 1). It included questions on respondents' awareness of direct observations of plastic burning in their communities for household energy needs. The final section gathered information on respondent characteristics and socio-demographic details. Respondents were asked to respond to “In your opinion, how prevalent do you think burning waste plastic is in your city?” on a Likert scale (Not prevalent at all (1) to extremely prevalent (5)) (Q8.1) to understand the general prevalence of burning plastic waste in their local community. There were three questions in different sections of the survey about the burning of waste plastic by households for fuel, which were designed to triangulate on perceptions of this practice within each study location. The first question asked respondents to indicate their level of agreement, on a Likert scale (1 to 5), with the statement “Plastic is used for cooking fuel as a replacement for other fuels.” (Q3.1.6). This question sought to assess whether respondents believed that some households in their city burn plastic, at least partially, to meet cooking fuel needs beyond simple ignition. Second, participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement, using a Likert scale (Strongly disagree (1) to Strongly agree (5)), with the statement: “It is common practice to burn plastic waste (like polythene bags) in the fire of traditional stoves” (Q3.3.2). This question aimed to evaluate the prevalence of burning plastic waste in household stoves, in a way that might also capture burning for purposes of igniting the fire or simply to eliminate plastic waste. The third question, “Are you aware of households burning waste plastic as fuel to meet their household energy needs (e.g. fire starters and for cooking and heating)?” (Q5.1), with responses of no, unsure/maybe and yes, was aimed to understand respondent awareness about the practice of burning waste plastic as fuel in their locality. A follow-up question was asked to the respondents who selected yes to the third question to capture more directly their source of awareness on various purposes of burning waste plastic as fuel. The follow-up question asked “Please indicate whether you are aware of the following scenarios occurring” (Q5.2) where respondents selected among several options—‘No'; ‘Unsure'; ‘Yes; I have done it; ‘Yes, I have seen it'; and ‘Yes, I have heard about it'—for a) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fuel for cooking / preparing food (Cooking); b) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fuel for heating (Heating); c) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fuel for cattle feed preparation (Cattle feed); d) Plastic waste is burnt alongside other fuels like firewood (Mix fuel); e) Plastic waste being burnt and used to produce smoke that will deter pests e.g. mosquitos (Deter pest); and f) Plastic waste being burnt and used as a fire starter (Fire starter). Respondents were also asked about the type of waste plastic burned (Q5.5 and Q5.6), the type of stove used for burning (Q5.7), the reason for burning waste plastic as fuel (Q6.1), perceptions of likelihood of burning by different socio-demographic characteristics (Q7.1), and associated risks (Q7.2) and solutions (Q8.2). A total of 1188 respondents started the survey, but 170 (14% of the sample) responses were not usable (Supplementary Fig. Among these unusable responses, 26 were from individuals who did not consent to participate, 26 came from non-sample countries (likely provided through email referrals), and the remaining responses were from individuals who initially agreed to participate but abandoned the survey after answering only a few questions. This drop-off may have been caused by challenges encountered while completing the survey on some types of mobile devices. After data cleaning, 1018 responses were finally retained for analysis (86% of total responses), though some of these responses contained missing data for specific questions. Of the 904 respondents with fully complete survey data, 35.5% were researchers at universities or research institutes, 20.8% were affiliated with local government or civil service, 6.8% were socially engaged professionals (e.g., teacher, health care provider), 1.9% were community leaders, 9.4% worked for NGOs or CBOs, and 11.6% were employed by private operators and companies (Table 1, Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Data 2). The remaining 14% were from other categories such as consultants, politicians, contractors and animal scientists. The coverage of respondents' work organizations included: 18% in multinational organizations, 45% in national organizations, 20% at municipal or city-level structures, and 17% working at the sub-municipal or community level. Slightly less than half (43%) of the survey respondents were female, and the mean respondent age was 33 years (s.d. Finally, regarding experience, 43% of respondents reported having more than five years' experience in their field. We employed logistic regression for all models reported in Fig. The first model reported as green points with horizontal confidence interval bars in Fig. Odds ratios were estimated for agreement and awareness regarding the use of plastic waste as household fuel. The first variable focuses on respondents' subjective agreement, where the dependent variable reflects respondents' agreement that plastic waste is burned in household fires, based on Fig. Specifically, the dependent variable is assigned a value of 1 if the respondent somewhat or strongly agreed with the statement “It is common practice to burn plastic waste (like polythene bags) in the fire of traditional stoves.” The purple points with horizontal confidence interval bars in Fig. Specifically, the dependent variable is assigned a value of 1 if the respondent selected yes to the question “Are you aware of households burning waste plastic as fuel to meet their household energy needs (e.g., fire starters and for cooking and heating)?”. 7 takes the value 1 if the respondent selected ‘Yes, I have done it' for any of the six different purposes of burning plastic waste as fuel and otherwise is 0. All models use the same set of independent variables. The independent variables include respondent demographics and respondent subjective perceptions of the cost of clean fuel and solid waste management. Country-level data includes basic access to sanitation services (% of urban population)52. These variables represent both supply- and demand-side factors that may influence the prevalence of plastic waste burning while controlling for respondent characteristics. For variables with missing data, we imputed a country median where applicable and controlled for missing data in the regression model. Standard errors in all regression models are clustered at the city level. We note that the survey is not representative of the population in the study locations, and that all responses should be interpreted as being based on respondents' subjective views of the practice and implications of burning plastic waste as a fuel in their cities. Though these respondents are knowledgeable about the contexts they live in, they may nonetheless have a biased view of practices in their communities. This collaborative study consists of local researchers from survey countries, multidisciplinary experts and early career researchers. More specifically, the draft survey was circulated for comments and improvement and revised before formatting in Qualtrics. In response to collaborator feedback, the survey was translated into the French language, and a survey implementation guideline was prepared to facilitate the process. The survey question was then piloted, and we discussed the implementation plan several times to ensure it was easy and smooth for both researchers to disseminate and for respondents to answer. Local researchers were responsible for local distribution of the survey and were given discretion in deciding whether to implement the survey or not, and where to focus the data collection in each of their countries to ensure the survey does not involve risk to health, safety, security or other risks to researchers and also the research is locally relevant. Contributors from different countries also helped distribute the survey link where relevant. In several countries, for example, Benin and Mongolia, the local researchers could not implement the survey due to a number of reasons, such as difficulty in translation of questions and time constraints. We collected responses using an online format designed in Qualtrics. Each researcher was provided with an email template, flyer and QR code for respondents to use in accessing the survey. First, it focused on subjective perceptions of respondents regarding plastic pollution and the burning of plastic waste as household fuel, which are not particularly sensitive topics. Second, the survey did not involve animals or pose a bio-risk. Third, the survey did not ask for personal identifiers: name, phone number, email or postal address. Respondents were only asked to write their city name and select the name of their country. Thus, the survey was fully anonymised; we could not track who responded. Finally, the survey did not collect any biological materials, cultural artifacts or associated traditional knowledge. We obtained overall ethics approval for the study from the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number HRE2024-0177), with all team contributors included as co-PIs. All local researchers were requested to consult their institutions and comply with local regulations before starting the survey. Where appropriate, an ethics application was filed by the in-country collaborators to ensure local compliance, but in many cases, the anonymous nature of the survey and the approval from Curtin University meant that additional approvals were not required. This was true for the researchers affiliated with partner institutions in Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, India, Lao PDR, Thailand, DR Congo, Eswatini, Rwanda, Botswana, Vietnam, Uganda, the Gambia and India. Other partner institutions do not have an ethics committee and instead defer to the judgment of ethics review teams at the PI institution (e.g., at Curtin University). In such cases, the local researcher obtained permission from their institution before implementing the survey without carrying out a full review by a formal ethics board. Local researchers, such as in Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana, applied for and received full ethics approval, whereas a researcher from Sri Lanka applied for ethics approval at their institution and received an exemption. Note that the surveys were undertaken at different times, as some of the collaborators had to go through the ethics approval process, while others did not. All contributors were included as contributors of the paper and have access to the dataset. Results are disaggregated at the regional level to ensure that they are not stigmatizing or pose a risk to the researchers or participants. The manuscript has used localized evidence and has taken local research relevance into account to build its arguments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As people return to gyms or start new fitness routines in the new year, new research suggests that even a short burst of intense exercise could play a role in protecting against cancer. These rapid shifts appear to suppress bowel cancer cell growth while also speeding up the repair of damaged DNA. Many of these molecules are known to reduce inflammation, support healthy blood vessels, and improve metabolism. When scientists exposed bowel cancer cells in the lab to blood containing these exercise-driven molecules, they observed widespread genetic changes. The research shows that exercise sends molecular signals through the bloodstream that influence genes controlling tumor growth and genetic stability. The results add to growing evidence that staying physically active is an important part of cancer prevention. Dr. Sam Orange, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Exercise Physiology at Newcastle University and lead author of the study, said: "What's remarkable is that exercise doesn't just benefit healthy tissues, it sends powerful signals through the bloodstream that can directly influence thousands of genes in cancer cells. "It's an exciting insight because it opens the door to find ways that mimic or augment the biological effects of exercise, potentially improving cancer treatment and, crucially, patient outcomes. "In the future, these insights could lead to new therapies that imitate the beneficial effects of exercise on how cells repair damaged DNA and use fuel for energy." At the same time, genes linked to rapid cell division were turned down, which may make cancer cells less aggressive. All participants were overweight or obese (a risk factor of cancer) but otherwise healthy. Each volunteer completed a short but intense cycling test that lasted about 10 minutes. Thirteen of those proteins increased after exercise, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which plays a role in repairing damaged DNA. Dr. Orange, a Clinical Exercise Physiologist at The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: "These results suggest that exercise doesn't just benefit healthy tissues, it may also create a more hostile environment for cancer cells to grow. One bout of exercise, lasting just 10 minutes, sends powerful signals to the body. "It's a reminder that every step, every session, counts when it comes to doing your best to protect your health." In the UK, one person is diagnosed with bowel cancer every 12 minutes, adding up to nearly 44,000 cases each year. Researchers estimate that regular physical activity lowers bowel cancer risk by about 20%. Exercise does not have to mean gym workouts or sports. They also aim to study how exercise-related effects interact with common cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
