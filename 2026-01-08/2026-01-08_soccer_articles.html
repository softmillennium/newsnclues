Simeone's side come off a draw against Real Sociedad, while Xabi Alonso's Real Madrid arrive after surrendering a four-point lead at the top of LaLiga. Kylian Mbappé did not travel with the squad to Saudi Arabia due to a sprain in his left knee. However, he has not been completely ruled out of returning if Real Madrid reach the final against Barcelona. Xabi Alonso already faced heavy scrutiny at the end of September, when Real Madrid were thrashed 5–2 by Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano. It marked his second major defeat in a high-profile match as Real Madrid head coach. That result followed another alarming precedent: a 4–0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer Club World Cup.

Match ticket information and “gamification features”, such as filters and stickers, to enhance engagement, will also be available. “This is an innovative and creative collaboration that will connect more fans across the globe to the FIFA World Cup in unprecedented ways, bringing them behind the curtain and closer to the action than ever before,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said. “As football grows and evolves — uniting an increasing number of people — so should the way it is shared and promoted.” U.S. President Donald Trump had expressed a desire to ban TikTok during his first term in office to resolve national security concerns. In 2024, U.S. Congress passed legislation to address this as lawmakers from both parties believed the app could blackmail Americans or influence elections. In December of last year, however, TikTok's chief executive announced they had signed an agreement which has been blessed by Trump, who declared he is “saving” the app. TikTok, which announced reaching a billion users in 2021, has collaborated in this way for sports tournaments before, notably for the 2023 Women's World Cup which was the first official collaboration with FIFA. Midway through the tournament the official hashtag had 1.8 billion views and similarly featured selected creators, who were able to earn money from their content.

HERRIMAN, Utah (Thursday January 8, 2026) - U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player January training camp to be held at the Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif that includes Utah Royals starting goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn. As the January training camp falls outside a FIFA competition window, Hayes named a roster made up entirely of players from the National Women's Soccer League.

McGlynn was selected for multiple rosters with the U.S. Women's National Team throughout the 2025 season and continues that streak, selected for the 26-player roster by Head Coach Emma Hayes. Through consistent excellence at the club and international levels, McGlynn has secured regular selection to the U.S. Women's National Team, continuing to influence the program both on and off the pitch as the 2027 FIFA World Cup approaches.

The USWNT squad is set to play two matches in California against Paraguay on Saturday January 24th at 3:30 pm MT on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo and Peacock in Spanish before taking on Chile Tuesday January 27th at 8 pm MT on TBS and HBO Max in English, Universo and Peacock in Spanish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KANSAS CITY (Jan. 8, 2026) — Four Kansas City Current players have been called up to the first United States Women's National Team (USWNT) training camp of 2026, as announced by U.S. Soccer on Thursday. The camp will run Jan. 17-27 at Dignity Health Sports Park (DHSP) in Carson, Calif., and two international friendlies will be played. The Paraguay contest will air on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English while the match vs. Chile will broadcast on TBS and HBO Max. Both games will be on Universo, Peacock and Futbol de Primera radio in Spanish as well as Westwood One radio in English. After featuring in the Futures Camp a year ago, Hutton received her first senior national team call-up for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup and has since appeared in all five subsequent camps. This marks the third senior team invitation for both LaBonta and Rodriguez. Sentnor's initial USWNT call-up was in November 2024 and she has been called into all but one senior camp since. Hutton's first USWNT appearance was in the SheBelieves Cup last year when she started against Australia and played 70 minutes, and she has seen significant minutes in each call-up since. She logged a full match against Ireland on June 26 before she registered her first career assist in another friendly with the Irish on June 29. Three days later, the 19-year-old notched her first international goal in the 36th minute in a 3-0 rout of Canada. She most recently played every minute in both friendlies with Italy during the final camp of 2025. LaBonta's first appearance for the Stars and Stripes was on May 31, 2025, when she came on as a substitute in the 70th minute to help the team to a 3-0 win against China PR. During her second camp, she entered the match vs. Portugal on Oct. 26 in the 86th minute before playing 23 minutes against New Zealand at CPKC Stadium a few days later. Rodriguez's consistent performances during the 2025 NWSL season prompted her to receive her first senior team call-up during the summer FIFA window. She was part of the starting lineup in that match and logged a full 90 minutes. The defender was also called into the final camp of 2025 but did not see action in either friendly. Sentnor earned her first senior team cap in November 2024 vs. England at Wembley Stadium. Her breakthrough came at the 2025 SheBelieves Cup where she finished the tournament with two goals and an assist, including a goal in her first start on Feb. 20 against Colombia to become the first U.S. player to score her first USWNT goal in the SheBelieves Cup Tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN JOSE, Calif. (Jan. 8, 2026) – U.S. Soccer announced today that Bay FC goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz has been selected to participate in the upcoming U.S. Women's National Team January training camp from Jan. 17-28. Her selection followed a standout NWSL campaign for Bay FC that saw her rank fifth among all goalkeepers in saves, record four shutouts and win e.l.f. Cosmetics Save of the Week four times on a league-best 12 nominations. She earned her first selection to a national team program at any level in May, representing the U-23 Women's National Team as an overage player for training and matches in Germany. The USWNT will close this month's camp with two friendly matches, hosting Paraguay Jan. 24 at Dignity Health Sports Park (2:30 p.m. PT on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo and Peacock in Spanish, on Westwood One radio in English and on Futbol de Primera radio in Spanish) before traveling north to face Chile Jan. 27 at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara, Calif. (7 p.m. PT on TBS and HBO Max in English, Universo and Peacock in Spanish, and on the radio in English on Westwood One and in Spanish on Futbol de Primera).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's the purpose of a World Cup base camp. Kansas City has three base camp options: Compass Mineral Sporting Fields, where Sporting Kansas City practices; the KC Women's Soccer Training Complex for the KC Current; and the University of Kansas' facilities and Rock Chalk Park. Pam Kramer, the president of KC2026, said each nation had to give FIFA its top five base-camp choices by Monday. Location and FIFA rankings will be two key ways to determine which country gets its first choice. Argentina is ranked second in the world by FIFA, one spot behind Spain, which is leaning toward Chicago or Atlanta for a base camp, according to a report in Spain. That's bad news for England and coach Thomas Tuchel. Following last month's World Cup draw, The Guardian reported “Tuchel had cleared an FA (Football Association) plan for England to be based in ­Kansas after a pre-tournament ­training camp in Fort Lauderdale, but after the draw ... there are concerns that the Netherlands will be allocated their chosen facility at ­Sporting Kansas City, a ­high-performance centre used by US Soccer.” The Netherlands also play one of their three group-stage matches at Arrowhead Stadium. But the Netherlands hasn't picked a base camp site yet. England likely would have stuck with Kansas City if FIFA gave them the first option. England, which is fourth in FIFA's world rankings, plays group-stage matches in Arlington, Texas; Foxborough, Massachusetts; and East Rutherford, New Jersey. While England seems to have preferred Sporting Kansas City's training site, it is not known why Tuchel would not consider the KC Current or Rock Chalk Park options for a base camp.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1934 and 1978, Fifa's big event was given over to authoritarian aims. There's no more doubt that 2026 will be the same Italy's dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup, managing it with a heavy hand and even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn't sate his expansionist appetites. It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla's military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power through systematic detention, torture and murder. Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off. Argentina spared no expense in putting on its World Cup, even though the total cost was a state secret. But the right-wing government also didn't bother to slow the pace at which it disappeared political dissidents and opponents. Germany captain Berti Vogts proclaimed that “Argentina is a country where order reigns. I haven't seen a single political prisoner,” though, so no matter. When Vladimir Putin presided over the opening ceremony to the 2018 World Cup, it had been four years since his forces annexed Crimea from Ukraine and he backed pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas region. This conclusion was crystalized by last week's forceful and bloody abduction of the sitting president of Venezuela and his wife, before US president Donald Trump announced that the socialist state was now effectively an American-run territory. That was, of course, after Trump, or his henchmen, softened their support for Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia; literally blew boats out of the water on mere suspicion of drug trafficking; threatened to invade Mexico and annex Canada (their World Cup co-hosts! We don't yet know how far this administration, which promised isolationism but has instead delivered geopolitical mayhem, will go in a foreign policy that lacks any coherence beyond the governing assumption that it can do whatever it feels like. Fifa president Gianni Infantino has been immovable in his support for Trump. It's been some time since we had a World Cup without reasonable controversy. The 2010 and 2014 editions in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, were widely panned locally for the strain they put on nations with far more pressing needs. And then there's the 2034 World Cup, which has already been signed over to the Saudi Arabia's strongman de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman. The US-dominated World Cup fits neatly into this run. This nation isn't presently in a position to lecture anybody else on human rights – nor has it ever been. The Qataris and Saudis are sportswashing outliers no longer. This is just what the World Cup is now: a convenient vehicle for carrying the aims of dangerously self-interested people. Perhaps some kind of boycott movement from fans toward Fifa events will gather steam, although the slow slide of acceptance to where we are suggests otherwise. It's doubtful such a boycott would accomplish much by way of embarrassing the men, and the odd woman, who have killed off the parts of themselves that once felt shame anyway. Soccer has fully gone the way of the Olympics and Formula One, which long ago made their peace with whatever sordid baggage came attached to the highest bidder for their events.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few U.S. men's national team players, current or former, are better qualified to talk about the World Cup than Clint Dempsey. Few U.S. men's national team players, current or former, are better qualified to talk about the World Cup than Clint Dempsey. After all, he is the only American player to have scored in three tournaments. Deuce, as he is known by friends and teammates, is second only to Landon Donovan in career goals in the world's great spectacle (five to four). So, when Dempsey, who has become a spokesman for Unilever for the World Cup, talks about the greatest show on earth, we should listen. In 1994, the U.S. registered a 1-1-1 mark and four points to keep its hopes alive, avoiding becoming the first host side to fail to get out of the group stage in one piece. Eight years later in 2002, South Africa made history by not booking a spot beyond the first round. In my opinion, it's made the group stage not as exciting. You're having eight third-place teams being able to get out of the group. So, if you're not able to get out of the group in this World Cup, I think that that would be a failure, for sure. “So, I'm not going to put a ceiling on it. I hope they catch fire at the right time. You're seeing more that they're adding to the attack, and you got some exciting friendlies coming up potentially, against Portugal and Germany. I'm looking forward to seeing how they catch fire and get this country believing. But also, what we saw from South Korea in terms of South Korea's being the host country and getting everybody behind him and going on a great run.” Still, it was a great run that many U.S. Soccer officials would love to see. There are some soccer officials in this country who feel just hosting the World Cup will boost the sport into a high orbit in this country. Two years after welcoming the world, Major League Soccer was born. [Brazil] went on to win the World Cup. We were starting to believe again and have a professional league. It gave kids hope that maybe one day they could play soccer professionally and maybe try to play in a World Cup and do what they were able to see.” A 13-year-old Dempsey was one of those kids in 1994. “I think having something on home soil right in front of your eyes really inspires the youth, and it inspired me in terms of what this World Cup can bring,” he said. It looks like there's more Copa Americas that are starting to be played here. There are talks of it in 2028 maybe being here as well. “I got to play in one of those. So, I just hope that maybe, in terms of domestically, it inspires more kids to take their game to the next level and take it further than the current players have been able to take it. “Maybe with MLS, it gets rid of the salary cap. Because we see that we're going on the same schedule as the European schedule in terms of dealing with transfers and transfer deadlines, maybe it's a situation where, long as you're within the FIFA financial fair play, then you're able to strengthen your team as much as you want to because of their your ability to be able to do so. Speaking or players in their prime, at the age of 27, Christian Pulisic will be in his prime this June. Dempsey has no worries whether Pulisic will excel because he has come through in just about every competition in which he plays. “One off, I want to say it's a team effort,” he said. But what I will say about Christian in big moments, whether it was World Cup qualifying or we're playing in World Cup or playing in Copa America, he's someone that that steps up and scores your goals and gets you assists. So, I'm not worried about what he'll be able to do on the pitch as long as he's healthy. I think he's one of those difference makers. We were lucky to have him; I've been really impressed with what he's been able to do at A.C. Milan in Serie A. With five months until the U.S.'s opening match against Paraguay at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. on June 12, it will come down to every player keeping fight and healthy, like any other national team. “I just hope our players stay fit,” Dempsey said. Dempsey was encouraged that Antonee Robinson, an attacking left back who has set up goals for Fulham in the Premier League, returned from a knee injury. It's good to see [Folarin] Balogun's fit and playing really well in the Champions League, and also what he's been able to do in the league and also with the national team. And just that competition for spots in that position with Haji Wright and now [Ricardo] Pepe being more fit again. Then you got the likes of Tyler Adams and what he's doing in the Premier League, and Chris Richards as well at Crystal Palace, winning trophies with them and the confidence he's getting. So I'm really excited about this team and what they can do.” Years ago, American soccer fans were spoiled by the one-two punch of Landon Donovan and Dempsey in the Starting XI. It was pretty devastating as both players are tied for the all-time U.S. men's goal-scoring lead with 57 goals apiece. “I think Balogun is going to be the number nine that starts, but he does have competition for that spot with Haji Wright and Pepe,” Dempsey said. I just think he's someone who has it all. Playing in three World Cups is a big deal. Becoming the first American to score in three consecutive tournaments is even a bigger deal. Almost someone that could stand up and be counted. I took take a lot of pride in.” “Seeing players like Diego Maradona, [Michel] Platini, seeing Hugo Sanchez, watching Zico, all these different players from these different teams, and seeing the crowds and seeing how passionate they were for their country, that was pretty cool for me to see that people were as passionate about the same sport as me,” he said. “Which was weird growing up in Texas, because I didn't really feel like I related with a lot of people. Most people they're like, ‘Why aren't you playing baseball, basketball or American football?' He made his World Cup debut at the 2006 tournament in Germany. “I remember like it was yesterday,” he said. “If I'm being honest with you, I remember playing in the U-20 World Cup and not getting much playing time. I remember playing in the World Cup in 2006 the first game, not getting any playing time against the Czech Republic, and thinking to myself, is this going to be another World Cup like the U20s, where a tournament goes by and I really don't have much of a say.” In the Americans' 2-1 loss to Ghana in their final group stage match, Dempsey found the net for his first World Cup goal. Dempsey said that the goal “gave us a little bit of a lifeline, because if we beat Ghana, that we would be able to get out of the group, but we came up short. But it was dream come true for me, it's what I dreamed about as a kid, playing in a World Cup, score in the World Cup, and by being able to do that. Dempsey also talked about his partnership with Unilever. “What drew me to partnering with Unilever was the opportunity to help fans prepare for FIFA World Cup 26,” he said. This tournament is set to be the biggest yet, and with my home country hosting, it makes this a special moment for me, and so many fans. “Unilever helps people feel confident, fresh, and ready for the moments that matter most, especially on game day. Having experienced the FIFA World Cup firsthand as a player, it's exciting to now be part of something that helps fans feel closer and more focused on the action.” And there is an opportunity for fans to win World Cup tickets through Unilever. “Fans can enter for a chance to win FIFA World Cup 26™ tickets, and other prizes, by purchasing gift packs from Dove Men+Care, Degree, or AXE at major retailers or by visiting UnileverWorldCup26.com,” Dempsey said. “They can win things like watch party experiences, home entertainment upgrades, gaming packages and more. It's a fun and easy way to stay fresh while getting ready for the excitement of the FIFA World Cup 26. “This is something fans really don't want to miss. With three countries hosting, FIFA World Cup 26 is going to be incredible. It's more than just the game — it's about the energy, culture and bringing people together around their love of soccer.</p>

Wirtz is not alone, though, several big name players have opted to go abroad in recent years, leading Dwight Yorke to make the determination that the Bavarians just are not the domestic draw to player that they used to be. Omar Marmoush (Eintracht Frankfurt), Huge Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt), Benjamin Šeško (RB Leipzig), and a host of other players from the Bundesliga have jumped to other leagues after being — at least — loosely linked to Bayern Munich in recent years. “I think if you look at German football, all of them wanted to come here (to England), didn't they? Omar Marmoush, Florian Wirtz and all these guys. Bayern are interested in getting these players. There is at least a bit of context needed as some players who Bayern Munich might have interest in can easily look at depth chart and see a very difficult pathway to consistent playing time or a starting job. Sometimes, it is just comes down to an excessive salary offer or a much stronger chance for a starting gig.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Antoine Semenyo bid farewell to Bournemouth in the best possible fashion, netting a 95th-minute winner at the Vitality Stadium to end his side's 11-match run without a Premier League win. That was the type of stuff you write in movies and no man deserves it more than him." Semenyo's decisive strike against Spurs also perfectly underlined why Manchester City were so happy to have won what was essentially a 'Big Six' battle to sign the Ghana international. The question, of course, is whether Semenyo's £64 million ($86m) move to Manchester has come too late to save City's title hopes, because while Bournemouth fans were celebrating a vital victory on Wednesday night, the home fans still left inside the Etihad were counting the considerable cost of a desperately disappointing 1-1 draw with Brighton... Pep Guardiola's side won eight games in all competitions between November 29 and December 27 - a fantastic run of results that featured a statement victory over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. So, how have City found themselves in the very unusual position of needing Liverpool to win to boost a faltering title tilt? Guardiola's side had had to dig deep to defeat Nottingham Forest, with Rayan Cherki's winning goal arriving with just seven minutes of normal time remaining. There wasn't a doubt in Guardiola's mind that they would have lost that game last season - which only reinforced his belief that his team was back on track after their trophy-less 2024-25 campaign. On TNT Sports, Joe Hart called City's victory at Forest a "championship-winning performance", while midfielder Tijjani Reijnders effectively sent a warning to Arsenal. "We know a lot of clubs suffer here," the Dutch midfielder said. So, it's a very important win - and we are on the hunt." And given City's track record of successful pursuits, it was hard not to fear for Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, a side renowned for falling with the finishing line in sight. However, the title race could be as good as over eight days into the New Year, with City having drawn their first three games of 2026. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting After a scoreless stalemate at Sunderland on January 1, City allowed Chelsea to come away from the Etihad with a point three days later, and Brighton followed suit on Wednesday evening. "Many new players and good things - I love that. "But it was quite similar to the second half against Sunderland. [We are missing] too many clear chances and it's not just one or two players, it's all the players up front. "Scoring goals is part of our job when we analyse the game. [But while] we created a lot of chances in the six yard box, we could not score - and not just one player, everyone. That's why we could not win these games." However, blaming City's struggles solely on profligacy feels like a clear case of over-simplifying the problem. Remember, Chelsea fully deserved their draw at the Etihad. As Fabian Hurzeler also pointed out, Brighton were excellent in the first half of Wednesday's game and really should have been ahead before Haaland scored from the penalty spot just before the break. Injuries undeniably played their part against Brighton, with both Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias unavailable - along with the perma-crocked John Stones. Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has already made it clear that his captain won't come cheap but City are desperate and, after wasting a significant sum of money on two players that weren't anywhere near ready for rigours of English football last January (Vitor Reis and Abdukodir Khusanov), they may well feel that £40m ($54m) is a small price to pay for a proven Premier League performer. Semenyo's mix of pace, physicality and versatility should add another dimension to City's attack, while Guehi now feels like an absolutely essential addition for a back four that looked makeshift even before the injuries to Gvardiol and Dias because of Guardiola's insistence on converting midfielders into full-backs. Indeed, City have proven vulnerable in transitions all season long (the 5-4 win at Fulham is the most glaring case in point) and the obvious hope is that Rodri's return to full match fitness will eventually rectify that particular problem. However, while adding Semenyo and Guehi would also significantly boost City's Champions League bid, their Premier League challenge might already be over - and Guardiola knows it too. The Catalan coach cut a frustrated figure on Wednesday evening, even clashing with Hurzeler at one point, and when asked afterwards about his team winning the league, he replied, "If you don't win games, you cannot think about these things." And certainly not with Arsenal seemingly going from strength to strength at precisely the time we thought they might start exhibiting signs of weakness. So, while Semenyo and Guehi would be game-changing signings for City, it might actually be a case of too little, too late in terms of the title race.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Delaware native is doing everything he can to ensure U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino takes notice ahead of the World Cup later this year. When he returned to the Philly area for the U.S. men's national team's penultimate game of 2025 against Paraguay, it was a homecoming that he said grounded him. Groomed in the Union's academy system and having spent three seasons as a homegrown player on the club's first team, it marked the first occasion in quite some time McKenzie, a native of Bear, Del., returned to his old grounds. But being back, seeing familiar faces, training with the national team in Chester, and even briefly seeing a few family members brought perspective to what he's ultimately trying to do: find his name among 25 other hopefuls eager to make the American roster ahead of June's FIFA men's World Cup. At the time, McKenzie, 26, noted that packing in all of that perspective was part of a “business trip,” one that has continued under the watchful eye of U.S. men's coach Mauricio Pochettino as the starting center back for Toulouse, in France's first division. “It's always special coming back to Philly,” McKenzie said following the U.S. win against Paraguay at Subaru Park on Nov. 15. “I saw some old friends, my family came by the hotel, and just that time to take a little stroll and grab a bite to eat reminded me of who's been behind me on this journey, and who I'm playing for.” And considering there's not a clear early favorite as the No. “The biggest thing is controlling what I can control,” McKenzie said. “Sure, I think about that stuff, but ultimately it's not up to me. Defensively, McKenzie is taking control of a Toulouse team that is eighth in the Ligue 1 standings, just two spots outside of qualifying for the UEFA Europa League next season. “Going back to my [home] club [in Toulouse], that's where a lot of the hard work is done,” he said. Last October he became a dad, and he is trying to find the balance between those early days of fatherhood, his responsibilities to his club, and staying on Pochettino's radar. “He can't really hold his head up right now, and he's not really watching …,” joked McKenzie on CBS Sports' Morning Footy show in October, “but when we look back on these moments, this is something that I'll cherish forever; just to say that he's out there watching his daddy play is something that I'll hold dear to my heart.” Currently, that list includes Medford's Brenden Aaronson, Wayne native Matt Freese, and Media's Auston Trusty, the latter also vying for a spot along the back line. Each player has been invited to recent camps, and there's a belief that one, if not all, has a good chance to crack Pochettino's World Cup squad. Six months, to be exact — meaning all McKenzie can do is focus on the now. After all, it is the only thing in his control. » READ MORE: Follow the Inquirer's complete soccer coverage right here!</p>

It was almost grimly predictable. When news broke that the United States military had attacked Venezuela on Saturday, there wasn't even a flicker of activity among the Fifa Council, according to senior sources.

This is despite the primary host of their grand global event launching what is a rare act of aggression for a country staging the World Cup, with the president even talking in a concerning manner about a co-host.  In the aftermath of the Venezuela attacks, Donald Trump spoke about how his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum, is “very frightened of the cartels” and that “something is going to have to be done with Mexico”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Folarin Balogun says that Mauricio Pochettino has ensured that no U.S. men's national team players feel their place is guaranteed, which only makes the Monaco striker's recent goals feel all the more important. After missing much of 2025 with injury issues, Balogun returned to full fitness in the fall and has been scoring for club and country. Throughout much of 2025, his first full year as USMNT boss, Pochettino stressed that the door was wide open for anyone and everyone to fight for World Cup spots. The message has been heard loud and clear, Balogun says. "They have created an atmosphere where nobody feels like their place is guaranteed. I think that is the most important thing you can do when you have such a big pool of players like the USA does. "But Pochettino has come in with a completely new philosophy and if he thinks someone is playing well and is playing in a division like Major League Soccer then he will pick them. That is a wake-up call for everybody, and naturally, that will get a reaction, but he's also been able to add the smartness and the tactician side to it, and I think both sides are gelling together. Balogun has been a mainstay in the Monaco XI for much of this season, making his mark in both Ligue 1 and the Champions League. He has four goals and two assists in 848 Ligue 1 minutes while also scoring in each of his last three Champions League appearances for the club. "I'm still looking to be a lot more decisive in those games. But I've scored three in the last three, and this is my first year playing in the Champions League being a starter consistently. I'm able to contribute with important goals that are helping us win games and help us potentially progress to the next round. It's been an up-and-down season for Monaco, who currently sit ninth in Ligue 1 following a loss to Lyon this past weekend. The USMNT, meanwhile, will be back in action in March for their final two friendlies before Pochettino selects his World Cup roster. Those friendles will see the U.S. take on Portugal and Belgium in Atlanta.</p>
