                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year's flu season is turning out to be brutal. Researchers from University of Maryland Schools of Public Health and Engineering in College Park and the School of Medicine in Baltimore wanted to find out how the flu spreads, so they put college students already sick with the flu into a hotel room with healthy middle-aged adult volunteers. "At this time of year, it seems like everyone is catching the flu virus. And yet our study showed no transmission – what does this say about how flu spreads and how to stop outbreaks?" said Dr. Donald Milton, professor at SPH's Department of Global, Environmental and Occupational Health and a global infectious disease aerobiology expert who was among the first to identify how to stop the spread of COVID-19. "Our data suggests key things that increase the likelihood of flu transmission – coughing is a major one," said Dr. Jianyu Lai, post-doctoral research scientist, who led data analysis and report writing for the team. The students with the flu had a lot of virus in their noses, says Lai, but they did not cough much at all, so only small amounts of virus got expelled into the air. "The other important factor is ventilation and air movement. Lai adds that middle-aged adults are usually less susceptible to influenza than younger adults, another likely factor in the lack of any flu cases. Most researchers think airborne transmission is a major factor in the spread of this common disease. But Milton notes that updating international infection-control guidelines requires evidence from randomized clinical trials such as this one. The team's ongoing research aims to show the extent of flu transmission by airborne inhalation and exactly how that airborne transmission happens. The lack of transmission in this study offers important clues to how we can protect ourselves from the flu this year. "Being up close, face-to-face with other people indoors where the air isn't moving much seems to be the most risky thing – and it's something we all tend to do a lot. Our results suggest that portable air purifiers that stir up the air as well as clean it could be a big help. But if you are really close and someone is coughing, the best way to stay safe is to wear a mask, especially the N95," said Milton. The team used a quarantined floor of a Baltimore-area hotel to measure airborne transmission between five people with confirmed influenza virus with symptoms and a group of 11 healthy volunteers across two cohorts in 2023 and 2024. A similar quarantine set-up was used in an earlier study and exhaled breath testing was used in several pioneering studies by Milton and colleagues on influenza transmission. During the most recent flu study, participants lived for two weeks on an isolated floor of the hotel, and did daily activities simulating different ways that people gather and interact – including conversational ice-breakers, physical activities like yoga, stretching or dancing. Infected people handled objects such as a pen, tablet computer and a microphone, before passing the objects among the whole group. Researchers measured a wide range of parameters throughout the experiment, including participant symptom monitoring, daily nasal swabs and saliva samples and blood collection to test for antibodies. Participant exhaled breath was also measured daily in the Gesundheit II machine, invented by Milton and colleagues at Harvard T.H. Finding ways to control flu outbreaks is a public health priority, says Milton. Flu is responsible for a considerable burden of disease in the United States and globally – up to 1 billion people across the planet catch seasonal influenza every year and this season has seen at least 7.5 million flu cases so far in the United States alone, including 81,000 hospitalizations and over 3,000 deaths.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new meeting report was published in Volume 17, Issue 12 of Aging-US on December 23, 2025, titled "Cellular senescence meets infection: highlights from the 10th annual International Cell Senescence Association (ICSA) conference, Rome 2025." It focuses on how infections can trigger cellular senescence, a state in which cells stop dividing and release inflammatory signals. This link is important since it connects infectious diseases with aging, chronic inflammation, and lasting tissue damage. Although cellular senescence is best known for its role in aging and cancer, the meeting highlighted its emerging importance in infection biology. This process, known as infection-driven senescence (IDS), can help limit pathogen replication but may also prolong inflammation and slow recovery, particularly in older adults and during chronic infections. Several sessions focused on respiratory viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Researchers showed that these viruses can promote senescence in lung cells, contributing to persistent inflammation and reduced healing. Experimental models suggested that decreasing the amount of senescent cells improved lung repair, even after the virus was cleared, offering insight into why some patients experience long-lasting respiratory symptoms. These findings help explain why age-related conditions occur earlier and more frequently in this population. In the meeting, it was also demonstrated that senescence is not limited to viral infections. Researchers reported that the bacterium Mycobacterium abscessus induces senescence in immune cells during chronic infection. These senescent cells increased inflammation and susceptibility to further infection. Across the conference, speakers discussed therapies that either remove senescent cells or reduce their harmful inflammatory signals. These approaches, known as senolytic and senomorphic strategies, showed promise in preclinical studies as potential tools to limit infection-related tissue damage and chronic inflammation. Overall, the meeting report presents infection-driven senescence as a unifying concept linking infection, immunity, and aging. The discussions at ICSA 2025 highlight a growing field with important implications for understanding chronic disease and the long-term health effects of infections.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They found that HJURP did not localize at the centromere when the expression of both of two cell components, CENP-C and Mis18C, were eliminated following a double knockout process. Although it was known that Mis18C recognizes the chaperone HJURP to enable CENP-A's deposition onto centromeres, we found that CENP-C can actually occupy Mis18C's role in this process, providing a parallel pathway that helps ensure successful and timely mitosis or meiosis. We also identified the particular residues of HJURP that enable its binding to CENP-C." The team then built on these findings through analyses in DT40 chicken cells, confirming that these interactions are essential for centromere function during cell division. These analyses showed that when HJURP and CENP-C did not interact, this led to errors in mitosis, slowing cell growth. "Our work reveals that this sequence-independent epigenetic mechanism of centromere specification has greater diversity than previously thought," explains lead author, Tetsuya Hori. "Given how biologically fundamental the processes of mitosis and meiosis are, our finding that the cell has independent pathways for flagging the location of each chromosome's centromere is valuable." The key findings of this work, regarding the existence of dual pathways for recruiting HJURP for CENP-A deposition, can provide a solid foundation for future studies on the mechanisms behind centromere functioning and on diseases involving errors of cell division. Dual pathways via CENP-C and Mis18C recruit HJURP for CENP-A deposition into vertebrate centromeres.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the University of Southampton have developed a promising new way to bolster the body's immune system response to cancer. In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers used specially engineered multi-pronged antibodies to better activate cancer-killing T cells. The team from the University of Southampton's Centre for Cancer Immunology focused their efforts on an immune receptor called CD27. CD27 needs a matching key (ligand) to activate T cells. This ligand is produced naturally in response to infection, but cancers lack this signal and T cells can only elicit a weak response against the cancer cells. Antibodies can work a bit like a master key, but most commonly used antibodies are Y-shaped molecules with two prongs, meaning they can only engage two receptors at the same time. While antibodies have revolutionised cancer treatment, some cancers don't respond because T cells don't receive all the signals they need to become fully active. They also enlist the help of a second cell, forcing all the CD27 receptors they are holding to clump together. Antibodies are reliable molecules that make excellent drugs. However, the natural antibody format was not powerful enough, so we had to create a more effective version." In lab studies using mice as well as human immune cells, the new antibodies were more effective in switching on CD8⁺ T cells – the 'special forces' of the immune system, than standard Y-shaped antibodies, delivering a more robust anti-tumour response. By making CD27 more responsive to therapeutic targeting, the findings provide a blueprint for developing next‑generation immunotherapies that harness the immune system to fight cancer more effectively. This approach could help improve future cancer treatments by allowing the immune system to work closer to its full potential."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A controlled crossover study shows that simply working in natural daylight, rather than standard artificial lighting, can stabilize daily glucose swings, boost fat oxidation, and subtly tune the body's metabolic clock in people with type 2 diabetes. Study: Natural daylight during office hours improves glucose control and whole-body substrate metabolism. They found that exposure to natural light shifted metabolism toward greater fat oxidation, modulated select circadian outputs, and altered molecular metabolic signatures. People with greater natural light exposure also experienced a modest but statistically significant increase in the time when their glucose levels remained in the normal range. Disruptions to circadian rhythms, which are common in modern lifestyles dominated by indoor living, have been strongly linked to metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes. Individuals typically spend 80 % to 90 % of their time indoors, where lighting is dimmer, spectrally static, and poorly aligned with natural daylight patterns. Previous studies suggest that artificial light exposure can influence glucose and lipid metabolism; however, these studies rarely reflect real-world daylight conditions and often focus on short-term or isolated metabolic outcomes. They used a randomized crossover trial that included 13 older adults with type 2 diabetes who completed two 4.5-day intervention periods. One period involved exposure to natural daylight while indoors through large windows, and the other involved exposure to constant artificial office lighting intentionally low in melanopic and short-wavelength content. There was a washout period of four weeks or more between interventions. During each intervention, participants stayed continuously in a research facility, followed standardized sleep schedules and meal timings, and maintained consistent medication use. Natural daylight exposure occurred during office hours (08:00–17:00), while artificial lighting provided 300 lux at eye level. Evening light exposure was tightly controlled in both conditions, and glasses that blocked blue light were used when participants left the controlled environment. Continuous glucose monitoring was used throughout the intervention to assess glycemic control. Whole-body energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were measured using indirect calorimetry, which included assessments in a respiration chamber and ventilated hood. Multi-omic analyses, including lipidomics, metabolomics, and monocyte transcriptomics, were performed in an exploratory, hypothesis-generating framework to capture systemic molecular responses. Exposure to natural daylight did not alter average glucose levels but resulted in a greater proportion of time spent within the normal glucose range, indicating improved glycemic stability. Computational modeling showed that natural light reduced the amplitude of daily glucose fluctuations, which was associated with better glucose control. Whole-body energy expenditure was similar between lighting conditions. However, natural daylight consistently shifted metabolism toward greater fat oxidation and lower carbohydrate oxidation throughout the day and following a mixed meal, reflecting improved metabolic flexibility, or the ability to switch efficiently between fuel sources. Although 24-hour levels of plasma glucose, triglycerides, and free fatty acids did not differ significantly between conditions, postprandial metabolic dynamics differed, with natural light promoting a metabolic profile consistent with enhanced lipid utilization. Evening melatonin secretion was higher following natural daylight exposure, suggesting subtle circadian effects, although the timing of melatonin onset remained unchanged. At the molecular level, biopsies of skeletal muscle showed increased expression of specific clock genes following natural light exposure. Primary muscle cells cultured from these biopsies exhibited a phase-advanced circadian rhythm, suggestive of persistent alterations in peripheral clock properties, as observed ex vivo under controlled laboratory conditions, indicating a potential cellular-level memory of prior light exposure. Multi-omic analyses revealed consistent daylight-associated patterns in circulating metabolites, lipid classes, and immune-cell gene expression, particularly involving lipid metabolism pathways. However, most individual molecular features did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing. These findings demonstrate that exposure to indoor natural daylight favorably influences glucose regulation, metabolic flexibility, circadian biology, and molecular metabolic signatures in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This study suggests that chronic lack of natural light may be one contributing factor to poorer metabolic health in people with type 2 diabetes. Compared with standard artificial office lighting, exposure to natural light increased the time that participants showed glucose readings within a normal range and promoted greater fat oxidation, indicating improved metabolic flexibility. These benefits were accompanied by reduced daily glucose fluctuations, higher evening melatonin levels, suggestive advances in skeletal muscle circadian phase, and exploratory changes in circulating metabolites, lipids, and immune-cell gene expression linked to insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. A key strength of the study is its randomized crossover design, which features tightly controlled light exposure, meals, and activity. However, the small sample size, short intervention duration, older study population, seasonal restriction, and reliance on subjective sleep measures limit generalizability and warrant cautious interpretation of causality. Overall, the findings highlight natural daylight as a potentially modifiable environmental factor that may support metabolic control in type 2 diabetes and warrant longer, larger, and more naturalistic real-world studies, particularly in working-age populations and real office environments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study of over 32,000 US Veterans has found that the longer people stay on medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine, methadone, or extended-release naltrexone), the greater the probability of short- and medium-term survival. This benefit continues to increase at least for four years of ongoing treatment, considerably longer than most patients currently stay in treatment. People with opioid use disorder run the risk of dying from accidental overdose but opioid use disorder also increases the risk of death from other health conditions, most notably infectious disease. People who receive buprenorphine and other medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) have fewer drug cravings, improved social functioning, and better quality of life than those who do not, and those improvements decrease their risk of mortality. Most standards of care specify 6 months as the minimum target for treatment duration, and more than 25% of patients say they want even shorter durations. Encouraging patients to continue treatment for at least four years will significantly increase their chances of survival. For example (see figure), a 50-year-old male with no other health risk factors who remained in MOUD treatment for two years had a 4 % higher survival probability than a 50-year-old male who stopped treatment at six months. In contrast, a 30-year-old female with no other health risk factors was not projected to achieve a 4 % greater survival probability until around 5 years of MOUD duration. Additionally, for the lowest risk patients, the improvements in relative survival for each additional year of therapy started to diminish as duration increased, with no statistically discernible difference beyond 4 years. After four years of receiving MOUD, additional time in treatment may not continue to increase the relative predicted probability of survival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In early 2025, around 4.9 million British adults - almost one in ten - are estimated to have recently used, or expressed interest in using, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist medications to support weight loss. The findings, which are based on a nationally representative household survey of 5,260 British adults, are published in BMC Medicine. The GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP medications liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide are licensed for weight loss in the UK but only around 220,000 people will be eligible for treatment with these on the NHS between 2025 and 2028. Of those who had not recently used these medications for weight loss, 6.5 % were interested in doing so within the next year. Extrapolating from these figures, the authors estimate that around 1.6 million British adults may have used GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications to support weight loss between 2024 and early 2025 and that a further 3.3 million were interested in doing so at the start of 2025. Among those who used a GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medication to support weight loss within the previous year, 15 % reported using a medication that was not licensed for weight loss in the UK. The authors speculate that this could be due to off-label prescribing or individuals acquiring medications through non-medical routes such as online purchases. The authors found that GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medication use and interest was more prevalent among women, those aged between 45 and 55 years, and those who reported experiencing moderate to severe levels of psychological distress within the previous month. Interest in GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications was also higher among individuals reporting difficulties with their finances, and who were not in work due to long-term illness or disability. The findings highlight substantial demand for GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP medications to support weight loss in Britain. The authors recommend regular monitoring of their use, health outcomes, and broader impacts on the British healthcare system, and to ensure that they are provided safely, appropriately, sustainably, and fairly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cell division is an essential process for all life on earth, yet the exact mechanisms by which cells divide during early embryonic development have remained elusive – particularly for egg-laying species. Scientists from the Brugués group at the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) at TUD Dresden University of Technology have revealed a novel mechanism that explains how early embryonic cells may divide without forming a complete contractile ring, traditionally seen as essential for this process. In most species, cells divide by forming a contractile ring from a structural protein known as actin at the cell equator. This ring contracts like a purse-string, pinching the cell's contents to result in two new cells. Although the 'purse-string' model of cell division is observed in many organisms, this is not the case for species with very large embryonic cells such as sharks, platypus, birds and reptiles. In these cases, the actin ring cannot fully close due to the cell's immense size and large yolk sac. How exactly cell division takes place in these organisms remained an open question in the field, until now. How does a contractile band, with loose ends, remain stable and generate enough force to divide these huge cells?" asked Alison Kickuth, a recently graduated PhD student from the Brugués group at the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) and lead author of the study. The scientists studied zebrafish embryos, which divide rapidly and share the characteristic of having large, yolk-filled cells during early development. In addition, it seemed that microtubules, another essential part of the cytoskeleton, appeared to bend and splay in response to the laser cuts, and had a critical role in stabilizing the band during contraction. To clarify the role of microtubules in this process, the authors disrupted them in two separate experiments: by chemically inducing depolymerization (effectively stopping new microtubules from forming), and by physically disrupting them using an obstacle, in the form of a microscopic oil droplet. Without microtubules, the actin band collapsed, proving that microtubules are essential for holding the band in place, and provided both mechanical support and signaling during its formation. Importantly, the cell cycle is separated into distinct phases of activity; a mitotic phase (M-phase) where the DNA is divided, and an interphase, where a typical cell grows and replicates its DNA. After DNA has been divided, large structures made of microtubules called asters grow to span the entire cytoplasm. These asters are essential during interphase for deciding where the actin band will form and start contracting, marking the future cleavage plane. These experiments allowed the scientists to measure changes in cytoplasmic stiffness during cell cycle stages. They found that the cytoplasm becomes stiffer during interphase, acting as a scaffold to stabilize the actin band. Only one question remained: How did the band remain stable throughout M-phase despite the cytoplasm becoming more fluid-like? Instead, this retraction is "rescued" due to the fast cell cycles in these early stages. These cycles of instability during M-phase and stabilization during interphase repeated over several cell cycles until division was complete. In this case, division is possible through the alternating material properties of the cytoplasm, and takes place over multiple cell cycles instead of just one. "The temporal ratchet mechanism fundamentally alters our view of how cytokinesis works", emphasized Jan Brugués, corresponding author of the study. Zebrafish are a fascinating case, as cytoplasmic division in their embryonic cells is inherently unstable. To overcome this instability, their cells divide rapidly, allowing ingression of the band over several cell cycles by alternating between stability and fluidization until division is complete." This discovery represents a novel paradigm for understanding cell division in large embryonic cells and may apply broadly across species with yolk-rich embryos. Additionally, this study highlights temporal control of material properties in the cytoplasm as an important contributor to cellular processes, a role that may be expanded in future studies. Understanding these mechanisms will open new perspectives for studying development in different species.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In these cases, radiotherapy very close to the mouth can destroy salivary glands and compromise saliva production, which is essential for controlling bacteria and disease. According to research conducted at the Bauru School of Dentistry at the University of São Paulo (FOB-USP) in Brazil, CANECPI-5 forms a protective "shield" for the teeth, guarding the enamel against weakening acids found in juices, alcoholic beverages, and even stomach acids. The study was conducted during Natara Dias Gomes da Silva's doctoral studies at FOB-USP. She collaborated with researchers from the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), also in Brazil; the University of California in San Francisco, in the United States; and Yonsei University College of Dentistry, in South Korea.The work is part of the Thematic Project "Modulation of acquired pellicle to control dental mineral loss: unveiling mechanisms to make therapies possible", which is coordinated by Professor Marília Afonso Rabelo Buzalaf from FOB-USP. We tested the mouthwash developed with CANECPI-5 by applying this solution to small pieces of animal teeth once a day for one minute. Based on these results, we'll conduct further research so that we can think about applications of this product." Natara Dias Gomes da Silva, first author of the article "This is the first product that uses the concept of acquired pellicle [a thin protective layer that quickly forms on the tooth surface] to treat xerostomia, which is the sensation of a dry mouth caused by a lack of saliva. In these tests, the artificial saliva spray significantly reduced bacterial activity and tooth demineralization – the process by which teeth lose calcium and phosphate, making them more susceptible to cavities. This discovery is significant because patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer do not yet have access to a specific product on the market that can help combat and treat the most aggressive cavities that develop after radiation therapy. "Artificial saliva improves the sensation of dry mouth and sores. This helps with discomfort and also combats bacteria. In others, it's permanent, because many individuals lose the ability to produce saliva," adds Buzalaf. "We've already tested the solution as a mouthwash, gel, and orodispersible film, which is a type of plastic that's placed on the tongue and dissolves, releasing the protein. We'll continue testing other technologies within the Thematic Project to use not only this protein, but others as well," says Buzalaf. According to Flávio Henrique Silva, a professor in the Department of Genetics and Evolution at UFSCar, who worked on developing the CANECPI-5 protein, the work with cystatins (a family of proteins involved in various biological processes) is linked to research carried out under the Sugarcane Genome Project (SUCEST, FAPESP). His laboratory is part of that project. "At that time, our group identified and produced, in a recombinant form in bacteria, the first cystatin from sugarcane. We then identified and produced five other cane cystatins, including CANECPI-5, which had potent inhibitory activities against cysteine peptidases, which are its target enzymes. Throughout our work, we noticed that this protein bound strongly to smooth surfaces, such as the quartz cuvettes used in activity measurements. This led us to conduct tests in partnership with Professor Marília Buzalaf on the binding of the protein to tooth enamel." "CANECPI-5 has also been used in the work of other colleagues in the field of dentistry, particularly involving periodontitis. We also have a collaborative project with a colleague from the Federal University of Uberlândia, using subcutaneous sponge implants in mice, which has shown that it's capable of reducing inflammation and promoting angiogenesis [the formation of new blood vessels] and fibrinogenesis [the formation of fibrin, a protein essential for blood clotting], important processes in tissue repair, making it a candidate molecule for use in wound healing," Silva points out. According to Buzalaf, one possible avenue is to study CANECPI-5 fused with a peptide derived from statherin, a protein found in saliva, to see if the new hybrid protein is more effective against the acids that weaken teeth when they come from the stomach. A novel artificial saliva enriched with CaneCPI-5 for irradiated head and neck cancer (HNC) patients: in vitro antimicrobial and anticaries effect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT), the leading professional organization for the advancement of cell and gene therapies (CGTs), and the Orphan Therapeutics Accelerator (OTXL), a non-profit biotech focused on completing development and enabling access to stalled rare disease treatments, today announced a partnership to establish CGTxchange, a jointly owned entity that will serve as a clearinghouse and marketplace for deprioritized CGTs. The new joint venture will address a growing and urgent challenge facing the CGT field: policy and economic shifts in recent years have led biopharma sponsors to halt development of hundreds of CGTs no longer considered commercially viable by traditional industry standards, including many that delivered clear benefits to patients in trials. CGTxchange leverages the combined capabilities of the organizations in an unprecedented way to engage a broad array of potential partners and funders to efficiently identify, evaluate, finance, develop, and provide sustainable, reliable, and scalable access to potentially transformative CGTs for ultra-rare diseases. At ASGCT, we have observed that a host of cell and gene therapies are being set aside not because they lack clinical merit, but rather due to the challenges of commercializing these therapies once approved. In partnership with OTXL, we are creating an entirely new way to ensure these CGTs find their way to organizations – whether companies, non-profits or academic institutions – that are ready to take on the challenges of development and commercialization so patients may ultimately benefit." From there, listed assets can be matched with prospective investors or partners in the marketplace, thereby expanding the potential to secure funding and new clinical sponsors. "Typical venture capital and biopharma expectations for returns are set well above what most CGTs for ultra-rare diseases can meet in light of recent policy and market shifts," said Craig Martin, CEO of OTXL. "Yet many of these shelved therapies can still offer meaningful returns to the right partners, as well as tremendous benefits to patients. This partnership allows us to surface high-quality, clinical-stage CGT programs to investors and organizations whose missions, timelines and objectives align with what these therapies can deliver." Within the partnership, ASGCT will convene and engage its extensive network of CGT leaders, experts, donors and investors, while helping establish CGTxchange as the leading solution for currently 'pre-viable' CGT programs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When compared with antidepressant medication, exercise also showed a similar effect, but the evidence was of low certainty. Depression is a leading cause of ill health and disability, affecting over 280 million people worldwide. Exercise is low-cost, widely available, and comes with additional health benefits, making it an attractive option for patients and healthcare providers. The results show that exercising can have a moderate benefit on reducing depressive symptoms, compared with no treatment or a control intervention. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested a similar effect, but the evidence is limited and of low certainty. Long-term effects are unclear as few studies followed participants after treatment. Side effects were rare, including occasional musculoskeletal injuries for those exercising and typical medication-related effects for those taking antidepressants, such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems. Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression. This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important." Some forms of exercise, such as yoga, qigong and stretching, were not included in the analysis and represent areas for future research. Long-term effects are unclear as few studies followed participants after treatment. This update adds 35 new trials to previous versions published in 2008 and 2013. This is because the majority of trials were small, with fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. "Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar," said Professor Clegg. "Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'The fact that these antibodies reach the nasal mucosa has not been demonstrated before and highlights how effective this vaccination is'. Since 2019, pregnant women in the Netherlands have been offered a vaccination against whooping cough (pertussis) for their unborn child, known as the 22-week shot. 'We give this vaccine to protect babies from whooping cough right after birth. In the first weeks of life, babies are extremely vulnerable and too young to be vaccinated themselves. That's why we vaccinate the mother during pregnancy,' explains immunologist Dimitri Diavatopoulos of Radboudumc. Each year, between 200,000 and 300,000 people die from it, mostly young infants in low- and middle-income countries, where good vaccines are not always available. 'Mothers who were vaccinated during pregnancy passed on antibodies through the placenta that were subsequently detected in the baby's nasal mucosa,' says Diavatopoulos. The study also shows that babies who received a whole-cell whooping cough vaccine at 8, 12, and 16 weeks developed, on average, a stronger immune response than those who received an acellular vaccine. 'The difference is that a whole-cell vaccine contains the complete, but inactivated, whooping cough bacterium, whereas an acellular vaccine contains only a few purified components of the bacterium,' Diavatopoulos explains. 'Acellular vaccines usually cause fewer side effects but often also provide shorter-lasting protection. Our findings suggest that whole-cell vaccines may support longer-term immune protection', says Janeri Fröberg, postdoctoral researcher at Radboudumc. In Europe, the acellular vaccine has been used since 2005, while most low- and middle-income countries still use the whole-cell vaccine. The researchers emphasize that further studies are needed to determine what these results mean for clinical protection and vaccination policies in different settings. For lower-income countries, where most deaths occur, the results show that implementing whooping cough vaccination during pregnancy could save lives. And for countries that continue to use whole-cell vaccines, the findings support the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to maintain their use, as they may provide longer lasting immunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Higher intake of food preservatives, widely used in industrially processed foods and beverages to extend shelf-life, is associated with a modestly increased risk of cancer, finds a study from France published by The BMJ today. Some experimental studies have shown that certain preservatives can damage cells and DNA, but firm evidence linking preservatives to cancer risk remains scarce. Their findings are based on 105,260 participants aged 15 years and older (average age 42 years; 79% women) enrolled in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study who were free of cancer and completed regular 24 hour brand-specific dietary records over an average 7.5 year period. Preservatives were grouped into non-antioxidants (which inhibit microbial growth or slow chemical changes that lead to spoilage) and antioxidants (which delay or prevent food deteriorating by removing or limiting oxygen levels in packaging). During the follow-up period, 4,226 participants received a diagnosis of cancer, comprising 1,208 breast, 508 prostate, 352 colorectal, and 2,158 other cancers. Of the 17 individually studied preservatives, 11 were not associated with cancer incidence, and no link was found between total preservatives and cancer incidence. However, higher intakes of several preservatives (mostly non-antioxidants including potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, and acetic acid) were associated with higher risk of cancers compared with non-consumers or lower consumers. For example, total sorbates, specifically potassium sorbate, was associated with a 14% increased risk of overall cancer and a 26% increased risk of breast cancer, while total sulfites were associated with a 12% increased risk of overall cancer. Among antioxidant preservatives, only total erythorbates and specific sodium erythorbate were found to be associated with higher incidence of cancer. While more studies are needed to better understand these potential risks, the researchers note that several of these compounds can alter immune and inflammatory pathways, possibly triggering the development of cancer. This is an observational study, so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and the researchers can't rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results. However, they say this was a large study based on detailed dietary records linked to food databases over 14 years and results are consistent with existing experimental data suggesting adverse cancer related effects of several of these compounds. As such, they conclude: "This study brings new insights for the future re-evaluation of the safety of these food additives by health agencies, considering the balance between benefit and risk for food preservation and cancer." In the meantime, they call on manufacturers to limit the use of unnecessary preservatives, and support recommendations for consumers to favour freshly made, minimally processed foods. From a policy perspective, preservatives offer clear benefits by extending shelf life and lowering food costs, which can be particularly important for populations with lower incomes, point out US researchers in a linked editorial. However, they say the widespread and often insufficiently monitored use of these additives, with uncertainties of their long term health effects, call for a more balanced approach. Findings from NutriNet-Santé may prompt regulatory agencies to revisit existing policies, such as setting stricter limits on use, requiring clearer labeling, and mandating disclosure of additive contents, while collaborative global monitoring initiatives, similar to those implemented for trans fatty acids and sodium, could also support evidence based risk assessments and guide reformulation by the food industry, they write. "At the individual level, public health guidance is already more definitive about the reduction of processed meat and alcohol intake, offering actionable steps even as evidence on the carcinogenic effects of preservatives is evolving," they conclude.
