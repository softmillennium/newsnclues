                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital asset custody and infrastructure firm Fireblocks Inc. has acquired Tres Finance Ltd., a leading provider of crypto accounting, reconciliation and financial management suite for digital assets. With these evolutions, business opportunities continue to grow, creating new operational overheads. The U.S. recently passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act in October, providing a framework for banks and businesses to interact with digital assets permissively and the EU passed Markets in Crypto-Assets in 2022, providing a focus on stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that maintains parity with another currency, such as the U.S. dollar. Blockchain enthusiasts tout that this enables faster settlements, lower costs and the ability to provide payments across borders with less challenge than traditional payment rails. Fireblocks said this is a gap that Tres Finance will help solve. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, Crypto Twitter has been speculating if the country's regime holds a Bitcoin stockpile and how big it is. But does the country actually own a large stack of Bitcoin or is it just social media conjecture? Here's everything we know about Venezuela's supposed crypto riches. While a much circulated newsletter by Bradley Hope's Whale Hunting suggests that the Maduro regime sits on 600,000 Bitcoin worth billions of dollars, it is just hypothetical and not based on any hard evidence. Blockchain forensics firms told DL News that they've struggled to find any Bitcoin at all held by the regime. “We have not identified any such holdings at present,” Matteo Colledan, VP of business development at blockchain surveillance firm Arkham, told DL News. Global Head of Policy at TRM Labs, Ari Redbord, added that while the firm was looking for a centralised government stockpile, the country's crypto exposure was more “fragmented, opportunistic, and adaptive, rather than the deliberate accumulation of a sovereign crypto reserve.” Redbord told DL News that while they continue to investigate all credible angles, “we are not currently seeing onchain data that supports the existence of a large, centrally managed Venezuelan state Bitcoin treasury anywhere near the scale being suggested.” In 2018, the government launched the Petro, an oil-backed digital currency that was widely criticised as a sanctions evasion tool that largely failed to gain traction. TRM Labs said in a December report that state entities were directed to use digital-asset payment mechanisms for oil-related and cross-border transactions. Bitcoin mining has also flourished due to the country's cheap energy, although the government has cracked down on unauthorised operations and seized equipment. Nobel peace prize winner and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who is hoping to lead the country, even spoke in September 2024 of how Bitcoin is a “vital means of resistance” for the Venezuelan people. But grassroots adoption by desperate citizens scrambling for financial stability is not the same as a secret government Bitcoin treasury. The latter remains speculation — or an enviable effort in camouflage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In its latest publication, FATF recognized the T3 FCU as a prime example of an effective public-private collaboration to combat illicit activity on the blockchain, highlighting the initiative's comprehensive monitoring capability, which enables T3 FCU to work across borders, identifying and disrupting criminal operations in real-time, making it an invaluable resource for law enforcement agencies worldwide. T3 FCU is a first-of-its-kind public-private initiative launched by TRON, Tether, and TRM Labs in September 2024 to combat illicit activities on the blockchain. This groundbreaking public-private partnership works directly with law enforcement agencies around the globe to identify and disrupt criminal networks. Since its inception, and in just over one year, T3 FCU has frozen more than $300 million in criminal assets across five continents, established rapid response capabilities to address threats, and demonstrated how industry collaboration can effectively combat financial crime while supporting blockchain innovation. In a recent blog post examining the FATF's asset recovery guidance and best practices, TRM Labs notes a shift toward real-time interdiction, observing that traditional post-investigation recovery models are increasingly ineffective for fast-moving virtual assets. It emphasizes the importance of coordinated public-private action, supported by blockchain intelligence and close collaboration among law enforcement, virtual asset service providers, and stablecoin issuers, to identify, restrain, and disrupt illicit funds before they can be dispersed, underscoring the growing role of operational models that enable timely cross-border enforcement. The FATF's recognition affirms T3 FCU as an industry-first model of how blockchain-based systems can reinforce global financial integrity through structured collaboration with public authorities. It further reinforces TRON DAO's commitment to responsible blockchain adoption and effective financial crime prevention, serving as meaningful validation of coordinated, cross-sector efforts to address illicit activity at scale as regulators continue to evaluate the role of public blockchains in the global financial system. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $80 billion. Recognized as the global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success, TRON is “Moving Trillions, Empowering Billions.” TRONNetwork | TRONDAO | X | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NFT Paris and its sibling summit, RWA Paris, have cancelled this year's events due to market uncertainty. Organisers say the numbers stopped working. NFT Paris had grown used to calling itself a fixture. Launched in 2022, it quickly became Europe's most visible Web3 gathering, drawing crowds from digital ownership, culture and currency. Twenty thousand visitors were not unusual. There were hundreds of speakers and late-night panels promoting decentralisation. This year was meant to be bigger than ever. stating, “The crypto and NFT downturn hit hard. In its early editions, NFT Paris leaned heavily into visual art. Over time, the tone changed. More talk of chains, platforms, scaling up. The sponsor lists reflected that drift. John Karp, who runs Lisbon's Non Fungible Conference, has pointed out that art made up a sliver of the ecosystem, probably under five per cent of sponsors. From that angle, the cancellation is a verdict on NFT art more than on the machinery built around it. RWA Paris was meant to steady things. A pivot toward real-world assets. The promise of bridging traditional finance and decentralised systems. It sounded like an exciting prospect to many. Tsydenkov's note to his team carried weariness. Tens of thousands through the doors. No attempt to dress it up.” All ticket holders will be refunded. Just over $1,100 for VIP access.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GR8 Tech has launched Crypto Turnkey, a platform solution that lets operators accept multiple cryptocurrencies without relying on third-party payment providers or extra technical integrations. The platform enables operators to go live faster, maintain uninterrupted operations, and expand globally with native multi-currency support. "Industry data shows crypto players deposit 35-50% more and bet with 40-60% higher frequency than traditional players," said Denys Parkhomenko, CPO at GR8 Tech. We built Crypto Turnkey to make that move simple." By eliminating reliance on external payment providers, Crypto Turnkey reduces the risk of launch delays and service disruptions. Unlike traditional payment infrastructures—where provider outages can halt operations—crypto-based payments allow operators to go live faster and maintain uninterrupted revenue flow around the clock. Also catering to VIP players, who contributed 47% of turnover on GR8 Tech platforms in 2025, Crypto Turnkey allows users to hold multiple currencies, deposit and withdraw without conversion, and switch currencies instantly. The system automatically handles conversions, balance segregation, and real-time exchange rates. Crypto Turnkey also eliminates chargebacks entirely and reduces transaction costs from 2.5–5% in fiat payments to approximately 0.5%. GR8 Tech noted that the payment advantages are amplified when combined with its broader platform capabilities, including AI-driven personalization, advanced CRM tools, sports margin management, and geo-specific “Champion setups” designed to accelerate performance in target markets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) fell back below $90,000, dropping sharply from a local high of $91,570 at 01:15 UTC to trade at its lowest level in five days. The drawdown follows a third failure to break through $94,500 after attempts on Dec. 4 and Dec. 10, with price action mirroring that of the past six weeks. Bitcoin's trading range is now well defined between $85,000 and $94,500, with the zone providing some stability in recent weeks after prices tumbled on Oct. 6 from a record high of $126,220 to $80,600 by Nov. 21. Altcoins underperformed on Thursday as privacy coin zcash (ZEC) plunged by more than 16% between midnight UTC and 10:00. PUMP also suffered a double-digit decline over the same period. Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures are trading 0.27% and 0.29% lower, respectively, since midnight while the dollar index (DXY) continues its ascent. Over $400 million in leveraged crypto futures bets have been liquidated in 24 hours, with bullish bets accounting for most of the tally, a sign that the leverage was skewed bearish. Overall open interest (OI) in crypto futures has pulled back to $140 billion from more than $141 billion Wednesday, which was the highest in nearly two months. OI in bitcoin futures increased by 2% alongside positive funding rates. Some traders seem to be buying the price dip. Funding rates for most major cryptocurrencies, except BNB, remain positive, indicating dominance of bullish long positions. In altcoins, LINK, XLM, AVAX and CC stand out with negative rates. The put bias, however, stands notably weakened in short-dated options compared with last month. This can be attributed to a continued void in liquidity and market depth across the altcoin ecosystem following a liquidation cascade in early October that evaporated $19 billion worth of derivatives positions. ZEC faces uncertainty after members of its development team quit following a clash with a nonprofit organization created to support the network. CoinMarketCap's "altcoin season" indicator remains firmly in a bearish zone at 23/100, a far cry from in September when it topped 78/100.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has praised China's central bank digital currency (CBDC) policy, sparking debate during an ongoing regulatory fight. He supported China's move to offer interest on its digital yuan while defending U.S. stablecoin rewards threatened by banking lobby pressure. Rewards on stablecoins will not change lending one bit – but it does… https://t.co/nrpa8eSKUs Armstrong said these rewards help regular people and don't harm traditional lending, urging regulators to let markets decide freely. They noted that China's interest program responds to low adoption, not competitive strength. Crypto commentator Phyrex clarified that interest on the digital yuan is subsidized by commercial banks, not China's central bank. He said that the interest rates remain below demand deposit levels and are intended to boost digital yuan usage. Armstrong's interpretation, according to critics, misrepresents the policy's true purpose and context. The GENIUS Act passed in July 2025 allows platforms to offer yield-sharing on stablecoins, though it bars issuers from direct interest payments. This exception benefits companies like Coinbase that offer “rewards” without violating interest bans. However, U.S. banking groups now seek to eliminate this flexibility through new regulatory proposals. In November, the American Bankers Association and 52 state associations sent a letter asking the Treasury to close what they call a “loophole.” They claimed that stablecoin rewards could drain bank deposits and risk up to $6.6 trillion in lending. More pressure followed on January 7, when over 200 community bank leaders wrote to the Senate with similar demands. These efforts challenge Coinbase's ability to maintain a key revenue stream under the current rules. Armstrong responded sharply on December 26, warning against any rollback of the GENIUS Act's protections for platforms. He said banks earn about 4% on reserves at the Federal Reserve while offering near-zero to customers. He accused them of “mental gymnastics” for framing rewards programs as financial risks. His comparison to China, though challenged, appears aimed at showing global momentum for digital currency incentives. Armstrong suggests the U.S. should not fall behind on offering consumer benefits. While Armstrong's framing of China CBDC policy faces scrutiny, his broader argument remains directed at preserving platform-level stablecoin rewards. The debate now shifts to lawmakers considering whether platforms should retain this exemption. Discover top-performing stocks in AI, Crypto, and Technology with expert analysis.

Over the past 24 hours, the price eased from around $93,000 (£69,175) to just above $90,000, representing a roughly 2.5% pullback, coinciding with notable outflows from major US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Data from SoSoValue shows US spot bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs registered $486m in net outflows on Wednesday. Analysts argue the latest dip is more about positioning and profit-taking than any deterioration in bitcoin's (BTC-USD) underlying trend. Wenny Cai, COO of SynFutures, told Yahoo Finance UK that bitcoin (BTC-USD) has entered 2026 with a “more complex setup than in prior cycles” as the asset recovers from a turbulent end to 2025. She noted that after slipping from its October highs near $126,000, price action in early January has shown “renewed momentum” with markets firming across major exchanges.

However, she cautioned that risks around macro conditions, regulation, and shifting risk appetite could amplify volatility. Market participants, she said, should balance optimism with “disciplined risk management.” Read more: Geopolitical risk shaping up new 'Mag 7' companies, says fund manager Brickken market analyst Enmanuel Cardozo described bitcoin's (BTC-USD) current positioning as a phase of recalibration rather than weakness. Speaking to Yahoo Finance UK he described the current price action as reflecting a market that “has reset after an extended period of risk reduction,” with excess leverage cleared, volatility compressed and ETF flows stabilising. Cardozo argued that bitcoin (BTC-USD) is behaving less like a speculative trade and more like a “maturing strategic allocation” tied to global liquidity trends and evolving capital market structures.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered three malicious npm packages that are designed to deliver a previously undocumented malware called NodeCordRAT. "This final payload, named NodeCordRAT by ThreatLabz, is a remote access trojan (RAT) with data-stealing capabilities." NodeCordRAT gets its name from the use of npm as a propagation vector and Discord servers for command-and-control (C2) communications. The malware is equipped to steal Google Chrome credentials, API tokens, and seed phrases from cryptocurrency wallets like MetaMask. Both "bitcoin-main-lib" and "bitcoin-lib-js" include a "package.json" file that features "postinstall.cjs" as a postinstall script, leading to the execution of "bip40" that contains the NodeCordRAT payload. "The stolen files are uploaded as message attachments via Discord's REST endpoint /channels/{id}/messages." Modern cyberattacks hide in trusted tools and workflows, evading traditional defenses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The data regulator explores how agentic commerce could become the norm, with customers' personal agents anticipating shopping needs and making proactive purchases based on learned and defined preferences or behaviours along with knowledge of upcoming plans - rather than having to have specific prompts. This means that personalised digital shopping companions could soon have the ability to check personal bank accounts to ensure a purchase is within a monthly budget, assess how it will affect other spending plans, schedule purchases around seasonal sale events like the January sales and even negotiate a price directly with sellers. The ICO is reminding retailers wanting to interact with customers through their own agentic AI systems that they are obligated to make sure data privacy is embedded from the start. It adds that retailers cannot rely on developers alone to do this and cautions against implementing off the shelf or one size fits all agentic solutions which could cause privacy problems in the future. William Malcolm, Executive Director of Regulatory Risk and Innovation, ICO, says: “Agentic AI will have the capacity to make decisions and take actions independently. Our own personal AI agents could be paying for goods, booking flights and helping with household finances. While the potential benefits could be transformational, the public needs assurances their personal information is secure and well managed before placing their trust in agentic systems.” He adds: “Strong data protection foundations can help build that public trust and can help scale the fast and safe adoption of AI. Throughout 2026 the ICO will actively monitor advancements and work with AI developers and deployers to ensure they are clear on what the law requires of them.” RTIH proudly presents the first edition of its AI in Retail Awards, sponsored by VenHub Global, 3D Cloud and EdTech Innovation Hub. It's free to enter and you can do so across multiple categories. As we witness a digital transformation revolution across all channels, AI tools are reshaping the omnichannel game, from personalising customer experiences to optimising inventory, uncovering insights into consumer behaviour, and enhancing the human element of retailers' businesses. With 2025 set to be the year when AI and especially gen AI shake off the ‘heavily hyped' tag and become embedded in retail business processes, our newly launched awards celebrate global technology innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world and the resulting benefits for retailers, shoppers and employees. This will kick off with a drinks reception in the stunning Conservatory, followed by a three course meal, and awards ceremony in the Garden Room.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,300 resistance and dipped. ETH is now showing a few bearish signs and might decline toward $3,080. Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,300 and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH price dipped below $3,240 and $3,220 to enter a short-term bearish zone. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $3,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even dipped below $3,150. A low was formed at $3,123, and the price is now consolidating losses. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls can protect more losses below $3,120, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $3,180 level. An upside break above the $3,250 region might call for more gains in the coming days. If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,220 resistance, it could start a fresh decline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence that allows for more activities to be automated - making decisions, interacting with its environment, solving problems in real time and mimicking some types of reasoning and planning.
