                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least three prominent Republicans don't seem concerned about potential overreach. This prompted ABC's Jonathan Karl to ask House Speaker Mike Johnson: “Could we really see active duty Marines on the streets of Los Angeles?” “I think the president did exactly what he needed to do … Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or unwillingness to do what is necessary there, so the president stepped in,” Speaker Johnson tells @JonKarl after Trump deploys California National Guard. “You don't think sending Marines into the streets of an American city is heavy-handed?” Karl asked. “We have to be prepared to do what is necessary, and I think the notice that that might happen might have the deterring effect,” Johnson said. Active-duty military troops have not been sent in to suppress unrest since the 1992 Los Angeles protests after a jury acquitted four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a Black man who was pulled over for a traffic violation. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits federal troops from engaging in civilian law enforcement unless there is a clear legal or constitutional basis for doing so. Chris Mirasola of Lawfare wrote that Trump's justification for using this authority is “factually contestable and, even on the face of the memorandum, unusually weak.” Republican Sen. James Lankford on NBC's Meet the Press argued that by deploying the National Guard, Trump is “trying to deescalate all the tensions that are there.” Newsom has said that Trump activating National Guard troops is “purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions” “This is an American city, and to be able to have an American city where we have people literally flying Mexican flags and saying, ‘You cannot arrest us,' cannot be allowed,” Lankford said on Sunday. “They were literally out there protesting, carrying a foreign flag. These are illegals,” he said Sunday on State of the Union. “Carrying a flag is not illegal, as you know,” CNN's Dana Bash responded. “Foreign flag while you're attacking law enforcement, it's pretty bad,” Mullin said. MARKWAYNE MULLIN: They were literally out there protesting, carrying a foreign flag. And the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has been clear that anyone found destructing property will be arrested. “Everyone has the right to peacefully assemble and voice their opinions,” LAPD posted on X. “However, vandalizing property and attempting to seriously injure officers, whether Federal or LAPD, is not peaceful.” When Meet the Press host Kristen Welker pointed out to Lankford that “Governor Newsom says there is no unmet law enforcement need. “This wouldn't be an issue if California didn't promote sanctuary city policies to be able to tell people literally, ‘You can violate federal law and live in our state, and no one will arrest you for this,'” Lankford said. “Now suddenly when they are arrested for federal crimes then suddenly they go into this kind of protest saying, ‘No, you can't arrest us here. Sanctuary city policies do not grant anyone immunity, they only limit how state and local resources are allocated to aid federal immigration enforcement. Under the Tenth Amendment, states have the right to allocate resources as they see fit, and states have used that amendment in court to justify not assisting with federal immigration raids. ‘Dejected' Trump Says Relationship With Musk Is Over; Calls Him a 'Big-Time Drug Addict': Report See Bruce Springsteen Bring Out Paul McCartney at Liverpool Concert Being Stray Kids Takes a Lot of Work — and Close Friendships It's disturbing that prominent GOP lawmakers are signing on to the president's use of authority to activate the National Guard — against a governor's wishes — and signaling their agreement that deploying active duty Marines against civilians would be fine with them should Trump choose to do so. “Don't kid yourself they know they are absolutely getting cooked politically [with] their terrible bill and rising prices, and they want to create a violent spectacle to feed their content machine,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz posted on X late Saturday. “It's time for the mainstream media to describe this authoritarian madness accurately.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Evan Goldberg, who directed the episode with Seth Rogen, says Scorsese waited to share his thoughts until later: "He was like, 'I knew you were doing this wrong, but I didn't want to be a backseat director, so I just didn't say anything.' An upset Scorsese gets comforted by another guest star, Charlize Theron. Seth Rogen, Kieran Culkin Voice Ambitious Pigs in First Footage From Andy Serkis' 'Animal Farm' 'Echo Valley' Review: Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney Star in Apple TV+'s Satisfyingly Tense Domestic Thriller Even though Scorsese has an Oscar for best director (for The Departed) as well as nine other directing noms, he didn't share his thoughts with The Studio co-creators Evan Goldberg and Rogen, who directed the pilot together, while filming his scenes. Added Goldberg: “There was a moment where him and Charlize Theron were whispering to each other, and it took like 10 takes to get the shot. Goldberg did not reveal what that note was in the People story. Casting director Melissa Kostenbauder recently told The Hollywood Reporter that Scorsese was the “white whale” that Rogen and Goldberg were hoping for in terms of guest stars. “I feel like they got their white whale, which was Martin Scorsese,” casting director Melissa Kostenbauder told THR. Indeed, the Gotham Award-winning show boasts several A-list guest stars in each episode. Kostenbauder told THR that this consisted of a very “unusual casting process” in that they wouldn't send scripts when initially sending the offer out to the talent. And some really did want to lean more into — I don't know if it was Olivia Wilde or Dave Franco — kind of poking fun at themselves.” As for why Scorsese signed on, Goldberg said he thinks Jonah Hill — who's collaborated with Rogen several times and starred in Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street — had a hand in that. “I got the feeling he dropped in a good word for us and that might've helped it happen,” Goldberg said.

Olivia Rodrigo welcomed David Byrne onstage during her headlining set Saturday at New York's Governors Ball festival for a rendition of the Talking Heads classic “Burning Down the House.”


	Toward the end of her weather-delayed set, Rodrigo brought out the “legendary” Byrne, who immediately launched into the Speaking in Tongues track. The two singers then traded verses on the track, with Byrne eventually dropping his acoustic guitar to engage in some synchronized dance routines with the Guts singer:


	Like much of the Talking Heads' work following the Stop Making Sense rerelease, “Burning Down the House” has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years: Paramore covered the track for the Talking Heads tribute album Everyone's Getting Involved, and later added it to their live repertoire. Dave Matthews Band also performed the 1983 song during their own induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

	Byrne and his trademark dance moves also recently joined another pop star onstage when he and Robyn performed her “Dancing on My Own” and the Talking Heads' “This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)” during the all-star SNL 50 concert.

	











	Rodrigo has made it a habit to share the stage with her musical heroes, from crashing No Doubt's reunion at Coachella to performing “Hot to Go!” alongside Chappell Roan to inviting Jewel onstage at a Madison Square Garden gig to duetting with Tyler Childers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As two of Hallmark Channel's most beloved leading men, actors Andrew Walker and Kristoffer Polaha are known for their onscreen romantic gestures. But on June 7, 2025, the two friends — who cruised together with fans in January 2024 — celebrated their real-life love stories, realizing that they share the same wedding anniversary with their wives. Both men paid tribute to their spouses in touching Instagram posts on June 7. Walker commented on Polaha's post, “We've got the same anniversary brother! ❤️” and Polaha replied, ” happy anniversary to you two lovebirds as well! Polaha, who has starred in more than a dozen Hallmark romances, honored his real-life life story in his tribute to his wife, sharing a photo from their wedding and writing, “22 years ago today, in a little church on a rainy day in Florida, this girl said ‘I do,' I said it right back, and God used her to change the course of my life forever. Thank you for this adventure that we get to call our life together.” At the time, Morris was an actress on “Days of Our Lives,” where she played Greta Von Amberg from 1998 to 2002, per IMDb. “She was surrounded by this whole circle of dudes, and it was like time stood still for a second,” Polaha told Highbrow. “Then, we all sat down at this table and it was a table that was kind of small, but she got squished in between two guys that she already knew. I sat next to her and we talked. The two spent quality time together before he flew back to New York, and then had “a really beautiful, innocent two-year courtship where we just took our time to get to know each other,” he told the outlet. He continued, “It was in that time where I was like, ‘I don't think that my career is going to amount to anything unless I have someone to share it with.' And I loved meeting Julianne when I did because I knew she wasn't marrying me for my money or my fame or anything other than the fact that she just loved me.” Walker, meanwhile, posted a video montage of his wife out in nature at their temporary home in Vancouver, where he's been shooting a new Hallmark movie. In his post, Walker wrote, “13 years married ❤️ Happy anniversary @casstroywalker … 21 years ago, this bird woman walked into my life…Your love for life, friendship and the joy you bring to every moment is a gift I'll never not cherish. Thank you for sharing me with the birds. Before pursuing acting, Walker, who grew up in Vancouver, earned a full football scholarship to Boston College, per TV Guide, but suffered a career-ending ACL injury during a routine practice drill. After she finished college, Troy moved from Montreal to Los Angeles in 2006 to live with Walker, the outlet reported, and they eventually eloped in 2012. On May 3, Walker also paid tribute to his wife on her birthday, writing in a post, “You're the heart of our family, the most incredible mom, and partner I never stop being grateful for.</p>

The Die Hard star announced in February 2023 that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. He had retreated from the spotlight a year earlier due to his deteriorating health.

Jackson Reveals Invaluable Advice He Received From Bruce Willis During 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' Shoot The website adds that the actor's deterioration wasn't immediately apparently either on set or on screen, because Willis had always had a slow speech pattern, after having a stutter as a child – something he once told interviewer Michael Parkinson he was able to put to good effect: She said: “I really wrote the book that I wish someone had handed me the day we got our diagnosis with no hope, no direction … not much. Today life looks different for me and our family because I was able to put support into place.” As well as his successful turns in the Die Hard franchise, Willis has enjoyed a string of hit films including Look Who's Talking, The Sixth Sense and Death Becomes Her. He had his breakthrough success in early 1980s TV series Moonlighting, co-starring with Cybil Shepherd as private detectives David Addison and Maddie Hayes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We're in for nasty weather,” prophesied David Byrne 42 years ago on his band Talking Heads‘ biggest  Billboard Hot 100 hit. He probably wasn't making specific predictions about 2025's Governors Ball festival in New York, but that's certainly what was in store for attendees Saturday (June 7), as heavy rain and possible thunder and lightning forced the fest to delay its Day Two start time by four hours. As a result, headliner Olivia Rodrigo didn't take the stage at Gov Ball until 9:35 p.m. ET — but the packed audience showed that few if any fans had been deterred by the bad weather and late start time. And along with her usual captivating set of heart-rending acoustic ballads and stomach-punching alt-rock riffers, Rodrigo had a surprise in store for those who'd stuck around with a Byrne guest appearance, as he came out to duet with the singer-songwriter on the Heads' 1983 smash “Burning Down the House.” After being introduced by a starstruck Rodrigo, Byrne — who could be seen earlier in the night checking out Feid's performance at the Kiehl's stage — emerged in an all-white outfit, covered by red overalls to match Rodrigo's own two-piece getup. The two traded off lines throughout the always-incendiary new wave classic, and then Rodrigo joined Byrne in some of his signature on-stage moves — bending her knees, running in place, and generally looking his traditional combination of charmingly stilted and impossibly cool.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sci-fi TV show Stranger Things was successfully pitched with a remix. Its creators, the Duffer Brothers, cobbled together a fake trailer featuring clips from Steven Spielberg's E.T. with its soundtrack replaced by the menacing synths of horror king John Carpenter. It was a way of communicating through vibes instead of hack references, a Proustian madeleine for survivors of an America scarred by nuclear anxiety, exploding space shuttles, Satanic panic, Chinese stars, lawn darts, and Punky Brewster's friend getting trapped in the fridge. The Zoltar machine that predicted all of this was a 125-second YouTube clip of the obscure 1983 arcade game Laser Grand Prix soundtracked by a loop from Chris de Burgh's saccharine 1986 ballad “The Lady in Red.” Uploaded in the summer of 2009 and currently standing at 4.3 million views, the video—titled “Nobody Here” after its cycling, haunting refrain—would serve as something like an a-ha moment for people who craved something deeper than A-ha references, a big bang for a generation of musicians attempting to live on the edge of memory and imagination. “Nobody Here” would reappear as the untitled 12th track on Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. Released in 2010, Eccojams was a collection of 15 remixes all with the same concept: the dross of radio's past, slowed down, echoed, and run through some dream-logic computer effects. Songs both familiar and unfamiliar transmogrified into a sleep paralysis slurry of half-remembered traumas. Putting Toto's “Africa” in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City conjured the cool '80s of Don Johnson blazers, neon lights, and DeLorean doors. Putting Toto's “Africa” in the Eccojams funhouse conjures the lived '80s of wainscotted hallways, dust-caked mini blinds, station wagon interiors yellowed from cigarette smoke, lawns speckled with white dog shit and cathode ray TVs that play “The Star-Spangled Banner” at 4 a.m. “Chuck Person” was Daniel Lopatin, better known as Oneohtrix Point Never, a Brooklyn drone merchant who had spent the previous three years processing and reconstructing the abstract dreamscapes he culled from his Roland Juno-60. Alongside artists like Emeralds, Yellow Swans, Skaters, and Carlos Giffoni, noise music was starting to sound less like Texas Chain Saw Massacre and more like Tarkovsky's Stalker—and Lopatin was quietly training to become the house DJ for the “Zone.” “[T]he entire point of Eccojams was that it was a DIY practice that didn't involve any specialized music tech knowledge,” Lopatin said in a Reddit AMA, “and for me it was a direct way of dealing with audio in a mutable, philosophical way that had very little to do with music and everything to do with feelings.” Like rope making or basket weaving, the Eccojam is a folk art requiring very little in the way of equipment or natural ability. “I was nothing,” he said about the gig. I could just feel the life draining out of me.” In his boredom, Lopatin ripped songs and videos from YouTube, slowing them to narcoleptic speeds using GoldWave and editing little films in Windows Movie Maker. The first taste of Lopatin spelunking the collective unconscious was a 2009 DVD-R leadingly titled Memory Vague, a 33-minute mash-up of his music set to evocative detritus: '80s commercials for VCRs, golf balls, and Russian cassette players; creepy video logos; primordial video art and computer animations; obscure 1980 TV movie The Arrival; trippy 1985 new age curio Pilot Video Presents California Images: Hi-Fi for the Eyes and more. “Angel” was a skipping, pitch-tweaked, highly phased reimagining of Fleetwood Mac's 1982 album track “Only Over You.” The aforementioned “Nobody Here” would become the “Blitzkrieg Bop” of phantasmal fuzzies. Of course, Lopatin did not invent slowing down music to discover its hidden pleasures. Belgium's hedonistic “popcorn” clubs of the '70s featured popular American soul 45s spun at a sensuous 33 1/3. Perennial hip-hop breaks like the Winstons' “Amen Brother” and ESG's “UFO” were pitched down substantially when they appeared on the sampling bedrock compilations Ultimate Breaks and Beats. Pioneers like Ft. Lauderdale's Jam Pony Express and Houston's DJ Screw made hundreds of molasses-speed DJ mixes ideal for slow-motion crawls on Southern highways. English turntable artist Philip Jeck culled sooty fogs of dubby melancholy from crackling thrift-store vinyl that crawled along at a snail's pace. However, it was Lopatin's Eccojams that would strike a singular nerve in an era where it seemed like the bones of “the '80s” had been picked clean. Xennials like Lopatin had already lived through the emergence of quirky new-wave replicas, which had been around since the '90s. Unlike the music of, say, Ariel Pink or Washed Out, Eccojams are inextricable from their source material. Nearly 70 percent of the material on Eccojams Vol. Most of the remaining 30 percent—including bits of a Byrds album track, Radio Disney balladeer JoJo, Belgian trance act Ian Van Dahl and Michael Jackson's mostly forgotten '90s remix album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix—had their own ephemeral appeal. Kate Bush (“B1”) would re-enter the Billboard singles chart at No. 4 after “Running Up That Hill” was used in a Stranger Things episode. Womack & Womack (“B7”), Alexander O'Neal (“A8”) and Teddy Pendergrass (“B2”) would all receive critical reappraisal once R&B became the new indie rock. Toto's “Africa” (”A1”) had an absolutely insufferable second life that's not worth going into here. As a selector, Lopatin pillages these songs for their most forlorn and cryptic moments, exploding their hidden melancholia: “Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you,” “It doesn't matter anyway, you know it's just too little too late,” “I know that door that shuts just before.” “The key,” said Lopatin, “is if everyone can do it, then each piece reveals something about what its producer likes about it. So I'm always searching for the juiciest moment in a pop track to sample...and get into this hypnotic state with it.” Take the 1978 smash “Baker Street” by Gerry Rafferty. Lopatin finds a sour lyrical shard of despondency, forcing Rafferty to repeat over and over again in what sounds like an opiate-saturated daze, “Another year and then you'd be happy.” The album briefly created a small army of Eccojammers, most notably Laserdisc Visions and New Dreams Ltd., both pseudonyms of Portland-based producer Vektroid. However, this would quickly metastasize into “vaporwave,” a slowpoke collage-art music that plundered the '80s and '90s for R&B, smooth jazz, Japanese pop, muzak, video games, and Microsoft sound effects. Though many will cite chillwave or hypnogogic pop as the birth of too-online music, vaporwave was truly the first internet microgenre, a self-sufficient community ignored by any critical establishment larger than e-zines and vloggers. After Eccojams, the dustiest, most overlooked corners of Goodwill were rethought and re-appreciated. Reissue label Light in the Attic moved from Betty Davis and Rodríguez to successfully recontextualizing soft rock, adult contemporary, new age cassettes, and Japanese AOR. The “uncanny '80s” was explored in films like weirdo comedy Brigsby Bear, psychedelic horror Mandy, and nü-slasher MaXXXine. The folk tradition of the Eccojam lives on nearly unrecognizably in YouTube videos called “slowed + reverb,” where slowpoke versions of Hindi love songs get views in the tens of millions. Critics and theorists mostly paint Eccojams and vaporwave as a critique of the market, with Simon Reynolds saying it reveals “the buried utopianism within capitalist commodities” in his essential 2011 nostalgia screed Retromania. “I think a lot of those Eccojams are just cathartic for me,” said Lopatin. '” An Eccojam is a celebration of the ineffable. Like ASMR, horror movies, cat videos, rage bait, or pornography, it's a functional medium painstakingly calibrated to evoke a specific sensation. “The sublime is located in all times and across all brows at once,” Lopatin told The Wire, railing against the “timbral fascism” that won't let synth musicians use chorus effects without seeming cheesy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maks Chmerkovskiy recently revealed that money impacted his “Dancing With the Stars” performances. “There's definite ways to influence you to want to do your best and stay on and so I think that somebody like me, for example, that backfires,” he said. The former “DWTS” pro continued, “Sometimes that competitiveness kicks in because on top of it, if I don't keep making it week after week, I don't get paid. Chmerkovskiy shared that making it to the semifinals meant he would get a “paycheck all 10 weeks.” During his 15 seasons on “DWTS,” Chmerkovskiy made it to the finals five times and won season 18 with partner Meryl Davis. He called Meryl “an incredible partner,” adding, “And I think I was also at that time already ready to go all the way in that type of partnership.” Chmerkovskiy also shared that the current pros' contracts have likely “evolved” from when he was on the show. “I don't think [that's] the case anymore. I think there are some guarantees,” he said. The former “DWTS” pro noted that he “had some incredible partnerships with people who were a certain type.” He explained, “Honestly, it's whatever they want. They want it to be more of a showmanship. A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix) Will Chmerkovskiy return to “Dancing With the Stars? Chmerkovskiy noted, “Who would've thought there were moments in talk about reminiscing. There were moments in my journey with ‘Dancing With the Stars' that I've never thought that 20 years later I will be as part of it as I was.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "Leave Me Alone" singer laughed and blew kisses from the back of a pickup truck draped with a transgender flag at WorldPride in Washington, D.C. Gray skies and drizzle gave way to sunshine, multicolored flags and celebrations as the nation's capital held the WorldPride parade Saturday (June 7). Tens of thousands of people participated in parades and other festivities, in defiance of what activists say is an unprecedented assault on the LGBTQ+ community that challenges the rights for which many have fought over the years. Singer-songwriter and actor Reneé Rapp laughed and blew kisses from the back of a pickup truck draped with a transgender flag while Laverne Cox, a transgender actress and activist known for her role in Netflix's Orange is the New Black, waved from an open convertible. “Pride means us looking out for each other no matter what,” she declared to the crowd as the convertible rolled to a stop. A child with rainbow face paint blew bubbles at the base of the steps while Whitney Houston's “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” blared from loudspeakers. is already one of the biggest cities in the country for celebrating Pride,” said Cheo White, 33, from Annapolis, Maryland, “But we are all collectively more united and turning out more because of what's happening in the White House.” Many have said the gathering has taken on a new meaning amid the Trump administration's aggressive policies against protections for transgender Americans and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. White's partner, Nick Kerver, 26, who was visiting from Toledo, Ohio, said Pride has “always been a political tool” but has taken on more importance this year amid mounting threats to the LGBTQ+ community, especially transgender and nonbinary Americans. “But we also have to get involved in our local communities too.“ David Begler, a 58-year-old gay man from Philadelphia, expressed disappointment that many international travelers felt unsafe visiting D.C. for WorldPride but said he appreciates its presence in the city during this political climate. “It's the perfect time to have WorldPride in D.C.,” Begler said. But this year, she and her wife, Deenie DeRoux, planned a full weekend. “This is a really big year,” Stay DeRoux said. So it's an amazing thing to be among allies, among people who love because we've experienced so much hate on a daily basis.” Streets were closed, but filled with floats, and impromptu parties broke out with music and food in streets adjoining the parade route. Johnny Cervantes Jr., dressed in a black suit and top hat, headed to a grandstand at a church-themed float to marry his partner of 28 years, Freddie Lutz, owner of Freddie's Beach Bar and Restaurant in Arlington, Virginia.
