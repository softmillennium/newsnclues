Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter discusses the protesters clashing with ICE agents in Los Angeles and New York City on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.' House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's suggestion that he could send U.S. Marines to quell anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement riots in Los Angeles would not be a heavy-handed approach. Trump said he would pursue the federal government taking control of the California National Guard if Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass "can't do their jobs" to protect Los Angeles against rioting and looting. "I have no concern about that at all," Johnson told ABC host Jonathan Karl. "I think the president did exactly what he needed to do. These are federal laws and we have to maintain the rule of law, and that is not what is happening. Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or an unwillingness to do what is necessary there, so the president stepped in. An officer works to put out a fire during a protest in Compton, California, on Saturday, June 7, 2025, after federal immigration authorities conducted operations. Karl also asked about a message posted by Hegseth, who wrote on X Saturday that the Department of Defense was mobilizing the National Guard "IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angles," and "if the violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized – they are on high alert." "One of our core principles is maintaining peace through strength," Johnson said in response Sunday. "You don't think sending the Marines into the streets of an American city is heavy-handed?" "We have to be prepared to do what is necessary, and I think the notice that that might happen might have the deterring effect," Johnson said. Newsom responded to Hegseth's threat on X, writing: "The Secretary of Defense is now threatening to deploy active-duty Marines on American soil against its own citizens. "Deranged = allowing your city to burn & law enforcement to be attacked," Hegseth hit back Sunday morning. "There is plenty of room for peaceful protest, but ZERO tolerance for attacking federal agents who are doing their job." "The National Guard, and Marines if need be, stand with ICE," the defense secretary added. In his initial message Saturday, Hegseth said, "The violent mob assaults on ICE and Federal Law Enforcement are designed to prevent the removal of Criminal Illegal Aliens from our soil; a dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels (aka Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and a huge NATIONAL SECURITY RISK. Generally, the U.S. military is not allowed to carry out civilian law enforcement duties against U.S. citizens except in times of emergency. An 18th-century wartime law called the Insurrection Act is the main legal mechanism that a president can use to activate the military or National Guard during times of rebellion or unrest. But Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act on Saturday. Instead, the president's memorandum called "into Federal service members and units of the National Guard under 10 U.S.C. 12406 to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations." Los Angeles County sheriffs stand guard during a protest in Compton, California, Saturday, June 7, 2025. The National Guard is a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. It's not immediately clear if the president can activate National Guard troops without the order of that state's governor. It's also not clear if military personnel can be deployed. Trump threatened to use the Insurrection Act during the height of 2020 rioting in the wake of George Floyd's death, but ultimately did not do so. He did deploy federal agents to several U.S. cities, including Portland, where rioters attempted to breach a federal courthouse, clashing with law enforcement officers and targeting the building with Molotov cocktails and other projectiles for over 100 consecutive nights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• LA deployment: About 300 National Guardsmen are deployed at three locations around Los Angeles, the California governor's office said this morning. It follows a presidential memorandum signed by President Donald Trump Saturday, sending 2,000 National Guardsmen to disperse protests sparked by immigration raids. • Immigration crackdown: Immigration authorities and demonstrators have clashed for two days in the Los Angeles area, with unrest beginning Friday after dozens of people were detained by federal immigration agents across different locations. • Top officials gather: Trump is expected to meet with senior members of his administration today at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to two sources. Andres Kwon, attorney and senior policy counsel at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, had said in a statement that “city leaders broke their promise” and LAPD officers had assisted federal agents, “impeding people from going to work, making their immigration court appearances, or attending their children's graduations.” “To be clear, the LAPD does not participate in immigration enforcement operations and was not made aware in advance of the federal activity referenced. When a request for assistance was made by federal authorities, the LAPD responded to ensure the safety of all individuals involved—residents, demonstrators, and law enforcement alike.“Our Department's role was limited, measured, and guided by our responsibility to ensure public safety and restore order—not to support immigration enforcement. At no time did the LAPD impede anyone from accessing work, court, or public events.“The LAPD will always respond immediately to all requests for assistance from other law enforcement agencies whether they be local, state or Federal. The LAPD has, and will continue, to support our law enforcement partners immediately upon request.” Members of the Northern Command of the National Guard are on the ground in Los Angeles after President Donald Trump deployed them in response to immigration enforcement action protests that broke out Friday. CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas, Kaitlin Collins, Michelle Watson, Gregory Clary, Antoinette Radford and Kit Maher contributed reporting. “We are workers, neighbors, students, parents — people who contribute to and sustain California's economy and future,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights. “The coordinated assault on immigrants — raiding homes, stalking people in courthouses, and targeting children at school — now expands into a terrifying threat to use military force against lawful protestors. This action does nothing but incite fear and chaos, while exerting control through the threat of violence.” “Additional information will be provided as units are identified and deployed,” NORTHCOM said in a social media post. Separately, the California governor's office said in a statement that 300 National Guardsmen were “deployed between 0200-0400 Sunday at three sites around Los Angeles.” President Trump's federalization of National Guard troops to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles on Saturday marks the first time a US chief executive has used such power since the 1992 LA riots in reaction to the acquittal of four White police officers in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King. Dozens of people were killed, thousands injured and thousands arrested during several days of rioting in Los Angeles at the time. Presidential mobilization of state militias was first authorized by Congress in 1792, in that case to help repel foreign invasions and suppress domestic insurrections, the website says. The biggest ever federalization of state militias was made by President Abraham Lincoln, when he called up 75,000 troops to fight the Confederacy and later support Reconstruction. Key difference: Unlike Trump's federalization of National Guard troops this weekend, the 1992 mobilization was requested by then-California Gov. According to The Associated Press, 5,500 National Guard soldiers were mobilized in Los Angeles County in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd. Gavin Newsom called President Donald Trump on Friday and they spoke for approximately 40 minutes, according to the governor's office. Gavin Newsom in a post on X Saturday night called the deployment “purposefully inflammatory” and warned it would only escalate tensions. The US Secretary of Homeland Security said National Guard soldiers are in Los Angeles to maintain peace amid ongoing tensions between immigration authorities and demonstrators this weekend. Noem said the soldiers are there to “provide security for operations and to make sure that we have peaceful protests,” but did not provide specifics about their activities on the ground. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and the LAPD for their response to this weekend's protests against immigration operations in the area. “We're not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen,” she said, referencing the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in Minneapolis during the summer of 2020. When asked about claims that migrants are being held in makeshift facilities with limited access to food and water, Noem did not directly address the question. Multiple people have been arrested in Los Angeles and New York as authorities crack down on people obstructing immigration enforcement activities, Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino said today. Posting to social media, Bongino said those arrested face federal, local and state charges. “There are approximately 300 California National Guard in Los Angeles currently. They were deployed between 0200-0400 Sunday at three sites around Los Angeles,” Gardon said. As President Donald Trump and his administration make the push to advance his domestic agenda, tensions with Elon Musk continue to make headlines. Americans largely approve of President Donald Trump's program to find and deport immigrants who are in the US illegally but they are not sold on the way he's carrying it out, according to a new poll from CBS News and YouGov. The poll was completed just before protests over deportations in Los Angeles. Overall, Trump's approval rating has held steady in CBS's trends since the 100-day mark of his presidency – 45% approve and 55% disapprove. CBS/YouGov has typically found approval ratings for the president that are a few points higher than other high-quality polls. The CBS News/YouGov poll was conducted online from June 4 through 6 among a random national sample of 2,428 adults. In Paramount, California, tear gas and flash bangs were used to disperse demonstrations. Democratic Rep. Nanette Barragán said she has been told to prepare for a large presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in California. “We've been told to get ready for 30 days of enforcement. Thirty days of ICE enforcement,” she told CNN's Dana Bash today, adding that the presence of National Guardmen is “going to escalate the situation.” President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum last night deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to disperse protests that began in response to immigration raids, including in the city of Paramount, which is in Barragán's constituency. This is him escalating it, causing tensions to rise. It's only going to make things worse in a situation where people are already angry over immigration enforcement,” she said. When asked about the LA County Sheriff's office describing protesters as “exhibiting violent behaviour towards federal agents and deputy sheriffs” the congresswoman had a clear message: “Don't get violent.” But, she said the violence was not coming from anti-immigration protesters. “While today's events concluded without incident, the Los Angeles Police Department remains fully prepared to respond swiftly and appropriately to any potential acts of civil unrest,” the LAPD said in a statement. President Donald Trump has signed off on the deployment of 2,000 National Guardsman to Los Angeles, though Mayor Karen Bass said there was no evidence of the National Guard on the ground yet. “We will maintain a heightened readiness posture and remain ready to ensure the continued safety of our communities,” the LAPD said. Reminder: The LAPD does not have jurisdiction over Paramount, a city in Los Angeles County, where protesters exhibited “violent behavior towards federal agents and deputy sheriffs,” the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said in an advisory late Saturday. Protests have gripped Los Angeles this weekend, sparked in response to immigration raids carried out on Friday. Protests in and around Los Angeles erupted on Friday after at least 44 people were arrested by federal immigration agents earlier in the day. Late into Saturday, some protesters gathered near an immigration holding center in Alameda. Law enforcement used tear gas and flash bangs in an effort to disperse the crowd in Paramount, California, and some protesters were detained. Gavin Newsom called the deployment of troops “purposefully inflammatory” and said it would only escalate tensions. At midnight, the LAPD announced several people who re-entered areas of “unlawful assembly” have been detained and some will be “arrested and booked.” It is unclear how many people were detained. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department told CNN some remaining protesters threw fireworks at law enforcement, while officers formed a skirmish line to push people away from the area. President Donald Trump said early today he would ban the use of masks by protesters, after two days of unrest in Los Angeles. What do these people have to hide, and why?? ICE officers are allowed to wear masks, however, with the agency's acting director Todd Lyons saying recently the agents cover up to protect their families. President Donald Trump is expected to meet with senior members of his administration today at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to two sources. “The White House has organized what will become a regular off campus retreat of principals attended by the President and Vice President,” a White House official said. They'll meet on a number of issues and topics, the official said. Attendees are expected to include Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, according to another person familiar with the meeting.</p>

U.S. National Guard are deployed around downtown Los Angeles, Sunday, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. LOS ANGELES (AP) — National Guard troops began arriving in Los Angeles early Sunday on orders from President Donald Trump in response to clashes in recent days between federal immigration authorities and protesters seeking to block them from carrying out deportations. Members of California's National Guard were seen staging at the federal complex in downtown Los Angeles that includes the Metropolitan Detention Center, one of several sites that have drawn confrontations involving hundreds of people in the last two days. Trump has said he is deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell the protests, which he called “a form of rebellion.” Los Angeles County Sheriffs stand during a protest in Compton, Calif., Saturday, June 7, 2025, after federal immigration authorities conducted operations. Gavin Newsom, marking the first time in decades that a state's national guard was activated without a request from its governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Their arrival follows two days of relatively small protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton. As federal agents staged near a Home Depot in Paramount, demonstrators sought to block Border Patrol vehicles, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement. A prominent union leader was arrested while protesting and accused of impeding law enforcement. Spectators watch during a protest in Compton, Calif., Saturday, June 7, 2025, after federal immigration authorities conducted operations. Newsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor's office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday. In a signal of the administration's aggressive approach, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened to deploy active-duty Marines “if violence continues” in the region. Newsom, a Democrat, described Trump's decision to call in the National Guard as a “provocative show of force” that would only escalate tensions, adding that Hegseth's threat to deploy Marines on American soil was “deranged behavior.” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, endorsed the president's move, doubling down on Republicans' criticisms of California Democrats. “Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or an unwillingness to do what is necessary, so the president stepped in,” Johnson said on ABC “This Week.”</p>

Rick Scott, R-Fla., about what it would take for him to support President Donald Trump's spending bill. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other politicians from the U.S. and Latin America condemned the shooting of Colombian presidential candidate Miguel Uribe on Sunday. Uribe, a Colombian senator, is currently fighting for his life after sustaining three gunshot wounds, one of which was to the head. "Having seen firsthand Colombia's progress over the past few decades to consolidate security and democracy, it can't afford to go back to dark days of political violence. President Petro needs to dial back the inflammatory rhetoric and protect Colombian officials," he added. Colombian Senator Miguel Uribe was shot while campaigning for president in Colombia. Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno also condemned the attack in a statement on social media. This evil act must be investigated and anyone responsible, directly or indirectly, must face swift punishment," Moreno wrote. Chilean President Gabriel Boric also reacted to Uribe's shooting. "My strongest condemnation of the attack against Miguel Uribe Turbay, pre-presidential candidate in Colombia. In a democracy, violence has no place or justification," Boric wrote. People and police officers make way for an ambulance in which Colombian Senator Miguel Uribe is transported after he was shot during a campaign event, in Bogota, Colombia, on June 7, 2025. Authorities say Uribe was shot by a boy less than 15 years old, and they are investigating who was behind the attack. Police recovered a 9mm "Glock-type" pistol from the suspect. "Miguel is fighting for his life at this moment. Let us ask God to guide the hands of the doctors who are attending to him," Maria Claudia Tarazona, Miguel's wife, wrote on her husband's X account. "I ask everyone to join together in a prayer chain for Miguel's life." Tarazona later announced that Uribe's initial surgery at the hospital "went well," though he remains in intensive care. Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Uribe's chief opponent in the presidential race, said the attack crossed a "red line" and ordered an investigation. Colombian President Gustavo Petro canceled a planned trip to France following the assassination attempt against Uribe. Colombia's Ministry of Defense has offered a nearly $750,000 reward for information relating to the assassination attempt. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

The unrest is centered in the city of Paramount, California, where protesters clashed with federal authorities, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who were allegedly trying to conduct a raid at a local business.

U.S. Northern Command on Sunday confirmed that National Guard troops have begun to deploy to the Los Angeles area, where confrontations between anti-ICE rioters and law enforcement have happened over the weekend. Two federal sources told Fox News on Sunday morning that the National Guard is actively protecting federal assets in Los Angeles County. Riots against the Trump administration's immigration raids in Southern California are rocking Los Angeles this weekend and California Republicans are pinning blame for the violence on Democratic Gov. "Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass have a real habit of letting Los Angeles burn," Republican California Rep. Darell Issa posted to X on Saturday evening. "If only Karen Bass fought against the Los Angeles fires like she fights for illegal aliens," Issa added in another post, referring to the Palisades fire that tore through Southern California in January. Other California Republicans and conservatives have also directed their ire at Democratic leaders for the violence, Fox Digital found. "Gavin Newsom seems to think that California can not only defy federal immigration law, but now federal tax law. More than 20 anti-ICE rioters were arrested in New York City on Saturday during a confrontation with immigration authorities. A mob of nearly 150 people tried to block federal officials from conducting immigration raids in Lower Manhattan, with some screaming and cursing at authorities. Demonstrators, some of whom were masked, threw rocks at an unmarked white van with tinted windows as it tried to pull away from the plaza where U.S. Immigration Court is located, the New York Post reported. Others reportedly tried to block the van with their bodies. A car was set on fire in the middle of an intersection in Los Angeles on Saturday as tensions flared between anti-ICE demonstrators and immigration authorities. Aerial video shows the tense scene as it unfolded in Los Angeles. Two individuals are seen circling the burning car on motorbikes, with one waving a Mexican flag. Gavin Newsom said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was acting “deranged” over his threat to deploy active-duty Marines to the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles. “The Secretary of Defense is now threatening to deploy active-duty Marines on American soil against its own citizens,” Newsom wrote on X. Newsom was responding to Hegseth's post on Saturday, in which the defense secretary wrote that the Pentagon is mobilizing the National Guard to respond to anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles and warned that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton may also be deployed "if violence continues." And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert.” "Using the National Guard this way is a completely inappropriate and misguided mission," Padilla wrote on X. "The Trump Administration is just sowing more chaos and division in our communities," he continued. This comes after the Trump administration took over the California National Guard and deployed 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles. Officers in Los Angeles, California, fire non-lethal projectiles during anti-ICE demonstrations. President Donald Trump on Sunday morning thanked the National Guard "for a job well done" in responding to anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, California, and said masks will not be allowed at protests. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats, as he gave high praise to the National Guard. "Great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence, clashes and unrest. We have an incompetent Governor (Newscum) and Mayor (Bass) who were, as usual (just look at how they handled the fires, and now their VERY SLOW PERMITTING disaster. "These Radical Left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will NOT BE TOLERATED," he continued. What do these people have to hide, and why??? Again, thank you to the National Guard for a job well done!" The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department arrested two individuals for alleged assault on law enforcement officers Saturday night. The sheriff's department told CBS News Los Angeles that the two suspects were arrested for alleged assault on peace officers. Multiple people were detained during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, California, on Saturday, according to police. The Los Angeles Police Department said officers detained the individuals for failing to disperse after multiple warnings were issued. "Remaining people in the area of the UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY will be subject to arrest," LAPD wrote on X. "The federal government is taking over the California National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles — not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle," Newsom wrote on X. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded that Newsom has "done nothing to stop this violence" and "should be thanking President Trump for bringing law and order to California." "Illegal criminal aliens and violent mobs have been committing arson, throwing rocks at vehicles, and attacking federal law enforcement for days," she wrote. "Gavin Newsom has done nothing to stop this violence." "He should be thanking President Trump for bringing law and order to California — a basic value that Newsom and his fellow Democrats have failed to uphold," she added. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday that the Pentagon is mobilizing the National Guard to respond to anti-ICE protests in California and warned that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton may be deployed as well "if violence continues." "The violent mob assaults on ICE and Federal Law Enforcement are designed to prevent the removal of Criminal Illegal Aliens from our soil; a dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels (aka Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and a huge NATIONAL SECURITY RISK," Hegseth wrote on X. The secretary said that under the Trump administration, violence and destruction against federal agents and federal facilities "will NOT be tolerated," adding: "It's COMMON SENSE." "And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert." Following violent anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles on Saturday night, FBI Director Kash Patel warned "if you assault a law enforcement officer, you're going to jail—period." President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Paramount, California after immigration authorities driving in the area were pelted with rocks, stones, and concrete — shattering government vehicle windshields. If the local police force won't back our men and women on the thin blue line, we @FBI will," Patel wrote on X. Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass said Saturday that violence and destruction are "unacceptable" and that anyone responsible will be held accountable, as protests continue against immigration authorities conducting raids at businesses in Southern California. "This is a difficult time for our city," Bass wrote on X. "As we recover from an unprecedented natural disaster, many in our community are feeling fear following recent federal immigration enforcement actions across Los Angeles County." "Reports of unrest outside the city, including in Paramount, are deeply concerning," she continued. "We've been in direct contact with officials in Washington, D.C., and are working closely with law enforcement to find the best path forward." "Everyone has the right to peacefully protest, but let me be clear: violence and destruction are unacceptable, and those responsible will be held accountable," the mayor added. The National Guard will be deployed to Los Angeles County after anti-ICE protests continued to escalate Saturday afternoon, Trump administration border czar Tom Homan told Fox News Saturday. On Saturday, tear gas was deployed near Home Depot in Paramount, California, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were allegedly conducting a raid. Following the raid, a violent protest broke out and several arrests were made for assault on a federal agent, according to U.S. Border Patrol Chief Michael W. Banks. "If Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can't do their jobs, which everyone knows they can't, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!" Newsom responded on X, claiming the federal government "is moving to take over the California National Guard" and deploy 2,000 soldiers. "That move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions," Newsom wrote. "LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice. The Guard has been admirably serving LA throughout recovery. This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust." This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The last time Whitney Decker saw her three daughters, she gave them each a hug and kiss goodbye, not realizing it would be the last time she saw them alive. The sisters, 5-year-old Olivia, 8-year-old Evelyn and 9-year-old Paityn Decker, were found suffocated to death at an abandoned campsite in Washington state on Monday, police said, sparking an intense manhunt for their father, Travis Decker. Though the couple had been divorced for several years, they maintained communication as co-parents and friends, her attorney Arianna Cozart told CNN. “We'll see you at eight,” he last told Whitney, Cozart said. Decker wasn't supposed to keep his daughters out after 8 p.m. and their custody plan specified no overnight visits, Whitney told the Wenatchee police when she reported the girls missing. His phone was going straight to voicemail, she told police. The mother appeared to have been crying when she arrived at the police station, police said, telling them Decker “has never failed to return the kids” and typically lets her know when he is running late, according to a police affidavit filed in the Chelan County Superior Court. Whitney told police that while he had a “good relationship” with his daughters and they enjoyed their time together, she believed he was experiencing mental health issues, according to the affidavit. “But he never displayed any sort of ‘red flags' to Whitney,” Cozart said. Their disappearance kicked off an intensive search that grew as friends, family and volunteers came out to look for the girls. The girls' bodies were about 75 yards away, down a small embankment. Authorities are now searching by land and air for Travis Decker – wanted for three counts each of murder and kidnapping – across the county, sweeping through local forests and wilderness areas, according to the Chelan County Sheriff's office. Bob Ferguson on Saturday announced he's tapping emergency funds and ordering Washington National Guard resources to support the multi-agency search for Travis Decker, warning area residents to keep their doors and windows locked and to avoid restricted areas. Meanwhile, a portrait of Travis Decker is emerging: an Army veteran and National Guardsman experiencing homelessness, skilled in wilderness survival, an involved father and, according to his ex-wife, a man struggling with mental health issues. Nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Range, Wenatchee lies between Seattle and Spokane, where rugged peaks give way to rolling orchards and breathtaking views of the Columbia River as it winds through the valley – a scenic view now punctured by tragedy. The sisters were found about 30 minutes northwest, in the Wenatchee River Ranger district, a remote, mountainous region of Washington that encompasses approximately 696,000 acres. Authorities have released photos and a video clip of Travis Decker from the days before his custody visit with the girls. He was last seen wearing a light-colored shirt and dark shorts and had his dark hair pulled back into a ponytail. Decker is “well versed in wilderness survival and capable of spending days or even weeks in the wilderness on his own and with very little equipment” which will likely make the search more difficult, the sheriff's office said in a news release on Wednesday. Doorbell camera shows wanted father days before his daughters were found dead Travis Decker is a former US Army infantryman and staff sergeant with eight years of service, including five months in Afghanistan, according to a US Army spokesperson. As the manhunt continues, the sheriff's office has advised residents in neighboring counties to lock their doors, including on outbuildings and sheds, and leave their outdoor lights on and their blinds open. His dog and daughters “are the two big positives in his life,” she said, according to the affidavit. Whitney told police that near the end of their marriage, her ex-husband was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and she did not think he was taking his medication, according to the police affidavit. In September 2024, a judge granted Whitney and Decker a parenting plan with limitations after an incident in which Decker kept the girls overnight at a homeless shelter and allowed them to go to a corner store unsupervised, according to Cozart. The new parenting plan included a psychiatric evaluation for Travis Decker, mandatory mental health counseling, and a domestic violence evaluation, according to court documents. He was permitted to see the children every other weekend. Travis Decker had “displayed some volatile behaviors that seemed concerning towards Whitney, never towards the girls,” Cozart said. His ex-wife believes the tragedy may have been prevented if Travis Decker had better access to mental health support as a veteran, Cozart said, pointing to well-documented barriers to accessing adequate resources for veterans struggling with issues including post-traumatic disorder. Central WA Veterans Counseling, a local agency serving veterans, believes that if Travis Decker had sought their help, he would have been redirected elsewhere or placed on a waitlist due to a lack of funding and a shortage of alternative resources to adequately support veterans in the region. “This isn't a hidden crisis—we've been vocal about it in the media and with local, state, and federal officials,” the group said in a statement. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Veterans Affairs for information. The flag at the Chelan County Courthouse now flies at half-staff in memory of Olivia, Evelyn and Paityn. There are no words that can capture the weight of this loss. Right now, she is surrounded by friends, family, and neighbors doing everything they can to hold her up,” Amy Edwards, a friend of Whitney's, said in part in a statement released through Cozart. “They were the kind of children everyone rooted for, looked forward to seeing, and held close in their hearts. They are cherished - not just by their family, but by an entire community who watched them grow, perform, learn, and love. A GoFundMe launched by Edwards has raised more than $1.1 million as of Sunday to support Whitney through the loss. May their light continue to shine in every performance we give. Video shows wanted father days before daughters found dead As the community grieves, no sorrow runs deeper than Whitney's – a mother devastated by unimaginable loss yet determined to ensure that her daughters are known for the light, laughter, and love they brought into the world. “The girls were amazing little humans,” Cozart said. “I know Whitney wants the world to remember them that way.”</p>

President Donald Trump's restrictions on travel from 10 African countries are being praised by analysts for improving U.S. security internationally and domestically. The president said on X the travel ban was being introduced after a terror attack against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, last weekend, allegedly by an Egyptian man who had overstayed his visa. In a White House fact sheet, Trump said, "We will restore the travel ban, some people call it the Trump travel ban, and keep the radical Islamic terrorists out of our country." This point was backed by the State Department's principal deputy spokesperson, Tommy Pigott. But observers believe there is an external, international reason. "Most, if not all, of the African countries were added to this list either because of extreme instability and thus terrorist havens or because relations between them and the U.S. is either extremely poor or non-existent," Bill Roggio, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and editor of FDD's Long War Journal, told Fox News Digital. In this Feb. 17, 2011, file photo, hundreds of newly trained al-Shabaab fighters perform military exercises in an area south of Mogadishu, Somalia. The world's two principal Islamist terror groups, ISIS and al Qaeda, represented here by Al-Shabaab, both operate openly in Somalia. The White House described it this week as "a terrorist safe haven." Somalia also remains a destination for individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the national security of the United States." The U.S. Africa Command mounted five air attacks against operators from both groups in just the 12 days up to June 2. Fighters of the Sudan Liberation Movement, a Sudanese rebel group active in Sudan's Darfur State that supports army Chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, attend a graduation ceremony in the southeastern Gedaref state March 28, 2024. The U.S. has already imposed sanctions against the leaders of both parties involved in a two-year civil war that has reportedly killed 150,000 and displaced 12 million. The U.S. claims up to 28% of Sudanese overstay their visas. The criminal records of Eritreans are not available for inspection by U.S. officials. With an overstay rate of up to 55%, the White House also reported that "Eritrea has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals." The West African country is causing concern in Washington as it deepens relations with Russia. Chad President Idriss Deby went to Moscow last year for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Kremlin Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was then warmly welcomed in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, for a reciprocal visit. Russia's shadowy Wagner private mercenary group's importance in the country is being questioned after three of its members were arrested in September and sent back to Moscow. In this pool photograph distributed by Russian state-owned agency Sputnik, Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Chad's Transitional President Mahamat Idriss Deby at the Kremlin in Moscow Jan. 24, 2024. Banning nationals this week, the U.S. said Chad has had a visa overstay rate of up to 55%. In Chad, President Deby responded by saying, "I have instructed the government to act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity and suspend the issuance of visas to U.S. People from this West African country have reportedly overstayed their F, M and J visas by up to 70%. Depending on the visa category, up to 35% of citizens in the U.S. are reported to have overstayed their visas. Has an overstay rate of up to 35%, and, the White House says, "has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals." Libyan protesters gather in Tripoli's Martyrs Square to call for the resignation of the national unity government May 14, 2025. Togo suffers from poor governance, nepotism and widespread corruption, which reportedly goes all the way to the president's office. Togo's nationals have an overstay rate of up to 35% in the U.S. Yet soaring inflation has caused a devastating rise in food prices. A former rebel group has led the country for two decades in a climate of political unrest and alleged repression. Burundi's citizens have an overstay rate of up to 17% in the U.S. Paul Tilsley is a veteran correspondent who has reported on African affairs for more than three decades from Johannesburg, South Africa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are desperately trying to lay the groundwork to recapture voting blocs in 2028 that shifted toward President Donald Trump last November. But one important nominating state, Iowa, is seemingly being left behind as the party sets its sights elsewhere. Over the last two years, Democrats have been chipping away at Iowa's first-in-the-nation status, something it's held since 1972. New Hampshire, which defied the Democratic National Committee by holding an unsanctioned primary last cycle, gained a second seat. While surrounding states like Illinois and Minnesota have moved to the left, and Wisconsin leans blue, despite swinging for Trump in 2024, Iowa has largely been written off as a red state. However, it has a purple history and elected former President Barack Obama over Republican John McCain in 2008. All six members of the U.S. congressional delegation from Iowa are Republicans, and State Auditor Rob Sand, now running for governor, is the only Democrat holding statewide office. “National Democrats are pulling away from Iowa,” Democratic state Sen. Tony Bisignano told the Washington Examiner. “Rightfully so, looking back at our turn to the far right as a politically voting state. Iowa peaked with Obama, and it's been a disaster ever since.” “Politics is what have you done lately,” the state legislator said. Iowa congressional Republicans have even expressed disappointment with the DNC's decision — particularly as the issue of preserving the caucuses and Iowa's first-in-the-nation status has been a bipartisan one for so long, Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA) said. “They're getting more liberal, and Iowa is a state of normal people,” Feenstra, who is also running for governor of Iowa, told the Washington Examiner. “It's just unfortunate where the Democrat Party is headed.” The decision to pull Iowa's seat at the Rules and Bylaws Committee comes as Chairman Ken Martin finds his footing within the DNC, signaling that Iowa's influence within the party is waning as Democrats already are preparing for a competitive and consequential presidential primary in 2028. Iowa still has representation on the DNC's Resolutions Committee with Gregory Christensen. “National Democrats let Trump get a headstart in the 2024 campaign by excluding Iowa,” Hart said. “We simply can't afford to be ignored again.” Reps. Zach Nunn (R-IA) and Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA) are among the 29 vulnerable House Republican seats the GOP needs to defend, and Democrats only need a net gain of three seats to take back the lower chamber. On the Senate side, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) is up for reelection, and given recent controversies and policy stances, it could open the door for a Democratic victory. “All states will have an opportunity to participate.” Rahman praised Iowa's DNC members and Hart as “fierce advocates” of the state and assured that “they will have their voices heard.” One Democratic communications strategist, who has worked with the DNC and was granted anonymity to discuss committee conversations, told the Washington Examiner that Iowa doesn't seem to be on “anybody's minds” at meetings discussing how to move forward in the aftermath of former Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign. Instead, they think Martin's choice reflects that he has “good relationships with the folks that he picked,” who he thinks can best get the DNC on track across the board, not just state by state. Democrats face an uphill battle to bring blue-collar workers and minority blocs such as black, Latino, Asian American, and Pacific Islander voters back to their side of the aisle. “So then, when you're trying to make a defense that Iowa and New Hampshire should be states that are early states, you're like, ‘Wait, white people ruin everything. Hinson said the Iowa-is-too-white argument “falls flat” when compared to the demographics of early voting states such as New Hampshire, Nevada, and Michigan. “They're listening to a few in their most progressive wing of their party, and it's exactly why they've lost ground in Iowa,” Hinson said.</p>

Alumnus Brian Davis, right, and assistant football coach Derrick Davis talk outside Ferriday High School in Ferriday, La., Thursday, May 22, 2025. (AP) — Even at a glance, the differences are obvious. The walls of Ferriday High School are old and worn, surrounded by barbed wire. Alumnus Brian Davis, right, and assistant football coach Derrick Davis talk outside Ferriday High School in Ferriday, La., Thursday, May 22, 2025. The schools are part of Concordia Parish, which was ordered to desegregate 60 years ago and remains under a court-ordered plan to this day. Yet there's growing momentum to release the district — and dozens of others — from decades-old orders that some call obsolete. In a remarkable reversal, the Justice Department said it plans to start unwinding court-ordered desegregation plans dating to the Civil Rights Movement. Jeff Landry and his attorney general, who have called for all the state's remaining orders to be lifted. They describe the orders as burdens on districts and relics of a time when Black students were still forbidden from some schools. The orders were always meant to be temporary — school systems can be released if they demonstrate they fully eradicated segregation. Decades later, that goal remains elusive, with stark racial imbalances persisting in many districts. Civil rights groups say the orders are important to keep as tools to address the legacy of forced segregation — including disparities in student discipline, academic programs and teacher hiring. They point to cases like Concordia, where the decades-old order was used to stop a charter school from favoring white students in admissions. “Concordia is one where it's old, but a lot is happening there,” said Deuel Ross, deputy director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “That's true for a lot of these cases. Last year, before President Donald Trump took office, Concordia Parish rejected a Justice Department plan that would have ended its case if the district combined several majority white and majority Blac k elementary and middle schools. At a town hall meeting, Vidalia residents vigorously opposed the plan, saying it would disrupt students' lives and expose their children to drugs and violence. Accepting the plan would have been a “death sentence” for the district, said Paul Nelson, a former Concordia superintendent. White families would have fled to private schools or other districts, said Nelson, who wants the court order removed. “It's time to move on,” said Nelson, who left the district in 2016. “Let's start looking to build for the future, not looking back to what our grandparents may have gone through.” He said the district's disparities come into focus whenever his teams visit schools with newer sports facilities. Others oppose merging schools if it's done solely for the sake of achieving racial balance. “Redistricting and going to different places they're not used to ... it would be a culture shock to some people,” said Ferriday's school resource officer, Marcus Martin, who, like Derrick Davis, is Black. The district's current superintendent and school board did not respond to requests for comment. Concordia is among more than 120 districts across the South that remain under desegregation orders from the 1960s and '70s, including about a dozen in Louisiana. Calling the orders historical relics is “unequivocally false,” said Shaheena Simons, who until April led the Justice Department section that oversees school desegregation cases. “Segregation and inequality persist in our schools, and they persist in districts that are still under desegregation orders,” she said. With court orders in place, families facing discrimination can reach out directly to the Justice Department or seek relief from the court. Otherwise, the only recourse is a lawsuit, which many families can't afford, Simons said. In Concordia, the order played into a battle over a charter school that opened in 2013 on the former campus of an all-white private school. To protect the area's progress on racial integration, a judge ordered Delta Charter School to build a student body that reflected the district's racial demographics. But in its first year, the school was just 15% Black. Desegregation orders have been invoked recently in other cases around the state. One led to an order to address disproportionately high rates of discipline for Black students, and in another a predominantly Black elementary school was relocated from a site close to a chemical plant. Concordia and an unknown number of other districts are in the same situation, making them vulnerable to quick dismissals. Concordia's case dates to 1965, when the area was strictly segregated and home to a violent offshoot of the Ku Klux Klan. When Black families in Ferriday sued for access to all-white schools, the federal government intervened. As the district integrated its schools, white families fled Ferriday. Ferriday is mostly Black and low-income, while Vidalia is mostly white and takes in tax revenue from a hydroelectric plant. It also files reports on teacher demographics and student discipline. Without court supervision, Brian Davis sees little hope for improvement. “You'll find schools like Ferriday — the term is, to me, slipping into darkness.” The Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Protesters kick the side of a Border Patrol vehicle during a demonstration over the dozens detained in an operation by federal immigration authorities a day earlier, in Paramount, Calif., Saturday, June 7, 2025. Tear gas fills the street as protesters confront Border Patrol personnel during a demonstration over the dozens detained in an operation by federal immigration authorities a day earlier, in Paramount, Calif., on Saturday, June 7, 2025. This time, however, Trump is acting in opposition to Newsom, who under normal circumstances would retain control and command of California's National Guard. Here are some things to know about when and how the president can deploy troops on U.S. soil. Generally, federal military forces are not allowed to carry out civilian law enforcement duties against U.S. citizens except in times of emergency. An 18th-century wartime law called the Insurrection Act is the main legal mechanism that a president can use to activate the military or National Guard during times of rebellion or unrest. But Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act on Saturday. Instead, he relied on a similar federal law that allows the president to federalize National Guard troops under certain circumstances. The National Guard is a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. Sometimes National Guard troops will be assigned by their state to serve federal missions, remaining under state command but using federal funding. The law cited by Trump's proclamation places National Guard troops under federal command. Notably, Trump's proclamation says the National Guard troops will play a supporting role by protecting ICE officers as they enforce the law, rather than having the troops perform law enforcement work. Steve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in military justice and national security law, says that's because the National Guard troops can't legally engage in ordinary law enforcement activities unless Trump first invokes the Insurrection Act. The move could also be a precursor to other, more aggressive troop deployments down the road, he wrote on his website. “There's nothing these troops will be allowed to do that, for example, the ICE officers against whom these protests have been directed could not do themselves,” Vladeck wrote. The Insurrection Act and related laws were used during the Civil Rights era to protect activists and students desegregating schools. President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black students integrating Central High School after that state's governor activated the National Guard to keep the students out. Bush used the Insurrection Act to respond to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King. National Guard troops have been deployed for a variety of emergencies, including the COVID pandemic, hurricanes and other natural disasters. At the time, Trump also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd's death in Minneapolis – an intervention rarely seen in modern American history. But then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper pushed back, saying the law should be invoked “only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” Trump never did invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term. But while campaigning for his second term, he suggested that would change. Trump also promised to deploy the National Guard to help carry out his immigration enforcement goals, and his top adviser Stephen Miller explained how that would be carried out: Troops under sympathetic Republican governors would send troops to nearby states that refuse to participate, Miller said on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” in 2023. After Trump announced he was federalizing the National Guard troops on Saturday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said other measures could follow. Hegseth wrote on the social media platform X that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert and would also be mobilized “if violence continues.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark, left, battles for the ball with Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese, center, during the second half an WNBA basketball game in Indianapolis, Saturday, May 17, 2025. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) reacts after a basket against the New York Liberty in the second half of a WNBA basketball game in Indianapolis, Saturday, May 24, 2025. He mentioned that his first experience at a WNBA All-Star game was also in Chicago — two years later at Wintrust Arena. There was another big one on Saturday night. “It's an incredible moment for this league,” said Marsh, in his first season coaching the Sky. I think that's the cool part about it is we get to represent our city in this building on a historic night. It's not lost among us how important and significant it is — and for myself to be part of that and to represent the W in that capacity, to represent the Sky in that capacity, is something that I don't take for granted.” A matchup that got moved from the smaller Wintrust Arena and was supposed to feature two of the league's brightest young stars in Chicago's Angel Reese and Indiana's Caitlin Clark didn't play out as envisioned. And they did it without the injured Clark. That had to be a bummer for the fans who showed up wearing Clark jerseys. The enthusiastic crowd of 19,496 surpassed Chicago's previous high of 16,444 in 2016 at Allstate Arena in suburban Rosemont, though tickets weren't hard to find. By comparison, when Clark and Reese played their first game in Chicago last season, courtside seats at Wintrust Arena were going for $5,000 on Ticketmaster an hour before tipoff. That game drew the celebrities, with Chicago native Chance The Rapper, comedian Jason Sudeikis and New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson in the sellout crowd along with Pro Basketball Hall of Famer Cheryl Swoopes. Even so, this was a big night. “We just continue to make milestones for women,” Reese said. I think this is gonna be the first of many. Obviously, we have two here this year. But we could continue to see this — and all our games at NBA arenas.” Reese and Clark have helped carry the league to new heights in popularity after taking their rivalry from LSU and Iowa to the pros. But the night wasn't just about them. We were on the road, me and my teammates were crammed into hotels — the Days Inn or whatever it was — watching them in June. I think they were everyone's favorite team, especially youngsters like us growing up in the ‘90s.” Marsh said Sky player-development coach Aaron Johnson, who's from Chicago, had this game circled on his proverbial calendar. “Since it got announced that we would be playing this game, it was something that he really got emotional about. Not to put him on Front Street, but this is a building that he grew up idolizing and sitting in the nosebleeds, and going from that to being able to step on the floor, those are the types of moments that you can't really put a price on,” Marsh said. You take those experiences for what it is and it comes with the moment, but also, you're extremely excited for our players to be a part of that as well.”</p>
