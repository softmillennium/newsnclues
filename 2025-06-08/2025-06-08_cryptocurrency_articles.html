                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Read to Earn quest available! Today, holding Bitcoin or Ether is a bit like living with a target on your back. Large virtual wallets trigger very real nightmares. And while some store their passwords in a safe, others bury them at the end of the world. Waiting for justice to get its hands on the predators… if they really do one day. Fear doesn't always knock at the door. Sometimes it shows up armed to the teeth. This happened to the wife of a Brazilian entrepreneur. Ransom demanded: 40 million dollars… in crypto, of course. Eventually released, the transaction was settled at 2 million. In Monero, obviously, to cover their tracks. It is human greed that tarnishes its image. In response, some strengthen security: armored doors, cameras, biometric safes. He scattered his bitcoins across four continents. A radical choice, born of paranoia? I prefer to live in a decentralized world where I have the responsibility to protect my capital. Is a fortune in crypto worth the price of constant insecurity? Many admit it half-quietly: they are afraid. The danger is no longer virtual. It is tangible, real, brutal. Holding crypto is carrying an invisible burden. Every poorly guarded password becomes a ticking time bomb. Rapid gains, promise of independence, desire to break from the traditional banking system. The new bitcoin rich do not drive Lamborghinis. They flee, hide, live between VPNs and suitcases. Crypto can make you free… or a slave to your own fortune. In 2017, they sold everything: house, car, furniture. But instead of flaunting their wealth, they fragmented it. A strategy worthy of the greatest security organizations. It is time to think about money differently. Even if it means living in a state of constant alert. Morocco has just arrested the man suspected to be the mastermind behind crypto-related kidnappings in France. And some will continue burying their keys, far, very far from prying eyes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Markets remained focused on crypto resilience despite unsettling headlines, including an immigration-related standoff in Los Angeles. According to a report by CNBC, over 100 arrests have been reported as clashes continued between protesters and federal agents, prompting President Trump to authorize the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. By Sunday morning, elements of the 79th Infantry Brigade had arrived on-site, according to Northern Command. Further escalation came with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warning that U.S. Marines at Camp Pendleton could also be mobilized if violence persists. Bitcoin traded within a narrow $1,057 range, from $105,043 to $106,101, and is currently hovering at $106,332. An early breakout attempt above $106,100 ran into selling pressure, creating a high-volume resistance zone. That move was short-lived as profit-taking set in, though the coin held onto its gains. Despite broader macro headwinds, BTC continues to attract buyers during dips, underscoring its role as a perceived hedge amid rising uncertainty.Technical Analysis Highlights Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's the first time this wallet has shown activity in two years. The purchase has stirred talk among traders and on-chain analysts alike. Some see it as a sign that big players are getting ready for more action in the weeks ahead. According to Lookonchain data, the same whale pulled 500 BTC out of Gemini back in 2022 when Bitcoin was trading near $27,400, a move worth nearly $14 million at the time. Now, with BTC hovering around $105,000, the whale's holdings sit on an unrealized gain of over $39 million. They wonder if this is the start of a wider trend or just one wallet's play. A whale that had been dormant for 2 years bought another 250 $BTC($26.37M) 9 hours ago. 2 years ago, this whale withdrew 500 $BTC($13.7M) from Gemini at $27,401, now sitting on an unrealized profit of $39M.https://t.co/c0U92isSfc pic.twitter.com/vcb4V3M0Uz Early adopters have seen massive upside in Bitcoin over the years. This whale's 2022 withdrawal came just before a multi-year price boom. Small investors often feel left behind when a wallet this size shifts coins. Still, some traders say it can create a ripple of optimism. When big holders buy, retail traders sometimes pile in, chasing the same gains.Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals On the charts, BTC seems to be shaping an inverse cup-and-handle pattern with a significant neckline at $100,800 serving as major support. There were some wild price movements last week fueled in part by social media battles between US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk. The miner capitulation signal was also detected by CryptoQuant's Hash Ribbons indicator, pointing to near-term pain for worse-off miners, but some potential rallies ahead once they pulled through.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jonathan Mann, a non-fungible token (NFT) artist, has spun his taxing experience with cryptocurrency into a song. What Happened: Mann, who is recognized for his “Song A Day” project, recently released a track that narrates his financial misfortune. In a post on X, Mann shared that he made a whopping $3 million by selling his entire song catalog as NFTs. This earned him approximately $3 million in Ether (ETH). Adding to their woes, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came knocking. This holds true even if the crypto asset's value crashes later.

In an attempt to avoid selling their crypto at a loss, Mann took out a loan through the Aave lending protocol, using some of the ETH as collateral. However, the market crash triggered a series of liquidations across the ecosystem, which included Mann's loan, erasing 300 ETH. After months of collaboration with his accountant, Mann found out that they owed $1,095,171.79 in taxes. To pay off the IRS bill, Mann sold a rare Autoglyph NFT for $1.1 million. Despite this financial blow, Mann continues his daily songwriting and selling them as NFTs. It also highlights the risks associated with crypto-backed loans, particularly during market downturns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After earning $3 million by selling thousands of his songs as NFTs in early 2022, Mann found himself facing a massive tax bill and a portfolio in freefall. Hoping for further gains, Mann and his wife chose to hold onto their earnings in Ethereum. But when the market turned and ETH began to slide, they were unprepared. But when the Terra ecosystem collapsed, it triggered a wave of liquidations, including Mann's. In an instant, 300 ETH vanished—effectively erasing years of creative work. Faced with the threat of losing their home and retirement savings, Mann dug into his digital vault and sold a rare Autoglyph NFT for $1.1 million—just enough to settle the tax debt. Despite the ordeal, Mann continues his daily song project, still minting NFTs and hoping for a second act—this time with a clearer financial strategy. Elon Musk's financial standing has taken a major hit, with his net worth shrinking by $70 billion since his public fallout with Donald Trump. UBS analyst Brian Meredith has revised his outlook on Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares, trimming the price target from $606 to $591, while maintaining a “buy” rating. In a move not seen in decades, the U.S. Treasury Department has initiated a historic $10 billion bond buyback—its largest ever—targeting securities set to mature between mid-2025 and mid-2027.

Try This: I'm a Financial Advisor: 10 Most Awesome Things You Can Do for Your Finances Stablecoins are already gaining traction for everyday use because of their speed and low fees. “We've seen some interest where banks and other companies will want to create their own stablecoin,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. In fact, companies like Circle and JPMorgan have already developed their own stablecoins to facilitate faster payments at lower fees than traditional banks. The most revolutionary change may come from decentralized finance (DeFi), which could entirely remove traditional banking middlemen. Currently, some DeFi platforms allow users to lend, borrow and earn interest directly through smart contracts. A decade from now, people may bypass banks completely when it comes to saving money, borrowing and even lending.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, a new smart money project, Unilabs Finance, has attracted massive attention within market circles. With its AI-powered investment and income strategies, crypto fans are already betting on the project to have the largest liquidity pull in this cycle. Changelly's Ethereum price prediction model aligns with this current outlook. As per data, ETH's potential maximum price level for September stands at $2,875, a 13% increase from its current value of $2,508. Meanwhile, assets like Polygon Coin and Pi Network could witness a market recovery from the possible liquidity flow from the Circle IPO. But Unilabs is poised to be the biggest beneficiary of this potential liquidity influx, with more investors flocking to AI-driven investment products. Unilabs Finance is becoming a big topic in crypto forums, as its presale phase has surpassed market expectations. Although the Ethereum price prediction remains optimistic, this next-gen DeFi project is already charting remarkable courses. The answer is simple: AI-based investment strategies and passive income systems. With its AI Market Pulse, users could access well-scouted investment opportunities powered by artificial intelligence. Through its multi-fund model, Unilabs exposes users to four investment funds: AI, RWA, mining and Bitcoin. This way, traders could benefit from emerging opportunities within these sectors while the platform handles research and exposure. With Unilabs, investors could earn by just holding their tokens on the network. Even more, investors could earn a 122% APY for staking their tokens. Experts predict that the potential liquidity flow from the Circle IPO could further add to its over $30 million in assets under management (AUM). If this happens, the UNIL could surge exponentially post-launch. Crypto fans are currently bearish on the coin, as shown by CoinCodex's sentiment tracker. While a climb back to the top seems far-fetched, experts are predicting the Circle IPO to add a much-needed boost. Like Polygon Coin, Pi Network is another asset that could benefit from the recent developments around the world's second-largest stablecoin issuer. Pi briefly surged to $2.98 post-launch but has since declined by 79% and currently trades at $0.62. Unlike the Ethereum price prediction, which has utility-based drivers, Pi Network was launched without a clear use case. However, the network has stepped up its utility game, partnering with a new decentralized app, Boostr, to enable utility payments. Pi Network is also gaining greater market reach, with exchanges like CEX.io and Binance offering a PI/USDC trading pair. As USDC liquidity spreads across these platforms, Pi could attract fresh inflows through greater exposure. But market commentators are betting big on Unilabs Finance due to its user-investment-driven approach. For savvy investors, the time to join this rare trend is now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan just revamped its Payment Services Act to be ‘crypto-friendly,' opening the door for more institutional and mainstream adoption across Asia. In Dubai, tokenized real estate pushed sales past $18B in May – proof that on‑chain ownership of physical assets is no longer science fiction. Let's look at the three of the best altcoins in presale right now – each uniquely positioned to benefit from crypto-friendly regulation in Asia and real-world tokenization trends. Crypto is having a global moment – and it's not just about price charts anymore. In Asia, Japan just revised its Payment Services Act, tightening oversight while making space for crypto firms to register and operate more easily. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Dubai is setting records. These two trends, regulatory clarity and real-world use cases, are no longer hypothetical. Designed to neutralize Solana's most pressing issues like network congestion, failed transactions, and scaling headaches, Solaxy also amplifies everything Solana does best. With its native token $SOLX set to go multichain on both Ethereum and Solana, it bridges two of the biggest blockchain ecosystems. That means access to Ethereum's deep DeFi liquidity and Solana's meme-coin explosion – all from one token. It's no wonder the presale has already raised over $45.4M. But right now, you can still buy $SOLX for just $0.001748 per token. Solaxy also democratizes high-frequency meme coin trading, giving regular users tools once reserved for sniper bots. As real-world tokenization gains ground, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is stepping into the spotlight as the first AI agent for content creation and premium Web3 platform. Here's how it works: creators can use AI tools to automate chats, upsell premium content, and even delegate video editing. Fans can buy tokens to unlock gated content, tip creators, or even interact with AI-generated avatars approved by the original influencers themselves. Price forecasts suggest $SUBBD could reach between $0.08 and $0.30 in 2025 – making it a standout among the new crypto projects with real-world use and upside. Qubetics ($TICS) enters the scene as a full-fledged Layer‑1 blockchain built around real-world asset tokenization. The crypto presale is already turning heads: $TICS is currently trading at $0.33709673, and over $17.8M has been raised so far – proof there's serious institutional and retail interest. Qubetics stands out by reducing friction in real-world asset trading: instant settlements, low fees, and regulatory compliance make it easy to fractionalize expensive assets. In a world where tokenization is moving from theory to practice, Qubetics offers a bridge between traditional assets and decentralized finance. From Japan's crypto-friendly reforms to Dubai's tokenized real estate surge, adoption is accelerating. Whether you're into utility or opportunity, these could be your best altcoins yet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin traders eye key levels to hold and reclaim into the weekly close, but the chances of a major liquidity grab are growing. Bitcoin is working on completing a “successful” support retest as trader bets increase prior to the weekly candle close. BTC price volatility is expected as liquidity analysis shows that conditions favor a significant short squeeze. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD cementing its rebound after a trip to $100,500 on June 5. Now almost back at its weekly open level, Bitcoin again inspired traders to bet on upside continuation and resumption of the bull run. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support earlier today,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital told X followers while uploading a chart with key levels. BTC price action had already achieved a daily close above its 10-day simple moving average (SMA) — something that fellow trader SuperBro had said was a prerequisite to “invalidate the bear case.” Trader Cas Abbe meanwhile looked to order book liquidity for cues over price direction. “BTC liquidation cluster is now signalling an upside move,” he summarized on X. Abbe noted that negative funding rates pointed to “big short positions” appearing over the weekend. “I think BTC big move is coming next week, possibly pushing it above $109K-$110K,” he concluded. Related: Bitcoin nears $105K as Donald Trump demands 'full point' Fed rate cut Updating X followers on his market forecast, popular trader CrypNuevo saw the logical place to build long BTC positions at $100,000. Rekt Capital meanwhile described the support retest after May's all-time highs on weekly timeframes as “successful.” Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and iGaming industries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former chief executive of the software firm Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is doubling down on his massive price prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) as it continues to trade above the six-figure level. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitcoin firebrand Michael Saylor says that as institutions enter the top crypto asset by market cap, BTC should experience a supply shock and a surge in price. “There's been a surge of Bitcoin treasury companies. That's sort of about $45 – $50 million a day at this level. That is all being consumed by the Bitcoin treasury companies. And the Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are coming on strong. Saylor goes on to slightly upgrade his price prediction for the flagship digital asset, noting that he believes it will outpace other key asset classes, such as real estate and the S&P 500. “My forecast in July of last year in Nashville was Bitcoin's going to appreciate 29% a year on average for the next 21 years. I'm getting more bullish on that forecast, but I'm certainly comfortable forecasting 30% a year ARR (annual recurring revenue) on average for the next 20 years. That's eight times real estate and bonds are down 4%. Strategy is currently the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, coming in at 580,955 BTC worth just over $61.3 billion, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries. Bitcoin is trading for $105,431 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day. Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

You're reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool's Premium Investing Services. Ethereum's native token could bounce back after a challenging year. Its first spot-price ETFs were approved last July, but those funds didn't attract as much attention as Bitcoin's (BTC 0.72%) earlier ETFs. Instead, Ether seemed to be held back by concerns about competition from newer and faster blockchains, its slowing network activity, and the Trump Administration's unpredictable tariffs. Nevertheless, some investors remain fiercely bullish on Ether's future. One of those bulls is ARK Invest's Cathie Wood, who believes Ether's price could reach $166,000 by 2032. That would represent a gain of nearly 6,220% and boost its market cap to more than $20 trillion. Bitcoin, which Wood is also bullish on, currently has a market cap of $2 trillion. Could Ether skyrocket to those levels, or should investors maintain more realistic expectations? Ethereum originally ran on a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism like Bitcoin. This meant it needed to be mined by GPUs or other chips. So instead of being mined, Ether is now staked (or locked up for rewards) on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum's transformation into a PoS blockchain also enabled it to support smart contracts, which are used to develop decentralized apps (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other crypto assets. Therefore, Ether's value is often linked to Ethereum's popularity as a development platform. Bitcoin is still valued by its scarcity and limited supply -- since 19.6 million of its maximum supply of 21 million tokens have already been mined. That's because a portion of every transaction fee in Ether is burned. But when Ethereum's network activity slows down, its supply rises as more Ether tokens are created than burned. Solana processes transactions much faster than Ethereum, while Cardano usually offers lower fees. Ether's next big upgrade -- The Verge -- aims to upgrade its security features and lower its hardware requirements so it can run on smaller devices like smartphones, wearables, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It also aims to reduce its off-chain Layer 2 (L2) fees with a series of upgrades for its network to clear more space for fresh data. Another potential catalyst would be the approval of new spot-price ETFs with staking features. The first batch of Ether's spot-price ETFs only held Ether in cold storage and didn't pass on any of its interest-like staking rewards. The next batch could pass on those rewards (about 3% to 5% annually) and make them more appealing. However, Ether could still be held back by competition from other PoS blockchains, a lack of approvals for new ETFs with staking rewards, or the messy macro environment that is curbing the market's appetite for cryptocurrencies and other speculative investments. Wood believes Ether's value will rise as Ethereum becomes a foundational layer of a new digital financial ecosystem that challenges traditional banks with decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, NFTs, and tokenized versions of real-world assets. She also expects Ether's staking yield to become more appealing than the yields of U.S. Treasuries as interest rates decline, and for the approvals of new staking ETFs to bring in even more institutional investors. Just as with Bitcoin, Wood expects the growing institutional adoption of Ether over the next few years to drive its price a lot higher. That thesis sounds reasonable, but claiming it could reach a $20 trillion market cap within the next seven years -- compared to gold's current market cap of $3.4 trillion -- seems too bullish. So while it might be smart to accumulate Ether as it rolls out new networking upgrades, attracts more developers, burns more tokens, and gains more attention with new ETFs, we should take Cathie Wood's forecasts with a grain of salt. It will probably stabilize and rise higher, but its long-term value isn't that easy to gauge. Leo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the biggest quantity ever for it and it means that more than $100 billion worth of ETH is not circulating anymore. Crypto expert Merlijn The Trader pointed this development out on June 7, 2025. He said that while many people are still focused on meme coins and risky bets, big investors, often called “smart money”, are quietly buying and locking up Ethereum. He believes this rise in staking is being missed by most of the crypto world and warned people not to ignore. Many people believe in Ethereum's progress and are therefore opting to invest rather than simply trade, which explains why the price has kept increasing. But by June 7, that number had dropped sharply to about 173,200 ETH. This sudden drop suggests fewer people are looking to sell, which fits with the trend of more ETH being staked for the long term. Many factors can affect price, but when less ETH is available on exchanges and more is being staked, it usually means investors are choosing to hold instead of selling. This often helps support higher prices in the future.
