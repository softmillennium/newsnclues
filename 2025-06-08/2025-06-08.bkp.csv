            Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh smashed the 400m freestyle world record in some style on Saturday, recording a time of 3:54.18 at the Canadian Swimming Trials.
    


            That time trimmed more than a second off the previous mark held by her longtime rival Ariarne Titmus, who beat the 18-year-old to the Olympic gold medal in this event at the 2024 Paris Games.
    


            Despite her age, McIntosh is already well accustomed to breaking records and winning the biggest titles in the sport – in Paris, she became Canada's first ever triple champion at a single Olympic Games.

            Still, breaking this world record provoked an emotional outburst rarely seen from McIntosh as she smashed the water and clenched her fist in celebration after noticing her time.
    


            “Touching the wall, you can kind of see my outburst of emotions because I was really not expecting that time. But overall I'm super, super happy,” she told reporters afterward.
    


            “I think just seeing the time after two years of really pushing my hardest every day and training in this event and not seeing the results…
    


            “So just kind of all that energy and anger and blood, sweat and tears built up and then finally having an amazing swim in it is just really, really satisfying.”
    


            McIntosh previously held the world record in this event before Titmus snaffled it, the Canadian recording a time of 3:56.08 in March 2023, almost two seconds slower than the mark she set on Saturday.
    


            This time around, she set off slower but recorded a blistering second half of the race to improve on her time.

            Veteran ABC News correspondent Terry Moran was suspended Sunday after he posted a highly critical assessment of President Donald Trump and Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on the social media platform X.
    


            In the missive, which was posted shortly after midnight, Moran said both Trump and Miller are “world-class haters.” For Trump, he said, hatred is “only a means to an end, and that end is his own glorification. That's his spiritual nourishment.”
    


            For Miller, on the other hand, “hatreds are his spiritual nourishment,” Moran charged. “He eats his hate.”
    


            Moran — who landed a rare Oval Office interview with Trump in April — later deleted the tweet and didn't post anything further.
    


            On Sunday morning, Trump administration officials condemned Moran and said the post reflected poorly on ABC News as an institution. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly pushed ABC to discipline Moran.
    


            “We have reached out to ABC to inquire about how they plan to hold Terry accountable,” she wrote on X.
    


            “Hopefully this journalist will either be suspended or terminated,” Leavitt said in an interview on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News.
    


            As for ABC, “they have said they will be taking action,” she added, apparently referring to a private conversation.
    


            About one hour later, the news division said Moran, its senior national correspondent and former “Nightline” anchor, had been suspended.
    


            “ABC News stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others,” a spokesperson said in response to CNN's inquiry about Moran. “The post does not reflect the views of ABC News and violated our standards — as a result, Terry Moran has been suspended pending further evaluation.”
    


            Miller, often described as the architect behind Trump's immigration policies, is the subject of frequent and ferocious criticism, including the “hater” label that Moran applied. A 2020 book called “Hatemonger” documented Miller's longstanding ties to far-right groups that demonize immigrants.
    


            But it is highly unusual for a network correspondent like Moran to publish such a politically charged piece of commentary, particularly in the middle of the night on a free-for-all social media site.
    


            Miller reacted to Moran's post by saying that “the most important fact about Terry's full public meltdown is what it shows about the corporate press in America.”
    


            “For decades, the privileged anchors and reporters narrating and gatekeeping our society have been radicals adopting a journalist's pose. Terry pulled off his mask,” Miller wrote on X.
    


            Vice President JD Vance also posted a defense of Miller on X, stating that Miller is “motivated by love of country” and that ABC “should apologize.”

 Poland's newly elected president, Karol Nawrocki, has stressed that Warsaw's continued support for Kiev in its conflict with Russia does not override Polish national interests, and is contingent on reaching “compromise and consensus” over historical and economic disputes.

In an interview with the Hungarian magazine Mandiner, published on Saturday, Nawrocki raised long-standing issues such as the exhumation of Poles killed by Ukrainian Nazi collaborators during the 1940s Volyn massacres, as well as trade practices that he says harm Polish farmers and truckers.

“At the moment, I am opposed to Ukraine's accession into the European Union,” Nawrocki said. “I look at Ukraine as a country that, although it defends itself very boldly against Russia, must also respect the interests of other countries who, by the way, support Ukraine.”

“Poland has an interest in exhuming the Volyn victims, for example,” he said. ""During the campaign, I did not agree, nor will I, as president, agree to unfair competition against Poland's agriculture or logistics sector with Ukraine.”

Despite Warsaw being one of Kiev's key backers in its conflict with Moscow, it has consistently tied support for Ukraine's EU and NATO aspirations the recognition of the “genocide” committed by Ukrainian nationalists. Militants with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) slaughtered up to 100,000 Poles between 1943 and 1945 in the regions of Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, which currently belong to Ukraine. Modern Ukraine celebrates the perpetrators as “freedom fighters” and “national heroes.” The OUN was led by Stepan Bandera, a notorious Nazi collaborator who is widely revered in modern Ukraine.

Warsaw has also protested a tariff-free EU trade scheme with Ukraine which was introduced in 2022. While Brussels promoted it as a vital economic lifeline for Kiev, it drew backlash from disadvantaged domestic producers across the bloc. The framework expired this week after proposed extensions and alternatives failed to secure enough support.

Nawrocki, a conservative historian – currently on Russia's national wanted list for his role in the dismantling of hundreds of Soviet-era memorials – narrowly defeated liberal Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski in the June 1 presidential runoff with 50.89% of the vote. His campaign emphasized Catholic values, national sovereignty and a rebalanced relationship with the EU.

Nawrocki is set to take office on August 6. While the Polish presidency is largely ceremonial, it holds veto power and influence over foreign policy.

US President Donald Trump's administration is pushing to dilute a stringent Senate bill aimed at imposing harsh new sanctions on Russia, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Friday, citing sources. The proposed legislation includes a steep 500% tariff on imports from any country that continues to buy oil, gas, uranium, or other key commodities from Moscow.

The sanctions bill was introduced in early April by a bipartisan group of senators led by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. In addition to the tariffs, the measure includes secondary sanctions targeting countries that maintain commercial ties with Russia. Graham described the bill as “one of the most draconian sanctions bills ever written” and the restrictions as “bone-crushing.”

According to WSJ, Trump fears that the bill could harm his efforts to improve relations between the United States and Russia, which he is trying to combine with ending the conflict between Moscow and Kiev.

In recent weeks, White House officials have “quietly contacted” Graham's office to urge him to water down the bill. They have suggested adding exceptions to the bill that would allow the president to choose who would be subject to the restrictions, the newspaper's sources said.

In particular, Graham was asked to replace the bill's mandatory language, substituting “shall” with “may.”

While any administration could ask for changes in a bill like this one, “eliminating the mandatory nature of sanctions would render Graham's bill toothless,” WSJ added, citing staffers. They also stressed that Trump “already has discretion to impose sanctions.”

Blumenthal confirmed to WSJ that there had been “private negotiations” with Trump's administration, but declined to comment on the substance of it. “We're moving ahead and the White House is included in our conversations,” he said.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump told reporters that the sanctions bill moving through the US Senate would be “guided by me,” but suggested it might be better to let Russia and Ukraine continue fighting “for a while” before “pulling them apart.”

Russia has consistently criticized Western sanctions, calling them illegal, and maintains that they have failed to inflict lasting economic damage.

In March, President Vladimir Putin said that a total of 28,595 sanctions had been imposed on Russian companies and individuals in recent years – more than the total number on all other countries combined. According to the president, the West sought to eliminate the country as a competitor, but its economy has only grown more resilient under pressure.

The first batch of 1,212 bodies of dead Ukrainian servicemen has been delivered to a designated exchange point and is ready to be handed over to Kiev, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.

Moscow had decided to return the bodies of over 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers in a unilateral humanitarian gesture during talks between the two sides in Istanbul on Monday. The Russians tried transferring the remains on Saturday, but Kiev's representatives failed to show up at the exchange point on the border between Belarus and Ukraine.

“The Russian side is fully ready to fulfill all agreements on the return of the bodies of the dead Ukrainian soldiers and the exchange [of prisoners],” Russian Lieutenant General Aleksandr Zorin, who was a member of Moscow's negotiating team in Istanbul, told journalists.

However, he warned that the transfer of the remains could fail yet again, saying that there are “signals” that it could be postponed until next week. “Russia is waiting for confirmation from Ukraine,” he said.

“I have no comment regarding the rhetoric that it is some sort of a political decision. It is a purely humanitarian action. Not the first of such kind and, regrettably, not the last one,” he said about the Russian decision to hand the remains over to Ukraine.   

Kiev had refused to accept the bodies of its fallen soldiers on Saturday, claiming that it hadn't agreed on the date of the transfer and accusing Moscow of “humanitarian issues for informational purposes.”

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova reacted to the move by saying that Ukraine “does not need its people; neither dead nor alive.”

“There is no nation or ethnic group in the world that would refuse to bury its soldiers. But there is the Kiev regime, which professes a misanthropic ideology and is committing genocide against its own people,” Zakharova insisted.

A member of the Russian parliament's International Affairs Committee, Dmitry Belik, told RT that one of the reasons for Vladimir Zelensky's government failing to take back the bodies of its soldiers could be Ukraine's unwillingness to pay compensation to their families.

MOSCOW, June 8. /TASS/. Paratroopers from Novorossiysk destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot and manpower by drones in the Zaporozhye Region, Russia's Defense Ministry reported on Sunday.

""Operators of attack unmanned aerial vehicles of Novorossiysk paratroopers destroyed an ammunition depot and up to a squad of the Ukrainian infantry in the Zaporozhye Region. After flying over several kilometers, the operators spotted a camouflaged ammunition depot in a forest belt where the Ukrainian infantry periodically arrived for replenishing the ammunition load,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Following the target acquisition of a reconnaissance UAV, quadcopter drones dropped explosives and destroyed the field depot, triggering stored ammunition detonation. Subsequently, the operators detected the movement of enemy infantry in a stronghold. Up to a squad of the Ukrainian army tried to hide in a dugout but were eliminated by three accurate hits of FPV drones, the ministry said.

Novorossiysk paratroopers daily accomplish combat objectives using UAVs to destroy enemy manpower, armored combat vehicles, artillery and mortar crews and field ammunition depots camouflaged in forest belts. Reconnaissance and attack UAV teams operate jointly round the clock thanks to night vision cameras mounted on drones, it said.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The US president says he's deploying 2,000 troops to Los Angeles amid immigration protests. Here's what to know

Donald Trump said on Saturday he's deploying 2,000 California national guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to immigration protests, over the objections of the California governor, Gavin Newsom.

Here are some things to know about when and how the president can deploy troops on US soil.

Generally, federal military forces are not allowed to carry out civilian law enforcement duties against US citizens except in times of emergency.

An 18th-century wartime law called the Insurrection Act is the main legal mechanism a president can use to activate the military or national guard during times of rebellion or unrest. But Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act on Saturday.

Instead, he relied on a similar federal law that allows the president to federalize national guard troops under certain circumstances.

The national guard is a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. Often, it operates under state command and control, using state funding. Sometimes national guard troops will be assigned by their state to serve federal missions, remaining under state command but using federal funding.

The law cited by Trump's proclamation places national guard troops under federal command. The law says this can be done under three circumstances: when the US is invaded or in danger of invasion; when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the US government; or when the president is unable to “execute the laws of the United States”, with regular forces.

But the law also says that orders for those purposes “shall be issued through the governors of the States”. It's not immediately clear whether the president can activate national guard troops without the order of that state's governor.

Trump's proclamation says the national guard troops will play a supporting role by protecting US immigration officers as they enforce the law, rather than having the troops perform law enforcement work.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in military justice and national security law, says that's because national guard troops can't legally engage in ordinary law enforcement activities unless Trump first invokes the Insurrection Act.

Vladeck said the move raises the risk that the troops could end up using force while filling that “protection” role. The move could also be a precursor to other, more aggressive troop deployments down the road, he wrote on his website.

“There's nothing these troops will be allowed to do that, for example, the ICE officers against whom these protests have been directed could not do themselves,” Vladeck wrote.

The Insurrection Act and related laws were used during the civil rights era to protect activists and students desegregating schools. Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black students integrating Central high school after that state's governor activated the national guard to keep the students out.

George HW Bush used the Insurrection Act to respond to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King.

National guard troops have been deployed for a variety of emergencies, including the Covid pandemic, hurricanes and other natural disasters. But generally, those deployments are carried out with the agreements of the governors of the responding states.

In 2020, Trump asked governors of several states to deploy their national guard troops to Washington DC to quell protests that arose after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. Many of the governors agreed, sending troops to the federal district.

At the time, Trump also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd's death in Minneapolis – an intervention rarely seen in modern American history. But then defense secretary Mark Esper pushed back, saying the law should be invoked “only in the most urgent and dire of situations”.

Trump never did invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term.

But while campaigning for his second term, he suggested that would change. Trump told an audience in Iowa in 2023 that he had been prevented from using the military to suppress violence in cities and states during his first term, and said that if the issue came up again in his next term: “I'm not waiting.”

Trump also promised to deploy the national guard to help carry out his immigration enforcement goals, and his top adviser, Stephen Miller, explained how that would be carried out: sympathetic Republican governors would send troops to nearby states that refused to participate, Miller said on The Charlie Kirk Show in 2023.

After Trump announced he was federalizing the national guard troops on Saturday, the defense secretary Pete Hegseth said other measures could follow.

Hegseth wrote on the social media platform X that active-duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert and would also be mobilized “if violence continues”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ruling Spanish Socialist Workers' party has faced series of corruption allegations over past year

Tens of thousands of people have gathered in central Madrid to protest against the government of Spain's socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and to demand an early general election, as his party, his administration and his family continue to be beset by a succession of corruption allegations.

Sunday's protest, called by the opposition conservative People's party (PP) under the slogan “mafia or democracy”, attracted between 45,000 and 50,000 people, according to the central government's delegation to the region. Organisers put the attendance at 100,000.

Sánchez's government and his inner circle have faced a series of corruption allegations over the past year. Pressure on his Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) has increased over recent days after a former member of the party was accused of trying to wage a smear campaign against the Guardia Civil police unit investigating the prime minister's wife, Begoña Gómez, his brother, David Sánchez, and the former transport minister José Luis Ábalos.

Leire Díaz, who resigned from the PSOE after recordings were leaked in which she appeared to offer judicial leniency in return for compromising information on senior members of the unit, has denied working on behalf of the prime minister or the party, saying she was researching a book on corruption.

As demonstrators congregated in the midday heat of the Plaza de España, carrying placards bearing messages such as “Sánchez traitor” and “government resign”, the PP's leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, renewed his call for a snap election.

“Spain needs a revolution of decency and freedom – and we will lead that revolution from the streets and at the ballot boxes,” he told the crowd. “Mr Sánchez, stop hiding, stop lying and stop running. Spain knows only too well who you are and what you have done. Yield to democracy. Call an election: we want one now because no one voted for this, not even your supporters.”

The prime minister has accused his political and media opponents of conducting a “harassment and bullying operation” against him and his wife, arguing that false allegations levelled at her are designed to bring about his “personal and political collapse”.

Gómez is being investigated for alleged corruption and influence peddling after a complaint by the pressure group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), a self-styled trade union with far-right links that has a long history of using the courts to pursue political targets. Manos Limpias has accused Gómez of using her influence as the wife of the prime minister to secure sponsors for a university master's degree course that she ran. Sánchez has described the case against his wife as baseless and “an ugly fit-up driven by the far-right groups behind the complaint”.

Meanwhile, David Sánchez is facing trial over allegations of influence peddling and other offences in a case that also began with accusations from Manos Limpias and other groups. He denies the charges.

Sánchez's administration has also been facing questions since it emerged in February last year that an assistant to Ábalos, once a close ally and confidant of the prime minister, had been arrested on suspicion of taking payments to facilitate contracts for face masks during the coronavirus pandemic.

Meanwhile, the PP, which was ousted from government seven years ago after a series of corruption scandals, is itself under scrutiny on several fronts, not least over its handling of the deadly floods last year in Valencia, one of the regions it governs.

Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the populist PP president of the Madrid region – and one of the prime minister's most vocal critics – is facing continuing questions over her government's Covid protocols after more than 7,200 people died in the region's care homes during the early stages of the pandemic. She has also been forced to defend her relationship with her partner, Alberto González Amador, after judges began investigating his business dealings.

González Amador is under investigation for a variety of alleged offences and has been charged with two counts of tax fraud and one of document forgery in connection to fees he charged a company that imported face masks during the pandemic. Ayuso has said her partner has been targeted by “all the powers of the state” purely because of his relationship with her, while a member of her administration recently said the “presumption of innocence should be respected”.

The government attempted to play down the protests, dismissing them as a sign of the PP's desperation.

Spain's pugnacious transport minister, Óscar Puente, posted aerial pictures showing the plaza far from full, while the digital transformation minister, Óscar López, said the protest had been called to distract attention from Feijóo's underperforming leadership and from Ayuso's problems.

“They're really nervous,” López wrote on X. “Because they've filled the Plaza de España with insults but not with people … While they sling mud, we move forwards.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

An Indian state riven by ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew after protesters clashed with security forces over the arrest of some members of a radical group, police said yesterday.

Manipur in India's northeast has been rocked by periodic clashes for more than two years that have killed more than 250 people between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community.

The latest violence was triggered on Saturday after reports of the arrest of five members, including a commander, of Arambai Tenggol, a radical Meitei group.

Incensed mobs demanding their release stormed a police post, set fire to a bus and blocked roads in parts of the state capital Imphal.

Manipur police announced a curfew in five districts, including Imphal West and Bishnupur, due to the “developing law and order situation.”

“Prohibitory orders have been issued by District Magistrates. Citizens are requested to cooperate with the orders,” the police said in a statement.

Arambai Tenggol, which is alleged to have orchestrated the violence against the Kuki community, has also announced a 10-day shutdown in the state's valley districts.

The state's home ministry has ordered all internet and mobile data services in volatile districts to be shut off for five days to bring the latest unrest under control.

Internet services were shut down for months in Manipur during the initial outbreak of violence in 2023, which displaced about 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.

Thousands of the state's residents are still unable to return home owing to ongoing tensions.

Long-standing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs. 

Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain.

The agreement, reached in 2022 and ratified by Kosovar lawmakers last year, provides for the reception of up to 300 foreign prisoners sentenced in Denmark. They must not have been convicted of terrorism or war crimes, or have a mental condition or terminal disease. Once their sentence is completed in Kosovan, they would be deported to their home country.

Ecuador's National Assembly on Saturday approved a reform backed by Ecuadoran President Daniel Noboa to arm the government with new legal powers to confront armed groups and dismantle the drug-trafficking networks that fuel their criminal enterprises.

The bill was backed by 84 of the 141 lawmakers who were present in the legislature. Forty-six lawmakers voted against it, 10 abstained and one turned in a blank vote.

Noboa, 37, who began a full four-year term last month, declared an “internal armed conflict” against criminal gangs in January last year, just a couple of months after he was first inaugurated as president.

Since declaring the campaign against gangs, Noboa has issued emergency decrees to put military boots on the ground alongside police, significantly ramping up security forces.

He has also overseen an increase in prison sentences for drug-related crimes and is pursuing closer collaboration with the US and other nations for intelligence sharing and resources.

The new legal framework gives Noboa more freedom to redirect resources toward crime-fighting measures.

He would also have the power to pardon police and military personnel for their conduct in security operations.

Officers under criminal investigation would also avoid pretrial detention, but would be subject to evaluations every six months, according to the approved text.

The reforms introduce penalties of up to 30 years in prison for fuel theft, which costs hundreds of millions of dollars for the oil industry. Authorities say this crime, along with illegal mining, has grown in recent years and is a key source of funding for criminal gangs.

Assets linked to criminal groups can be directly seized by security forces, a significant shift allowing for more immediate confiscation compared to previous, often lengthy, judicial processes for asset forfeiture.

People who lead, belong to, or collaborate with these groups will face prison sentences of up to 30 years in prison.

The reforms also include economic incentives for sectors affected by the violence.

The agreement, reached in 2022 and ratified by Kosovar lawmakers last year, provides for the reception of up to 300 foreign prisoners sentenced in Denmark. They must not have been convicted of terrorism or war crimes, or have a mental condition or terminal disease. Once their sentence is completed in Kosovan, they would be deported to their home country.

The census indicated that Brazil had 100.2 million Roman Catholics in 2022, accounting for 56.7 percent of the population, down from 65.1 percent or 105.4 million recorded in the 2010 census.
Meanwhile, the share of evangelical Christians rose to 26.9 percent last year, up from 21.6 percent in 2010, adding 12 million followers to reach 47.4 million — the highest figure

President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration diverted 20,000 anti-drone missiles originally intended for Ukraine to American forces in the Middle East, in an interview with ABC News published on June 8.

Zelensky said Ukraine had counted on the missiles to help counter relentless Russian drone attacks, which include swarms of Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones. On June 1, Russia launched a record 472 drones in a single night.

""We have big problems with Shaheds… we will find all the tools to destroy them,"" Zelensky said. ""We counted on this project — 20,000 missiles. Anti-Shahed missiles. It was not expensive, but it's a special technology.""

Zelensky said the plan had been agreed upon with then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and was launched under President Joe Biden's administration. 

The Wall Street Journal reported on June 4 that the Trump administration had redirected the munitions, which include special fuzes used in advanced rocket systems to intercept drones, toward U.S. forces stationed in the Middle East.

The Pentagon reportedly informed Congress in a classified message that the reallocation of the fuzes for the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System was deemed an ""urgent issue"" by current Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

A Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent on June 4 that Russia is preparing to launch more than 500 long-range drones per night in future attacks, as Moscow rapidly scales up drone production and constructs new launch sites.

The Trump administration has halted the approval of new military aid packages to Ukraine since the start of his second term in January. 

Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about continued assistance to Kyiv and temporarily suspended military shipments earlier this year, only resuming them after Ukraine agreed to a ceasefire framework during peace talks in Jeddah on March 11.

Hegseth, who ordered the temporary halt, did not attend the most recent Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on June 4 — the first such absence by a U.S. defense chief since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.

Ukraine has urgently called on Western partners to expand investments in domestic arms production and deliver more air defense systems, including U.S.-made Patriots, to counter intensifying Russian airstrikes. 

Despite growing international appeals and Kyiv's offer of a 30-day ceasefire as the basis for peace talks, Moscow continues to reject the proposal.

Trump, who spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 4, has refused to impose new sanctions on Russia, saying he is focused on pursuing a negotiated ceasefire.

Errol Musk, the father of U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, has arrived in Moscow to attend the Forum of the Future 2050, a pro-Kremlin event scheduled for June 9-10,  the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on June 8. 

The report comes amid a high-profile public conflict between Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest businessman, and his former ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. In May, Musk announced he would step down as an advisor to Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Since then, he has emerged as a major critic of the president.

The pro-Kremlin event will be hosted by the Tsargrad Institute and led by far-right Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin. 

""I am eager to meet everyone. As far as I know, Russians are among the most intelligent people on the planet. It would be foolish not to ask their opinion on all sorts of issues,"" Errol Musk was quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency TASS.

Among the forum's panels are sessions titled ""Russian Space: The Race for Mars"" and ""The Battle for Hearts and Minds: The Ideology of Sovereign Russia."" 

According to Kommersant, scheduled speakers include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, and prominent state TV anchor Ekaterina Andreeva.

Errol Musk, a former South African businessman and politician, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him ""a strong leader"" and saying that ""it would be foolish not to admire Putin"" in an April interview with BBC Russia.  

Errol's attendance at the far-right event comes amid growing scrutiny of his son, Elon Musk, whose role as the head of SpaceX and the Starlink satellite network places him at the center of both U.S. defense operations and Ukraine's battlefield communications.

SpaceX holds billions in Pentagon and NASA contracts, including a $1.8-billion agreement with the U.S. intelligence community to build a classified spy satellite system.

Despite initially aiding Ukraine by providing Starlink terminals to stabilize battlefield communications, Elon Musk has increasingly echoed Kremlin-aligned narratives. 

He has suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks public support in Ukraine and has repeatedly called U.S. aid a driver of a ""never-ending draft meat grinder.""

Those statements have been warmly received by Russian officials, military bloggers, and state media outlets, which have praised Musk as a voice of reason and a critic of Western involvement in the war.

Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's international affairs committee, said on June 6 that Moscow is ready to grant political asylum to Musk following his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump.

People cycle and walk on the lakeshore path along Lake Ontario in Toronto in 2020.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press

If I'm walking on a multi-use path and I hear a bell from a cyclist approaching from behind, what am I supposed to do? Usually, the bikes are coming really fast. Often, it will be two bikes riding side by side. It seems like they expect me to leap out of the way (especially when they ring the bell incessantly) even if I'm on the rightmost side of the trail. 

I find it's getting worse now with so many people on e-bikes – especially people around my age (I'm in my 60s). My guess is some of them haven't cycled in years and think like entitled drivers. – Erin, Ontario

Despite what some cyclists think, ringing a bell doesn't mean “Scram, pedestrians!” 

If you're walking or running on a trail, cyclists should warn you that they're coming, but you don't have to get out of their way, experts said. 

“You may want to move if you can to stay safe, but it's not a legal requirement,” said Sean Shapiro, a traffic safety consultant and former Toronto traffic cop. “If I'm walking with my kids and I hear a bell, I'm going to look but I'm not going to leap, because I could leap into the cyclist's path and cause a collision.”

In Ontario, the Highway Traffic Act (HTA) requires cyclists, like drivers, to have “a bell, gong or horn” and use it “whenever is reasonably necessary to notify pedestrians” or face a $110 fine. 

That bell is just supposed to let you know that a cyclist is there, but you still generally have the right of way, Shapiro said. 

“You're a pedestrian – it's a pedestrian path or sidewalk,"" he said. “Everyone else is visiting.”

While the HTA generally doesn't apply on paths and trails, municipalities have their own bylaws around multi-use paths. Toronto's, for instance, includes a 20-kilometre-an-hour speed limit and a requirement to yield to pedestrians.

While the law varies by province and city, pedestrians usually have the right of way.

But cyclists should, generally, be yielding to pedestrians on trails even when it's not specifically required by local laws, said Patrick Brown, a Toronto-based personal injury lawyer who handles cycling-related cases.

“Shared respect should be maintained on all shared trails,” he said. “Cyclists have an added responsibility to pedestrians because they are heavier, faster and (can) cause serious injury to a pedestrian if struck.”

Civil discourse?

If you're seriously injured by a cyclist while you were walking or running, you could sue them for damages, Brown said. 

“[The court] would look at whether or not the cyclist's actions were reasonable in the circumstance,” he said. 

Damages, including pain and suffering, loss of income and care costs awarded by a court could be “a very substantial amount,” he said.

If the cyclist has home insurance, which includes personal liability insurance, it will cover the damages. 

“But if you didn't have home insurance, and a lot of people don't, especially in the city, that's a problem because you would be responsible for paying it,” he said, adding that if the collision is fatal and the cyclist is at fault, the amount of money could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

While incidents of pedestrians being seriously injured and killed by cyclists are relatively rare – especially compared to the number of cyclists and pedestrians seriously injured and killed by cars – they do happen, Brown said. 

But a pedestrian could also be found at fault, civilly, in a collision if, for instance, they ran out onto a trail in front of a bike without looking first and the bike had no way to stop in time, he said. 

“If you [try to avoid them] but peel off the trail into a ditch and fracture your neck, that pedestrian could be civilly responsible for what happened to you” as a cyclist, Brown said. “And that has happened, too.”

But if cyclists are coming up on somebody already on the trail, they should be slowing down and be ready to either stop or to go off the trail, if possible, to pass slowly, he said. 

That's because pedestrians may not hear you, they may not be able to move out of your way or, especially if they're with small kids, they could move unpredictably.

“If you're driving a car in a school zone, you better slow down and you better be wary that kids could run out in front of your car and you better drive accordingly,” he said. “It's the exact same thing with cyclists. You're riding through trails in park areas [with] families having picnics. So you should be going at a very low speed [so]… when the unexpected happens, you'll be able to brake and avoid it.”

That's especially true for e-bikes, which are heavier and need more distance to stop, he said. 

Generally, then, it's smartest for walkers and runners to keep calm and carry on when they hear that bell, Brown said.

“If you step out to the left or you step out to the right, how do you know what the bike will do?” he said. “Just keep going at your same pace and be conscious that there's a bike coming up from behind.”

While it's not a bad idea for pedestrians to stick to the right side of a trail, they don't have to unless there's a local bylaw requiring it (Toronto's doesn't), he said. That's true even when there's a painted centre line on the trail.

“If there's a family taking up a whole path, then the expectation is for the cyclist to slow down and stop until there's an opportunity to go around them or until they move,” he said. “There's no right at all to barrel through that, even if you think you have the right of way.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Friedrich Merz brings new political style to Germany","https://www.dw.com/en/friedrich-merz-brings-new-political-style-to-germany/a-72823365","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 07:04:51 GMT","

Chancellor Friedrich Merz's visit to Washington was met with favorable coverage back home, with many hailing a new political style that contrasts with that of his predecessors, Olaf Scholz and Angela Merkel.

The consensus was that he handled it quite well: The new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz  got through his first visit to US President Donald Trump without any heated exchanges or diplomatic faux pas. Although he hardly had a chance to speak during the nearly 50-minute press conference in the Oval Office, he was able to say that Germany will continue to support Ukraine in its defense against Russia.

For his part, Trump treated the conservative politician with more respect than he did former Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was not invited to the White House, or Angela Merkel, whom Trump once famously refused to shake hands with in the Oval Office.

Things have been pretty busy in German politics since May 6, when Merz, of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), took office. Since then, Germany's new head of government has made surprising statements and bold announcements nearly every week.

This is in contrast to his predecessor Scholz, of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), who became known for his tendency to keep the public in the dark about his plans. Scholz had consistently urged his staff to adhere to the motto: ""We will not be upset, we will not become hysterical."" In other words, he was at pains to convey a sense of calm.

Merz, on the other hand, never hid his impatience at having to wait so long in the wings before finally securing the office he so coveted: In 2002, he lost a power struggle with Merkel for the leadership of the CDU. Frustrated, Merz moved into the private sector and only returned to politics when it became clear that Merkel intended to step down in 2021. Four years later, at the age of 69, he finally reached the pinnacle of power in Germany. The chancellorship is the first public office Merz has held in his life.

Scholz and Merz couldn't have more different personalities. The former is a sober, soft-spoken northern German who had plenty of government experience before he became chancellor. Scholz was the mayor of Hamburg and then the federal finance minister under Merkel. By contrast, Merz, by nature very conservative and easily irritated, rose quickly through his party ranks even without administrative political experience. Nor are the two politicians particularly fond of each other.

DW Chief Political Editor Michaela Küfner knows both men well, having accompanied the two leaders on several foreign trips. Reflecting on the different styles of the two politicians and their predecessor, she noted: ""While Merkel always thought with the outcome in mind and Scholz was reluctant to even describe a political goal before he had paved the way for it, Merz clearly defines his goals."" According to Küfner's analysis, this represents a significant political shift in itself.

It took Scholz until the summer of 2022 to visit Ukraine, which had been invaded by Russia in the spring of that year. For a long time, Scholz remained secretive about whether he would supply weapons to the embattled country — though in the end he did.

Merz, on the other hand, visited Ukraine within days of taking office, together with French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, when they announced that there would soon be a ceasefire and peace talks.

But this still hasn't come to pass, while President Donald Trump appears to have backed out of his earlier commitment to forge a lasting peace. Given the US president's unpredictability, this was not really a surprise, something Scholz would certainly have taken into account.

""Following the strong performance with Macron, Tusk, and Starmer came this diplomatic embarrassment,"" says Berlin-based correspondent Küfner. ""Merz still has to prove that this defeat can translate into strong leadership.""

The change in style in Germany's policy toward Israel is even more noticeable. After the Islamist militia Hamas attacked Israelin October 2023, Scholz's response was essentially to insist on Israel's right to defend itself. This remained his stance even as the Israeli army took increasingly brutal action against the civilian population in the Gaza Strip. The European Union, as well as the United States, Germany and several other countries classify Hamas as a terrorist organization.

As an opposition politician at the time, Merz also showed strong support for Israel and even announced that, unlike Scholz, he would demonstrate that support by inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the chancellery. That stance did not waver even after the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last November for crimes against humanity.

But soon after taking office, he made something of a U-turn: A few days ago, Merz said he no longer understood Israel's actions in the Gaza war, before adding that they could no longer be justified as a legitimate fight against Hamas terrorism. Never before has a chancellor spoken so bluntly about the actions of the Israeli government.

Küfner says: ""Merz's criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza is a historic step. He is not afraid to directly criticize the Israeli prime minister about alleged violations of international law. This is a new tone from Germany."" With this, Merz begged a question that Scholz had successfully avoided: How far does the German reason of state, the commitment to Israel's security, actually extend?

What this will mean in practical terms for German-Israeli relations remains to be seen. Even under Scholz, arms deliveries to Israel had been relatively limited, and Merz has not announced an end to these deliveries. Nor has he repeated his earlier invitation to Netanyahu.

In practical terms, not much has really changed, but the tone is definitely different. This is likely to continue over the coming weeks. Germany will have to get used to the chancellor's new political style. Meanwhile, Scholz is now observing all this from his position as an ordinary member of the Bundestag. And he has not yet made any comments on his successor's policies.

Pope Leo XIV welcomed Javier Milei and reportedly agreed to visit Argentina. Leo's predecessor Francis was an Argentine who often clashed with Milei and never visited his home country during his 12-year papacy.

Pope Leo XIV on Saturday welcomed Argentina's President Javier Milei to the Vatican, which released an official statement calling the meeting ""cordial.""

After his exchange with Leo, Milei held talks with Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and a diplomatic team.

The Vatican statement said issues of ""common interest,"" were discussed during Saturday's visit, ""such as socioeconomic progress, the fight against poverty, and the commitment to social cohesion, in addition to addressing ongoing conflicts"" and global peace efforts.

Milei's office released an excited statement on social media after the meeting as well, announcing, ""The Pope confirmed to the President that he will visit Argentina.""

Argentine media sources suggest such a trip could take place as soon as next year as part of a South American tour that could include stops in Uruguay and Peru, where Leo lived and worked for nearly 20 years.

A brash libertarian populist with a fawning affinity for Donald Trump, Milei had a tense relationship with Leo's predecessor Pope Francis, an Argentine who never returned home during his 12-year papacy.

Though Francis never publicly called out Milei, he indirectly criticized police heavy-handedness in the mistreatment of Argentine retirees protesting for better pensions in 2024, saying, ""instead of paying for social justice, they paid for pepper spray."" 

Milei, who launched rabid online tirades against Francis, went so far as to defame him as ""an imbecile"" and far worse in expletive-laden posts, even equating him with the Antichrist.

Milei has implemented radical austerity measures in his effort to slow inflation and lower poverty levels. His radical free-market approach runs counter to Catholic social teachings that expect the state to care for those of its citizens finding themselves in need.

Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Ignacio Garcia Cuerva — whom Leo also welcomed to the Vatican on Saturday — has accused Milei of lacking empathy, saying he ""has no social thermometer"" nor understanding for the pain of simple Argentines.    

Milei's trip to the Vatican followed a Friday meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at which the two allies signed an agreement between their respective partially state-owned energy companies ENI and YPF.

The US news channel reported that the soldiers began assembling at in front of the Hall of Justice, just next to Los Angeles city hall. ABC7 also reported that the troops drove through the neighborhood of Paramount, in the southen part of the city.

Paramount was the scene of clashes between federal agents and protesters, with tear gas deployed. 

US President Donald Trump bypassed California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy the state's National Guard troops, assuming federal control in a rare move that overrides typical state oversight.

Governors usually command their state National Guard units, but Trump invoked federal authority to take direct control of California's forces.

Newsom criticized the decision as ""purposefully inflammatory,"" warning that it would only escalate tensions. The Democrat later accused the federal government of seeking a spectacle and urged the public not to respond with violence.

Newsom's office said Trump federalized California's National Guard under what is known as Title 10 authority. This legal provision allows the president to assume command of a state's National Guard if ""there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.""

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law, told the Los Angeles Times that by overriding Newsom's authority, Trump ""is using the military domestically to stop dissent.""

""It certainly sends a message as to how this administration is going to respond to protests. It is very frightening to see this done,"" he added.

The New York Times reported Trump's decision marks the first time in several decades that a president has activated a state's National Guard without the state governor's request.

Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, noted that the last such instance occurred in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson deployed troops to Alabama to protect civil rights demonstrators.

DW spoke with ""The California Report"" radio host Saul Gonzalez about the current situation of unrest in the Los Angeles area. Here is what he had to say:

Protests have died down in Los Angeles County after a day of chaos, with what appeared to have been tear gas having filled the streets in Paramount and downtown Los Angeles, where protesters clashed with security officers over immigration raids.

President Trump's decision to then deploy National Guard troops was met with objections, as California Governor Gavin Newsom called the decision ""purposefully inflammatory"" and called on demonstrators to ""never use violence.""

The protests began after federal officials conducted immigration sweeps in the Los Angeles area on Friday. 

US media outlets are reporting that organizers have called for a third day of protests after a day of clashes between protesters and law enforcement officials over immigration raids in Los Angeles.

The protests pit Democratic-run Los Angeles, where census data suggests a significant portion of the population is Hispanic and foreign-born, against Trump's Republican White House, which has made cracking down on immigration a hallmark of his second term.

Shortly after President Donald Trump praised the National Guard's efforts in Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass clarified that the troops had not yet arrived.

""Just to be clear, the National Guard has not been deployed in the City of Los Angeles,"" she wrote on X.

Trump earlier praised the National Guard ""for a job well done"" only hours after activating their deployment to Los Angeles County.

According to The New York Times, Bilal Essayli, the interim US attorney for the Central District of California, said guard troops will be on the streets of Los Angeles on Sunday.

""They're going to primarily be focused on protecting federal property, so I think you can expect to see them at least in downtown LA,"" the paper quoted him as saying. 

""This [Trump] administration's sole purpose is to conduct the biggest mass deportations in the history of the United States,"" Jeanette Zanipatin, an immigration lawyer, told DW.

""We are seeing them erode all the protections and rights that people have, especially immigrants, under the Constitution,"" she said.

Speaking about the ongoing protests in Los Angeles, Zanipatin said that the Trump administration is circumventing the Constitution and not allowing people to exercise due process. 

This administration is eroding ""checks and balances between the federal branch and our court system,"" she said. 

Watch the full interview here.

US President Donald Trump thanked the National Guard ""for a job well done"" only hours after activating their deployment to Los Angeles.

But there was no confirmation on whether troops were already deployed to the area by Saturday evening.

""These Radical Left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will NOT BE TOLERATED,"" he wrote on his Truth social platform. 

He also said protesters would no longer be allowed to wear masks. ""What do these people have to hide, and why,"" Trump asked.

This comes even though many immigration officers involved in the crackdown on undocumented migrants, an operation that sparked the protests, were wearing masks to conceal their identities.

ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, recently said agents cover up to protect their families

US Attorney for California Bill Essayli said that more than a dozen 'agitators' were arrested after they impeded federal agents from carrying out law enforcement operations.

Los Angeles saw a second day of unrest Saturday as residents clashed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) federal agents and other law enforcement officials over raids on undocumented migrants. 

""We will continue to arrest anyone who interferes with federal law enforcement,"" Essayli wrote on social media. 

The protests have set Democratic-led LA, where census data shows a large Hispanic and foreign-born population, against President Donald Trump's administration, which has made immigration crackdowns a central focus.

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said ICE operations in Los Angeles resulted in the arrest of 118 immigrants.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the National Guard has been deployed previously, but only during widespread civil unrest, for example, during the upheaval associated with the 2020 protests following the murder of George Floyd, or the riots that occurred after the Rodney King verdict in 1992.

This time, clashes between Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and law enforcement have been limited to isolated areas, including the Home Depot in Paramount, a location in LA's fashion district, and the Civic Center.

The unrest was sparked when ICE officers executed search warrants at multiple locations on Friday. 

They were wearing military-style uniforms, arrived in armored trucks and other unmarked vehicles, and had their faces covered. 

""The federal government is sowing chaos so they can have an excuse to escalate. That is not the way any civilized country behaves,"" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said.

US President Donald Trump took federal control of California's state military to deploy soldiers into LA, the country's second-biggest city.

California Governor Gavin Newsom said the Trump Administration was trying to create ""a spectacle"" by deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles.

""The federal government is taking over the California National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles - not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,"" he wrote on X.

He urged demonstrators,""don't give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully.""

If you're joining us now, we're covering news about the Trump administration having mobilized resources to send National Guard troops to the LA area following growing protests over immigration raids in the area.

Trump's order came after clashes between law enforcement officers and protesters in Paramount, a city south of LA, and neighboring Compton, where a car was set on fire.

Crowds also gathered again outside federal buildings in downtown LA, including a detention center, where local police declared an unlawful assembly and began to arrest people. 

US Vice President JD Vance labeled protesters who confronted immigration agents during raids of local businesses ""insurrectionists.""

""Insurrectionists carrying foreign flags are attacking immigration enforcement officers, while one-half of America's political leadership has decided that border enforcement is evil,"" Vance wrote on X.

Another top White House official, Stephen Miller, described the protest against the federal immigration raids as an ""insurrection"" against the United States.

""An insurrection against the laws and sovereignty of the United States,"" Miller, an immigration hardliner and White House deputy chief of staff, wrote on X.

The Trump administration has not invoked the Insurrection Act, two US officials told the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity. 

The US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has warned that the Pentagon is prepared to send active duty Marines to Los Angeles, where there have been violent clashes between protesters and security forces.

The unrest began on Friday after at least 44 migrants were detained in multiple Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the city.

Hegseth's announcement that US Marines could be deployed came shortly after the White House said it was sending 2,000 National Guard troops to LA in response to the violence.

Marines are considered to be among the best trained and most elite in the US Armed Forces. They are known for amphibious landings and unconventional warfare in overseas operations.

""And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert,"" Hegseth said on X.

""The violent mob assaults on ICE and Federal Law Enforcement are designed to prevent the removal of Criminal Illegal Aliens from our soil; a dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels (aka Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and a huge NATIONAL SECURITY RISK,"" the defense secretary said.

Hegseth added that ""violence and destruction"" against federal agents and facilities would not be tolerated.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

The ship is carrying necessities including rice, flour, medical supplies, and baby formula to Gaza.

As the Madleen drew closer to Gaza on its mission to deliver desperately needed humanitarian aid to the besieged enclave, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib led a letter on Friday calling on the Trump administration to protect the Gaza Freedom Flotilla vessel and its 12 crew members.

“We write to urge you to do everything in your power to ensure the safety of the ship and its unarmed, civilian passengers and the success of their peaceful, humanitarian mission to deliver lifesaving aid,” Tlaib (D-Mich.) and 10 other progressive lawmakers wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

I'm leading a letter to the Trump Administration demanding safe passage for the @GazaFFlotilla to deliver humanitarian aid and food to Gaza. Any interception or attack on this crew is a violation of international law. pic.twitter.com/2wMyMpBveJ

The lawmakers explained that their concern for the Madleen crew-members' safety stemmed “from the Israeli government's history of using lethal military force to prevent similar aid ships from arriving in Gaza.”

In 2010, for example, Israeli commandos killed nine activists onboard the Mavi Marmara during a raid, including one U.S. citizen. A 10th crew member, who was injured, later died as well. And as recently as May, another flotilla vessel, the Conscience, was attacked by drones off of Malta.

Crew members aboard the Madleen issued a distress signal on June 4 as drones circled overhead. Responding to the current voyage, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Brig.-Gen. Effie Defrin told reporters that the “IDF is prepared to operate on all fronts, including in the maritime arena,” and said, “We will act accordingly,” as The Jerusalem Post reported.

“We must be clear: Any attack on the Madleen or its civilian crew is a clear and blatant violation of international law,” the U.S. lawmakers wrote.

The ship is carrying necessities including rice, flour, medical supplies, and baby formula to Gaza, which has endured more than 600 days of Israeli bombardment and whose 2 million people face starvation following a two-month total aid blockade imposed by Israel that was only lifted in May after international pressure. However, the amount of aid allowed to enter is still severely curtailed.

Several human rights experts and organizations agree that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza with its deadly assault, which has killed at least 61,709 people since October 2023.

Crew members on the Madleen include French- Palestinian Member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan and Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, whose presence has sparked threats from right-wing figures, including U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who wrote on social media, “Hope Greta and her friends can swim!”

Tlaib and the other lawmakers criticized those threats, writing, “This is a serious matter, and we are deeply disturbed by U.S. elected officials making threatening ‘jokes' about violence against the civilians onboard.”

They urged Rubio “to monitor the Madleen's journey and deter any such hostile actions.”

The legislators concluded the letter by drawing attention to the reason the Madleen set sail in the first place:

Above all else, we urge you to address the issue at the root of this voyage: the brutal Israeli blockade and mass starvation of the Palestinian population of Gaza. We demand an immediate end to the blockade, an immediate resumption of unfettered humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, and an immediate and lasting cease-fire. While the Trump administration and the international community fail to use their immense leverage to end this blockade, the activists on board the Madleen are an example of humanitarianism and solidarity. They deserve safety, as does the besieged population of Gaza.

In addition to Tlaib, the letter was signed by Reps. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), Jesús G. “Chuy” García (D-Ill.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Greg Casar (D-Texas), Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), Al Green (D-Texas), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.)

Other political leaders have argued that international attention is the best way to protect the Madleen and its crew.

“The activists of the Madleen are risking their own lives to highlight the horrific cruelty of the Israeli government against the Palestinians in Gaza,” wrote Irish senator Lynn Ruane. “If those seeking aid are targets, then so too are those seeking to bring that aid, so all eyes must be firmly on the Freedom Flotilla; their lives depend on it.”

On Saturday, more than 200 members of parliament from Europe signed a letter to Israel urging it to guarantee the safety of all Madleen crew members, allow the ship to enter Gaza freely and safely, allow it to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, and lift its blockade on Gaza entirely.

“The world is watching,” the European politicians wrote. “This is an opportunity to demonstrate respect for humanitarian law and human rights.”

As of Saturday, the Madleen had reached the coast of Egypt.

“We are now sailing off the Egyptian coast,” crew member and German human rights activist Yasemin Acar told Agence France-Presse. “We are all good.”

Hassan, meanwhile, called on global governments to “guarantee safe passage for the Freedom Flotilla.”

A proposed rule from the Biden administration would protect 36 million workers from the hazards of extreme heat.

In July 2024, the Biden administration proposed a rule to address heat-related illness that it claimed would protect 36 million workers.

The directive would have required companies to monitor workers for heat stress, provide them with cool-down breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas, and ensure that they were given ample water.

“The purpose of this rule is simple,” a White House official told reporters at the time. “It is to significantly reduce the number of worker-related deaths, injuries, and illnesses suffered by workers exposed to excessive heat … while simply doing their jobs.”

The rule would have represented the first federal standard aimed at regulating the increasing dangers of climate change, but it was never finalized. And now, with Donald Trump in the White House, there is very little hope that it will be implemented.

In February, Trump nominated David Keeling to head the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Keeling has yet to be confirmed, but seeing as he is a former executive for Amazon and UPS, most assume that he won't be embracing the proposed heat rule.

Keeling oversaw health and safety protocols at those companies, and, according to an investigation by The Lever's Sam Pollak, they collectively received over 300 workplace safety citations while he was in charge, which added up to $2 million in OSHA fines. The citations included multiple heat-related incidents.

Republicans aren't waiting until Keeling takes power to challenge the Biden administration's proposed regulations. On March 19, Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Michigan), chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, sent a letter to newly confirmed Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer calling for the Department of Labor (DOL) to withdraw from the rule and rescind several additional OSHA directives.

“The committee recognizes that many burdensome regulations were developed at DOL during the Biden-Harris administration,” Walberg wrote.

When the GOP-controlled committee held a hearing on May 15, the subject was OSHA's alleged “overreach” on heat regulations. The Republicans showcased testimony from a number of pro-business witnesses including Felicia Watson, senior counsel at Littler Mendelson, which backs employers and has a history of defending union-busting.

“I've talked to people in New Mexico who say 80 degrees is a great day to build — it's perfect weather and you might have something completely different in Florida,” claimed Watson.

These sentiments were echoed by another Republican witness, Jake Parson, an executive at a building materials company who testified on behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers. Parson told the Congress members that, “When it comes to heat, what makes sense for Maine will not make sense for Texas.”

“OSHA standards are the bare minimum when it comes to workplace safety. Any lawmaker who wants to undo them just wants their billionaire backers to make another cent.”

Both witnesses were challenged by Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), a committee member who went on a thirst strike in 2023 to highlight the need for a federal workplace heat standard.

“It sounds like what you're saying is we have different conditions in Maine than in Texas,” said Casar. “But what I'm confused about is if it's 90 degrees in Austin or 90 degrees in Maine, 90 degrees is still 90 degrees.”

Without strong guidelines at the federal level, workers have to rely on the rules of their state.

California, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington have all adopted workplace heat protections of some kind and similar efforts are being pushed Arizona, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island.

“Policymakers don't have to start from scratch,” notes a recent report from the Center on American Progress. “Current state policies and the Biden administration's draft heat standard provide guidance for adopting or adapting occupational heat standards and can strengthen protections for outdoor and indoor workers.”

This fight has proved to be an uphill battle in states run by anti-regulation Republicans.

In April 2024, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation barring Florida localities from requiring companies to provide outdoor workers with rest, shade, and water. The move effectively killed a Miami-Dade effort to establish such protections in the county.

At a press conference, DeSantis admitted that the GOP plan was developed to invalidate the Miami victory.

“There was a lot of concern out of one county, Miami-Dade. And I don't think it was an issue in any other part of the state,” the governor explained. “I think they were pursuing something that was going to cause a lot of problems down there.”

Labor advocates in Austin faced a similar setback in 2024, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott passed the “Death Star” law, killing a rest-break ordinance passed by the city.

Texas AFL-CIO Organizing and Advocacy Director Ana Gonzalez told Truthout that such developments highlight the need to build bargaining power in the workplace.

“OSHA standards are the bare minimum when it comes to workplace safety. Any lawmaker who wants to undo them just wants their billionaire backers to make another cent,” said Gonzalez. “Texans have weathered worse storms, but with hotter summers, we must unionize every workplace to demand better safety standards. Otherwise, our state will keep leading the nation in workplace fatalities and injuries.”

The Trump administration's war on workplace safety, is certainly not limited to heat regulations.

President Trump has effectively shut down the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, closed multiple local OSHA offices, allowed Elon Musk's “Department of Government Efficiency” initiative to access sensitive OSHA files, and paused a rule on silica exposure, which can lead to severe health problems such as lung cancer.

A recent report from the Economic Policy Institute points out that between 5.2 million to 7.8 million workers already suffer work-related injuries and illnesses each year, a number that is likely to rise under the Trump administration.

The consumer rights group Public Citizen estimates that heat exposure results in 600 to 2,000 worker fatalities every year.

The report also notes out that weakened workplace regulations disproportionately impact workers of color, immigrant workers, and older workers. Over 33 percent of 2023's workplace fatalities occurred among workers 55 and older, while 67 percent of those killed were immigrant workers. Black and Latino workers are more likely to die while working than white workers.

“The bad news is we are facing a national workers' rights crisis, fueled by Trump administration attacks on long-standing worker health and safety protections and OSHA enforcement capacity, all while climate change is intensifying risks of deadly exposures to extreme heat in indoor and outdoor workplaces across the country,” the report's coauthor, Jennifer Sherer, told Truthout.

“The good news is that states don't need to wait to act, and can craft strong, effective heat standard policies that draw on decades of research and evidence-based best practices for preventing workplace deaths and boosting productivity,” she added.

The consumer rights group Public Citizen estimates that heat exposure results in 600 to 2,000 worker fatalities every year, and about 170,000 work injuries. The situation threatens to get much worse as temperatures rise as a result of climate change — 2024 was the warmest year on record. According to the World Meteorological Organization, there's an 80 percent chance that at least one of the next five years will exceed that mark.

A KFF Health Tracking Poll shows anxiety is high about looming Medicaid cuts among voters across the political spectrum.

New survey data out Friday shows that Republicans are wrong if they remain unconcerned about public sentiment as it relates to the evisceration of Medicaid or healthcare support systems that would result from passage of their colossal legislation now making its way through Congress — a bill that, if passed, would see coverage stripped from an estimated 11-16 million people in the coming years.

According to new KFF Health Tracking Poll released Friday, anxiety is high among voters, across the political spectrum, about the negative impacts resulting from cuts to Medicaid or reductions in support for marketplace insurance plans supported by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

“Most of the public is worried about the consequences of significant reductions in federal Medicaid spending, including among many groups that would be directly impacted by the cuts,” KFF noted in its release of the new survey data. “Partisanship drives these attitudes to a certain extent, but about two-thirds or more of Republicans enrolled in Medicaid and those with lower incomes are worried that Medicaid spending reductions would hurt their families and their communities.”

KFF added that most adults in the country, based on the poll's findings, “are worried significant reductions in federal Medicaid spending will lead to more uninsured people and will strain healthcare providers in their communities. About 7 in 10 adults (72%) are worried that a significant reduction in federal funding for Medicaid would lead to an increase in the share of uninsured children and adults in the U.S., including nearly half (46%) who are ‘very worried' and 1 in 4 (25%) who are ‘somewhat worried.'”

CBO estimates that the House-passed budget bill would decrease federal spending by $793B and result in more than 10 million people losing Medicaid coverage.  Our latest poll explores the views of those who could be most directly impacted: https://t.co/uZhxbQqVcb pic.twitter.com/aWT69z4Yjf

KFF notes that more than a quarter of Medicaid enrollees in the country are Republican, including 1 in 5 who identify with President Donald Trump's far-right MAGA movement. At the same time, nearly half of likely ACA marketplace enrollees identify as Republican.

16 million Americans losing health coverage.The biggest cut to Medicaid in history.Higher health, energy, and housing costs.Tax cuts for billionaires, tax hikes for working people.$3 trillion added to the national debt.The Republican bill is a “disgusting abomination.”

The new poll results, as The Washington Post notes:

The findings illustrate the political perils of upending the public health insurance program as Senate Republicans feud over Medicaid cuts. As they face pressure to slash spending to finance President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and immigration legislation, they risk alienating their own supporters who depend on the program.

“Medicaid is really a popular program, and a large majority of Americans do not want to see decreases in spending,” Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at KFF, told the Post. “These findings reflect that many people, whether or not they rely on Medicaid, see it as vital to their communities.”

Tony Carrk, executive director of the progressive watchdog group Accountable.US, said Friday that Republicans in the Senate would be wise to stick to their public promises that Medicaid would not be cut or harmed, specifically referencing Sens. Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt of Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

“Now is the time for these Senators to practice what they preach,” said Caark. “A vote for the current bill is a vote to take away their constituents' healthcare—full stop.”

“If these senators do the right thing, they will save the healthcare of millions of people from Alaska to Maine,” he added. “But if they throw their support behind this bill, not only will they have lied to the American people, they will be ripping healthcare from those who need it the most, while the richest Americans — including many of them — could financially benefit.”

Last week, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) sparked fury when she said at a town hall, in response to a constituent warning that “people will die” if Medicaid cuts went through, that “we all are going to die.”

On Capitol Hill this week, the advocacy group Social Security Works tried to catch up with Ernst about the comments, but she would not respond to questions.

We asked Republican @SenJoniErnst from Iowa what her response was to 51,000 more Americans dying every year due to the GOP plan to cut Medicaid in the big, beautiful betrayal.She ran away from us– with a smile on her face.Who thinks she should lose her job? pic.twitter.com/Q8cBEk3XXL

“By the way,” the group later posted, “Iowans are PISSED about sacrificing their Medicaid for a billionaire tax handout” and pointed to a local protest in Ernst's home state where community members rallied against cuts.

Citing a new study showing that more than 50,000 people a year will die prematurely if the Medicaid cuts proposed by Republicans goes through, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), said, “In the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires. As the Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I will be doing everything that I can to see that this disastrous bill is defeated.”

CNN national security analyst and former DHS official Juliette Kayyem warns that Trump's National Guard deployment is ""quite extreme"" and could escalate tensions rather than ease unrest.

            • LA deployment: About 300 National Guardsmen are deployed at three locations around Los Angeles, the California governor's office said this morning. It follows a presidential memorandum signed by President Donald Trump Saturday, sending 2,000 National Guardsmen to disperse protests sparked by immigration raids.
    


• Immigration crackdown: Immigration authorities and demonstrators have clashed for two days in the Los Angeles area, with unrest beginning Friday after dozens of people were detained by federal immigration agents across different locations.
    


            • Top officials gather: Trump is expected to meet with senior members of his administration today at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to two sources.
    


            The Los Angeles Police Department denied an allegation made by the ACLU that its officers had “assisted federal agents in terrorizing L.A. neighborhoods,” describing the claim as “both inflammatory and demonstrably false.”
    


            Andres Kwon, attorney and senior policy counsel at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, had said in a statement that “city leaders broke their promise” and LAPD officers had assisted federal agents, “impeding people from going to work, making their immigration court appearances, or attending their children's graduations.”
    


            In response, the police department told CNN today:
    


                    “To be clear, the LAPD does not participate in immigration enforcement operations and was not made aware in advance of the federal activity referenced. When a request for assistance was made by federal authorities, the LAPD responded to ensure the safety of all individuals involved—residents, demonstrators, and law enforcement alike.“Our Department's role was limited, measured, and guided by our responsibility to ensure public safety and restore order—not to support immigration enforcement. At no time did the LAPD impede anyone from accessing work, court, or public events.“The LAPD will always respond immediately to all requests for assistance from other law enforcement agencies whether they be local, state or Federal. The LAPD has, and will continue, to support our law enforcement partners immediately upon request.”
                





            Members of the Northern Command of the National Guard are on the ground in Los Angeles after President Donald Trump deployed them in response to immigration enforcement action protests that broke out Friday.
    


Here's what to know this morning:



CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas, Kaitlin Collins, Michelle Watson, Gregory Clary, Antoinette Radford and Kit Maher contributed reporting.  



            The Fair Immigration Reform Movement condemned what it characterized as “the Trump administration's increasingly authoritarian and violent campaign against immigrant communities and the people of the United States” in a news release this morning.
    


                    “We are workers, neighbors, students, parents — people who contribute to and sustain California's economy and future,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights. “The real crisis is the deliberate escalation by federal immigration authorities — and the effort to shift blame onto communities who are responding to fear, grief, and injustice.”
                





            The Fair Immigration Reform Movement's co-chair and president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition Murad Awawdeh also condemned the law enforcement response to the California protests.
    


            “Donald Trump is waging an all-out war against our communities and our democracy,” said Awawdeh in the release. “The coordinated assault on immigrants — raiding homes, stalking people in courthouses, and targeting children at school — now expands into a terrifying threat to use military force against lawful protestors. This action does nothing but incite fear and chaos, while exerting control through the threat of violence.”
    


            The US Northern Command said members of the California 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team are now on the ground in Los Angeles.
    


            President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum last night deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to disperse protests that began in response to immigration raids on Friday.
    


            “Additional information will be provided as units are identified and deployed,” NORTHCOM said in a social media post.



            Separately, the California governor's office said in a statement that 300 National Guardsmen were “deployed between 0200-0400 Sunday at three sites around Los Angeles.”
    


            President Trump's federalization of National Guard troops to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles on Saturday marks the first time a US chief executive has used such power since the 1992 LA riots in reaction to the acquittal of four White police officers in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King.
    


            Dozens of people were killed, thousands injured and thousands arrested during several days of rioting in Los Angeles at the time. Damage to property was estimated at more than $1 billion, in one of the worst civil disturbances in US history.
    


            Other federal mobilizations of the National Guard since World War II were made to support enforcement of the expansion of civil rights and ensure public order during the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957; the University of Mississippi in 1962; the University of Alabama and Alabama public schools in 1963, according to the National Guard's website.
    


            Guard units also came under federal control to restore public order during the Detroit riots in 1967, in response to the assassination of civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 and the New York postal strike in 1970, according to the Guard's website.
    


            Presidential mobilization of state militias was first authorized by Congress in 1792, in that case to help repel foreign invasions and suppress domestic insurrections, the website says.
    


            The biggest ever federalization of state militias was made by President Abraham Lincoln, when he called up 75,000 troops to fight the Confederacy and later support Reconstruction.
    


            After that, no president federalized state militias until the Detroit riots, according to the website.
    


Key difference: Unlike Trump's federalization of National Guard troops this weekend, the 1992 mobilization was requested by then-California Gov. Pete Wilson. Now, Gov. Gavin Newsom has called the deployment of National Guard troops to the LA immigration protests “purposefully inflammatory.”
    


George Floyd protests: The National Guard was also deployed in Los Angeles in 2020, but at the request of Newsom, not the president. According to The Associated Press, 5,500 National Guard soldiers were mobilized in Los Angeles County in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom called President Donald Trump on Friday and they spoke for approximately 40 minutes, according to the governor's office.
    


            The call took place after the widescale immigration enforcement began in Los Angeles, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN.
    


            Trump has signed a presidential memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to disperse protests that began in response to the immigration raids. California Gov. Gavin Newsom in a post on X Saturday night called the deployment “purposefully inflammatory” and warned it would only escalate tensions.
    


            About 300 members of the California National Guard are currently at three locations in the Los Angeles area, according to a statement from the governor's office.
    


            The US Secretary of Homeland Security said National Guard soldiers are in Los Angeles to maintain peace amid ongoing tensions between immigration authorities and demonstrators this weekend.
    


            “These 2,000 National Guard soldiers that are being engaged today are ones that are specifically trained for this type of crowd situation,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on CBS's “Face the Nation” Sunday.
    


            Noem said the soldiers are there to “provide security for operations and to make sure that we have peaceful protests,” but did not provide specifics about their activities on the ground.
    


            Noem criticized Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and the LAPD for their response to this weekend's protests against immigration operations in the area.
    


            “We're not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen,” she said, referencing the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in Minneapolis during the summer of 2020.
    


            When asked about claims that migrants are being held in makeshift facilities with limited access to food and water, Noem did not directly address the question.
    


            “What I would say is getting individuals in and out of those facilities was extremely challenging when the violence broke out, and when things were being thrown at vehicles and people were rocking vehicles and shaking them, trying to break into them,” she said.
    


            Multiple people have been arrested in Los Angeles and New York as authorities crack down on people obstructing immigration enforcement activities, Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino said today.
    


Posting to social media, Bongino said those arrested face federal, local and state charges.
    


             “It will not end well for you if you choose violence. Choose wisely.”
    


            His comments come after President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum last night deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to disperse protests that began in response to immigration raids.
    


            About 300 members of the California National Guard are currently in Los Angeles following two consecutive days of protests over immigration enforcement action, Izzy Gardon, Director of Communications for Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN in an email Sunday.
    


                    “There are approximately 300 California National Guard in Los Angeles currently. They were deployed between 0200-0400 Sunday at three sites around Los Angeles,” Gardon said.
                





            As President Donald Trump and his administration make the push to advance his domestic agenda, tensions with Elon Musk continue to make headlines.
    


Here's the latest from the Sunday morning political shows:



            Americans largely approve of President Donald Trump's program to find and deport immigrants who are in the US illegally but they are not sold on the way he's carrying it out, according to a new poll from CBS News and YouGov.
    


            The poll was completed just before protests over deportations in Los Angeles. Some other key findings include:
    


            Overall, Trump's approval rating has held steady in CBS's trends since the 100-day mark of his presidency – 45% approve and 55% disapprove. CBS/YouGov has typically found approval ratings for the president that are a few points higher than other high-quality polls. On average across polls that meet CNN's standards for reporting since early May, 43% approve of Trump's handling of the presidency.
    


            The CBS News/YouGov poll was conducted online from June 4 through 6 among a random national sample of 2,428 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.
    


            Protests in response to immigration raids escalated Saturday in and around Los Angeles. In Paramount, California, tear gas and flash bangs were used to disperse demonstrations.
    


            Democratic Rep. Nanette Barragán said she has been told to prepare for a large presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in California.
    


            “We've been told to get ready for 30 days of enforcement. Thirty days of ICE enforcement,” she told CNN's Dana Bash today, adding that the presence of National Guardmen is “going to escalate the situation.”
    


            President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum last night deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to disperse protests that began in response to immigration raids, including in the city of Paramount, which is in Barragán's constituency.
    


                    “We haven't asked for the help. We don't need the help. This is him escalating it, causing tensions to rise. It's only going to make things worse in a situation where people are already angry over immigration enforcement,” she said.
                





            When asked about the LA County Sheriff's office describing protesters as “exhibiting violent behaviour towards federal agents and deputy sheriffs” the congresswoman had a clear message: “Don't get violent.”
    


            But, she said the violence was not coming from anti-immigration protesters.
    


            “Last night, when I talked to the sheriff, he had told me the situation in Paramount was under control, the people that were peacefully protest have left. The situation was now across the street into the Compton area and this was the unruly folks — that Saturday night crowd — the people that were there to actually protest immigration were gone.
    


            “We agree that if you're being violent, you should be arrested, you should be prosecuted,” she said.
    


            The Los Angeles Police Department said protests in the city last night were peaceful.
    


                    “While today's events concluded without incident, the Los Angeles Police Department remains fully prepared to respond swiftly and appropriately to any potential acts of civil unrest,” the LAPD said in a statement.
                





            President Donald Trump has signed off on the deployment of 2,000 National Guardsman to Los Angeles, though Mayor Karen Bass said there was no evidence of the National Guard on the ground yet.
    


            “We will maintain a heightened readiness posture and remain ready to ensure the continued safety of our communities,” the LAPD said.
    


Reminder: The LAPD does not have jurisdiction over Paramount, a city in Los Angeles County, where protesters exhibited “violent behavior towards federal agents and deputy sheriffs,” the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said in an advisory late Saturday.
    


            Protests have gripped Los Angeles this weekend, sparked in response to immigration raids carried out on Friday.
    


Here's what to know about the demonstrations:



Why did they start? Protests in and around Los Angeles erupted on Friday after at least 44 people were arrested by federal immigration agents earlier in the day. The arrests come amid Trump's crackdown on immigration, which has involved waves of raids and deportations across the country. Late into Saturday, some protesters gathered near an immigration holding center in Alameda.



What happened on Saturday? Law enforcement used tear gas and flash bangs in an effort to disperse the crowd in Paramount, California, and some protesters were detained. But the situation escalated when President Donald Trump said he was deploying 2,000 members of the National Guard to control protesters in the evening. Trump claimed local officials had failed to deal with the unrest, and the federal government would “solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!”
    


How are people responding to the National Guard? California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the deployment of troops “purposefully inflammatory” and said it would only escalate tensions. The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, said there was no evidence of the National Guard on the ground, despite Trump praising their efforts. And the League of United Latin American Citizens also condemned Trump's order, saying that the move “marks a deeply troubling escalation in the administration's approach to immigration and civilian reaction to the use of military-style tactics.”
    


The latest from the ground: Small groups of protesters continued to gather and disrupt traffic near the Metropolitan Detention Center in Alameda late Saturday, despite repeated warnings from police to disperse. At midnight, the LAPD announced several people who re-entered areas of “unlawful assembly” have been detained and some will be “arrested and booked.” It is unclear how many people were detained.
    


            The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department told CNN some remaining protesters threw fireworks at law enforcement, while officers formed a skirmish line to push people away from the area.
    


            President Donald Trump said early today he would ban the use of masks by protesters, after two days of unrest in Los Angeles.
    


            “MASKS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED to be worn at protests. What do these people have to hide, and why???” the president posted on Truth Social.
    


            ICE officers are allowed to wear masks, however, with the agency's acting director Todd Lyons saying recently the agents cover up to protect their families.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to meet with senior members of his administration today at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to two sources.
    


            “The White House has organized what will become a regular off campus retreat of principals attended by the President and Vice President,” a White House official said.
    


            They'll meet on a number of issues and topics, the official said.
    


            Attendees are expected to include Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, according to another person familiar with the meeting.
    


            Trump is expected to stay at Camp David tonight and return to the White House tomorrow, according to the White House official.

How a manhunt for a father accused of killing his 3 daughters is unfolding","https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/08/us/travis-decker-daughters-washington-manhunt","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","


            The last time Whitney Decker saw her three daughters, she gave them each a hug and kiss goodbye, not realizing it would be the last time she saw them alive.
    


            The sisters, 5-year-old Olivia, 8-year-old Evelyn and 9-year-old Paityn Decker, were found suffocated to death at an abandoned campsite in Washington state on Monday, police said, sparking an intense manhunt for their father, Travis Decker.



            Whitney had handed the girls over to Decker, 32, for their regularly scheduled custody visit on May 30, the Friday before the devastating discovery. Though the couple had been divorced for several years, they maintained communication as co-parents and friends, her attorney Arianna Cozart told CNN.
    


            “We'll see you at eight,” he last told Whitney, Cozart said. Whitney noticed he was quieter than usual, but the exchange took place without any problems, and she didn't think much of it – until the sun slipped behind the hills, dusk spilling across the sky, and the girls still weren't home.
    


            Decker wasn't supposed to keep his daughters out after 8 p.m. and their custody plan specified no overnight visits, Whitney told the Wenatchee police when she reported the girls missing.
    


            His phone was going straight to voicemail, she told police.
    


            The mother appeared to have been crying when she arrived at the police station, police said, telling them Decker “has never failed to return the kids” and typically lets her know when he is running late, according to a police affidavit filed in the Chelan County Superior Court.
    


            Whitney told police that while he had a “good relationship” with his daughters and they enjoyed their time together, she believed he was experiencing mental health issues, according to the affidavit.
    


            “But he never displayed any sort of ‘red flags' to Whitney,” Cozart said.
    


            After speaking with Whitney, police checked the hotels and motels in Wenatchee as well as the camping roster at the state park, and then the wider area. Decker's name was not listed anywhere.
    


            The Wenatchee Police Department requested the Washington State Patrol issue an Amber Alert the day the girls went missing, but because “there was no current evidence” the girls were at risk of serious injury or death, an alert was not issued, according to the police affidavit.
    


            The following day, when Decker and the girls did not show up to a running event scheduled at the park, police provided more information to the Washington State Patrol, which then issued an Endangered Missing Person Alert, seeking the community's help in locating Olivia, Evelyn and Paityn.
    


            Their disappearance kicked off an intensive search that grew as friends, family and volunteers came out to look for the girls. Then, on Monday the father's pickup truck was found unoccupied at a Chelan County campground with two bloody handprints on the tailgate, according to the affidavit.
    


            The girls' bodies were about 75 yards away, down a small embankment.
    


            Authorities are now searching by land and air for Travis Decker – wanted for three counts each of murder and kidnapping – across the county, sweeping through local forests and wilderness areas, according to the Chelan County Sheriff's office.
    


            Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Saturday announced he's tapping emergency funds and ordering Washington National Guard resources to support the multi-agency search for Travis Decker, warning area residents to keep their doors and windows locked and to avoid restricted areas.
    


            Meanwhile, a portrait of Travis Decker is emerging: an Army veteran and National Guardsman experiencing homelessness, skilled in wilderness survival, an involved father and, according to his ex-wife, a man struggling with mental health issues.
    


            Nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Range, Wenatchee lies between Seattle and Spokane, where rugged peaks give way to rolling orchards and breathtaking views of the Columbia River as it winds through the valley – a scenic view now punctured by tragedy.
    


            The sisters were found about 30 minutes northwest, in the Wenatchee River Ranger district, a remote, mountainous region of Washington that encompasses approximately 696,000 acres. The girls had plastic bags over their heads, and their wrists were zip-tied, according to police.
    


            The discovery of their bodies triggered a closure of the Enchantments, an area popular for backcountry hiking and camping, as law enforcement combs the forest for any signs of the tattooed Army veteran. Authorities have released photos and a video clip of Travis Decker from the days before his custody visit with the girls. He was last seen wearing a light-colored shirt and dark shorts and had his dark hair pulled back into a ponytail.
    


            Decker is “well versed in wilderness survival and capable of spending days or even weeks in the wilderness on his own and with very little equipment” which will likely make the search more difficult, the sheriff's office said in a news release on Wednesday.
    


            The former military member also has “extensive tactical training,” according to the US Marshals, which is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to Decker's arrest.
    


Doorbell camera shows wanted father days before his daughters were found dead



            Travis Decker is a former US Army infantryman and staff sergeant with eight years of service, including five months in Afghanistan, according to a US Army spokesperson. He is currently a member of the Washington National Guard but is in the midst of a disciplinary process of being discharged because of missed drills, the National Guard confirmed to CNN.
    


            As the manhunt continues, the sheriff's office has advised residents in neighboring counties to lock their doors, including on outbuildings and sheds, and leave their outdoor lights on and their blinds open.
    


            Travis Decker was experiencing homelessness, living in his car, motels or camping locally, his ex-wife told police. His dog and daughters “are the two big positives in his life,” she said, according to the affidavit.
    


            “He was very active with their extracurricular activities, their dance, their soccer games, all of those things. He was very involved,” Cozart said.
    


            But there were concerns. Whitney told police that near the end of their marriage, her ex-husband was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and she did not think he was taking his medication, according to the police affidavit.
    


            In September 2024, a judge granted Whitney and Decker a parenting plan with limitations after an incident in which Decker kept the girls overnight at a homeless shelter and allowed them to go to a corner store unsupervised, according to Cozart.
    


            The new parenting plan included a psychiatric evaluation for Travis Decker, mandatory mental health counseling, and a domestic violence evaluation, according to court documents. He was permitted to see the children every other weekend.
    


            Travis Decker had “displayed some volatile behaviors that seemed concerning towards Whitney, never towards the girls,” Cozart said.
    


            His ex-wife believes the tragedy may have been prevented if Travis Decker had better access to mental health support as a veteran, Cozart said, pointing to well-documented barriers to accessing adequate resources for veterans struggling with issues including post-traumatic disorder.
    


            Central WA Veterans Counseling, a local agency serving veterans, believes that if Travis Decker had sought their help, he would have been redirected elsewhere or placed on a waitlist due to a lack of funding and a shortage of alternative resources to adequately support veterans in the region.
    


            “This isn't a hidden crisis—we've been vocal about it in the media and with local, state, and federal officials,” the group said in a statement.
    


            It's unclear whether Travis Decker was seeking help for the mental health issues outlined in the police report. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Veterans Affairs for information.
    


            The flag at the Chelan County Courthouse now flies at half-staff in memory of Olivia, Evelyn and Paityn.
    


            The killings of the three sisters – remembered by loved ones and in their community as beacons of light and joy – have deeply impacted Wenatchee and touched the hearts of parents across the country.
    


            “Whitney is living every mother's worst nightmare. The hole in her heart is immeasurable. There are no words that can capture the weight of this loss. Right now, she is surrounded by friends, family, and neighbors doing everything they can to hold her up,” Amy Edwards, a friend of Whitney's, said in part in a statement released through Cozart.
    


            She remembered Olivia, Paityn and Evelyn as performers and dancers and said, “their laughter, curiosity, and spirit left a mark on all of us.”
    


            “They were the kind of children everyone rooted for, looked forward to seeing, and held close in their hearts. They are cherished - not just by their family, but by an entire community who watched them grow, perform, learn, and love. We ache with the love we still carry for them - and always will.”
    


            A GoFundMe launched by Edwards has raised more than $1.1 million as of Sunday to support Whitney through the loss.
    


            “We are heartbroken by the loss of three of our shining stars from the Short Shakespeareans family,” the Music Theatre of Wenatchee said in a statement.
    


            “Their joy, creativity, and spirit lit up our stage and our hearts. Though their time with us was far too short, their impact will forever be part of our story. May their light continue to shine in every performance we give. We carry them with us—always.”

            “My heart, and the hearts of the entire Wenatchee School District leadership, remain with the Decker family, the Lincoln Elementary community, and all who knew and loved these precious girls,” district superintendent Kory Kalahar said in a statement. “Every school, every classroom, and every family within our district may be touched by this tragedy in some way.
    


            As the community grieves, no sorrow runs deeper than Whitney's – a mother devastated by unimaginable loss yet determined to ensure that her daughters are known for the light, laughter, and love they brought into the world.
    


            “The girls were amazing little humans,” Cozart said. “I know Whitney wants the world to remember them that way.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — National Guard troops began arriving in Los Angeles early Sunday on orders from President Donald Trump in response to clashes in recent days between federal immigration authorities and protesters seeking to block them from carrying out deportations.

Members of California's National Guard were seen staging at the federal complex in downtown Los Angeles that includes the Metropolitan Detention Center, one of several sites that have drawn confrontations involving hundreds of people in the last two days.

Trump has said he is deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell the protests, which he called “a form of rebellion.”

The move came over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom, marking the first time in decades that a state's national guard was activated without a request from its governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

Early Sunday, the deployment was limited to a small area in downtown Los Angeles, with the rest of the city of 4 million people largely unaffected. 

Their arrival follows two days of relatively small protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.

As federal agents staged near a Home Depot in Paramount, demonstrators sought to block Border Patrol vehicles, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, federal agents in riot gear unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls.




Tensions were high after a series of sweeps by immigration authorities the previous day, as the weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the city climbed past 100. A prominent union leader was arrested while protesting and accused of impeding law enforcement.

Newsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor's office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday.

On Sunday morning, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the National Guard would “keep peace and allow people to be able to protest but also to keep law and order.” 

The troops included members of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to a social media post from the Department of Defense that showed dozens of National Guard members with long guns and an armored vehicle. 

In a signal of the administration's aggressive approach, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened to deploy active-duty Marines “if violence continues” in the region.

Newsom, a Democrat, described Trump's decision to call in the National Guard as a “provocative show of force” that would only escalate tensions, adding that Hegseth's threat to deploy Marines on American soil was “deranged behavior.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said the order by Trump reflected “a president moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism” and “usurping the powers of the United States Congress.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, endorsed the president's move, doubling down on Republicans' criticisms of California Democrats.

“Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or an unwillingness to do what is necessary, so the president stepped in,” Johnson said on ABC “This Week.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's intelligence minister claimed without offering evidence Sunday that Tehran seized an “important treasury” of information regarding Israel's nuclear program, ahead of a week in which the Islamic Republic likely will face new diplomatic pressure over its own program. 

The remarks by Esmail Khatib follow Iranian state television claiming Saturday that Iranian intelligence officials seized documents, again without any evidence. Israel, whose undeclared atomic weapons program makes it the only country in the Mideast with nuclear bombs, has not acknowledged any such Iranian operation targeting it — though there have been arrests of Israelis allegedly spying for Tehran amid the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. 

Iran, meanwhile, will likely face censure this week from the Board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency over longstanding questions about its program. Iran has also signaled it will reject a proposal from the United States after five rounds of negotiations over its nuclear program — setting the stage for that long-running crisis to potentially spike as well. 




Responding to questions from an Iranian state TV reporter Sunday after a Cabinet meeting, Khatib said members of the Intelligence Ministry “achieved an important treasury of strategic, operational and scientific intelligence of the Zionist regime and it was transferred into the country with God's help.” 

He claimed thousands of pages of documents had been obtained and insisted they would be made public soon. Among them were documents related to the U.S., Europe and other countries, he claimed, obtained through “infiltration” and “access to the sources.”

He did not elaborate on the methods used. However, Khatib, a Shiite cleric, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2022 over directing “cyber espionage and ransomware attacks in support of Iran's political goals.” 

For Iran, the claim may be designed to show the public that the theocracy was able to respond to a 2018 Israeli operation that spirited out what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as a “half ton” of documents related to Iran's program. That Israeli announcement came just before President Donald Trump in his first term unilaterally withdrew America from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which greatly limited its program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. 

This week, Western nations are expect to go before the IAEA's Board of Governors with a proposal to find Iran in noncompliance with the United Nations' nuclear watchdog. It could be the first time in decades — and likely would kick the issue to the U.N. Security Council. 

That could see one of the Western countries involved in the 2015 nuclear deal invoke the so-called “snapback” of U.N. sanctions on the Islamic Republic. The authority to reestablish those sanctions by the complaint of any member of the original 2015 nuclear deal expires in October — putting the West on a clock to exert pressure on Tehran over its program before losing that power. 

Iran now enriches uranium up to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Tehran has enough highly enriched uranium to build multiple atomic bombs should it choose to do so. 

Without a deal with the U.S., Iran's long-ailing economy could enter a freefall that could worsen the simmering unrest at home. Israel or the U.S. might carry out long-threatened airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities. Experts fear Tehran in response could decide to fully end its cooperation with the IAEA and rush toward a bomb.

BEIJING (AP) — U.S.-China trade talks in London this week are expected to take up a series of fresh disputes that have buffeted relations, threatening a fragile truce over tariffs.

Both sides agreed in Geneva last month to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of recession.

Since then, the U.S. and China have exchanged angry words over advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence, “rare earths” that are vital to carmakers and other industries, and visas for Chinese students at American universities.

President Donald Trump spoke at length with Chinese leader Xi Jinping by phone last Thursday in an attempt to put relations back on track. Trump announced on social media the next day that trade talks would be held on Monday in London. 

The latest frictions began just a day after the May 12 announcement of the Geneva agreement to “pause” tariffs for 90 days.

The U.S. Commerce Department issued guidance saying the use of Ascend AI chips from Huawei, a leading Chinese tech company, could violate U.S. export controls. That's because the chips were likely developed with American technology despite restrictions on its export to China, the guidance said.

The Chinese government wasn't pleased. One of its biggest beefs in recent years has been over U.S. moves to limit the access of Chinese companies to technology, and in particular to equipment and processes needed to produce the most advanced semiconductors.

“The Chinese side urges the U.S. side to immediately correct its erroneous practices,” a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wasn't in Geneva but will join the talks in London. Analysts say that suggests at least a willingness on the U.S. side to hear out China's concerns on export controls.

One area where China holds the upper hand is in the mining and processing of rare earths. They are crucial for not only autos but also a range of other products from robots to military equipment.

The Chinese government started requiring producers to obtain a license to export seven rare earth elements in April. Resulting shortages sent automakers worldwide into a tizzy. As stockpiles ran down, some worried they would have to halt production.

Trump, without mentioning rare earths specifically, took to social media to attack China.

“The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” Trump posted on May 30.

The Chinese government indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well. A Commerce Ministry statement said it had granted some approvals and “will continue to strengthen the approval of applications that comply with regulations.”

The scramble to resolve the rare earth issue shows that China has a strong card to play if it wants to strike back against tariffs or other measures.

Student visas don't normally figure in trade talks, but a U.S. announcement that it would begin revoking the visas of some Chinese students has emerged as another thorn in the relationship.

China's Commerce Ministry raised the issue when asked last week about the accusation that it had violated the consensus reached in Geneva.

It replied that the U.S. had undermined the agreement by issuing export control guidelines for AI chips, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and saying it would revoke Chinese student visas.




“The United States has unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a May 28 statement that the United States would “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”

More than 270,000 Chinese students studied in the U.S. in the 2023-24 academic year.

President Donald Trump says he's deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to immigration protests, over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. 

It's not the first time Trump has activated the National Guard to quell protests. In 2020, he asked governors of several states to send troops to Washington, D.C. to respond to demonstrations that arose after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers. Many of the governors he asked agreed, sending troops to the federal district. The governors that refused the request were allowed to do so, keeping their troops on home soil.

This time, however, Trump is acting in opposition to Newsom, who under normal circumstances would retain control and command of California's National Guard. While Trump said that federalizing the troops was necessary to “address the lawlessness” in California, the Democratic governor said the move was “purposely inflammatory and will only escalate tensions.” 

Here are some things to know about when and how the president can deploy troops on U.S. soil. 




Generally, federal military forces are not allowed to carry out civilian law enforcement duties against U.S. citizens except in times of emergency. 

An 18th-century wartime law called the Insurrection Act is the main legal mechanism that a president can use to activate the military or National Guard during times of rebellion or unrest. But Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act on Saturday. 

Instead, he relied on a similar federal law that allows the president to federalize National Guard troops under certain circumstances. 

The National Guard is a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. Often it operates under state command and control, using state funding. Sometimes National Guard troops will be assigned by their state to serve federal missions, remaining under state command but using federal funding. 

The law cited by Trump's proclamation places National Guard troops under federal command. The law says that can be done under three circumstances: When the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion; when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the U.S. government, or when the President is unable to “execute the laws of the United States,” with regular forces.

But the law also says that orders for those purposes “shall be issued through the governors of the States.” It's not immediately clear if the president can activate National Guard troops without the order of that state's governor. 

Notably, Trump's proclamation says the National Guard troops will play a supporting role by protecting ICE officers as they enforce the law, rather than having the troops perform law enforcement work.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in military justice and national security law, says that's because the National Guard troops can't legally engage in ordinary law enforcement activities unless Trump first invokes the Insurrection Act.

Vladeck said the move raises the risk that the troops could end up using force while filling that “protection” role. The move could also be a precursor to other, more aggressive troop deployments down the road, he wrote on his website.

“There's nothing these troops will be allowed to do that, for example, the ICE officers against whom these protests have been directed could not do themselves,” Vladeck wrote.

The Insurrection Act and related laws were used during the Civil Rights era to protect activists and students desegregating schools. President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black students integrating Central High School after that state's governor activated the National Guard to keep the students out.

George H.W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to respond to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King.

National Guard troops have been deployed for a variety of emergencies, including the COVID pandemic, hurricanes and other natural disasters. But generally, those deployments are carried out with the agreements of the governors of the responding states. 

In 2020, Trump asked governors of several states to deploy their National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to quell protests that arose after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers. Many of the governors agreed, sending troops to the federal district.

At the time, Trump also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd's death in Minneapolis – an intervention rarely seen in modern American history. But then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper pushed back, saying the law should be invoked “only in the most urgent and dire of situations.”

Trump never did invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term.

But while campaigning for his second term, he suggested that would change. Trump told an audience in Iowa in 2023 that he was prevented from using the military to suppress violence in cities and states during his first term, and said if the issue came up again in his next term, “I'm not waiting.”

Trump also promised to deploy the National Guard to help carry out his immigration enforcement goals, and his top adviser Stephen Miller explained how that would be carried out: Troops under sympathetic Republican governors would send troops to nearby states that refuse to participate, Miller said on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” in 2023.

After Trump announced he was federalizing the National Guard troops on Saturday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said other measures could follow.

Hegseth wrote on the social media platform X that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert and would also be mobilized “if violence continues.”

FERRIDAY, La. (AP) — Even at a glance, the differences are obvious. The walls of Ferriday High School are old and worn, surrounded by barbed wire. Just a few miles away, Vidalia High School is clean and bright, with a new library and a crisp blue “V” painted on orange brick.

Ferriday High is 90% Black. Vidalia High is 62% white.

For Black families, the contrast between the schools suggests “we're not supposed to have the finer things,” said Brian Davis, a father in Ferriday. “It's almost like our kids don't deserve it,” he said.

The schools are part of Concordia Parish, which was ordered to desegregate 60 years ago and remains under a court-ordered plan to this day. Yet there's growing momentum to release the district — and dozens of others — from decades-old orders that some call obsolete.

In a remarkable reversal, the Justice Department said it plans to start unwinding court-ordered desegregation plans dating to the Civil Rights Movement. Officials started in April, when they lifted a 1960s order in Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish. Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the department's civil rights division, has said others will “bite the dust.”

It comes amid pressure from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and his attorney general, who have called for all the state's remaining orders to be lifted. They describe the orders as burdens on districts and relics of a time when Black students were still forbidden from some schools.

The orders were always meant to be temporary — school systems can be released if they demonstrate they fully eradicated segregation. Decades later, that goal remains elusive, with stark racial imbalances persisting in many districts.




Civil rights groups say the orders are important to keep as tools to address the legacy of forced segregation — including disparities in student discipline, academic programs and teacher hiring. They point to cases like Concordia, where the decades-old order was used to stop a charter school from favoring white students in admissions.

“Concordia is one where it's old, but a lot is happening there,” said Deuel Ross, deputy director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “That's true for a lot of these cases. They're not just sitting silently.”

Last year, before President Donald Trump took office, Concordia Parish rejected a Justice Department plan that would have ended its case if the district combined several majority white and majority Blac k elementary and middle schools.

At a town hall meeting, Vidalia residents vigorously opposed the plan, saying it would disrupt students' lives and expose their children to drugs and violence. An official from the Louisiana attorney general's office spoke against the proposal and said the Trump administration likely would change course on older orders.

Accepting the plan would have been a “death sentence” for the district, said Paul Nelson, a former Concordia superintendent. White families would have fled to private schools or other districts, said Nelson, who wants the court order removed.

“It's time to move on,” said Nelson, who left the district in 2016. “Let's start looking to build for the future, not looking back to what our grandparents may have gone through.”

At Ferriday High, athletic coach Derrick Davis supported combining schools in Ferriday and Vidalia. He said the district's disparities come into focus whenever his teams visit schools with newer sports facilities.

“It seems to me, if we'd all combine, we can all get what we need,” he said.

Others oppose merging schools if it's done solely for the sake of achieving racial balance. “Redistricting and going to different places they're not used to ... it would be a culture shock to some people,” said Ferriday's school resource officer, Marcus Martin, who, like Derrick Davis, is Black.

The district's current superintendent and school board did not respond to requests for comment.

Concordia is among more than 120 districts across the South that remain under desegregation orders from the 1960s and '70s, including about a dozen in Louisiana.

Calling the orders historical relics is “unequivocally false,” said Shaheena Simons, who until April led the Justice Department section that oversees school desegregation cases.

“Segregation and inequality persist in our schools, and they persist in districts that are still under desegregation orders,” she said.

With court orders in place, families facing discrimination can reach out directly to the Justice Department or seek relief from the court. Otherwise, the only recourse is a lawsuit, which many families can't afford, Simons said.

In Concordia, the order played into a battle over a charter school that opened in 2013 on the former campus of an all-white private school. To protect the area's progress on racial integration, a judge ordered Delta Charter School to build a student body that reflected the district's racial demographics. But in its first year, the school was just 15% Black.

After a court challenge, Delta was ordered to give priority to Black students. Today, about 40% of its students are Black.

Desegregation orders have been invoked recently in other cases around the state. One led to an order to address disproportionately high rates of discipline for Black students, and in another a predominantly Black elementary school was relocated from a site close to a chemical plant.

The Trump administration was able to close the Plaquemines case with little resistance because the original plaintiffs were no longer involved — the Justice Department was litigating the case alone. Concordia and an unknown number of other districts are in the same situation, making them vulnerable to quick dismissals.

Concordia's case dates to 1965, when the area was strictly segregated and home to a violent offshoot of the Ku Klux Klan. When Black families in Ferriday sued for access to all-white schools, the federal government intervened.

As the district integrated its schools, white families fled Ferriday. The district's schools came to reflect the demographics of their surrounding areas. Ferriday is mostly Black and low-income, while Vidalia is mostly white and takes in tax revenue from a hydroelectric plant. A third town in the district, Monterey, has a high school that's 95% white.

At the December town hall, Vidalia resident Ronnie Blackwell said the area “feels like a Mayberry, which is great,” referring to the fictional Southern town from “The Andy Griffith Show.” The federal government, he said, has “probably destroyed more communities and school systems than it ever helped.”

Under its court order, Concordia must allow students in majority Black schools to transfer to majority white schools. It also files reports on teacher demographics and student discipline.

After failing to negotiate a resolution with the Justice Department, Concordia is scheduled to make its case that the judge should dismiss the order, according to court documents. Meanwhile, amid a wave of resignations in the federal government, all but two of the Justice Department lawyers assigned to the case have left.

Without court supervision, Brian Davis sees little hope for improvement.

“A lot of parents over here in Ferriday, they're stuck here because here they don't have the resources to move their kids from A to B,” he said. “You'll find schools like Ferriday — the term is, to me, slipping into darkness.”

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Sky coach Tyler Marsh recalled working the 2020 NBA All-Star game at the United Center when he was an assistant with the Toronto Raptors. 

He mentioned that his first experience at a WNBA All-Star game was also in Chicago — two years later at Wintrust Arena. 

“It's been cool moments,” Marsh said.

There was another big one on Saturday night. Though the Sky got blown out by Indiana 79-52, it was the first WNBA game at the United Center. 

“It's an incredible moment for this league,” said Marsh, in his first season coaching the Sky. “It's an incredible moment for our team and our staff and our city, really. I think that's the cool part about it is we get to represent our city in this building on a historic night. It's not lost among us how important and significant it is — and for myself to be part of that and to represent the W in that capacity, to represent the Sky in that capacity, is something that I don't take for granted.”

A matchup that got moved from the smaller Wintrust Arena and was supposed to feature two of the league's brightest young stars in Chicago's Angel Reese and Indiana's Caitlin Clark didn't play out as envisioned.

The Fever rolled over the Sky for the second time this season. And they did it without the injured Clark.

The 2024 Rookie of the Year missed her fourth straight game because of a quad issue and watched the primetime, nationally televised game from the sideline. That had to be a bummer for the fans who showed up wearing Clark jerseys. 




The enthusiastic crowd of 19,496 surpassed Chicago's previous high of 16,444 in 2016 at Allstate Arena in suburban Rosemont, though tickets weren't hard to find. They were listed on StubHub for as little as $9 a few hours before tipoff.

By comparison, when Clark and Reese played their first game in Chicago last season, courtside seats at Wintrust Arena were going for $5,000 on Ticketmaster an hour before tipoff. That game drew the celebrities, with Chicago native Chance The Rapper, comedian Jason Sudeikis and New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson in the sellout crowd along with Pro Basketball Hall of Famer Cheryl Swoopes.

Even so, this was a big night. And the significance of playing at the United Center wasn't lost on the players and coaches. The Sky and Fever will meet again at the home of the NBA's Bulls and NHL's Blackhawks on July 27.

“We just continue to make milestones for women,” Reese said. “Women belong here. I think this is gonna be the first of many. Obviously, we have two here this year. But we could continue to see this — and all our games at NBA arenas.”

Reese and Clark have helped carry the league to new heights in popularity after taking their rivalry from LSU and Iowa to the pros. They brought the style and swagger that captivated the nation when they were going at it in college and spurring debates about sport and society.

But the night wasn't just about them.

“It just shows how much women's basketball is growing, and it's amazing to see it,” said Sky center Kamilla Cardoso, another young star.

For Fever assistant Austin Kelly, who was filling in with coach Stephanie White missing the game for personal reasons, playing at the United Center brought back memories of watching the Bulls during the Michael Jordan-Scottie Pippen dynasty.

“I was born in ‘89,” he said. “I played AAU basketball. We were on the road, me and my teammates were crammed into hotels — the Days Inn or whatever it was — watching them in June. A lot of memories of watching Jordan, watching the Bulls growing up. I think they were everyone's favorite team, especially youngsters like us growing up in the ‘90s.”

Marsh said Sky player-development coach Aaron Johnson, who's from Chicago, had this game circled on his proverbial calendar.

“Since it got announced that we would be playing this game, it was something that he really got emotional about. Not to put him on Front Street, but this is a building that he grew up idolizing and sitting in the nosebleeds, and going from that to being able to step on the floor, those are the types of moments that you can't really put a price on,” Marsh said. You take those experiences for what it is and it comes with the moment, but also, you're extremely excited for our players to be a part of that as well.”

Michelino Sunseri, an experienced runner, is facing prison time for running on a mountain trail. 

Picture this: you lace up your shoes, take a breath of fresh mountain air, and hit the trail in the Grand Tetons National Park. You complete a legendary speed record in the world of ultra-running, and fellow runners are celebrating you. Then, you're slapped with a federal crime.

Sounds like a joke, right? Sadly, it's real—and it's happening now to Michelino Sunseri, a 32-year-old bartender and record-setting mountain runner.

Sunseri ran a trail that hundreds if not thousands before him had done: he took a well-worn trail, one that's been used for decades by hikers, climbers, and runners alike. There was no gate. No park ranger stopping people. Just a tiny sign about ""erosion"" half-hidden in the sagebrush. But that was enough for the National Park Service to charge him with a federal crime.

‘BIG BLOW TO BIG GOVERNMENT': MAJOR SCOTUS DECISION STRIPS POWER OF ‘FACELESS LEVIATHAN' OF FEDERAL AGENCIES

Now, Sunseri is looking at up to $5,000 in fines, a possible six months in federal prison, and worst of all—a permanent criminal record. To add insult to injury, he could also be banned from the Grand Tetons National Park, the mountains he loves, for the next five years.

This isn't justice. This is overcriminalization.

Bernanke may disappoint stock investors betting on a commitment to step up stimulus when he makes remarks at the annual Fed symposium tomorrow.  (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)

Sunseri should not be a criminal. He didn't vandalize or hurt anyone. He ran a trail. He did not damage the trail, and he was open about it. He posted his record-breaking run on a digital app, and that's when government bureaucrats decided to make an example of him.

When federal bureaucrats act as lawmaker, judge, and jury, there's little any of us can do. As a former federal prosecutor, I can tell you that the Department of Justice wins 90% of its cases. And too often, there is no common sense, no grace, no understanding. Just raw, unchecked power.

And here's the truth: it can happen to you.

When the government creates a maze of vague rules and hidden signs and then prosecutes people who violate them without knowing and without intent, it's not justice. It's about power and control.

Sunseri's case is a warning to all of us. It shows what happens when Americans are expected to follow rules they can't even see. No one in the entire federal government keeps track of them all, but we estimate there are more than 300,000 federal statutes and regulations that carry federal criminal penalties.

And remember, once convicted of a federal crime there is no expungement of your record. Even if you're pardoned, your criminal record follows you for a lifetime and prevents opportunities for housing, education and employment.

Sunseri's case isn't about a trail. It's about the growing divide between everyday citizens and an out-of-touch bureaucracy that thinks it knows best. It's about the erosion of liberty in the name of government authority.

We cannot sit back and let this continue. Government overreach is real, and this case is Exhibit A. We need laws written by elected lawmakers—not unaccountable federal agencies. We need clarity, not hidden signs and gotcha rules. And above all, we need a justice system that remembers the difference between a criminal—and a man who just loves to run in the mountains where he lives.

This week on ‘Fox News Sunday,' Shannon Bream speaks with Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., about what it would take for him to support President Donald Trump's spending bill.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other politicians from the U.S. and Latin America condemned the shooting of Colombian presidential candidate Miguel Uribe on Sunday.

Rubio blamed the assassination attempt on ""violent leftist rhetoric"" originating from the Colombian government. Uribe, a Colombian senator, is currently fighting for his life after sustaining three gunshot wounds, one of which was to the head.

""The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the attempted assassination of Senator Miguel Uribe. This is a direct threat to democracy and the result of the violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government,"" Rubio wrote.

""Having seen firsthand Colombia's progress over the past few decades to consolidate security and democracy, it can't afford to go back to dark days of political violence. President Petro needs to dial back the inflammatory rhetoric and protect Colombian officials,"" he added.

Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno also condemned the attack in a statement on social media.

""The assassination attempt on leading presidential candidate Miguel Uribe is a vile attack on democracy. This evil act must be investigated and anyone responsible, directly or indirectly, must face swift punishment,"" Moreno wrote.

Chilean President Gabriel Boric also reacted to Uribe's shooting.

""My strongest condemnation of the attack against Miguel Uribe Turbay, pre-presidential candidate in Colombia. In a democracy, violence has no place or justification,"" Boric wrote.

Authorities say Uribe was shot by a boy less than 15 years old, and they are investigating who was behind the attack. Police recovered a 9mm ""Glock-type"" pistol from the suspect.

""Miguel is fighting for his life at this moment. Let us ask God to guide the hands of the doctors who are attending to him,"" Maria Claudia Tarazona, Miguel's wife, wrote on her husband's X account. ""I ask everyone to join together in a prayer chain for Miguel's life.""

Tarazona later announced that Uribe's initial surgery at the hospital ""went well,"" though he remains in intensive care.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Uribe's chief opponent in the presidential race, said the attack crossed a ""red line"" and ordered an investigation. He also canceled a planned trip to France this week, citing the ""seriousness of the events.""

The National Guard was deployed to Los Angeles County as anti-ICE protests continued to escalate Saturday afternoon and into the evening. The unrest is centered in the city of Paramount, California, where protesters clashed with federal authorities, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who were allegedly trying to conduct a raid at a local business.

U.S. Northern Command on Sunday confirmed that National Guard troops have begun to deploy to the Los Angeles area, where confrontations between anti-ICE rioters and law enforcement have happened over the weekend.

The command said that some elements of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team from the California National Guard were already on the ground, while others were still deploying.

The command did not immediately provide the exact locations or assignments for the National Guard troops.


Two federal sources told Fox News on Sunday morning that the National Guard is actively protecting federal assets in Los Angeles County.

The Trump administration earlier said it took over the California National Guard and deployed 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles.





Riots against the Trump administration's immigration raids in Southern California are rocking Los Angeles this weekend and California Republicans are pinning blame for the violence on Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass.  


""Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass have a real habit of letting Los Angeles burn,"" Republican California Rep. Darell Issa posted to X on Saturday evening.  ""If only Karen Bass fought against the Los Angeles fires like she fights for illegal aliens,"" Issa added in another post, referring to the Palisades fire that tore through Southern California in January.  

Other California Republicans and conservatives have also directed their ire at Democratic leaders for the violence, Fox Digital found.  

""Gavin Newsom seems to think that California can not only defy federal immigration law, but now federal tax law. The doctrine of nullification died with the Confederacy. What's next: firing on Fort Ord?"" Republican California Rep. Tom McClintock posted to X, referring to Newsom floating withholding federal taxes in response to reports of the Trump administration cutting funding to the state.  


This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News Digital's Emma Colton. To read more, click here.





More than 20 anti-ICE rioters were arrested in New York City on Saturday during a confrontation with immigration authorities. 

A mob of nearly 150 people tried to block federal officials from conducting immigration raids in Lower Manhattan, with some screaming and cursing at authorities. 

Demonstrators, some of whom were masked, threw rocks at an unmarked white van with tinted windows as it tried to pull away from the plaza where U.S. Immigration Court is located, the New York Post reported. Others reportedly tried to block the van with their bodies.





A car was set on fire in the middle of an intersection in Los Angeles on Saturday as tensions flared between anti-ICE demonstrators and immigration authorities.

Aerial video shows the tense scene as it unfolded in Los Angeles.


Two individuals are seen circling the burning car on motorbikes, with one waving a Mexican flag. Dozens of others stood on the outskirts of the intersection.

The video shows law enforcement in riot gear arriving at the scene alongside fire trucks before they begin to walk toward the car burning in the intersection.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was acting “deranged” over his threat to deploy active-duty Marines to the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles.

“The Secretary of Defense is now threatening to deploy active-duty Marines on American soil against its own citizens,” Newsom wrote on X. “This is deranged behavior.”





Newsom was responding to Hegseth's post on Saturday, in which the defense secretary wrote that the Pentagon is mobilizing the National Guard to respond to anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles and warned that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton may also be deployed ""if violence continues.""

“Under President Trump, violence & destruction against federal agents & federal facilities will NOT be tolerated. It's COMMON SENSE,” Hegseth wrote. “The @DeptofDefense is mobilizing the National Guard IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles. And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert.”





U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said President Donald Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles to respond to anti-ICE protests was ""completely inappropriate and misguided.""


""Using the National Guard this way is a completely inappropriate and misguided mission,"" Padilla wrote on X.

""The Trump Administration is just sowing more chaos and division in our communities,"" he continued.

This comes after the Trump administration took over the California National Guard and deployed 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles.

President Donald Trump on Sunday morning thanked the National Guard ""for a job well done"" in responding to anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, California, and said masks will not be allowed at protests.

Trump took jabs at California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats, as he gave high praise to the National Guard.

""Great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence, clashes and unrest. We have an incompetent Governor (Newscum) and Mayor (Bass) who were, as usual (just look at how they handled the fires, and now their VERY SLOW PERMITTING disaster. Federal permitting is complete!), unable to to handle the task,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.


""These Radical Left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will NOT BE TOLERATED,"" he continued. ""Also, from now on, MASKS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED to be worn at protests. What do these people have to hide, and why??? Again, thank you to the National Guard for a job well done!""



Fox News Digital/ Louis Casiano Jr.



The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department arrested two individuals for alleged assault on law enforcement officers Saturday night.

The sheriff's department told CBS News Los Angeles that the two suspects were arrested for alleged assault on peace officers.

One of the individuals allegedly threw a molotov cocktail, which struck three deputies, the outlet reported.





Multiple people were detained during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, California, on Saturday, according to police.

The Los Angeles Police Department
 said officers detained the individuals for failing to disperse after multiple warnings were issued.

""Remaining people in the area of the UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY will be subject to arrest,"" LAPD wrote on X.

""Leave the area,"" the agency added.





California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said Saturday that the Trump administration is taking over the state's National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles because it wants a ""spectacle,"" leading the White House to shoot back that the governor has done ""nothing"" to stop the violence at the anti-ICE protests.

""The federal government is taking over the California National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles — not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,"" Newsom wrote on X. ""Don't give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully.""


White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded that Newsom has ""done nothing to stop this violence"" and ""should be thanking President Trump for bringing law and order to California.""

""Illegal criminal aliens and violent mobs have been committing arson, throwing rocks at vehicles, and attacking federal law enforcement for days,"" she wrote. ""Gavin Newsom has done nothing to stop this violence.""

""He should be thanking President Trump for bringing law and order to California — a basic value that Newsom and his fellow Democrats have failed to uphold,"" she added.



Fox News Digital/ Louis Casiano Jr.



Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday that the Pentagon is mobilizing the National Guard to respond to anti-ICE protests in California and warned that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton may be deployed as well ""if violence continues.""

""The violent mob assaults on ICE and Federal Law Enforcement are designed to prevent the removal of Criminal Illegal Aliens from our soil; a dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels (aka Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and a huge NATIONAL SECURITY RISK,"" Hegseth wrote on X.

The secretary said that under the Trump administration, violence and destruction against federal agents and federal facilities ""will NOT be tolerated,"" adding: ""It's COMMON SENSE.""


""The @DeptofDefense is mobilizing the National Guard IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles,"" he wrote. ""And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert.""



Fox News Digital/ Louis Casiano Jr.



Following violent anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles on Saturday night, FBI Director Kash Patel warned ""if you assault a law enforcement officer, you're going to jail—period.""

""It doesn't matter where you came from, how you got here, or what cause you claim to represent,"" Patel told Fox News Digital. ""If local jurisdictions won't stand behind the men and women who wear the badge, the FBI will.""


President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Paramount, California after immigration authorities driving in the area were pelted with rocks, stones, and concrete — shattering government vehicle windshields.

""Doesn't matter where you came from, how you got here, or what movement speaks to you. If the local police force won't back our men and women on the thin blue line, we @FBI will,"" Patel wrote on X.



Fox News Digital/ Louis Casiano Jr.



Los Angeles
 mayor Karen Bass said Saturday that violence and destruction are ""unacceptable"" and that anyone responsible will be held accountable, as protests continue against immigration authorities conducting raids at businesses in Southern California.

""This is a difficult time for our city,"" Bass wrote on X. ""As we recover from an unprecedented natural disaster, many in our community are feeling fear following recent federal immigration enforcement actions across Los Angeles County.""

""Reports of unrest outside the city, including in Paramount, are deeply concerning,"" she continued. ""We've been in direct contact with officials in Washington, D.C., and are working closely with law enforcement to find the best path forward.""

""Everyone has the right to peacefully protest, but let me be clear: violence and destruction are unacceptable, and those responsible will be held accountable,"" the mayor added.



Fox News Digital/Louis Casiano Jr.



The National Guard will be deployed to Los Angeles County after anti-ICE protests continued to escalate Saturday afternoon, Trump administration border czar Tom Homan told Fox News Saturday.

On Saturday, tear gas was deployed near Home Depot in Paramount, California, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were allegedly conducting a raid.


Following the raid, a violent protest broke out and several arrests were made for assault on a federal agent, according to U.S. Border Patrol Chief Michael W. Banks.

President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to call out state and local leadership's inaction.

""If Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can't do their jobs, which everyone knows they can't, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!"" Trump wrote.

Newsom responded on X, claiming the federal government ""is moving to take over the California National Guard"" and deploy 2,000 soldiers.


""That move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions,"" Newsom wrote. ""LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice. We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need. The Guard has been admirably serving LA throughout recovery. This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust.""

President Donald Trump's restrictions on travel from 10 African countries are being praised by analysts for improving U.S. security internationally and domestically.

The president said on X the travel ban was being introduced after a terror attack against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, last weekend, allegedly by an Egyptian man who had overstayed his visa.

In a White House fact sheet, Trump said, ""We will restore the travel ban, some people call it the Trump travel ban, and keep the radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.""

This point was backed by the State Department's principal deputy spokesperson, Tommy Pigott. In a briefing Thursday, Pigott said, ""This is a national security imperative"".

But observers believe there is an external, international reason. 

""Most, if not all, of the African countries were added to this list either because of extreme instability and thus terrorist havens or because relations between them and the U.S. is either extremely poor or non-existent,"" Bill Roggio, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and editor of FDD's Long War Journal, told Fox News Digital. 

""For instance, the U.S. has been historically hard on Eritrea for its human rights abuses and also alleged support for terrorism. While in Chad, its military regime kicked the U.S. military out of its territory last year, further hurting the U.S. military posture in Africa.""

The world's two principal Islamist terror groups, ISIS and al Qaeda, represented here by Al-Shabaab, both operate openly in Somalia. The White House described it this week as ""a terrorist safe haven."" 

A briefing note accompanying the travel ban declared, ""A persistent terrorist threat emanates from Somalia's territory. Somalia also remains a destination for individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the national security of the United States.""  

The U.S. Africa Command mounted five air attacks against operators from both groups in just the 12 days up to June 2. 

Fighting and subsequent piles of bodies in the streets have been reported in the past month in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. The U.N.'s Support Mission in Libya recently posted on X that the situation could ""spiral out of control.""

""The historical terrorist presence within Libya's territory amplifies the risks posed by the entry into the United States of its nationals,"" the White House note states, adding U.S. border officials can't properly vet Libyans because ""there is no competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents in Libya.""

The U.S. has already imposed sanctions against the leaders of both parties involved in a two-year civil war that has reportedly killed 150,000 and displaced 12 million. The U.S. claims up to 28% of Sudanese overstay their visas.

The criminal records of Eritreans are not available for inspection by U.S. officials. With an overstay rate of up to 55%, the White House also reported that ""Eritrea has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.""   

CRITICS HAVE MELTDOWN AND ACCUSE TRUMP OF IMPOSING RENEWED 'MUSLIM BAN' THROUGH 'DISGUSTING' TRAVEL ORDER

The West African country is causing concern in Washington as it deepens relations with Russia. Chad President Idriss Deby went to Moscow last year for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Kremlin Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was then warmly welcomed in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, for a reciprocal visit. Russia's shadowy Wagner private mercenary group's importance in the country is being questioned after three of its members were arrested in September and sent back to Moscow.

Banning nationals this week, the U.S. said Chad has had a visa overstay rate of up to 55%. In Chad, President Deby responded by saying, ""I have instructed the government to act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity and suspend the issuance of visas to U.S. citizens.""

People from this West African country have reportedly overstayed their F, M and J visas by up to 70%.

Depending on the visa category, up to 35% of citizens in the U.S. are reported to have overstayed their visas.

Overstaying is the main issue for the other African countries whose nationals are partially restricted and now have only limited entry into the U.S.

Has an overstay rate of up to 35%, and, the White House says, ""has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.""

Togo suffers from poor governance, nepotism and widespread corruption, which reportedly goes all the way to the president's office. Over 50% of the population lives below what's regarded as the international poverty line. Togo's nationals have an overstay rate of up to 35% in the U.S.

Burundi vies with South Sudan for the dubious title of poorest country in the world. Yet soaring inflation has caused a devastating rise in food prices. A former rebel group has led the country for two decades in a climate of political unrest and alleged repression. Burundi's citizens have an overstay rate of up to 17% in the U.S.

Democrats are desperately trying to lay the groundwork to recapture voting blocs in 2028 that shifted toward President Donald Trump last November. But one important nominating state, Iowa, is seemingly being left behind as the party sets its sights elsewhere.

Over the last two years, Democrats have been chipping away at Iowa's first-in-the-nation status, something it's held since 1972. In 2023, the party dismantled Iowa's position as the first state in the presidential nominating process, with allies of then-President Joe Biden elevating South Carolina to the coveted role.

DEMOCRATS NEED TO COME TO GRIPS WITH 2030 CENSUS REALITY

This week, the Hawkeye State lost its single seat on the powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee that oversees setting the presidential nominating calendar. New Hampshire, which defied the Democratic National Committee by holding an unsanctioned primary last cycle, gained a second seat. The other states that make up the early voting process, Nevada and South Carolina, also received a second representative.

Iowa is a unique Midwestern state. While surrounding states like Illinois and Minnesota have moved to the left, and Wisconsin leans blue, despite swinging for Trump in 2024, Iowa has largely been written off as a red state. However, it has a purple history and elected former President Barack Obama over Republican John McCain in 2008.

But with both parties becoming increasingly polarized over the last several cycles, the Hawkeye State appears to be a conservative stronghold for the time being. All six members of the U.S. congressional delegation from Iowa are Republicans, and State Auditor Rob Sand, now running for governor, is the only Democrat holding statewide office.

“National Democrats are pulling away from Iowa,” Democratic state Sen. Tony Bisignano told the Washington Examiner. “Rightfully so, looking back at our turn to the far right as a politically voting state. Iowa peaked with Obama, and it's been a disaster ever since.”

Bisignano said attracting national Democrats back to the state will depend heavily on the party's success in the 2026 midterm elections, but he's not optimistic about that.

“Politics is what have you done lately,” the state legislator said. “We have tanked!”

Iowa congressional Republicans have even expressed disappointment with the DNC's decision — particularly as the issue of preserving the caucuses and Iowa's first-in-the-nation status has been a bipartisan one for so long, Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA) said.

“But I think what this speaks to is the level of how the national Democrats are so out of touch,” Hinson told the Washington Examiner. “Iowa Democrats are so out of touch, and I think this is just a consequence of that.”

“I think that's unfortunate,” Hinson added.

Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA) echoed Hinson, stating it was “truly disappointing” to hear about the DNC's decision and the overall “lack of engagement” from Democrats in the state.

“They're getting more liberal, and Iowa is a state of normal people,” Feenstra, who is also running for governor of Iowa, told the Washington Examiner. “It's just unfortunate where the Democrat Party is headed.”

The decision to pull Iowa's seat at the Rules and Bylaws Committee comes as Chairman Ken Martin finds his footing within the DNC, signaling that Iowa's influence within the party is waning as Democrats already are preparing for a competitive and consequential presidential primary in 2028. 

Iowa Democratic Party Chairwoman Rita Hart said in a statement that while her focus is winning both statewide and national races in 2026, she does expect “tough and direct conversations with the DNC” regarding the caucuses and the “serious concerns surrounding the Biden 2024 calendar.”

Iowa still has representation on the DNC's Resolutions Committee with Gregory Christensen. But the absence of an Iowan on the nominating calendar committee could be indicative that Democrats are giving up on the state, which could be detrimental for rallying ground support ahead of the midterm elections.

“National Democrats let Trump get a headstart in the 2024 campaign by excluding Iowa,” Hart said. “We simply can't afford to be ignored again.”

Reps. Zach Nunn (R-IA) and Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA) are among the 29 vulnerable House Republican seats the GOP needs to defend, and Democrats only need a net gain of three seats to take back the lower chamber. On the Senate side, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) is up for reelection, and given recent controversies and policy stances, it could open the door for a Democratic victory.

The removal from the DNC also comes after Iowa Democrats flipped a red state Senate seat earlier this year — a trend developing across several states, such as Nebraska and Wisconsin, where Democrats are defeating Republican candidates or incumbents in the wake of the 2024 election.

“The DNC is committed to running a fair, transparent, and rigorous process for the 2028 primary calendar,” said Abhi Rahman, deputy communications director for the DNC. “All states will have an opportunity to participate.” 

Rahman praised Iowa's DNC members and Hart as “fierce advocates” of the state and assured that “they will have their voices heard.”

One Democratic communications strategist, who has worked with the DNC and was granted anonymity to discuss committee conversations, told the Washington Examiner that Iowa doesn't seem to be on “anybody's minds” at meetings discussing how to move forward in the aftermath of former Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign. 

But the strategist said the intention perhaps is not to “punish Iowa” by removing it from the Rules and Bylaws Committee. Instead, they think Martin's choice reflects that he has “good relationships with the folks that he picked,” who he thinks can best get the DNC on track across the board, not just state by state.

Democrats face an uphill battle to bring blue-collar workers and minority blocs such as black, Latino, Asian American, and Pacific Islander voters back to their side of the aisle. But Iowa, the strategist said, is a predominantly white early state compared to other early nominating states. Of the early primary states, South Carolina boasts the largest population of black voters.

Meanwhile, population shifts to the South and away from blue states such as California and New York have forced Democrats to figure out how to win elsewhere to keep up electorally.

Democrats have kept an eye on the South and Sun Belt, such as Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina. Through Martin's “Organize Everywhere, Win Anywhere” plan, the DNC will allot $17,500 to state officials in blue states and $22,500 to state parties in red states to continue outreach.

“I think there is some intentionality by the DNC and some of the folks who are from Southern states who are like, ‘If we're gonna win the presidency, or win back the House and the Senate … we need to figure out ways to win back these voters,'” the strategist said.

“So then, when you're trying to make a defense that Iowa and New Hampshire should be states that are early states, you're like, ‘Wait, white people ruin everything. What? Democrats are supposed to be diverse. What?' And so, that's a lot of the back and forth.” 

JONI ERNST CHALLENGER JD SCHOLTEN MOTIVATED TO RUN FOLLOWING TOWN HALL COMMENTS

Hinson said the Iowa-is-too-white argument “falls flat” when compared to the demographics of early voting states such as New Hampshire, Nevada, and Michigan.

“They're listening to a few in their most progressive wing of their party, and it's exactly why they've lost ground in Iowa,” Hinson said. “Iowa Democrats are continuing to make it harder for Iowa to keep its status as well, within the DNC. I really think they're doing this to themselves.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Ordering the National Guard to deploy in Los Angeles is a warning of what to expect when his hold on power is threatened.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump ordered the National Guard to quell disorderly protests against immigration-enforcement personnel in Los Angeles. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth declared his readiness to obey Trump by mobilizing the U.S. Marines as well. These threats look theatrical and pointless. The state, counties, and cities of California employ more than 75,000 uniformed law-enforcement personnel with arrest powers. The Los Angeles Police Department alone numbers nearly 9,000 uniformed officers. They can surely handle some dozens of agitators throwing rocks, shooting fireworks, and impeding vehicular traffic.

If and when those 75,000 uniformed personnel feel overmatched by the agitators, California can request federal help of its own volition. When California has asked for needed federal help—during the wildfires earlier this year, for example—Trump has begrudged that help and played politics with it. Trump is now forcing help that the city and state do not need and do not want, not to restore law but to assert his personal dominance over the normal procedures to enforce the law.

But if the Trump-Hegseth threats have little purpose as law enforcement, they signify great purpose as political strategy. Since Trump's reelection, close observers of his presidency have feared a specific sequence of events that could play out ahead of midterm voting in 2026:

Step 1: Use federal powers in ways to provoke some kind of made-for-TV disturbance—flames, smoke, loud noises, waving of foreign flags.

Step 2: Invoke the disturbance to declare a state of emergency and deploy federal troops.

Step 3: Seize control of local operations of government—policing in June 2025; voting in November 2026.

Some of Trump's most fervent supporters urged him to follow this plan in November 2020. But in 2020, they waited too long—until after the votes were cast. Using the military to overturn an election already completed was too extreme a step for a Department of Defense headed by a law-respecting Cabinet secretary such as Mark Esper. Trump looked to the courts instead. Only after the courts disappointed him did Trump attempt violence, and then the only available tool of violence was the lightly armed mob he summoned to Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021. Harrowing as those events were, they never stood much chance of success: Without the support of any element of the military, Trump's rioters could not impose the outcome Trump wanted.

But the methods Trump threatened in Los Angeles this weekend could be much more effective in November 2026 than the attempted civilian coup of January 2021.

If Trump can incite disturbances in blue states before the midterm elections, he can assert emergency powers to impose federal control over the voting process, which is to say his control. Or he might suspend voting until, in his opinion, order has been restored. Either way, blue-state seats could be rendered vacant for some time.

Precedents do exist for such action. In autumn 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant imposed martial law on counties in South Carolina to suppress Ku Klux Klan disturbances that were interfering with legal voting. More recently, the governor of the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands delayed elections, including the election of the islands' nonvoting delegate in the United States House of Representatives, after Saipan was struck by a super-typhoon in October 2018. In that same month, Trump himself claimed that a caravan of undocumented immigrants heading north toward the U.S. constituted a “national emergency” that would justify suspending civil authority and deploying the military in border states.

In his first term, Trump repeatedly talked more radically than he acted. He was usually constrained by his own appointees. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley rebuffed Trump's suggestion during the George Floyd unrest that the military shoot protesters, which sufficed to dissuade Trump from upgrading the suggestion into a direct order.

But instead of Esper and Milley, the second Trump administration's military is headed by a former talk-show host facing troubling allegations of heavy drinking and sexual misconduct. (He denies these claims.) Hegseth owes everything to Trump. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are likewise headed by radical partisans with dubious records, abjectly beholden to Trump. This Trump administration is sending masked agents into the streets to seize and detain people—and, in some cases, sending detainees to a prison in El Salvador without a hearing—on the basis of a 1798 law originally designed to defend the United States against invasion by the army and navy of revolutionary France. The presidency of 2025 has available a wide and messy array of emergency powers, as the legal scholar Elizabeth Goitein has described.

Second-term Trump and his new team are avidly using those powers in ways never intended or imagined.

Since Trump's return to the presidency in January, many political observers have puzzled over a seeming paradox. On the one hand, Trump keeps doing corrupt and illegal things. If and when his party loses its majorities in Congress—and thus the ability to protect Trump from investigation and accountability—he will likely face severe legal danger. On the other hand, Trump is doing extreme and unpopular things that seem certain to doom his party's majorities in the 2026 elections. Doesn't Trump know that the midterms are coming? Why isn't he more worried?

This weekend's events suggest an answer. Trump knows full well that the midterms are coming. He is worried. But he might already be testing ways to protect himself that could end in subverting those elections' integrity. So far, the results must be gratifying to him—and deeply ominous to anyone who hopes to preserve free and fair elections in the United States under this corrupt, authoritarian, and lawless presidency.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Immigration raids and protests will continue so long as Trump is president. His opponents should do everything they can to stay within the law.

In Los Angeles, federal agents carrying out deportations on behalf of the Trump administration are clashing with protesters, some lawful, others unlawfully disruptive and even violent. The Trump administration has ordered in the National Guard and threatened to send in the Marines. Governor Gavin Newsom calls this willful escalation. Trump-administration officials say they must protect federal agents engaged in lawful immigration actions––enforcement that some protesters regard as cruel and immoral, regardless of legality.

Anytime that American citizens clash in the streets with armed agents of the state, something has gone wrong. Today's civil unrest risks expanding into the sort of violence that kills lots of people and strains civic bonds for decades. And every time looting and rioting occur in Los Angeles, the city's poorest neighborhoods suffer the aftereffects for years. Stepping back from the brink is in America's interest, regardless of where one attributes blame. As a Californian, I am especially dismayed to see this happen in L.A., a city I adore, where I long lived and where I have many friends and loved ones. For all Angelenos, so recently traumatized by this year's devastating wildfires, and for the many Americans who feel dismay when watching their fellow citizens clash, I pray the turmoil ends without loss of life.

My fear that it may instead intensify is informed by several background conditions.

Among them are President Donald Trump's incentives. On X, many of his supporters are gleeful about the prospect of a clash that ends in bloodied leftists wearing handcuffs and facing felonies. Even setting aside the most negatively polarized segment of the Republican base, Trump has a strong incentive to redirect public attention away from his feud with Elon Musk, his underwater approval rating on the economy, and the fight over a spending bill that divides his coalition, and toward immigration enforcement, an issue on which his approval rating is still positive. What's more, this clash concerns deportation actions that are apparently lawful, as opposed to Trump's unconstitutional deportations of foreigners to a Salvadoran prison.

Newsom has urged nonviolence, but California officials also have incentives to focus on opposing Trump rather than restoring calm to protect innocents. Golden State polls show not only that Trump is more unpopular in the state than he is in the nation, but that immigration is a bad issue for him locally. Regarding undocumented immigrants, the Public Policy Institute of California finds that “overwhelming majorities of adults (73%) and likely voters (71%) say that there should be a way for them to stay in the country legally, if certain requirements are met”; that “eight in ten adults (79%) and likely voters (80%) favor the protections given by DACA—Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—to undocumented immigrants brought into the US as children”; and that “about six in ten adults (63%) and likely voters (62%) favor the California state and local governments making their own policies and taking actions, separate from the federal government, to protect the legal rights of undocumented immigrants in California.”

Sentiments in Los Angeles are surely even more antagonistic to Trump's position, and the stakes for Angelenos with family members and friends who live there without legal status are high––in protesting, within or outside of the law, many seek to preserve their communities or perhaps their very families. And Trump, by his own unlawful actions, has made many fear that their intimates may not be simply deported back to their home country but instead disappeared into the prison system of an authoritarian regime.

Federal and local cops have cause to feel threatened, too. More than 900 suffered injuries during the 2020 unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd. Multiple federal, state, and local agencies trying to keep order, while federal, state, and local officials fight rather than coordinate, only raises the probability of bad outcomes. And today's social-media environment facilitates the rapid communication of where deportation raids are occurring, enabling not just peaceful protesters but also, potentially, nihilistic inciters of chaos to rush to the scene.

Immigration-enforcement raids will continue so long as Trump is president and the law of the land is unchanged. Opponents of such actions, even those that are entirely lawful, have every right under the Constitution to peaceably assemble to protest them.

Farsighted protest leaders should do everything in their power to keep those demonstrations law-abiding. Under the Trump administration, the rule of law is among the most precious safeguards Americans possess. Appealing to it, Trump critics have repeatedly prevailed in courtrooms, where Trump is least likely to succeed with his most dangerous gambits. In contrast, street violence gives Trump the ability to fight his enemies with the law on his side and with trained, armed personnel to enforce it.

In such a fight, Trump may well prevail in the court of public opinion. But if he is seen as needlessly escalating the dispute, and bloodshed follows, more Americans may come to reflect that the same man was president during the civil unrest of summer 2020; the civil unrest of January 6, 2021; and the civil unrest of today. Whether one attributes blame to Trump himself or to so-called Trump derangement syndrome, the sad and dangerous spectacle of Americans fighting one another happens alarmingly often when Trump is in the White House. A president attuned to America's long-term interests and the many global challenges our nation confronts would try to lower the temperature, rather than inflame a clash that could have deadly results.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The “audacity of hope” presidency has given way to the fierce lethargy of semi-retirement.

Last month, while Donald Trump was in the Middle East being gifted a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar, Barack Obama headed off on his own foreign excursion: a trip to Norway, in a much smaller and more tasteful jet, to visit the summer estate of his old friend King Harald V. Together, they would savor the genteel glories of Bygdøyveien in May. They chewed over global affairs and the freshest local salmon, which had been smoked on the premises and seasoned with herbs from the royal garden.

Trump has begun his second term with a continuous spree of democracy-shaking, economy-quaking, norm-obliterating action. And Obama, true to form, has remained carefully above it all. He picks his spots, which seldom involve Trump. In March, he celebrated the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act and posted his annual NCAA basketball brackets. In April, he sent out an Easter message and mourned the death of the pope. In May, he welcomed His Holiness Pope Leo XIV (“a fellow Chicagoan”) and sent prayers to Joe Biden following his prostate-cancer diagnosis.

No matter how brazen Trump becomes, the most effective communicator in the Democratic Party continues to opt for minimal communication. His “audacity of hope” presidency has given way to the fierce lethargy of semi-retirement.

Obama occasionally dips into politics with brief and unmemorable statements, or sporadic fundraising emails (subject: “Barack Obama wants to meet you. Yes you.”). He praised his law-school alma mater, Harvard, for “rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt” by the White House “to stifle academic freedom.” He criticized a Republican bill that would threaten health care for millions. He touted a liberal judge who was running for a crucial seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. When called upon, he can still deliver a top-notch campaign spiel, donor pitch, convention speech, or eulogy.

Beyond that, Obama pops in with summer and year-end book, music, and film recommendations. He recently highlighted a few articles about AI and retweeted a promotional spot for Air Force Elite: Thunderbirds, a new Netflix documentary from his and Michelle's production company. (Michelle also has a fashion book coming out later this year: “a celebration of confidence, identity, and authenticity,” she calls it.) Apparently, Barack is a devoted listener of The Ringer's Bill Simmons Podcast, or so he told Jimmy Kimmel over dinner.

In normal times, no one would deny Obama these diversions. He performed the world's most stressful job for eight years, served his country, made his history, and deserved to kick back and do the usual ex-president things: start a foundation, build a library, make unspeakable amounts of money.

But the inevitable Trump-era counterpoint is that these are not normal times. And Obama's detachment feels jarringly incongruous with the desperation of his longtime admirers—even more so given Trump's assaults on what Obama achieved in office. It would be one thing if Obama had disappeared after leaving the White House, maybe taking up painting like George W. Bush. The problem is that Obama still very much has a public profile—one that screams comfort and nonchalance at a time when so many other Americans are terrified.

“There are many grandmas and Rachel Maddow viewers who have been more vocal in this moment than Barack Obama has,” Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Institute, told me. “It is heartbreaking,” he added, “to see him sacrificing that megaphone when nobody else quite has it.”

People who have worked with Obama since he left office say that he is extremely judicious about when he weighs in. “We try to preserve his voice so that when he does speak, it has impact,” Eric Schultz, a close adviser to Obama in his post-presidency, told me. “There is a dilution factor that we're very aware of.”

“The thing you don't want to do is, you don't want to regularize him,” former Attorney General Eric Holder, a close Obama friend and collaborator, told me. When I asked Holder what he meant by “regularize,” he explained that there was a danger of turning Obama into just another hack commentator—“Tuesdays With Barack, or something like that,” Holder said.

Like many of Obama's confidants, Holder bristles at suggestions that the former president has somehow deserted the Trump opposition. “Should he do more? Everybody can have their opinions,” Holder said. “The one thing that always kind of pisses me off is when people say he's not out there, or that he's not doing things, that he's just retired and we never hear from him. If you fucking look, folks, you would see that he's out there.”

From the April 2016 issue: The Obama doctrine

Obama's aides also say that he is loath to overshadow the next generation of Democratic leaders. They emphasize that he spends a great deal of time speaking privately with candidates and officials who seek his advice. But unfortunately for Democrats, they have not found their next fresh generational sensation since Obama was elected 17 years ago (Joe Biden obviously doesn't count). Until a new leader emerges, Obama could certainly take on a more vocal role without “regularizing” himself in the lowlands of Trump-era politics.

Obama remains the most popular Democrat alive at a time of historic unpopularity for his party. Unlike Biden, he appears not to have lost a step, or three. Unlike with Bill Clinton, his voice remains strong and his baggage minimal. Unlike both Biden and Clinton, he is relatively young and has a large constituency of Americans who still want to hear from him, including Black Americans, young voters, and other longtime Democratic blocs that gravitated toward Trump in November.

“Should Obama get out and do more? Yes, please,” Tracy Sefl, a Democratic media consultant in Chicago, told me. “Help us,” she added. “We're sinking over here.”

Obama's conspicuous scarcity while Trump inflicts such damage isn't just a bad look. It's a dereliction of the message that he built his career on. When Obama first ran for president in 2008, his former life as a community organizer was central to his message. His campaign was not merely for him, but for civic action itself—the idea of Americans being invested in their own change. Throughout his time in the White House, he emphasized that “citizen” was his most important title. After he left office in 2017, Obama said that he would work to inspire and develop the next cohort of leaders, which is essentially the mission of his foundation. It would seem a contradiction for him to say that he's devoting much of his post-presidency to promoting civic engagement when he himself seems so disengaged.

To some degree, patience with Obama began wearing thin when he was still in office. His approval ratings sagged partway through his second term (before rebounding at the end). The rollout of the Affordable Care Act in 2013 was a fiasco, and the midterm elections of 2014 were a massacre. Obama looked powerless as Republicans in Congress ensured that he would pass no major legislation in his second term and blocked his nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.

“Obama, out,” the president said in the denouement of his last comedy routine at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, in 2016. In Obama lore, this mic-drop moment would instantly become famous—and prophetic.

After Trump's first victory, Obama tried to reassure supporters that this was merely a setback. “I don't believe in apocalyptic—until the apocalypse comes,” he said in an interview with The New Yorker. Insofar as Obama talked about how he imagined his post-presidency, he was inclined to disengage from day-to-day politics. At a press conference in November 2016, Obama said that he planned to “take Michelle on vacation, get some rest, spend time with my girls, and do some writing, do some thinking.” He promised to give Trump the chance to do his job “without somebody popping off in every instance.”

But in that same press conference, he also allowed that if something arose that raised “core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes.”

That happened almost immediately. A few days after vowing in his inaugural address to end the “American carnage” that he was inheriting, Trump signed an executive order banning foreign nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. The so-called Muslim travel ban would quickly be blocked by the courts, but not before sowing chaos at U.S. points of entry. Obama put out a brief statement through a spokesperson (“the president fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion”), and went on vacation.

Trump's early onslaught made clear that Obama's ex-presidency would prove far more complicated than previous ones. And Obama's taste for glamorous settings and famous company—Richard Branson, David Geffen, George Clooney—made for a grating contrast with the turmoil back home. “Just tone it down with the kitesurfing pictures,” John Oliver, the host of HBO's Last Week Tonight, said of Obama in an interview with Seth Meyers less than a month after the president left office. “America is on fire,” Oliver added. “I know that people accused him of being out of touch with the American people during his presidency. I'm not sure he's ever been more out of touch than he is now.”

Oliver's spasm foreshadowed a rolling annoyance that continued as Trump's presidency wore on: that Obama was squandering his power and influence. “Oh, Obama is still tweeting good tweets. That's very nice of him,” the anti-Trump writer Drew Magary wrote in a Medium column titled “Where the Hell Is Barack Obama?” in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. “I'm sick of Obama staying above the fray while that fray is swallowing us whole.”

Obama did insert himself in the 2024 election, reportedly taking an aggressive behind-the-scenes role last summer in trying to nudge Biden out of the race. He delivered a showstopper speech at the Democratic National Convention and campaigned several times for Kamala Harris in the fall. But among longtime Obama admirers I've spoken with, frustration with the former president has built since Trump returned to office. While campaigning for Harris last year, Obama framed the stakes of the election in terms of a looming catastrophe. “These aren't ordinary times, and these are not ordinary elections,” he said at a campaign stop in Pittsburgh. Yet now that the impact is unfolding in the most pernicious ways, Obama seems to be resuming his ordinary chill and same old bits.

Green, of the Progressive Change Institute, told me that when Obama put out his March Madness picks this year, he texted Schultz, the Obama adviser. “Have I missed him speaking up in other places recently?” Green asked him. “He did not respond to that.” ​​(Schultz confirmed to me that he ignored the message but vowed to be “more responsive to Adam Green's texts in the future.”)

Being a former president is inherently tricky: The role is ill-defined, and peripheral by definition. Part of the trickiness is how an ex-president can remain relevant, if he wants to. This is especially so given the current president.

“I don't know that anybody is relevant in the Trump era,” Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and head of the LBJ Foundation, told me. Updegrove, who wrote a book called Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House, said that Trump has succeeded in creating a reality in which every president who came before is suspect. “All the standard rules of being an ex-president are no longer applicable,” he said.

Still, Obama never presented himself as a “standard rules” leader. This was the idea that his political rise was predicated on—that change required bold, against-the-grain thinking and uncomfortable action. Clearly, Obama still views himself this way, or at least still wants to be perceived this way. (A few years ago, he hosted a podcast with Bruce Springsteen called Renegades.)

From the July 1973 issue: The last days of the president

Stepping into the current political melee would not be an easy or comfortable role for Obama. He represents a figure of the past, which seems more and more like the ancient past as the Trump era crushes on. He is a notably long-view guy, who has spent a great deal of time composing a meticulous account of his own narrative. “We're part of a long-running story,” Obama said in 2014. “We just try to get our paragraph right.” Or thousands of paragraphs, in his case: The first installment of Obama's presidential memoir, A Promised Land, covered 768 pages and 29 hours of audio. No release date has been set for the second volume.

But this might be one of those times for Obama to take a break from the long arc of the moral universe and tend to the immediate crisis. Several Democrats I've spoken with said they wish that Obama would stop worrying so much about the “dilution factor.” While Democrats struggle to find their next phenom, Obama could be their interim boss. He could engage regularly, pointing out Trump's latest abuses. He did so earlier this spring, during an onstage conversation at Hamilton College. He was thoughtful, funny, and sounded genuinely aghast, even angry.

He could do these public dialogues much more often, and even make them thematic. Focus on Trump's serial violations of the Constitution one week (recall that Obama once taught constitutional law), the latest instance of Trump's naked corruption the next. Blast out the most scathing lines on social media. Yes, it might trigger Trump, and create more attention than Obama evidently wants. But Trump has shown that ubiquity can be a superpower, just as Biden showed that obscurity can be ruinous. People would notice.

Democrats love nothing more than to hold up Obama as their monument to Republican bad faith. Can you imagine if Obama did this? some Democrat will inevitably say whenever Trump does something tacky, cruel, or blatantly unethical (usually before breakfast). Obama could lean into this hypocrisy—tape recurring five-minute video clips highlighting Trump's latest scurrilous act and title the series “Can You Imagine If I Did This?”

Or another idea—an admittedly far-fetched one. Trump has decreed that a massive military parade be held through the streets of Washington on June 14. This will ostensibly celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary, but it also happens to fall on Trump's 79th birthday. The parade will cost an estimated $45 million, including $16 million in damage to the streets. (Can you imagine if Obama did this?) The spectacle cries out for counterprogramming. Obama could hold his own event, in Washington or somewhere nearby. It would get tons of attention and drive Trump crazy, especially if it draws a bigger crowd. Better yet, make it a parade, or “citizen's march,” something that builds momentum as it goes, the former president and community organizer leading on foot. This would be the renegade move.

Few things would fire up Democrats like a head-to-head matchup between Trump and Obama. If nothing else, it would be fun to contemplate while Democrats keep casting about for their long-delayed future. “The party needs new rising stars, and they need the room to figure out how to meet this moment, just like Obama figured out how to meet the moment 20 years ago,” Jon Favreau, a co-host of Pod Save America and former director of speechwriting for the 44th president, told me. “Unless, of course, Trump tries to run for a third term, in which case I'll be begging Obama to come out of retirement.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What to do when your partner wants an open marriage and you don't.﻿

by  Sigal Samuel

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form or email sigal.samuel@vox.com. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

My husband and I have a good relationship. We're both committed to personal growth and continual learning and have developed very strong communication skills. A couple of years ago we were exposed to some friends with an open marriage and had our own conversations about ethical non-monogamy. At first, neither of us were interested. 

Now, my husband is interested and currently is attracted to a colleague who is also into him. She's married and has no idea that he and I talk about all of their interactions. He doesn't know what her relationship agreements are with her husband.

I'm not currently interested in ethical non-monogamy. I see things in our relationship that I'd like to work on together with my husband. I want more of his attention and energy, to be frank. I don't want his attention and energy being funneled into another relationship. I don't have moral issues with ethical non-monogamy, I just don't actually see any value-add for me right now. The cost-benefit analysis leaves me saying “not now.” 

My husband admitted that he's hoping I will have a change of mind. I don't want to force his hand, although I am continuing to say very clearly what I want in my relationship. How do we reach a compromise? If he cuts ties with this woman, he has resentment towards me. If he continues to pursue something with her, I feel disrespected, and while I don't want to leave him I would feel the need to do something.

Dear Monogamously Married,

I want to start by commending you for two things. First, for your openness to discussing and exploring all this with your husband. Second, for your insistence on clearly stating what you actually want — and don't want. 

I think Erich Fromm, the 20th-century German philosopher and psychologist, would back me up in saying that you'd do well to hold tight to both those qualities. For starters, radical openness is important because, according to Fromm, the basic premise of love is freedom. He writes:

Love is a passionate affirmation of its “object.” That means that love is not an “affect” but an active striving, the aim of which is the happiness, development, and freedom of its “object.” 

In other words, love is not a feeling. It's work, and the work of love is to fully support the flourishing of the person you love. That can be scary — what if the person discovers that they're actually happier with somebody else? — which is why Fromm specifies that only someone with a strong self “which can stand alone and bear solitude” will be up for the job. He continues:

This passionate affirmation is not possible if one's own self is crippled, since genuine affirmation is always rooted in strength. The person whose self is thwarted can only love in an ambivalent way; that is, with the strong part of his self he can love, with the crippled part he must hate.

So far, it might sound like Fromm is saying that to be a good lover is to be a doormat: you just have to do whatever's best for the other person, even if it screws you over. But his view is very much the opposite. 

In fact, Fromm cautions us against both “masochistic love” and “sadistic love.” In the first, you give up your self and sacrifice your needs in order to become submerged in another person. In the second, you try to exert power over the other person. Both of these are rooted in “a deep anxiety and an inability to stand alone,” writes Fromm; whether by dissolving yourself into them or by controlling them, you're trying to make it impossible for the other person to abandon you. Both approaches are “pseudo-love.”

Feel free to email me at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. Sign up here!

So although Fromm doesn't want you to try to control your partner, and although he suggests that the philosophical ideal is for you to passionately affirm your partner's freedom, he's not advising you to do that if, for you, that will mean masochism. 

If you're not up for ethical non-monogamy — if you feel, like many people, that the idea of giving your partner free rein is too big a threat to your relationship or your own well-being — then pretending otherwise is not real love. It's just masochistic self-annihilation.

I'm personally partial to Fromm's non-possessive approach to love. But I equally appreciate his point that the philosophical ideal could become a practical bloodbath if it doesn't work for the actual humans involved. I think the question, then, is this: Do you think it's possible for you to get to a place where you genuinely feel ready for and interested in ethical non-monogamy?

It sounds like you're intellectually open to the idea, and given that you said you're committed to personal growth and continual learning, non-monogamy could offer you some benefits; lots of people who practice it say that part of its appeal lies in the growth it catalyzes. And if practicing non-monogamy makes you and/or your husband more fulfilled, it could enrich your relationship and deepen your appreciation for each other.

But right now, you've got a problem: Your husband is pushing on your boundaries by flirting with a woman even after you've expressed that you don't want him pursuing something with her. And you already feel like he isn't giving you enough attention and energy, so the prospect of having to divvy up those resources with another woman feels threatening. Fair! 

Notice, though, that that isn't a worry about non-monogamy per se — it's a worry about the state of your current monogamous relationship.

In a marriage, what partners typically want is to feel emotionally secure. But that comes from how consistently and lovingly we show up for and attune to one another, not from the relationship structure. A monogamous marriage may give us some feeling of security, but it's obviously no guarantee; some people cheat, some get divorced, and some stay loyally married while neglecting their partner emotionally. 

“Monogamy can serve as a stand-in for actual secure attachment,” writes therapist Jessica Fern in Polysecure, a book on how to build healthy non-monogamous relationships. She urges readers to take an honest look at any relationship insecurities or dissatisfactions that are being disguised by monogamy, and work with partners to strengthen the emotional experience of the relationship. 

Since you feel that your husband isn't giving you enough attention and energy, be sure to talk to him about it. Explain that it doesn't feel safe for you to open up the relationship without him doing more to be fully present with you and to make you feel understood and precious. See if he starts implementing these skills more reliably. 

In the meantime, while you two are trying to reset your relationship, it's absolutely reasonable to ask him to cool it with the colleague he's attracted to; he doesn't have to cut ties with her entirely (and may not be able to if they work together), but he can certainly avoid feeding the flames with flirtation. Right now, the fantasy of her is a distraction from the work he needs to be doing to improve the reality of your marriage. He should understand why a healthy practice of ethical non-monogamy can't emerge from a situation where he's pushing things too far with someone else before you've agreed to change the terms of your relationship (and if he doesn't, have him read Polysecure!).

It's probably a good idea for you to each do your own inner work, too. Fern, like Fromm, insists that if we want to be capable of a secure attachment with someone else, we need to cultivate that within ourselves. That means being aware of our feelings, desires, and needs, and knowing how to tend to them. Understanding your attachment style can help with this; for example, if you're anxiously attached and you very often reach out to your partner for reassurance, you can practice spending time alone.

After taking some time to work on these interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, come back together to discuss how you're feeling. Do you feel more receptive to opening up the relationship? Do you think it would add more than it would subtract? 

If the answer is “yes” or “maybe,” you can create a temporary relationship structure — or “vessel,” as Fern calls it — to help you ease into non-monogamy. One option is to adopt a staggered approach to dating, where one partner (typically the more hesitant one) starts dating new people first, and the other partner starts after a predetermined amount of time. Another option is to try a months-long experiment where both partners initially engage in certain romantic or sexual experiences that are less triggering to each other, then assess what worked and what didn't, and go from there.

If the answer is “no” — if you're not receptive to opening up your relationship — then by all means say that! Given you'll have sincerely done the work to explore whether non-monogamy works for you, your husband doesn't get to resent you. He can be sad, he can be disappointed, and he can choose to leave if the outcome is intolerable to him. But he'll have to respect you, and what's more important, you'll have to respect yourself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","How the nasty feud between Trump and Musk unfolded minute by minute","https://www.businessinsider.com/a-timeline-of-how-elon-musks-relationship-with-trump-imploded-2025-6","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 01:38:00 GMT","

Twenty-five minutes of live TV, more than a dozen posts on X, and three posts on Truth Social over the period of five hours (and counting) — that's how the already fractured friendship of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly unraveled on Thursday.

The first signs of trouble began when Musk showed opposition to Trump's spending bill, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" though he never explicitly targeted Trump.

""Shame on those who voted for it,"" Musk tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress members who voted for Trump's tax cut bill.

Trump, for his part, had stayed uncharacteristically mum about Musk's criticism of the bill.

But that all changed on Thursday morning.

Here is a minute-by-minute breakdown of how the relationship between two of the most powerful men on the planet devolved.

Musk began digging up Trump's old posts on what was then Twitter about the deficit, including one from January of 2013.

Wise words https://t.co/6juH1jEjtc

Musk unearthed another old X post by Trump from back in July 2012, presumably as a swipe at the new Republican tax bill that many economists and the congressional Budget Office said would increase the country's deficits.

I couldn't agree more! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/sZ6xgisZEA

Trump responded to Musk's attacks for the first time when answering press questions during a White House event to welcome German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

""And you know Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,"" said Trump. ""And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning; he knew it from a long time ago.""

Trump's comments about Musk continued at the press appearance.

""He knew every aspect of this bill — better than almost anybody —and he never had a problem until right after he left,"" said Trump. ""He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn't said bad things about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.""

""People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile,"" Trump continued.

""I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it, but we have it with others, too. They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour's gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile,"" he added.

Musk began a whirlwind of tweets soon after, responding in near real time to what Trump said during the press appearance.

""False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!"" Musk posed on X.

False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! https://t.co/V4ztekqd4g

Musk then began a series of tweets directed at the president beyond the bill, including saying that without him, Republicans would have lost.

Such ingratitude

Musk polls his X followers about creating a new political party ""that actually represents the 80% in the middle."" Mark Cuban quoted the post with three checkmarks.

Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?

Musk gives Trump's bill — known on paper as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" — a new name: ""Big Ugly Spending Bill.""

Not even those in Congress who had to vote on the Big Ugly Spending Bill had time to read it! https://t.co/mBOQyhQYwX

Trump responds to Musk with two consecutive posts on his own social media platform, Truth Social.

""Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!"" Trump wrote.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"" the president continued.

Musk responds to Trump's posts on Truth Social, calling them ""such an obvious lie.""

Such an obvious lie. So sad. https://t.co/sOu9vqMVfX

A minute later, Musk appeared to dare Trump to cancel government contracts with his companies.

This just gets better and better 🤣🤣Go ahead, make my day … https://t.co/APmy7cV8iL

Musk makes another accusation.

Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT!

Trump posts on Truth Social again to defend his tax bill.

""I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress,"" Trump wrote.

""It's a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn't create this mess, I'm just here to FIX IT,"" Trump added.

Musk says SpaceX will decommission its Dragon spacecraft ""immediately.""

SpaceX's Dragon spaceships transport NASA astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. Prior to partnering with SpaceX, the agency depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions.

In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW

Musk says that Trump's tariffs will ""cause a recession in the second half of this year.""

Some economists have also predicted that Trump's tariffs would hurt the economy, and Trump himself declined to rule out the chances of a recession back in March.

JPMorgan had predicted a 60% chance of a US recession after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on April 2. The bank adjusted the possibility down to below 50% recently after Trump paused most of his highest tariffs.

The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year https://t.co/rbBC11iynE

Musk retweeted what appears to be a video of Trump partying with Epstein from the 1990s, doubling down on his earlier statement about the Epstein files.

🤨 https://t.co/DTdfJWydLS

""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Business Insider in a statement. ""The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.""

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Musk took a softer tone later on Thursday night.

Some five hours after his post about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, he walked back the decision in a response to an X user.

""This is a shame this back and forth. You are both better than this. Cool off and take a step back for a couple days,"" X user Fab25june wrote on the platform.

""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon,"" Musk wrote at 9:20 p.m.

In a separate exchange on X, billionaire investor Bill Ackman encouraged Musk and Trump to make up.

""I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart,"" Ackman wrote.

""You're not wrong,"" Musk responded at 9:27 p.m.

Trump spoke about the feud on Friday morning during a phone call with CNN's Dana Bash.

""I'm not even thinking about Elon,"" Trump said. ""He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem.""

Trump doesn't intend to speak to Musk ""for a while"" and wishes Musk well, according to Bash.

Bash said people in Musk and Trump's orbit are trying to mend the rift.

The President appears to respond to Musk's allegation that he's in the so-called ""Epstein files.""

On Truth Social, Trump posted a screenshot of an X post from David Schoen, Epstein's defense attorney. Schoen said in the post that Epstein ""had no information to hurt President Trump.""

""I specifically asked him!"" Schoen wrote.

Trump reiterated that he wasn't thinking about Musk while traveling with reporters aboard Air Force One.

He wished Musk the best of luck on his Tesla business.

""I mean, I hope he does well with Tesla,"" he said.

Musk found a name for his new political party proposal: ""The America Party.""

The America Party https://t.co/hO5S8Kjb5O

In a separate post on X, Musk said the ""people have spoken"" as the polling results showed that 80% of the 5.6 million participants voted ""Yes"" to creating a party that represents ""the middle.""

Musk said on X that he would apologize to Trump ""profusely as soon as there is a full dump of the Epstein files.""

The CEO was responding to a post from James Fishback, an investor who proposed the idea of DOGE dividend checks, who posted on X that Musk should send Trump a ""full-throated apology.""

""You can substantively disagree with the President on policy, but you should not have baselessly and personally attacked him,"" Fishback wrote.

Trump and Musk appeared to extend each other an olive branch — at least for a brief moment.

Likewise

The White House rapid response account on X posted a clip of Trump's gaggle with the press on Air Force One, highlighting the president saying he wishes Musk well.

""Likewise,"" Musk said in response at 10:46 p.m.

Musk deleted some of the X posts he made on Thursday, including one in which he said Trump was named in the Epstein files. He also deleted a tweet announcing his intention to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.

However, other the X posts Musk made, including criticism of the tax bill, remain on his account.

Trump told NBC News in a phone interview that he has no plans to amend his relationship with Musk and threatened that there would be ""serious consequences"" if the Tesla CEO funded Democratic candidates.

Strong demand from yield-hungry investors is driving a surge in developing-world bond sales as borrowers race to secure financing ahead of any further wobbles in global markets.

Since the beginning of the year, emerging-market governments and companies have sold $331 billion in debt denominated in hard currencies like the dollar and euro, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is the fastest pace in four years and already surpasses the total in the first half of 2024. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Hotels, airlines and the rest of the industry are chasing “aspirational” vacationers now willing to shell out big bucks. But what happens when they stop?

Checking in.

When you go on vacation, do you ever treat yourself to an upgraded airline seat? Or book the (admittedly cheapest) room at a five-star hotel? Maybe splurge on a spa day or celebratory Michelin-starred meal? If any of this sounds familiar, you may be what the travel industry calls an “aspirational” luxury traveler. And much to the industry's potential dismay, you're also inflating an economic bubble that may be about to burst.

According to McKinsey, the aspirational set, defined as those with between $100,000 and $1 million in net worth, now accounts for 35% of the global luxury travel market. In 2023, they spent $84 billion on high-end vacations, a figure expected to grow to $107 billion by 2028. That purchasing power has helped turn luxury travel from a glamorous niche into a major profit center, sparking a race among airlines, hotels, cruise lines, tour companies and the rest to cater to and capture this market segment. But what happens when economic uncertainty suddenly brings aspirations back down to earth?  ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

A Palestinian militia operating with tacit approval from Israel has surfaced in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip to challenge the rule of Hamas, which threatened a crackdown in turn.

The Popular Forces says its mission is to rescue Gazans from starvation and violence exacerbated by Hamas. The militia's existence was publicized 20 months into Israel's offensive in Gaza, which has inflicted significant damage but failed to eliminate Hamas.

Israel's government on Sunday vowed to prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip.

Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel wouldn't allow anyone to break its naval blockade of the Palestinian territory, which he said was aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms.

""To the antisemitic Greta and her fellow Hamas propagandists — I will say this clearly: You should turn back, because you will not make it to Gaza,"" he said in a statement.

Thunberg, a climate campaigner, is among 12 activists aboard the Madleen, which is operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. The vessel departed Sicily last Sunday on a mission that aims to break the sea blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid, while raising awareness over the growing humanitarian crisis 20 months into the Israel-Hamas war.

The activists had said they planned to reach Gaza's territorial waters as early as Sunday.

Thiago Ávila, a Brazilian activist on board the boat, posted a video on social media Sunday afternoon saying someone appeared to be jamming their tracking and communication devices about 160 nautical miles from Gaza.

Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, is among the others onboard. She has been barred from entering Israel because of her opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians.

After a 2 1/2-month total blockade aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel started allowing some basic aid into Gaza last month, but humanitarian workers have warned of famine unless the blockade is lifted and Israel ends its military offensive.

An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after another of the group's vessels was attacked by two drones while sailing in international waters off Malta. The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship.

Israel and Egypt have imposed varying degrees of blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Critics of the blockade say it amounts to collective punishment of Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.

Israel sealed Gaza off from all aid in the early days of the war ignited by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but later relented under U.S. pressure. In early March, shortly before Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas, the country again blocked all imports, including food, fuel and medicine.

Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages, more than half of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas is still holding 55 hostages, more than half of them believed to be dead.

Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which has said women and children make up most of the dead. It doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants.

The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of the territory's population, leaving people there almost completely dependent on international aid.

In this article

The Walt Disney Company and Universal, two of the biggest names in theme parks, are both undertaking historic expansions to their experiences businesses.

Universal Orlando Resort in May opened the gates to Epic Universe, its fourth theme park at its flagship resort. Epic cost an estimated $7 billion to build, according to numbers provided by the University of Central Florida. Brian Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Universal parent company Comcast, called it the ""single-largest investment Comcast NBCUniversal has made in its theme park business"".

""It's so different than anything else that we've ever built, but certainly I think it's different than anything anyone's ever built,"" said Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando President and COO.

Epic's opening coincides with an expansion of Universal Orlando's resort portfolio, adding three Loews hotels to bring its total to 11 operated on the property. Universal is betting that the addition of Epic will turn the resort into a full-week destination, a distinction that is normally reserved for its crosstown neighbor, Walt Disney World.

Not to be upstaged, Disney is working on a historic undertaking of its own. 

In 2023, Disney announced plans to invest $60 billion in its experiences segment, which includes theme parks, cruise ships and consumer products. Of that investment, $30 billion will go to its domestic theme parks, Disney World and Disneyland.

""We've got a lion's share of that investment coming to us,"" said Michael Hundgen, portfolio executive creative producer with Walt Disney Imagineering. ""It's about finding what strikes the best creative intent in the most value oriented way possible.""

These investments come at a time when both Disney and Comcast are paring down or spinning off their linear TV segments, an arena that has seen volatility in recent years. By comparison, theme parks have been consistent revenue drivers for the companies in the post-COVID tourism bounce.

However, the timing of these openings and expansions could prove challenging for both theme parks. Epic's opening summer coincides with fears of a travel slowdown due to economic volatility.

""If you're uncertain how the economy is going to develop, then you're going to try to be more cautious in your spending,"" said Jorge Ridderstaat, associate professor at UCF's Rosen College of Hospitality Management.

Will these massive investments pay off for Disney and Universal? Or could a tourism downturn upset Orlando's 'Epic' summer. Watch the video above to learn more.

Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.

Russia said on Sunday its forces had advanced to the edge of the east-central Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk amid a public row between Moscow and Kyiv over peace negotiations and the return of thousands of bodies of soldiers who fell in the war.

Amid talk of peace, the war is stepping up with Russian forces grabbing more territory in Ukraine and Kyiv unfurling high-profile drone and sabotage attacks on Russia's nuclear-capable bomber fleet and, according to Moscow, on railways.

Russia, which controls a little under one-fifth of Ukrainian territory, has taken more than 190 square km (73 square miles) of the Sumy region of eastern Ukraine in less than a month, according to pro-Ukrainian open source maps.

Now, according to the Russian defense ministry, units of the 90th Tank Division of the Central Grouping of Russian forces have reached the western frontier of Ukraine's Donetsk region and are attacking the adjacent Dnipropetrovsk region.

""The enemy does not abandon its intentions to enter the Dnipropetrovsk region,"" Ukraine's Southern Defence Forces said on Telegram. ""Our soldiers are courageously and professionally holding their section of the front, disrupting the occupier's plans. This work does not stop for a minute.""

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said the Dnipropetrovsk offensive showed that if Ukraine did not want to accept the reality of Russia's territorial gains in peace talks then Moscow's forces would advance further.

The pro-Ukrainian Deep State map showed Russian forces very close to the Dnipropetrovsk region, which had a population of more than 3 million before the war, and advancing on the city of Kostyantynivka in the Donetsk region from several directions.

A Ukrainian military spokesman, Dmytro Zaporozhets, said that Russian forces were trying to ""build a bridgehead for an attack"" on Kostyantynivka, an important logistical hub for the Ukrainian army.

Russia on Saturday accused Ukraine of delaying the swap of prisoners of war and return of the bodies of 12,000 dead soldiers, though Ukraine denied those claims.

Russia said on Sunday it was moving bodies towards the border and television showed refrigerated trucks containing the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers on the road in the Bryansk region.

Ukraine accused Russia of playing propaganda games and said that the exchange of prisoners of war and the bodies of fallen soldiers was scheduled for next week. Russia said Ukraine was playing politics with the dead.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he wants an end to the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two, on Thursday likened it to a fight between young children and indicated that he might have to simply let the conflict play out.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that he did not think Ukraine's leaders wanted peace, after accusing them of ordering a bombing in Bryansk, western Russia, that killed seven people and injured 115 a day before talks in Turkey.

Ukraine, which has not commented on the attack on a Bryansk bridge, has similarly accused Moscow of not seriously seeking peace, citing as evidence Russian resistance to an immediate ceasefire.

Russia is demanding international recognition of Crimea, a peninsula annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014, and four other regions of Ukraine that Moscow has claimed as its own territory. Ukraine would have to withdraw its forces from all of them.

Russia controlled 113,273 square km, or 18.8%, of Ukrainian territory as of June 7, according to the Deep State map. That is an area bigger than the U.S. state of Virginia.

The areas under Russian control include Crimea, more than 99% of the Luhansk region, over 70% of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, all in the east or southeast, and fragments of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions in the northeast.

Putin told Trump on Wednesday that he would have to respond to Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia's bomber fleet and the bombings of the railways.

The United States believes that Putin's threatened retaliation against Ukraine over its attacks has not happened yet in earnest and is likely to be a significant, multi-pronged strike, U.S. officials told Reuters.

Russia also hit the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Friday evening and overnight with drones, missiles and guided bombs, killing at least four people and injuring more than 60, including a baby, local officials said on Saturday.

Russia also said it had downed 61 Ukrainian drones overnight on Sunday in the Moscow region. Two major airports serving Moscow were closed temporarily.

California National Guard troops started arriving in Los Angeles on Sunday morning, hours after President Donald Trump signed an order to deploy 2,000 service members in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles.

""Elements of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team from the California National Guard have begun deploying to the Los Angeles area, with some already on the ground,"" U.S. Northern Command wrote on X.

Trump's order, announced by the White House Saturday night, comes amid continued clashes between demonstrators and federal agents executing immigration enforcement actions in L.A., which have led to more than 100 arrests. 

""In recent days, violent mobs have attacked ICE Officers and Federal Law Enforcement Agents carrying out basic deportation operations in Los Angeles, California,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

Leavitt told NBC News that Trump is federalizing part of California's National Guard that would otherwise report to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Presidents have the authority to do so under limited circumstances.

Newsom slammed Trump's move, calling it ""purposefully inflammatory"" and said it ""will only escalate tensions.""

""LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice,"" Newsom wrote on X. ""We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need.""

""This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust,"" he said.

Trump and Newsom spoke on Friday for approximately 40 minutes, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC.

The White House on Saturday showed no signs that it was preparing to de-escalate the situation.

On the contrary, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to deploy U.S. Marines in addition to the members of the National Guard.

""If violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert,"" he posted on X.

Trump on Truth Social early Sunday morning wrote, ""great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence, clashes and unrest.""

His post came before the troops he ordered officially arrived in the area.

Trump spent Saturday night attending an Ultimate Fighting Championship match at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J.

The White House also released a formal memo from the president to the secretary of Defense, the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security.

""To the extent that protests or acts of violence directly inhibit the execution of the laws, they constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States,"" the memo stated.

""In light of these incidents and credible threats of continued violence, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby call into Federal service members and units of the National Guard.""

Vice President JD Vance called the protestors ""insurrectionists"" in a post on X.

""Insurrectionists carrying foreign flags are attacking immigration enforcement officers, while one half of America's political leadership has decided that border enforcement is evil,"" Vance wrote.

Labor leader David Huerta, president of the SEIU California, was injured Friday when he was arrested while observing the protests. The Homeland Security Department alleged that Huerta was ""obstructing"" federal officers.

In this article

Macro uncertainty is keeping the market volatile, but investors ought to keep their focus on stocks that can provide compelling long-term returns.

Top Wall Street analysts' recommendations can help inform investors as they pick the right stocks that can weather short-term pressures with solid execution and generate impressive returns over the long term.

With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is this week's first stock pick. The company reported market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Despite chip export restrictions, Nvidia remains confident about the demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Following the Q1 print, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reiterated a buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $170. The analyst noted that the company delivered solid revenue despite lost sales related to the H20 chip export restrictions on shipments to China. However, NVDA's margins and EPS were hit by the $4.5 billion write-down related to H20 inventory write-downs.

Excluding H20 shipments, Sur projects that the July quarter data center revenue is growing at about 16% quarter over quarter, driven by continued robust spending by customers on their AI/accelerated compute projects and persistent strength in production and deployment ramp of Nvidia's Blackwell platform. 

The analyst added that the demand for Nvidia's Blackwell platform is very strong and is expected to continue to surpass supply for many quarters. Sur believes that management has good visibility for solid growth through calendar year 2026, backed by recent mega data center deals (including those with UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan) and the end of the diffusion rule.  

Overall, Sur concluded that Nvidia is staying ahead of competitors with its silicon, hardware and software platforms and an impressive ecosystem, ""further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time."" 

Sur ranks No. 38 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 23.4%. See Nvidia Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

We move to cybersecurity company Zscaler (ZS). The company's results for the fiscal third quarter surpassed expectations, fueled by the demand for its Zero Trust Exchange platform and the growing need for AI security.

In reaction to the upbeat results, JPMorgan analyst Brian Essex reaffirmed a buy rating on Zscaler stock and boosted the price target to $292 from $275, saying, ""We are encouraged by the strength in the quarter, particularly when off-calendar peers seemed to struggle with macro headwinds a bit more than expected.""

The analyst noted that Zscaler raised its full-year outlook for revenue, profitability and billings. He explained that the company's performance was backed by encouraging contributions from emerging products like Zero Trust Everywhere, Data Security Everywhere and Agentic Operations. In fact, these emerging products are approaching $1 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR).

Essex noted that large customer momentum continued to be solid in Q3 FY25, with the number of customers with over $1 million of ARR increasing 23% year over year, keeping Zscaler on track to exceed $3 billion of ARR in the fiscal fourth quarter. He emphasized that macro commentary was better than anticipated, as management stated that the company didn't witness a ""softer April,"" though IT budgets remain tight.

Commenting on Zscaler's Red Canary acquisition, Essex views this deal as encouraging, given that it is expected to enable the company to leverage the IP (intellectual property) and threat intel capabilities of Red Canary.

Essex ranks No. 652 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.6%. See Zscaler Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Customer relationship management software provider Salesforce (CRM) recently reported better-than-projected revenue and earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and raised its full-year forecast. The company also announced the acquisition of data management company Informatica for $8 billion.

Following the results, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reiterated a buy rating on CRM stock with a price target of $375. Wood noted that the company's Q1 FY26 revenue and current remaining performance obligations surpassed expectations.

""We think its renewed focus on accelerating sales capacity growth is a strong demand signal & should unlock higher growth next year,"" said Wood.

The analyst highlighted that AI adoption is ramping for Salesforce, with Data Cloud and AI ARR rising more than 120% year over year and reflecting strong early traction for the company's Agentforce offering. Wood noted that 30% of net new Agentforce bookings came from existing customers expanding their usage. The analyst stated he is encouraged by the scale and velocity of Data Cloud, which he considers to be a leading indicator of Agentforce adoption as customers gear up to power agentic workflows.

Wood contends that with margins now in the mid-30% range, Salesforce is focusing more on growth by re-deploying AI cost savings. Notably, the company is increasing its workforce more aggressively, following a flat sales headcount in the last two to three years. The analyst sees this as a signal of positive demand, with management indicating that pipelines are growing by the double-digits.

Wood ranks No. 176 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.8%. See Salesforce Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

The European startup scene was recently shaken by a LinkedIn debate with some venture capitalists applying pressure on founders to embrace a culture of overwork to compete on a global stage.

The ""996"" work culture reigns supreme in China and has been adopted by various tech giants including Jack Ma's Alibaba and Bytedance's TikTok, but the system has also been the subject of much protest in recent years. Tech workers in Europe told CNBC in 2021 that they're turning down job offers, rejecting interviews, or even quitting their roles, upon learning of TikTok's 996 work culture.

Sebastian Becker, general partner at Switzerland-based VC company Redalpine added to the debate on LinkedIn by addressing the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has called for removal of the legal work limit of eight hours per day in Germany in a bid to increase efficiency, while keeping the 40-hour week.

Becker said Merz' proposal doesn't go far enough, as ""40 hours a week won't cut it.""

""In Silicon Valley, 60-70 hour weeks aren't the exception — they even have a term for it: 996 — 9am to 9pm, six days a week... we can have the same amount of smart, ambitious people, but if we're consistently being outworked, we won't win,"" Becker said.

Index Ventures Partner Martin Mignot in London explained on LinkedIn that 996 originated in China and has ""quietly become the norm"" at startups internationally.

Part of the reason behind this most recent push is that there's a persistent view that Europe's tech and startup scene is lagging behind the U.S. and China, both of which have produced tech giants and are known for intense work cultures.

However, Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, told CNBC Make It that these views are outdated as Europe has produced deca-corns in recent years— companies worth more than $10 billion including Klarna, Revolut, Wise, and Checkout.com. The continent has yet to produce a trillion-dollar tech firm like Nvidia.

""The European tech market and ecosystem is keeping up today with the U.S. and Asia... back in the 1980s the European tech scene was behind the tech scene on the West Coast of the US, but that's not the case now,"" Chandratillake said in an interview.

The calls for Europe to adopt the 996 work culture sparked a wave of backlash. CNBC spoke with seven European startup founders and VCs on why they disagree.

The obsession with China's 996 or Silicon Valley's 24/7 work culture emerges from a glorification of hustle culture in the startup landscape, founders and VCs said.  

""It's about a fetishization of overwork rather than smart work…it's a myth,"" Chandratillake said. ""California is very good at telling stories and there's a lot of mythmaking around the concept of what startups look like…. there is hard work involved but if you really spend time in that ecosystem, you will discover that lots of people work really hard, but there are also periods where they don't work.""

Nina Mohanty, a Silicon Valley native and founder of London-based Bloom Money, said there are actually ""lasting effects and unintended consequences"" to adopting an aggressive overwork culture,

""You only have to think about Revolut and the culture that they have is probably the closest that we've seen in Europe to the 996 culture, and they struggled,"" Mohanty told CNBC. ""Their churn rate was incredibly high within their team, and they even struggled to get their banking license, and their culture was actually cited as one of those reasons.""

For its part, Revolut told CNBC it operates in a ""high-growth, high-performance environment.""

""In line with this, we've evolved how we support our people: through value-based behaviours, structured development, and a culture that's collaborative, challenging, and built for scale,"" a spokesperson from Revolut said.

Noa Khamallah, general partner at Don't Quit Ventures, pointed out that there's ""no need for 996"" and that these values are often at odds with both the European mindset and regulation.

""Europe's most successful companies — from Spotify to SAP to ASML — didn't achieve dominance through overwork but through sustainable innovation cultures,"" Khamallah said.

He offered the examples of Silicon Valley's Uber and Meta, both companies that expanded into Europe and faced massive regulatory pushback.

""These examples reveal how Silicon Valley's 'move fast and break things' ethos often breaks against European values around worker rights, privacy, and sustainable business practices,"" Khamallah said.

An always-on culture decreases retention and creates a revolving door of talent, Sarah Wernér, co-founder of Husmus, told CNBC.

""Overwork today is a productivity crisis tomorrow,"" Wernér said. ""Personally, I hope my competitors are doing 996. It makes poaching great people a lot easier when they decide they've had enough.""

Dama Sathianathan, a senior partner at Bethnal Green Ventures said it's unhelpful to ""prescribe"" working hours, especially if it means putting workers' wellbeing at risk.

""Optimizing labor doesn't always lead to better productivity, or help with differentiating from other companies long-term, if you've made work devoid of meaning,"" Sathianathan explained.

Meanwhile, the youngest generation at work are less likely to put up with overworking and tend to prioritize work-life balance.

Jas Schembri-Stothart, founder of Luna, a health and wellness app for teen girls, said 996 will drive young talent away from European startups.

""People may tolerate overwork for a while, but eventually it leads to churn and even resentment, especially with Gen Z and younger millennials, there's much less tolerance for toxic hustle cultures,"" Schembri-Stothart said.

Founders insist that instead of increasing working hours, startups need more funding and resources to position themselves as key players in the global startup scene.

""What Europe really needs isn't more hustle-porn it's more aggressive funding,"" Wernér said. ""With the right level of capital, our startups can hire enough talent to work intensely without breaking themselves. If a team of 10 is burning out to keep up with a 50-person U.S. VC or Chinese government-backed startup, the problem isn't their stamina, it's their cap table.""

In fact, since 2015 Europe's tech startups have missed out on nearly $375 billion in growth-stage funding, with founders losing out on a potential $300 billion in European investments, according to Atomico's State of European Tech report published in 2024. Additionally, one in two companies raising funding turn to the U.S. for capital rather than Europe.

""What European startups really need is access to the right resources — funding, talent, and support — to grow, innovate quickly, and scale effectively,"" Schembri-Stothart said. ""The venture landscape in the U.S. is a different ballgame altogether, and it's tough to compete with that without a stronger ecosystem here.

Founders acknowledged that the startup life requires intense hustle and grind, but it's a more nuanced picture than just adopting 996.

Timothy Armoo, co-founder and former CEO of Fanbytes, an influencer marketing firm that he sold for eight figures in 2022, told CNBC that he's a ""huge supporter"" of this new 996 push, but admitted that timing is key.

""I think there are seasons but I also think that if you are a first-time founder or if your primary goal is basically wealth creation, I'll be very candid, if this is your season, and you're stepping back, then you're not serious about it,"" he said.

Armoo said there are no excuses because AI allows entrepreneurs to be maximally efficient as it can reduce certain time-consuming manual tasks.

Meanwhile, Bloom Money's Mohanty, said that when she's not sleeping, she's working. ""I think early stage teams tend to almost unknowingly or without actually saying it, work the 996 life, because when you are early stage, you just have to hustle harder with less, and especially if you're the founder, you're always on and always working, and it can be very, very difficult to turn off.""

Schembri-Stothart draws the line at exploiting her team to produce more work. ""It's my choice to work at the weekend, but I'd never expect that on my team, it's definitely not glorified to push your teams to breaking point.

Silicon Valley tech exec Dion McKenzie warned that expectations of a 996 culture could make VC funding even more out of reach for early-stage startups.

""My fear is that as these new norms and trends become the status quo and benchmarks for getting funded, it excludes so many brilliant founders that value their mental health and/or can't commit to a 996 due to caregiving responsibilities or being a parent,"" Mckenzie said.

LAFAYETTE, Ind. — President Donald Trump has said he wants to bolster manufacturing jobs and other technical employment in the United States. But in the aviation industry, finding skilled workers to make airplanes and engines — and maintaining those jobs for years to come — has been a struggle.

The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic in the U.S. is 54, and 40% of them are over the age of 60, according to a joint 2024 report from the Aviation Technician Education Council and consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which cites Federal Aviation Administration data. The U.S. will be short 25,000 aircraft technicians by 2028, according to the report.

""A lot of them were hired on in the '80s and early '90s. You just start doing some math and you start saying at some point they're going to retire,"" said American Airlines Chief Operating Officer David Seymour, who oversees the carrier's more than 6,000 daily flights.

To boost their ranks, airlines and big manufacturers of airplanes and their thousands of components are trying to get more younger people interested in the field.

The industry was already facing a retirement wave when Covid hit, and companies cut or offered buyouts to experienced workers — from those who build aircraft to those who maintain them to keep flying.

""People forget that the aerospace industry was in a pretty serious ramp at the time pre-Covid. And then frankly, of course overnight we went from ramping to zero demand over time. And so we lost a lot of talent,"" said Christian Meisner, GE Aerospace's chief human resources officer.

GE, along with its French joint venture partner Safran, makes the bestselling engines that power Boeing and Airbus top-selling jetliners, and has been ramping up hiring, though it is also dependent on a web of smaller suppliers that have also been getting back up to speed since the pandemic.

Meisner said that the company has a strong retention rate and that some employees earn their FAA licenses to work on airplane engines or airframes on the job. At GE's engine plant in Lafayette, Indiana, about an hour outside of Indianapolis, base pay averages between $80,000 and $90,000 a year, based on qualifications and experience, the company said.

Median pay for aircraft technicians or mechanics was $79,140 a year in the U.S. in 2024, compared with a nationwide median income of $49,500, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The agency projects 13,400 job openings in the field each year over the next decade.

American's Seymour said that with new pay raises, technicians could make $130,000 a year at the top of their pay scale in nine years at the carrier.

While many experts don't expect jobs that have been shipped abroad like clothing manufacturing to come back to the U.S., high-value sectors tend to pay much more and are more likely to stick around. But hiring can still be difficult in a sector that is seen as politically important and symbolic to the country's economic power.

The impending worker shortages aren't just for those who repair aircraft and engines. A shortfall of air traffic controllers has also stifled airline growth and raised concerns about safety in recent years. The Trump administration has said it will raise wages and ramp up hiring to try to reverse yearslong shortfalls.

Manufacturing is about 9% of U.S. employment but ""we all have a bit of a fetish with manufacturing because we focus on it more and than other sectors,"" said Gordon Hanson, a professor of urban policy at Harvard University.

The U.S. unemployment rate in May held steady at 4.2%.

One problem with manufacturing jobs, Hanson said, is that workers aren't very geographically mobile, and if factories reopen or hiring ramps up, that could make it harder to attract employees from other places.

""You're asking the local labor market to supply workers,"" Hanson added.

Wages for technicians that repair aircraft at airlines, as well as big manufacturers like Boeing, have gone up in recent years, with skilled workers still in short supply and travel and airplane demand robust. But some workers said that's not enough.

""We need to increase wages,"" said Sarah MacLeod, executive director of the Aeronautical Repair Station Association. Most of the companies the association works with are small businesses. 

She warned that the ""entire world is going to feel this workforce shortage. You already can't get your houses built. You already can't do XYZ. I think and pray that aerospace can actually lead the recovery of that.""

Getting FAA licenses can take years, but the reward can be high. Some students are considering forgoing traditional four-year college degrees straight out of high school to get into the industry.

""I'm thinking about going to college, but it's whichever really comes first. If they give me an opportunity to go to the airlines, I'd like to do that,"" said Sam Mucciardi, a senior at Aviation High School in Queens, New York.

The public school offers its roughly 2,000 students the option to stay on for a fifth year to earn their FAA licenses with training at the school. 

""I stay late after school every day to work on the planes and, probably a little bit too much ... but I still really enjoy it,"" Mucciardi said. ""That's what I put my all my heart into.""

The school, which has been teaching students how to maintain aircraft since the 1930s, is fielding more demand from airlines in recent years.

""After a program like ours, typically you'd go to the regional airlines first, like the Endeavors, the Envoys,"" said Aviation High School Principal Steven Jackson. ""Lately, because of the huge technician need, there's been more students going directly into American, Delta, United, but you have the whole range."" He said the school received about 5,000 applications this year from students.

Students at the school learn at the campus in the Sunnyside section of Queens but also at other facilities at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Seymour said American has teamed up with high schools before, but is now going even younger and working with some junior highs to raise awareness about the career path.

""It is getting into the high schools and showing that a career in aerospace as an engineer or frankly, on a production floor, is not your grandparents' manufacturing. It is high tech,"" GE's Meisner said. ""You're talking about laser-guided machine, precision machining operations, exotic coatings and metals.""

Krystal Godinez, who has lived in the Lafayette area for about 14 years, graduated last summer from GE's first apprentice program class at the facility after about two years. She said she previously worked in the automotive industry.

""I feel like what I do here … definitely does matter. It's like taking all those extra steps, make sure everything is correct,"" she said. ""We're there to kind of keep people safe out there and make them feel safe.""

American's Seymour was optimistic that younger people are changing their tune.

""There was a period of time when people said 'I want a computer, I want tech,'"" he said. ""There are people who want to get their hands dirty.""

Colombian Senator Miguel Uribe, a potential presidential contender, survived an initial operation for his injuries after being shot in Bogota on Saturday, according to his wife and the hospital treating him, although he remains in intensive care.

Uribe, 39, is a member of the opposition right-wing Democratic Center party and was shot in the head during a campaign event in a public park in the Fontibon neighborhood.

A boy under 15 years of age was arrested after the shooting, the attorney general's office said in a statement on Saturday, adding he was carrying a 9-millimeter Glock-type pistol.

The government said it is investigating if there were other potential perpetrators. Leftist President Gustavo Petro urged an investigation into who had ordered the attack in remarks late on Saturday.

Campaigning is just beginning for the country's 2026 presidential election and Uribe, who is from a prominent political family, does not have a well-known platform so far.

It was unclear why he was targeted in the attack. Though he has talked about the need to improve security and about having personally suffered in the country's conflict, many other potential candidates, including others from his party, have also said steps must be taken to tackle crime.

Uribe's grandfather was president from 1978 to 1982, while his mother, journalist Diana Turbay, was kidnapped in 1990 by an armed group under the command of the late cartel leader Pablo Escobar. She was killed during a rescue operation in 1991.

""Miguel came out of surgery, he made it. Every hour is a critical hour. He fought his first battle, and it went well,"" his wife Maria Claudia Tarazona told local media on Sunday. ""This will take time.""

The couple are parents to a young son.

In a statement, the Santa Fe Foundation hospital where Uribe was treated said he had procedures on his head and his left thigh, and remained in intensive care as doctors seek to stabilize his condition.

Uribe's party said in a statement that armed subjects shot him from behind. Videos on social media showed a man, identified as Uribe, being tended to after the shooting. He appeared to be bleeding from his head.

Bogota's mayor, Carlos Galan, whose own presidential candidate father was assassinated in 1989, addressed journalists outside the hospital overnight, saying he had asked for increased protection for all candidates in Bogota and for Uribe's family.

The Colombian government is offering some $730,000 as a reward for information in the case.

""For now there is nothing more than hypothesis,"" Petro said, adding that failures in security protocols would also be looked into. Uribe had the bodyguard protection provided for senators and other officials.

Petro sympathized with Uribe's family in a message on X, saying: ""I don't know how to ease your pain. It is the pain of a mother lost, and of a homeland.""

People gathered outside the hospital in northern Bogota, staging candlelight vigils and praying, while others carried Colombian flags. A march of support was planned for Sunday.

Several nations on Sunday including Brazil, Italy, Spain, Uruguay and Paraguay condemned the attack, as did the Venezuelan government and opposition.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that the U.S. ""condemns in the strongest possible terms the attempted assassination"" of Uribe, blaming Petro's ""inflammatory rhetoric"" for the violence.

Petro was an outspoken critic of U.S. President Donald Trump's deportation policies earlier this year, but has been less vocal since Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on the Andean country.

Colombia has for decades been embroiled in a conflict between leftist rebels, criminal groups descended from right-wing paramilitaries, and the government.

Self-made millionaire, author and TV host Ramit Sethi knows a thing or two about money. He's even published books on how to get rich and how couples can manage their finances together.

But his own financial journey hasn't been perfect. He recently sat down with his wife, Cassandra, for a special episode of his Money for Couples podcast where they answered some of the same questions he asks couples every week in an interview with friend Julie Nguyen.

The Sethis have been married since 2018, and Ramit has often shared tidbits about their relationship on his podcast and in his books, highlighting some of the strategies they've used to navigate combining finances, earning different incomes, creating shared goals and more.

On the podcast, Ramit and Cassandra agreed on the most difficult money conversation they've ever had as a couple: negotiating their prenup before getting married.

""I'm sweating thinking about it right now,"" Ramit said. ""[The] first time I brought it up, I remember I had talked to so many people, gotten advice, planned what I was gonna say and I was very nervous about it.""

Cassandra received the idea of a prenup well, he said, but things went south from there. 

Many money experts recommend getting a prenuptial agreement, even to those with modest finances. A prenup is a legal contract outlining how a couple wants their finances handled in the event of a divorce. Without one, couples could wind up leaving those decisions — like who gets certain assets or who pays spousal support — up to a judge.

Prenups are for everyone, money expert Suze Orman told CNBC Make It in 2020, and individuals should feel comfortable bringing it up with their partner.

""If you cannot talk money to the person that you are about to marry, you are doomed for failure because money is going to run through your relationship more than anything else,"" she said.

When Ramit brought up the idea of a prenup up to Cassandra, he had already started his business and written his first book on money. Cassandra didn't know much about them, but was willing to learn. And while they both agreed to get a prenup, their negotiations turned contentious due to differing expectations and understandings of money.

Ramit saw the negotiations as strictly financial and tried to let the numbers speak for themselves. Cassandra, on the other hand, was more tapped into the emotional considerations, which Ramit wasn't really thinking about. 

Ramit tried to make a ""generous"" offer in his prenup proposal, he said, but Cassandra was more concerned with their relationship and ensuring their feelings and emotions were aligned.

""We started going back and forth and I was very confused, very hurt because I'm like, 'I'm not trying to trick anybody here,'"" Ramit said.

Cassandra eventually suggested the couple sit down with a therapist and talk through their emotions to figure out where things weren't aligning. The therapist asked how they each view money.

""That really opened up conversations that we hadn't been able to have because my answer was like, 'growth, of course, look at the compounding.' And her answer was, 'safety,'"" Ramit said.

Despite the turmoil, the process helped the couple deepen their relationship by revealing not just how they each think about money, but also how they should be communicating those feelings with each other, they said.

While Ramit was more focused on the actual numbers, Cassandra didn't have the financial knowledge to get a sense of security from the amounts in their savings and investment accounts.

""I'll never forget something Ramit said to me during that time. You were like, 'I really need you to get better at money,'"" she said. ""I took that very seriously because deep down inside I was like, 'I know I'm not that great at money. I could get better.'""

While she worked on learning about prenups and managing money in general, Ramit acknowledged he needed to improve at talking about emotions so he could more clearly communicate where he was coming from and better understand Cassandra's perspective.

""In retrospect, you were not asking me to pull out a f------ spreadsheet. You were feeling this,"" he said. ""Looking back, I needed to listen to what you were saying. I should have been asking more questions.""

Now seven years into their marriage, they still consider what they learned from their prenup negotiations the most valuable lessons they've learned from each other, they said.

Cassandra said Ramit's mindset around abundance and trusting your earning power ""has been really eye-opening."" And Ramit is grateful to have learned from Cassandra the importance of checking in on your feelings and talking about them.

""It has really changed the way that I relate to people a lot,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Speaker Johnson hopes Musk and Trump can 'reconcile' their differences after public fallout","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/08/speaker-johnson-hopes-musk-and-trump-can-reconcile-their-differences-after-public-fallout.html","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 15:23:13 GMT","



House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday that he hopes President Donald Trump and Elon Musk can ""reconcile"" after their public fallout last week.

""There's a lot of emotion involved in it, but it's in the interest of the country for everybody to work together,"" the Louisiana Republican said on ABC News' ""This Week.""

Johnson said that he has not spoken with Musk about the GOP-led ""big, beautiful bill"" since last Monday.

Musk last week went on a rant against the multitrillion-dollar spending package that narrowly passed the House, calling it a ""disgusting abomination"" that would lead to exploding federal deficits.

On Sunday, Johnson brushed aside the Tesla's CEO's criticisms of the bill.

""I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world, what we're trying to do is help hardworking Americans,"" he said.

The spending bill is now with the Senate.

Musk's vocal opposition to the legislation was in part what triggered the public clash between Trump and the billionaire SpaceX founder, CNBC previously reported.

The two men have not spoken since their feud, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Sunday on ""Fox Sunday Morning Futures,"" adding that she doesn't think Trump ""intends to.""

Trump also told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Saturday that he was not interested in repairing his relationship with Musk following their spat, signaling that their rift could be irreversible.

Musk was the largest donor of the 2024 presidential campaign, and his super PAC spent roughly $200 million to propel Trump to the White House.

In the midst of Musk's criticisms against the bill, he threatened to ""fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.""

But Trump warned Saturday that Musk would pay ""very serious consequences"" if he funds Democratic candidates challenging Republicans who support the bill.

Johnson, a loyal Trump ally, echoed the president's remarks, saying it would be a ""big mistake"" if Musk were to back Democratic candidates.

 “Send more Orange,” Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor wrote on X, signaling another Bitcoin purchase from the company. 

Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor posted a chart of the company's Bitcoin holdings on June 8, signaling a possible upcoming acquisition.

On June 8, Saylor posted “Send more Orange” on X. Saylor's cryptic posts are often followed by announcements of new Bitcoin (BTC) purchases. If Strategy follows up the post with another BTC buy, it will mark the ninth week of consecutive Bitcoin purchases from the company. 

The post comes shortly after the company purchased an additional 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1 for around $75 million at an average price of $106,495 per coin, bringing the company's total Bitcoin holdings to 580,955 BTC, currently valued at approximately $61.4 billion.

Data from SaylorTracker shows that the company is up approximately 50% on its investment, amounting to around $20.6 billion in unrealized profit. 

Saylor's X post follows Strategy's announcement of a $1 billion stock offering, quadrupling its previously announced $250 million raise. The company said it will use the proceeds to fund additional Bitcoin purchases and general corporate expenses.

The offering involves 11.76 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock priced at $85 per share. Strategy expects to raise about $979 million after expenses from underwriting and other dues are deducted. 

Unlike its past funding methods, the preferred stock offers non-cumulative dividends of 10%. This appeals to institutional and professional investors who are after yield. It aims to offer more predictable investor returns while the company continues to pursue its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy.

Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that the company's holdings make it the single largest known Bitcoin holder, eclipsing the amount of Bitcoin held by the United States and China combined. Strategy's holdings are also nearly 12 times bigger than the second-largest BTC holder, Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings. 

Strategy has become closely associated with Bitcoin, with many investors seeing the company as a corporate wrapper for Bitcoin exposure.

Based on reports, a long-dormant Bitcoin whale made a surprise move this week, snapping up 250 BTC for about $26.37 million. It's the first time this wallet has shown activity in two years.

The purchase has stirred talk among traders and on-chain analysts alike. Some see it as a sign that big players are getting ready for more action in the weeks ahead.

Whale Returns After Two Years

According to Lookonchain data, the same whale pulled 500 BTC out of Gemini back in 2022 when Bitcoin was trading near $27,400, a move worth nearly $14 million at the time. Now, with BTC hovering around $105,000, the whale's holdings sit on an unrealized gain of over $39 million.

That kind of profit margin grabs attention. Other large holders often watch these moves closely. They wonder if this is the start of a wider trend or just one wallet's play.

A whale that had been dormant for 2 years bought another 250 $BTC($26.37M) 9 hours ago.

2 years ago, this whale withdrew 500 $BTC($13.7M) from Gemini at $27,401, now sitting on an unrealized profit of $39M.https://t.co/c0U92isSfc pic.twitter.com/vcb4V3M0Uz

Big Gains On Early Bet

Early adopters have seen massive upside in Bitcoin over the years. This whale's 2022 withdrawal came just before a multi-year price boom. Since then, Bitcoin has climbed nearly 300%.

Not everyone can make moves like that. Small investors often feel left behind when a wallet this size shifts coins. Still, some traders say it can create a ripple of optimism. When big holders buy, retail traders sometimes pile in, chasing the same gains.Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals

On the charts, BTC seems to be shaping an inverse cup-and-handle pattern with a significant neckline at $100,800 serving as major support. The price has fallen into the handle stage, and a dip below $100,800 could propel Bitcoin to $91,000, which coincides with its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA).

Bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) is 52, indicating the bullish momentum is fading. A fall below 50 could introduce additional selling pressure. For the bulls to regain control, BTC must recapture the 20-day EMA resistance, which is just above $105,000.Market Volatility And Liquidations

There were some wild price movements last week fueled in part by social media battles between US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk. The price of bitcoin fell below $101,000 for a moment, causing close to $1 billion in liquidations across futures markets, before recovering to above $105,000 within hours.

The miner capitulation signal was also detected by CryptoQuant's Hash Ribbons indicator, pointing to near-term pain for worse-off miners, but some potential rallies ahead once they pulled through.

The former chief executive of the software firm Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is doubling down on his massive price prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) as it continues to trade above the six-figure level.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitcoin firebrand Michael Saylor says that as institutions enter the top crypto asset by market cap, BTC should experience a supply shock and a surge in price.

“There's been a surge of Bitcoin treasury companies. There's like 100 public companies or more. They're holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet. And every single week, there's another announcement. I think that it used to be that we're focused on the halvings. 

But at this point, the entire natural supply of Bitcoin is only 450 Bitcoin available for sale every day. That's sort of about $45 – $50 million a day at this level. That is all being consumed by the Bitcoin treasury companies. And the Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are coming on strong. So I'm very bullish.” 

Saylor goes on to slightly upgrade his price prediction for the flagship digital asset, noting that he believes it will outpace other key asset classes, such as real estate and the S&P 500.

“My forecast in July of last year in Nashville was Bitcoin's going to appreciate 29% a year on average for the next 21 years. And that moves it from it was about mid $60s, $65,000 to $13 million a coin in the year 2045. I'm getting more bullish on that forecast, but I'm certainly comfortable forecasting 30% a year ARR (annual recurring revenue) on average for the next 20 years.

 I think Bitcoin's up 57% a year for the past four and a half years. Again, that's double the Mag seven. That's quadruple the S&P. That's eight times real estate and bonds are down 4%. So Bitcoin is smashing everything.”

Strategy is currently the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, coming in at 580,955 BTC worth just over $61.3 billion, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.

Bitcoin is trading for $105,431 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

Ethereum is once again capturing attention across the market, and for good reason. On the daily chart, ETH has just confirmed a sustained move above the 200-day EMA, which is traditionally seen as a critical threshold between bearish and bullish cycles. This breakout could be laying the foundation for a broader push toward $3,000, with the current level near $2,500 acting more like a pit stop than a ceiling.

Recent price action shows ETH consolidating above multiple EMAs, and despite some choppy candles, bulls are holding their ground. The bounce from the 200 EMA was swift and backed by a noticeable uptick in volume, typically a sign of renewed market interest. The RSI is steadily climbing again from neutral territory, indicating there's room for further upward momentum without immediately triggering overbought conditions.

The second chart, IntoTheCryptoverse's long-term moving averages, gives this breakout even more significance. ETH is now sitting well above its 200-week SMA ($2,450), which historically has acted as a launchpad during bull cycles. Add to that the price being squeezed between the 50W and 100W SMAs, and it's easy to see why a breakout above $2,700 could lead to a rapid acceleration toward the $2,800-$3,000 range.

Ethereum Whales Move $159,000,000 ETH In One Go

ByCaroline Amosun





However, there's still a critical resistance barrier around $2,700. It's not just a psychological level, it also aligns with the 50W SMA and previous price congestion zones from early 2024. If ETH manages to convincingly break through this wall, we are likely looking at the early stages of a medium-term bullish rally.

Ethereum is sending strong technical signals. The 200 EMA flip, robust support near $2,450 and alignment with historical long-term moving averages point to a potentially explosive upside, if the $2,700 resistance gives in. This chart does, in fact, explain everything.

Key Points

Ethereum's native token could bounce back after a challenging year.

Ether (ETH 0.62%), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, lost more than 30% of its value over the past 12 months. Its first spot-price ETFs were approved last July, but those funds didn't attract as much attention as Bitcoin's (BTC 0.72%) earlier ETFs.

Instead, Ether seemed to be held back by concerns about competition from newer and faster blockchains, its slowing network activity, and the Trump Administration's unpredictable tariffs. Nevertheless, some investors remain fiercely bullish on Ether's future. One of those bulls is ARK Invest's Cathie Wood, who believes Ether's price could reach $166,000 by 2032.

That would represent a gain of nearly 6,220% and boost its market cap to more than $20 trillion. Bitcoin, which Wood is also bullish on, currently has a market cap of $2 trillion. Could Ether skyrocket to those levels, or should investors maintain more realistic expectations?

Image source: Getty Images.

Ethereum originally ran on a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism like Bitcoin. This meant it needed to be mined by GPUs or other chips.

But in 2022, Ethereum transitioned to the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, which was roughly 99% more power efficient than the PoW mechanism. So instead of being mined, Ether is now staked (or locked up for rewards) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethereum's transformation into a PoS blockchain also enabled it to support smart contracts, which are used to develop decentralized apps (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other crypto assets. Bitcoin's PoW blockchain doesn't support smart contracts.

Therefore, Ether's value is often linked to Ethereum's popularity as a development platform. Bitcoin is still valued by its scarcity and limited supply -- since 19.6 million of its maximum supply of 21 million tokens have already been mined.

Ether doesn't have a fixed maximum supply, but its overall supply declines when its network activity rises. That's because a portion of every transaction fee in Ether is burned. But when Ethereum's network activity slows down, its supply rises as more Ether tokens are created than burned.

So while Bitcoin is always deflationary, Ether can be both inflationary and deflationary. But to remain a popular platform for developers and investors, it needs to keep providing fast transaction times with low fees.

That's becoming increasingly difficult as faster and cheaper PoS blockchains like Solana and Cardano challenge Ethereum. Solana processes transactions much faster than Ethereum, while Cardano usually offers lower fees.

Ether's next big upgrade -- The Verge -- aims to upgrade its security features and lower its hardware requirements so it can run on smaller devices like smartphones, wearables, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It also aims to reduce its off-chain Layer 2 (L2) fees with a series of upgrades for its network to clear more space for fresh data. Those upgrades could help it indirectly reduce its congestion issues by absorbing some of its core Layer 1 (L1) network traffic.

Assuming those upgrades bring in more developers and investors, its network activity will increase, reduce its supply, and stabilize Ether's price. Another potential catalyst would be the approval of new spot-price ETFs with staking features.

The first batch of Ether's spot-price ETFs only held Ether in cold storage and didn't pass on any of its interest-like staking rewards. The next batch could pass on those rewards (about 3% to 5% annually) and make them more appealing.

However, Ether could still be held back by competition from other PoS blockchains, a lack of approvals for new ETFs with staking rewards, or the messy macro environment that is curbing the market's appetite for cryptocurrencies and other speculative investments.

Wood believes Ether's value will rise as Ethereum becomes a foundational layer of a new digital financial ecosystem that challenges traditional banks with decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, NFTs, and tokenized versions of real-world assets.

She also expects Ether's staking yield to become more appealing than the yields of U.S. Treasuries as interest rates decline, and for the approvals of new staking ETFs to bring in even more institutional investors. Just as with Bitcoin, Wood expects the growing institutional adoption of Ether over the next few years to drive its price a lot higher.

That thesis sounds reasonable, but claiming it could reach a $20 trillion market cap within the next seven years -- compared to gold's current market cap of $3.4 trillion -- seems too bullish.

So while it might be smart to accumulate Ether as it rolls out new networking upgrades, attracts more developers, burns more tokens, and gains more attention with new ETFs, we should take Cathie Wood's forecasts with a grain of salt. It will probably stabilize and rise higher, but its long-term value isn't that easy to gauge.

Crypto World News

June 8, 2025 by Paul Adedoyin 

The number of Ethereum staked has reached an impressive level of 32.8 million. This is the biggest quantity ever for it and it means that more than $100 billion worth of ETH is not circulating anymore.

Crypto expert Merlijn The Trader pointed this development out on June 7, 2025. He said that while many people are still focused on meme coins and risky bets, big investors, often called “smart money”, are quietly buying and locking up Ethereum.

He believes this rise in staking is being missed by most of the crypto world and warned people not to ignore.

Source: X @Merlijn The Trader

A chart shared with his post shows a steady and strong increase in staked ETH. Many people believe in Ethereum's progress and are therefore opting to invest rather than simply trade, which explains why the price has kept increasing.

Also, CryptoQuant reported a big drop in the amount of Ethereum being moved to exchanges between June 6 and June 7.

On June 6, over 900,000 ETH were sent to exchanges. But by June 7, that number had dropped sharply to about 173,200 ETH. Usually, when more ETH is sent to exchanges, it means people might be getting ready to sell.

Source: X @ CryptoQuant

This sudden drop suggests fewer people are looking to sell, which fits with the trend of more ETH being staked for the long term. Interestingly, fewer people are sending Ethereum to exchanges at the same time its price has gone up to about $2,490. 

Many factors can affect price, but when less ETH is available on exchanges and more is being staked, it usually means investors are choosing to hold instead of selling. This often helps support higher prices in the future.

The crypto world is bustling with momentum.

Japan just revamped its Payment Services Act to be ‘crypto-friendly,' opening the door for more institutional and mainstream adoption across Asia.

In Dubai, tokenized real estate pushed sales past $18B in May – proof that on‑chain ownership of physical assets is no longer science fiction.

Let's look at the three of the best altcoins in presale right now – each uniquely positioned to benefit from crypto-friendly regulation in Asia and real-world tokenization trends.

Crypto is having a global moment – and it's not just about price charts anymore.

In Asia, Japan just revised its Payment Services Act, tightening oversight while making space for crypto firms to register and operate more easily.

Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Dubai is setting records. The city saw over $18B in real estate sales in May alone, fueled in part by the rapid rise of tokenized property.

Instead of paperwork and middlemen, buyers can now invest using blockchain-based tokens – secure, traceable, and fast.

These two trends, regulatory clarity and real-world use cases, are no longer hypothetical. They're happening now. And they're fueling demand for presale projects that don't just promise innovation – they're built for it.

With the world turning to scalable crypto infrastructure, Solaxy ($SOLX) is stepping up as the first-ever Layer‑2 built on Solana, aiming to lead the next phase of blockchain evolution.

Designed to neutralize Solana's most pressing issues like network congestion, failed transactions, and scaling headaches, Solaxy also amplifies everything Solana does best. Including lightning speed and rock-bottom fees.

But Solaxy doesn't stop at Solana. With its native token $SOLX set to go multichain on both Ethereum and Solana, it bridges two of the biggest blockchain ecosystems.

That means access to Ethereum's deep DeFi liquidity and Solana's meme-coin explosion – all from one token.

It's no wonder the presale has already raised over $45.4M. But right now, you can still buy $SOLX for just $0.001748 per token.



Solaxy also democratizes high-frequency meme coin trading, giving regular users tools once reserved for sniper bots.

With only 8 days left in the presale, this is the final boarding call for what could be one of the best altcoins of the year.

As real-world tokenization gains ground, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is stepping into the spotlight as the first AI agent for content creation and premium Web3 platform.

At the time of writing, $SUBBD is in presale at $0.0556 and has already raised over $625K.

Here's how it works: creators can use AI tools to automate chats, upsell premium content, and even delegate video editing.

Fans can buy tokens to unlock gated content, tip creators, or even interact with AI-generated avatars approved by the original influencers themselves.



With over 250M followers across the platform and its affiliated brands, $SUBBD already has the reach to take off fast.

Price forecasts suggest $SUBBD could reach between $0.08 and $0.30 in 2025 – making it a standout among the new crypto projects with real-world use and upside.

Qubetics ($TICS) enters the scene as a full-fledged Layer‑1 blockchain built around real-world asset tokenization.

The platform connects Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana ecosystems, offering cross-chain access, transparency, and global reach – all while complying with local regulations.

The crypto presale is already turning heads: $TICS is currently trading at $0.33709673, and over $17.8M has been raised so far – proof there's serious institutional and retail interest.



With 38.5 % of the total supply allocated for presale, the launch is both well-funded and structured.

Qubetics stands out by reducing friction in real-world asset trading: instant settlements, low fees, and regulatory compliance make it easy to fractionalize expensive assets.

In a world where tokenization is moving from theory to practice, Qubetics offers a bridge between traditional assets and decentralized finance.

From Japan's crypto-friendly reforms to Dubai's tokenized real estate surge, adoption is accelerating.

Projects like Solaxy, SUBBD Token, and Qubetics are built for this moment – bridging regulation, utility, and innovation. Whether you're into utility or opportunity, these could be your best altcoins yet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Ethereum Price Prediction: Circle IPO Could Add Billions To These 3 Altcoins","https://financefeeds.com/ethereum-price-prediction-circle-ipo-could-add-billions-to-these-3-altcoins/","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 16:10:23 GMT","

The latest Ethereum price prediction has injected the much-needed confidence that was lacking in the previous months. Meanwhile, analysts predict that the Circle IPO could help reverse the poor market form of Polygon Coin and Pi Network.

However, a new smart money project, Unilabs Finance, has attracted massive attention within market circles. With its AI-powered investment and income strategies, crypto fans are already betting on the project to have the largest liquidity pull in this cycle.

The Ethereum price prediction has shifted to bullish over the past month as a new wave of optimism sweeps through the cryptosphere. For the first time in months, technical indicators are suggesting a northbound movement for ETH.

Changelly's Ethereum price prediction model aligns with this current outlook. As per data, ETH's potential maximum price level for September stands at $2,875, a 13% increase from its current value of $2,508.

Other technical indicators, such as the 200-day SMA, suggest that the bulls have taken over the Ethereum price prediction sentiment.

Meanwhile, assets like Polygon Coin and Pi Network could witness a market recovery from the possible liquidity flow from the Circle IPO.

But Unilabs is poised to be the biggest beneficiary of this potential liquidity influx, with more investors flocking to AI-driven investment products.

Unilabs Finance is becoming a big topic in crypto forums, as its presale phase has surpassed market expectations. Although the Ethereum price prediction remains optimistic, this next-gen DeFi project is already charting remarkable courses.

The project is outpacing Polygon Coin and Pi Network as buyers invest over $2.5 million to purchase about 516 million tokens. What is powering this run? The answer is simple: AI-based investment strategies and passive income systems.

With its AI Market Pulse, users could access well-scouted investment opportunities powered by artificial intelligence. This tool tracks multiple data points, key token movements, and other on-chain data to deliver an actionable overview.

Through its multi-fund model, Unilabs exposes users to four investment funds: AI, RWA, mining and Bitcoin.

This way, traders could benefit from emerging opportunities within these sectors while the platform handles research and exposure.

But that's not all. With Unilabs, investors could earn by just holding their tokens on the network.

The platform distributes 30% of the fees generated within the ecosystem to UNIL holders across tiers. Even more, investors could earn a 122% APY for staking their tokens.

Experts predict that the potential liquidity flow from the Circle IPO could further add to its over $30 million in assets under management (AUM). If this happens, the UNIL could surge exponentially post-launch.

While the Ethereum price prediction is already reversing its weak trend, Polygon Coin is still battling bearish conditions. At the time of writing, Polygon Coin is changing hands at $ 0.21 after losing over half its value year-to-date.

Crypto fans are currently bearish on the coin, as shown by CoinCodex's sentiment tracker. While a climb back to the top seems far-fetched, experts are predicting the Circle IPO to add a much-needed boost.

USDC is available on the Polygon network. As such, analysts expect the Polygon coin, as well as Pi Network to benefit from a portion of the $1.05 billion Circle IPO, which could move within the networks.

Like Polygon Coin, Pi Network is another asset that could benefit from the recent developments around the world's second-largest stablecoin issuer. Pi briefly surged to $2.98 post-launch but has since declined by 79% and currently trades at $0.62.

Unlike the Ethereum price prediction, which has utility-based drivers, Pi Network was launched without a clear use case. However, the network has stepped up its utility game, partnering with a new decentralized app, Boostr, to enable utility payments.

Pi Network is also gaining greater market reach, with exchanges like CEX.io and Binance offering a PI/USDC trading pair. As USDC liquidity spreads across these platforms, Pi could attract fresh inflows through greater exposure.

But market commentators are betting big on Unilabs Finance due to its user-investment-driven approach. Priced at just $0.0062, UNIL offers investors the chance to profit from the crypto market without breaking the bank. For savvy investors, the time to join this rare trend is now.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Tether-Backed Blockchain Aims to Serve Financial Giants","https://cryptodnes.bg/en/tether-backed-blockchain-aims-to-serve-financial-giants/","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 11:01:19 GMT","

A new blockchain initiative backed by the forces behind Tether and Bitfinex is taking shape—one that's turning its focus away from retail crypto users and setting its sights firmly on institutional finance.

Tether-Linked Blockchain ‘Stable' Targets Institutions with USDT-Powered Network

Dubbed simply “Stable,” the project is still under development but already drawing attention due to its direct link to USDT, the world's most widely used stablecoin.

Though still cloaked in anonymity, the team behind Stable describes itself as a blend of protocol engineers, fintech insiders, and seasoned crypto founders. What sets this project apart is its unconventional approach to network fees: instead of traditional gas tokens, Stable will use USDT as the sole currency for covering transaction costs. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino is also advising the venture, adding further credibility to its enterprise-focused ambitions.

Rather than catering to individual users or decentralized finance enthusiasts, Stable aims to become an infrastructure layer for financial institutions. One of its core selling points is the introduction of “enterprise lanes”—dedicated pathways designed to handle high-priority transactions with greater speed and reliability.

According to an early post on the project's official X account, the developers are aiming to solve what they see as core weaknesses in current blockchain ecosystems: inconsistent performance, high fees, and fragmented scalability. “USDT already moves over $100 billion daily, yet the rails it runs on are often unreliable for institutional-grade operations,” the statement read.

This move also comes as competition in the stablecoin arena heats up. Tether, with a market cap exceeding $154 billion, remains dominant, but Circle's USDC—valued at around $61 billion—has gained momentum, particularly following Circle's successful public listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

If Stable delivers on its promises, it could carve out a niche as the go-to blockchain for high-volume institutional finance, powered by the very stablecoin that has become synonymous with global liquidity in crypto.







Tether is deepening its involvement in the tokenized gold space by introducing a new version of its gold-backed stablecoin—XAUt0—on The Open Network (TON).

Litecoin is taking a major leap into the world of DeFi and Web3 with the launch of LitVM, a newly introduced Layer-2 network designed to bring smart contract capabilities to the long-standing cryptocurrency.

Binance has announced its full technical support for an upcoming upgrade to the Siacoin (SC) blockchain, scheduled for June 6, 2025.

MetaMask is making a major leap beyond Ethereum by adding support for Solana, marking its first deep integration with a non-EVM blockchain.

Jonathan Mann, the creator behind the long-running “Song A Day” project, has turned his crypto misfortune into a musical cautionary tale.

After earning $3 million by selling thousands of his songs as NFTs in early 2022, Mann found himself facing a massive tax bill and a portfolio in freefall.

Hoping for further gains, Mann and his wife chose to hold onto their earnings in Ethereum. But when the market turned and ETH began to slide, they were unprepared. Despite the shrinking value of their assets, U.S. tax law still treated the income at its original value—leaving them owing over $1 million to the IRS.

In an attempt to delay selling at a loss, the couple used ETH as collateral for a loan on Aave. But when the Terra ecosystem collapsed, it triggered a wave of liquidations, including Mann's. In an instant, 300 ETH vanished—effectively erasing years of creative work.

Faced with the threat of losing their home and retirement savings, Mann dug into his digital vault and sold a rare Autoglyph NFT for $1.1 million—just enough to settle the tax debt. Fortunately, the previous losses meant he didn't owe capital gains on the sale.

Despite the ordeal, Mann continues his daily song project, still minting NFTs and hoping for a second act—this time with a clearer financial strategy.







Elon Musk's financial standing has taken a major hit, with his net worth shrinking by $70 billion since his public fallout with Donald Trump.

UBS analyst Brian Meredith has revised his outlook on Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares, trimming the price target from $606 to $591, while maintaining a “buy” rating.

In a move not seen in decades, the U.S. Treasury Department has initiated a historic $10 billion bond buyback—its largest ever—targeting securities set to mature between mid-2025 and mid-2027.

In a bold move to reshape the future of ApeCoin, Yuga Labs has introduced a proposal that would dissolve the existing ApeCoin DAO and replace it with a streamlined management body called ApeCo.

Jonathan Mann, a non-fungible token (NFT) artist, has spun his taxing experience with cryptocurrency into a song. This follows a $3 million loss he suffered due to a market crash.

What Happened: Mann, who is recognized for his “Song A Day” project, recently released a track that narrates his financial misfortune. In a post on X, Mann shared that he made a whopping $3 million by selling his entire song catalog as NFTs. However, he lost it all during the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.

According to his post, on Jan. 1, 2022, Mann embarked on his crypto journey, selling 3,700 songs at $800 each. This earned him approximately $3 million in Ether (ETH). However, the value of ETH plummeted, leaving Mann and his wife uncertain about the right time to sell or the amount to sell. Adding to their woes, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came knocking.

Mann clarified that the earnings from his NFT sales are taxed as income, based on the ETH value at the time of receipt. This holds true even if the crypto asset's value crashes later.

Consequently, despite the decrease in their $3 million worth of ETH, their tax bill remained unchanged.

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

In an attempt to avoid selling their crypto at a loss, Mann took out a loan through the Aave lending protocol, using some of the ETH as collateral. However, the market crash triggered a series of liquidations across the ecosystem, which included Mann's loan, erasing 300 ETH.

After months of collaboration with his accountant, Mann found out that they owed $1,095,171.79 in taxes. To pay off the IRS bill, Mann sold a rare Autoglyph NFT for $1.1 million. Despite this financial blow, Mann continues his daily songwriting and selling them as NFTs.

Why It Matters: Mann's experience underscores the volatility of the crypto market and the potential tax implications of trading in digital assets. 

It also highlights the risks associated with crypto-backed loans, particularly during market downturns. 

Despite his financial setback, Mann's continued commitment to his craft and the NFT space demonstrates the resilience and adaptability of artists in the face of adversity.

The ICO's first processor fine

Online tracking has become an inevitable part of daily digital experiences, often enabling personalised services but sometimes using information in ways users may not understand or expect. 

The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) and (UK) GDPR requirements are notoriously challenging for the digital advertising industry to meet because they fail to take into account the realities of the business model. 60% of cookie-related complaints received by the ICO in 2024 concerned people not being given the option to reject non-essential tracking, although people are also tired of endless pop-up banners asking for consent, often with non-GDPR-compliant cookie notices.  For regulators and individuals alike, the picture has been further complicated by emergence (following a string of CJEU rulings) of the 'consent or pay' model for online advertising – both in the EU and, to a lesser extent, in the UK.  

It's not new for regulators to focus on online tracking.  The European Data Protection Board has been active in this space and, at a national level, the French CNIL stands out.  For the ICO, the challenge focuses on enforcing data privacy law in alignment with the government's pro-growth strategy.

On 23 January 2025, the ICO published its online tracking strategy for the year (strategy). It outlines the ICO's plans to promote compliance with data protection laws in the online tracking ecosystem, with a focus on safeguarding and empowering people to have meaningful control over their data while promoting responsible innovation and sustainable economic growth.

The strategy outlined the ICO's plans to ""go further and faster"" in 2025, heralded as part of a broader package of measures announced by the ICO on 16 January 2025, aimed at driving economic growth while maintaining high data protection standards (see here for more). It follows on from a series of actions the ICO took in 2024, including consulting on fresh guidance for storage and access technologies like cookies and fingerprinting, examining 'consent or pay' business models, reviewing the UK's top 200 websites, and concluding investigations and audits of data management platforms.  

The ICO identified four areas where users are not being given the control to which they are entitled under UK data protection law.

The ICO is concerned that without action, compliant organisations face a 'first mover disadvantage' compared to competitors which continue with non-compliant practices, creating weak incentives for investment in approaches which respect users' privacy. The ICO wants to level the playing field, to make it easier for businesses to comply, and ensure user control over personal data.

The focus of the strategy is on online advertising and, in particular, user control.  Many of the initiatives complete or extend the work done in 2024.

Making it easier for publishers to adopt more privacy-friendly forms of online advertising

The ICO wants to make it easier for publishers to adopt more privacy-friendly forms of online advertising that don't involve extensive profiling of individuals. It will explore where PECR requirements might be hindering industry-wide shifts toward more privacy-friendly advertising approaches, such as contextual models, and will publish a statement outlining low-risk processing activities. The ICO plans to work with the government to develop secondary legislation to amend PECR consent requirements, to create an exemption for specific low-risk advertising purposes.

Ensuring publishers give people meaningful control over how they are tracked on websites

The ICO will continue to enforce consent requirements to ensure users have meaningful control over how their information is used. It is extending its monitoring around online tracking and personalised advertising from the top 200 to the top 1,000 most popular UK websites, implementing automated compliance monitoring.

Ensure people have meaningful control over tracking on apps and connected TVs

For the first time, the ICO will extend its scrutiny beyond web browsers to include apps and connected TVs, preventing non-compliant tracking from migrating to these platforms.  The ICO will consult on guidance for IoT devices and intervene with app developers and TV manufacturers to promote compliance.

Confirm how publishers can deploy 'consent or pay'

Alongside its online tracking strategy, on 23 January 2025 the ICO published guidance on 'consent or pay' business models, clarifying how publishers can implement these approaches while allowing users to have meaningful control over their data. These models allow users to choose between consenting to tracking for free access or paying for access without being tracked.

Provide industry with clarity

The ICO will publish final guidance on storage and access technologies after the Data (Use and Access) Bill is finalised.  The ICO will also work with the online advertising industry to develop a certification scheme which will enable organisations to demonstrate compliance with data protection laws, and support businesses looking to introduce novel solutions through its Regulatory Sandbox and Innovation Advice services.

Investigate compliance failures in the adtech ecosystem

Building on the audits it concluded last year, the ICO plans to investigate potential non-compliance in data management platforms that connect online advertisers and publishers. It will also examine the case for further action to ensure that people can easily withdraw consent from all organisations with which their personal information has been shared.

Support the public to take control of how they are tracked online

The ICO will publish guidance for the public on understanding and controlling how their information is used online, raising awareness of their rights.

The strategy takes a comprehensive view of the online tracking ecosystem, addressing not just websites but also apps, connected TVs, and data management platforms, emphasising that all participants in the digital advertising supply chain will face regulatory scrutiny.

The ICO's expanded monitoring scope and implementation of automated compliance checks suggest a more rigorous enforcement landscape for businesses operating in the UK digital advertising ecosystem.   The strategy places particular emphasis on protecting vulnerable users who may face greater risks from unchecked tracking, including potential discrimination or unwanted disclosure of sensitive information.

As UK Information Commissioner John Edwards indicated in his letter to the Prime Minister, the ICO aims to balance its protective role with supporting economic growth. This means that the ICO's approach recognises how important personalised advertising is to organisations. The ICO's guidance on 'consent or pay' models and exploration of privacy-friendly alternatives like contextual advertising show a desire to help businesses find compliant revenue models and the ICO clearly wants to work with the industry, not against it. This is why it plans to offer regulatory sandboxes and innovation advice, and to develop certification schemes to help businesses demonstrate compliance with data protection laws.

For organisations involved in online advertising or tracking, the message is clear: the ICO is increasing scrutiny, expanded monitoring, and making a determined push towards ensuring users have genuine control over how their data is collected, used, and shared online.  This applies whatever tracking technology is used.  Despite this, the ICO will not lose sight of the economic importance of digital advertising, and aims to help businesses comply with their privacy obligations.

Some voices in the XRP community believe a major shift is coming, and holding just 1,000 XRP before October 2025 is non-negotiable.

One of those voices, Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, recently shared his thoughts in a video commentary making the rounds.

Specifically, Farina believes now is the right time to build a solid XRP position. He pointed out that 1,000 XRP, at today's price, costs around $2,300. With five months left until October 2025, he says investors still have time to get in before major changes take place. 

While he didn't make any bold price predictions, he emphasized that it is important to prepare for what could be a turning point for XRP and the broader crypto market.

Importantly, he tied this outlook to the European Central Bank's plan to roll out its digital euro in October 2025. According to Farina, this launch could play an important role in XRP's future. 

He pointed to a statement from ECB President Christine Lagarde, where she said all European institutions would support the move toward digital cash. Essentially, Farina sees this as a strong sign that the region's financial systems will shift toward blockchain technology.

He mentioned Europe's TIPS (Target Instant Payment Settlement) system and claimed it connects to the XRP Ledger. In his view, this could put XRP at the heart of fast, cross-border digital payments. 

Farina also reminded viewers that Lagarde, formerly head of the IMF, has praised Ripple in the past, and the IMF itself has shown interest in Ripple's technology. Specifically, Lagarde spotlighted Ripple alongside Circle as a firm that could disrupt the banking sector.

Meanwhile, to support his point, Farina mentioned that Palau built its digital currency on the XRP Ledger. Now, since Palau uses the euro, he suggested it may have served as a test run for something bigger. 

He also claimed that the French central bank successfully tested XRP Ledger for digital payments. This claim originally came from a research paper by Ulster University's Professor Daniel Broby.

Speaking further, Farina warned that any official confirmation of XRP's involvement might come suddenly. Essentially, due to non-disclosure agreements, governments and banks may keep their plans quiet until everything is in place. 

According to him, when that happens, the market could move quickly and leave retail investors behind. This is why he urged people to focus on accumulating XRP while prices remain relatively low. Farina has persistently suggested that investors accumulate at least 1,000 XRP.

Meanwhile, in a parallel commentary, crypto analyst XFinanceBull supported the bullish sentiment with recent developments. He highlighted the launch of EURØP, a euro stablecoin on the XRP Ledger, which went live on May 22. 

The euro just picked its chain and it wasn't BitcoinIt was $XRP Ledger.

— X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) May 25, 2025



However, it is worth noting that while EURØP is licensed under MiCA regulations and issued by Schuman Financial, there's no solid proof that France's central bank directly backs it.

Still, XFinanceBull stressed the importance of this move. According to him, this is not just another DeFi project but real money moving on-chain. In his view, XRP doesn't just store value like Bitcoin; it moves it efficiently, with regulatory compliance and global liquidity.

He argued that XRP is quietly building the foundation for the future of finance. As more countries adopt similar systems, the demand for XRP could grow fast. Interestingly, XFinanceBull boldly suggested that the ambitious XRP to $1,000 price prediction could only be the starting point.

To put things into perspective, the 1,000 XRP portfolio championed by Farina could skyrocket from $2,300 to a worth of $1 million if XRP ever claimed a $1,000 price per token.

Work & Technology Correspondent

Donald Trump once dismissed cryptocurrency as ""a scam"" but in recent months he and his family have become heavily involved in the digital currency marketplace and have reportedly made billions of dollars in the process.

The Trump administration has cut regulations for the crypto industry, while the Trump family is simultaneously profiting from the sector.

There are calls for investigations into the US President's crypto business dealings amid claims of conflicts of interest, and accusations that Mr Trump is abusing his position to enrich himself.

From crypto critic to crypto fan

In July 2019, during his first term as US President, Donald Trump made his dislike of cryptocurrencies very clear in a post on Twitter, now X.

""I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,"" Mr Trump wrote.

""Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,"" he added.

In June 2021, Mr Trump told Fox Business that bitcoin ""just seems like a scam"".

In another interview with Fox Business later that year, he said that investing in cryptocurrencies was like a ""disaster waiting to happen.""

""I like the currency of the United States,"" Mr Trump said.

He claimed that investing in cryptocurrencies ""hurts the United States currency"" and ""we should be invested in our currency.""

In the space of just three years, Mr Trump's views on crypto had utterly changed.

""Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC,"" he posted on Truth Social in June 2024.

CBDC refers to a central bank digital currency, which is a digital currency issued by a central bank rather than by a commercial bank.

""Biden's hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!"" Mr Trump wrote.

As the presidential election race ramped up last summer, the Trump campaign announced that it was starting to accept crypto donations.

""Demonstrating President Trump's success as a champion of American freedom and innovation, we proudly offer you a chance to contribute to the campaign with cryptocurrency,"" the campaign website stated.

In July last year, Mr Trump addressed a bitcoin conference in Nashville vowing to be an ally of the crypto industry if he was returned to the White House.

""This afternoon I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world and we'll get it done,"" Mr Trump told the conference.

""The Biden-Harris administration's repression of crypto and bitcoin is wrong and it's very bad for our country,"" he added.

World Liberty Financial

In September last year, Donald Trump formally announced his support for a Trump family crypto venture called World Liberty Financial.

The company's homepage describes itself as being ""Inspired by Donald J Trump"" and shaping a new era of finance.

Visitors to the site can purchase a crypto token called $WLFI.

In March 2025, World Liberty announced it would launch USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin.

""We're leading a financial revolution by dismantling the stranglehold of traditional financial institutions and putting the power back where it belongs: in your hands,"" the site states over a large photo of Mr Trump.

The US President is listed as 'Chief Crypto Advocate' in the 'Meet our Team' section of the website, along with his sons Eric, Donald Jr and Barron.

One of the co-founders of World Liberty Financial is Mr Trump's Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff.

He has been accused of blurring the lines between diplomacy and business amid claims that he and his son have been promoting World Liberty's crypto interests while on visits to the Middle East.

Last month, it was announced that an Abu Dhabi state-backed investment firm would make a major $2 billion investment using the USD1 stablecoin.

$TRUMP meme coin

In January 2025, days before his inauguration, Donald Trump announced the launch of his new meme coin $TRUMP.

""Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW,"" Mr Trump posted on Truth Social.

Meme coins are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes, jokes, or cultural trends.

""Their value is largely driven by community sentiment, social media hype, and celebrity endorsements,"" according to Forbes.

Days after her husband announced his new meme coin, the US First Lady Melania Trump launched a cryptocurrency token of her own with $Melania being offered for sale.

Last month, Mr Trump hosted a black-tie event at his golf club just outside Washington DC for the top buyers of his $TRUMP meme coin.

Weeks earlier, the US President had begun promoting a competition that would reward 220 buyers of the crypto token with a private dinner.

The top 25 investors were invited to an additional ""exclusive private VIP reception"" with Mr Trump.

Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, has demanded the release of the guest list of invitees at the dinner, claiming they had ""purchased access to the President"".

Mr Raskin said a majority of the buyers were likely foreign nationals who would have been barred from donating to the Trump campaign.

""I write today to demand that you release the names of all the attendees at this dinner and provide information about the source of the money they each used to buy $TRUMP coins, so that we can prevent illegal foreign government emoluments from being pocketed without congressional consent,"" Mr Raskin wrote in a letter to the president.

""Publication of this list will also let the American people know who is putting tens of millions of dollars into our President's pocket so we can start to figure out what - beyond virtually worthless meme coins - they are getting in exchange for all this money,"" the letter stated.

The White House has insisted that there is no conflict of interest for President Trump, as his assets are held in a trust managed by his children.

Asked recently about potential conflicts of interest, Donald Trump Jr told CNBC that the family got into crypto out of necessity as they had been ""de-banked"".

""We got into politics and all of a sudden (the banks) wouldn't take our call,"" he said.

Trump's crypto assets valued at $2.9 billion

A recent report from the US watchdog State Democracy Defenders Fund found that as of mid-March 2025, Mr Trump's crypto assets were valued at $2.9 billion, representing approximately 37% of his total wealth.

This included assets from the $TRUMP meme and the $WLFI governance token.

The State Democracy Defenders Fund said Mr Trump's entanglements with the cryptocurrency industry could pose serious risks to democratic institutions and public trust.

The report entitled 'Trump's Crypto Conflicts of Interest' found that Mr Trump and his allies are embracing crypto as both a fundraising tool and policy agenda.

""Rather than divest his crypto assets to avoid any possible conflict of interest, President Trump seems to have positioned himself to maximise profiting from them by adopting a less aggressive regulatory and enforcement programme than his predecessor,"" said Virginia Canter, Chief Anti-Corruption Counsel for State Democracy Defenders Fund.

""Reduced oversight could undermine US national security interests by emboldening terrorists and extremists, who have increasingly used crypto for anonymous financing, while foreign governments may view his crypto businesses as an open invitation for corruption,"" Ms Canter said.

The report concludes that the Trump administration has taken a more lenient approach towards crypto enforcement.

It points to a change in criminal policy at the Department of Justice, and highlights recent cases being dropped or stayed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), signaling a favorable regulatory and enforcement stance toward digital assets.

During his first presidential campaign, Donald Trump successfully wooed blue-collar union members, coal miners and steelworkers who felt abandoned by the Democrats.

Winning over these disaffected voters helped him to claim the White House in 2016.

Eight years later, in a similar way, he focused on the crypto community, promising to undo the regulations and restrictions introduced by Joe Biden.

He secured their votes and millions in crypto donations.

But this was not just about getting elected.

Mr Trump has deregulated an industry that his family now profits from, investors can get access to the president by buying his cryptocurrency and his envoy has been accused of blurring the lines between official Government diplomacy and business promotion.

He may have once dismissed cryptocurrency as a scam used by criminals, but the man who likes to see himself as the ultimate dealmaker may well have found his biggest earner yet.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are likely going to reshape personal finance over the next decade.

Consider This: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You

For You: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025

Even if you never buy bitcoin, ethereum or any other digital currency, the impact could affect how you save, spend and manage your money. Here are three ways crypto could transform your financial life by 2035.

Trending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?

The most immediate change will be in how people send and receive money.

Pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar, stablecoins brought the stability that cryptocurrencies lacked, making them practical for everyday transactions. A decade from now, sending money across borders will likely be faster and cheaper.

“We believe in the potential of stablecoins to streamline payments and commerce across the value chain,” said Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard.

This means your future paychecks, bill payments and international transfers could all flow through blockchain-based systems that operate 24/7 without traditional banking intermediaries.

Stablecoins are already gaining traction for everyday use because of their speed and low fees.

“We've seen some interest where banks and other companies will want to create their own stablecoin,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.

In fact, companies like Circle and JPMorgan have already developed their own stablecoins to facilitate faster payments at lower fees than traditional banks.

As stablecoins become more integrated into finance, they could power everyday spending, from paying bills to shopping online and transferring money, providing more flexibility and efficiency.

The most revolutionary change may come from decentralized finance (DeFi), which could entirely remove traditional banking middlemen.

Currently, some DeFi platforms allow users to lend, borrow and earn interest directly through smart contracts. These platforms offer better returns than traditional savings accounts.

A decade from now, people may bypass banks completely when it comes to saving money, borrowing and even lending.

(NewsNation) — Bitcoin is often hailed as digital gold, and on social media, it can feel like a modern-day gold rush.

On TikTok, crypto-influencers hype up lavish lifestyles, interviewing self-proclaimed Bitcoin billionaires surrounded by luxury cars.

Bitcoin, a form of digital currency that can be traded online without relying on traditional banks, has skyrocketed in value since its humble beginnings in 2009. One Bitcoin is currently worth around $110,000 — roughly quadruple its value just two years ago.

So is it too late to get in on the action? Here's what to know.

When it comes to cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is the biggest name in town and it's not even close. With a market cap of over $2 trillion as of this writing, Bitcoin is more valuable than Costco, Walmart and Netflix combined.

Like stocks, the value of Bitcoin fluctuates from one day to the next.

Buying and selling Bitcoin is fairly straightforward. You can purchase a Bitcoin (or fractions of a Bitcoin) with U.S. dollars through an online cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase or a more traditional investment broker like Robinhood.

That transaction is recorded on the blockchain — a decentralized, secure digital ledger that isn't controlled by banks or governments. 

“There is truly revolutionary technology underlying these cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, that allow money and value to flow outside of a government-sponsored fiat currency,” said Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation studies at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.

That said, Schulp worries influencer buzz could do more harm than good for digital assets in the long run.

“Viewing it all as, ‘how do you make a buck in the quickest way possible' is not beneficial to the long-term innovation that can be seen from this space,” she said.

The price of Bitcoin could go up or down. Nobody knows. That's true of other investments like stocks or gold, but Bitcoin has a few additional risks.

Historically, it's been more volatile than traditional asset classes. Bitcoin has gone up over the long run, but price swings have been the norm, not the exception. 

If you bought Bitcoin at its November 2021 high, your investment would have been worth roughly half as much about three months later. On the other hand, buying in early Feb. 2024 would have resulted in a significant gain after only a month — about 60%.

At times, those fluctuations have been more a reflection of crypto-enthusiasm than so-called “market fundamentals,” the tangible economic indicators investors use to gauge the stock market.

In that sense, Bitcoin requires investors to pay attention.

“I don't think it's just a set it and forget it investment because of its volatility, because of all the different macro factors influencing it,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar. 

It's worth noting that Bitcoin has been less volatile than many individual stocks, even popular names like Meta, Nvidia and Tesla, according to a Fidelity Digital Assets analysis in 2024.

Bitcoin has only been around for 16 years, while the New York Stock Exchange dates back hundreds of years. With time comes information. Investors can look at previous economic cycles and know with some confidence where stocks are headed in the future.

Since its introduction in 1957, for example, the S&P 500 has delivered an annual average return of around 10%. 

Bitcoin has done even better over the past decade, averaging an almost 50% annual return, but there's no guarantee that success will continue. 

“Predicting where [Bitcoin] is going to go when there's an economic shock, I think we just don't know yet,” Schulp said.

And unlike stocks, which represent ownership in real companies, Bitcoin isn't backed by physical assets. Its value comes from scarcity, hence the comparison to “digital gold.” 

But even that analogy is imperfect. Gold is something you can hold and the world's most powerful governments keep it in strategic reserves. That could happen with Bitcoin, but it hasn't unfolded in the same way yet.

The U.S. doesn't have a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, though several cryptocurrency bills and regulations are in the works.

“Part of the risk of it is that it's unknown how these things are going to be regulated five years from now versus one year from now,” Armour said.

Bitcoin investors are optimistic that the Trump administration will be positive for the crypto industry, with Trump poised to be the most pro-crypto president ever. Even so, the ongoing uncertainty makes crypto a risky investment. 

Ray Dalio, a prolific investor, called Bitcoin “one hell of an invention” back in 2021, but cautioned: “I suspect that Bitcoin's biggest risk is being successful, because if it's successful, the government will try to kill it and they have a lot of power to succeed.”

In 2023, Dalio said he has “a little bit” of crypto in his portfolio but acknowledged the risks: “I've seen people get very rich and I've seen people get very broke with it.”

Other big-name investors, like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, have been vocal critics of crypto over the years. 

Most Americans remain skeptical for now. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) say they have little to no confidence that current ways to invest in, trade, or use cryptocurrencies are reliable and safe, according to Pew Research.

Overall, just 17% of U.S. adults have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency, Pew found.

Massive phishing threat targets mobile users
If you're using an Android smartphone, beware! A major phishing threat is currently endangering crores of users across India. According to a recent report by Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL), more than 20 dangerous apps have been found on the Google Play Store that can compromise your personal and financial data.

These Crypto Wallet apps are a trap
These fake cryptocurrency wallet apps are designed to steal wallet recovery phrases—an essential key to accessing users' DeFi wallets. Apps like SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Raydium, Hyperliquid, and Suiet Wallet are part of this scam. Once a user downloads the app, it prompts them to enter their 12-word recovery phrase, which is then harvested by cybercriminals to gain access to the user's wallet.
How are these malicious apps spreading?
Cybercriminals are uploading these harmful apps using developer accounts originally linked to gaming and video editing tools. The apps hide phishing URLs within their privacy policies, tricking users into entering sensitive information. The scam becomes even more convincing because these apps imitate the design and functionality of genuine crypto wallet applications.
Immediate action: Delete these apps from your phone
The identified apps include:
Suiet Wallet
BullX Crypto
SushiSwap
Raydium
Hyperliquid
OpenOcean Exchange
Pancake Swap
Meteora Exchange
Harvest Finance Blog
If you have any of these apps installed on your device, delete them immediately to prevent your crypto funds and personal data from being compromised.Read Also

 Tether's CEO points to the company's growing Bitcoin and gold treasury as a reason why a speculative $515 billion valuation might actually be “a bit bearish.” 

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says the stablecoin issuer has no intention of going public, just days after rival Circle made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

“No need to go public,” Ardoino said on June 7, just two days after Circle, which is behind the stablecoin USDC (USDC), entered the public market on June 5. Circle's shares climbed 167% on its first trading session on the NYSE.

Ardoino addressed valuation speculation raised by Artmesis CEO Jon Ma, who claimed that if Tether, which is behind the stablecoin USDT (USDT), were to go public, it would rank as the 19th largest company globally with a valuation of $515 billion, larger than multinational giants like Costco and Coca-Cola.

While Ardoino called the $515 billion valuation a “beautiful number,” he said it might actually be too low. “Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + gold treasury, yet I'm very humbled,” Ardoino said.

Prominent Bitcoin advocates Anthony Pompliano and Jack Mallers both suggested that the company could one day reach a $1 trillion valuation.

Ardoino added he is “truly excited for the next phase of growth of our company.” . 

Tether's USDT ranks as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at $154.83 billion at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap.

Meanwhile, on April 24, it was announced that Tether would become the majority owner of Twenty One Capital, a new Bitcoin treasury company founded by Strike's Jack Mallers. 

Despite its recent launch, Twenty One has already become the world's third-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, behind only Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and mining firm MARA Holdings.

On June 3, Cointelegraph reported that Tether moved a combined 37,229.69 Bitcoin, worth about $3.9 billion, to addresses linked to the new Bitcoin-native financial platform.

 Bitcoin traders eye key levels to hold and reclaim into the weekly close, but the chances of a major liquidity grab are growing. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is working on completing a “successful” support retest as trader bets increase prior to the weekly candle close.

BTC price volatility is expected as liquidity analysis shows that conditions favor a significant short squeeze.

$100,000 still remains a likely target in the event of a fresh price dip.

Bitcoin (BTC) held $105,500 toward the June 8 weekly close amid hopes that the BTC price correction was over.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD cementing its rebound after a trip to $100,500 on June 5.

Now almost back at its weekly open level, Bitcoin again inspired traders to bet on upside continuation and resumption of the bull run.

“On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support earlier today,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital told X followers while uploading a chart with key levels.

BTC price action had already achieved a daily close above its 10-day simple moving average (SMA) — something that fellow trader SuperBro had said was a prerequisite to “invalidate the bear case.”

$BTC still needs to reclaim the 10 MA and H&S neckline on a closing basis to invalidate the bear caseuntil then, this is not the place to get aggressive with longs, the time for that was the retest of the FVG and 50 MA, when you were so sure it was all over 😂 pic.twitter.com/TAEG3wZgOM

Trader Cas Abbe meanwhile looked to order book liquidity for cues over price direction. 

This was building both above and below spot price, leading Abbe to predict a magnet-style move to “grab” it.

“BTC liquidation cluster is now signalling an upside move,” he summarized on X. 

Abbe noted that negative funding rates pointed to “big short positions” appearing over the weekend.

“I think BTC big move is coming next week, possibly pushing it above $109K-$110K,” he concluded.

Some saw the potential for further support retests first.

Updating X followers on his market forecast, popular trader CrypNuevo saw the logical place to build long BTC positions at $100,000.

“100k is the strongest psychological support so, as explained on Sunday, it's the area where I'm building some longs with easy invalidation below it,” he wrote, referring to his previous aim of tagging the $100,000 mark.

Rekt Capital meanwhile described the support retest after May's all-time highs on weekly timeframes as “successful.”

“Can Bitcoin successfully confirm this retest with a Weekly Close above $104400 for what would be a 4th week in a row?” he queried.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bitcoin core devs' joint statement sparks heated debate among Bitcoiners","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-debate-bitcoin-core-developers-use-cases-transaction-relay","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 04:06:17 GMT","

 The Bitcoin community is divided after core developers released a joint statement on transaction relay policy and use cases amid the ongoing OP_RETURN debate. 

A collective statement from 31 Bitcoin core developers has sparked a global debate among Bitcoiners after suggesting a hands-off approach to how the Bitcoin network is used, amid ongoing controversy over non-monetary use cases.

“This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on,” the June 6 statement published on the Bitcoin Core website said.

The letter argued that Bitcoin (BTC) is a network “defined by its users” and that its core contributors are “not in a position” to mandate what software or policies they desire. It comes amid the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network.

“Being free to run any software is the network's primary safeguard against coercion,” it added.

While many Bitcoiners supported the letter with an “ACK” comment, others objected.

JAN3 CEO Samson Mow criticized the tone of the letter on the same day. He said, “It's disingenuous to just say “it is what it is now, too bad.”

“Bitcoin Core devs have been changing the network gradually to enable spam and now seem focused on also removing barriers for spammers,” Mow said. “This statement itself is also inappropriate,” he added.

On May 8, Bitcoin Core developers decided to remove a long-standing limit on transaction data in a network upgrade to allow for larger data segments, which some Bitcoiners saw as opening the door to non-financial use cases.

However, Casa founder Jameson Lopp defended the letter. Lopp said, “Core Devs are a group saying we can't force anyone to run code they don't like; here is our thinking on relay policy and network health.”

“When there was no cohesive message, and it was just a bunch of independent developers making individual statements, Bitcoin Core was accused of having “poor public relations,” Lopp said, adding:

The developers argued in the letter that it is better for the Bitcoin node software “to aim to have a realistic idea of what will end up in the next block, rather than attempting to intervene between consenting transaction creators and miners to discourage activity that is largely harmless at a technical level.” It added:

Bitcoiner Carl Horton said, “It's Bit “Coin” not Bit “Bucket” or Bit “Store” or whatever general purpose data store you have in mind. It's a “peer to peer electronic cash system.”  

Meanwhile, Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr criticized the goals of the transaction relay policy outlined in the statement. “The goals of transaction relay listed are basically all wrong,” Dashjr said. 

“Predicting what will be mined is a centralizing goal. Expecting spam to be mined is defeatism. Helping spam propagate is harmful,” Dashjr said.

The developers said the main goals of transaction relay are predicting what Bitcoin transactions will be mined, “speeding up block propagation” for the transactions expected to be mined, and helping Bitcoin miners learn about fee-paying transactions.

 “Send more Orange,” Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor wrote on X, signaling another Bitcoin purchase from the company. 

Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor posted a chart of the company's Bitcoin holdings on June 8, signaling a possible upcoming acquisition.

On June 8, Saylor posted “Send more Orange” on X. Saylor's cryptic posts are often followed by announcements of new Bitcoin (BTC) purchases. If Strategy follows up the post with another BTC buy, it will mark the ninth week of consecutive Bitcoin purchases from the company. 

The post comes shortly after the company purchased an additional 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1 for around $75 million at an average price of $106,495 per coin, bringing the company's total Bitcoin holdings to 580,955 BTC, currently valued at approximately $61.4 billion.

Data from SaylorTracker shows that the company is up approximately 50% on its investment, amounting to around $20.6 billion in unrealized profit. 

Saylor's X post follows Strategy's announcement of a $1 billion stock offering, quadrupling its previously announced $250 million raise. The company said it will use the proceeds to fund additional Bitcoin purchases and general corporate expenses.

The offering involves 11.76 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock priced at $85 per share. Strategy expects to raise about $979 million after expenses from underwriting and other dues are deducted. 

Unlike its past funding methods, the preferred stock offers non-cumulative dividends of 10%. This appeals to institutional and professional investors who are after yield. It aims to offer more predictable investor returns while the company continues to pursue its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy.

Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that the company's holdings make it the single largest known Bitcoin holder, eclipsing the amount of Bitcoin held by the United States and China combined. Strategy's holdings are also nearly 12 times bigger than the second-largest BTC holder, Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings. 

Strategy has become closely associated with Bitcoin, with many investors seeing the company as a corporate wrapper for Bitcoin exposure.

Have the canines acquired strange mutations living near the power plant?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor in northern Ukraine—then part of the Soviet Union—exploded, sending a massive plume of radiation into the sky. Nearly four decades later, the Chernobyl Power Plant and many parts of the surrounding area remain uninhabited—by humans, at least.

Animals of all kinds have thrived in humanity's absence. Living among radiation-resistant fauna are thousands of feral dogs, many of whom are descendants of pets left behind in the speedy evacuation of the area so many years ago. As the world's greatest nuclear disaster approaches its 40th anniversary, biologists are now taking a closer look at the animals located inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), which is about the size of Yosemite National Park, and investigating how decades of radiation exposure may have altered animals' genomes—and even, possibly, sped up evolution.

Scientists from the University of South Carolina and the National Human Genome Research Institute have begun examining the DNA of 302 feral dogs found in or around the CEZ to better understand how radiation may have altered their genomes. Their results were published in the journal Science Advances.

“Do they have mutations that they've acquired that allow them to live and breed successfully in this region?” co-author Elaine Ostrander, a dog genomics expert at the National Human Genome Research Institute, told The New York Times. “What challenges do they face and how have they coped genetically?”

The idea of radiation speeding up natural evolution isn't a new one. The practice of purposefully irradiating seeds in outer space to induce advantageous mutations, for example, is now a well-worn method for developing crops that are well-suited for a warming world.

Scientists have been analyzing certain animals living within the CEZ for years, including bacteria, rodents, and even birds. One study back in 2016 found that Eastern tree frogs (Hyla orientalis), which are usually a green color, were more commonly black within the CEZ. The biologists theorize that the frogs experienced a beneficial mutation in melanin—pigments responsible for skin color—that helped dissipate and neutralize some of the surrounding radiation.

This made scientists ponder: could something similar be happening to Chernobyl's wild dogs?

The study uncovered that the feral dogs living near the Chernobyl Power Plant showed distinct genetic differences from dogs living only some 10 miles away in nearby Chernobyl City. While this may seem to heavily imply that these dogs have undergone some type of rapid mutation or evolution due to radiation exposure, this study is only a first step in proving that hypothesis. 

One environmental scientist, speaking with Science News, says that these studies can be tricky business, largely due to the fact that sussing out radiation-induced mutations from other effects, like inbreeding, is incredibly difficult.

However, this study provides a template for further investigation into the effects of radiation on larger mammals, as the DNA of dogs roaming the Chernobyl Power Plant and nearby Chernobyl City can be compared to dogs living in non-irradiated areas. Despite a current lack of firm conclusions, the study has shown once again that an area that—by all rights—should be a wasteland has become an unparalleled scientific opportunity to understand radiation and its impact on natural evolution.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Lighting up earthquakes: How scientists watched ruptures evolve in milliseconds","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250607231833.htm","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 05:34:29 GMT","

Researchers have developed a laboratory earthquake model that connects the microscopic real contact area between fault surfaces to the possibility of earthquake occurrences. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, this breakthrough demonstrates the connection between microscopic friction and earthquakes, offering new insights into earthquake mechanics and potential prediction.

""We've essentially opened a window into the heart of earthquake mechanics,"" said Sylvain Barbot, associate professor of earth sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and principal investigator of the study. ""By watching how the real contact area between fault surfaces evolves during the earthquake cycle, we can now explain both the slow buildup of stress in faults and the rapid rupture that follows. Down the road, this could lead to new approaches for monitoring and predicting earthquake nucleation at early stages.""

For decades, scientists have relied on empirical ""rate-and-state"" friction laws to model earthquakes -- mathematical descriptions that work well but don't explain the underlying physical mechanisms. ""Our model reveals what's actually happening at the fault interface during an earthquake cycle.""

Barbot says the discovery is a deceptively simple concept: ""When two rough surfaces slide against each other, they only make contact at minuscule, isolated junctions covering a fraction of the total surface area."" This ""real area of contact"" -- invisible to the eye but measurable through optical techniques -- turns out to be the key state variable that controls earthquake behavior.

Laboratory earthquakes: Lighting earthquakes in real time

The study utilizes transparent acrylic materials that allowed the researchers to literally watch earthquake ruptures unfold in real time. Using high-speed cameras and optical measurements, the team tracked how LED light transmission changed as contact junctions formed, grew and were destroyed during laboratory earthquakes.

""We can literally watch the contact area evolve as ruptures propagate,"" Barbot said. ""During fast ruptures, we see approximately 30% of the contact area disappear in milliseconds -- a dramatic weakening that drives the earthquake.""

The laboratory results revealed a previously hidden relationship: The empirical ""state variable"" used in standard earthquake models for decades represents the real area of contact between fault surfaces. This discovery provides the first physical interpretation of a mathematical concept that has been central to earthquake science since the 1970s.

From simulation to prediction

The researchers analyzed 26 different simulated earthquake scenarios and found that the relationship between rupture speed and fracture energy follows the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The team's computer simulations successfully reproduced both slow and fast laboratory earthquakes, matching not only the rupture speeds and stress drops but also the amount of light transmitted across the fault interface during ruptures.

As contact areas change during the earthquake cycle, they affect multiple measurable properties including electrical conductivity, hydraulic permeability and seismic wave transmission. Since the real area of contact affects multiple physical properties of fault zones, continuous monitoring of these proxies during earthquake cycles could provide new insights into fault behavior.

The implications extend far beyond academic understanding and laboratory experiments. The research suggests that monitoring the physical state of fault contacts could provide new tools for earthquake short-term systems and potentially for reliable earthquake prediction using the electric conductivity of the fault.

""If we can monitor these properties continuously on natural faults, we might detect the early stages of earthquake nucleation,"" Barbot explained. ""This could lead to new approaches for monitoring earthquake nucleation at early stages, well before seismic waves are radiated.""

Looking ahead

The researchers plan to scale up their findings outside controlled laboratory conditions. Barbot explained: The study's model provides the physical foundation for understanding how fault properties evolve during seismic cycles.

""Imagine a future where we can detect subtle changes in fault conditions before an earthquake strikes,"" Barbot said. ""That's the long-term potential of this work.""

About the study

In addition to Barbot, Baoning Wu, formerly at USC and now at the University of California, San Diego, authored the study.

The study was supported by National Science Foundation award number EAR-1848192 and the Statewide California Earthquake Center proposal number 22105.

A team of scientists from the SETI Institute and the University of California at Davis documented, for the first time, humpback whales producing large bubble rings, like a human smoker blowing smoke rings, during friendly interactions with humans. This previously little studied behavior may represent play or communication. Humpback whales are already known for using bubbles to corral prey and creating bubble trails and bursts when competing to escort a female whale. These new observations show humpback whales producing bubble rings during friendly encounters with humans. This finding contributes to the WhaleSETI team's broader goal of studying non-human intelligence to aid in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

""Because of current limitations on technology, an important assumption of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is that extraterrestrial intelligence and life will be interested in making contact and so target human receivers,"" said Dr. Laurance Doyle, SETI Institute scientist and co-author on the paper. ""This important assumption is certainly supported by the independent evolution of curious behavior in humpback whales.""

""Humpback whales live in complex societies, are acoustically diverse, use bubble tools and assist other species being harassed by predators,"" said co-lead author Dr. Fred Sharpe, UC Davis Affiliate. ""Now, akin to a candidate signal, we show they are blowing bubble rings in our direction in an apparent attempt to playfully interact, observe our response, and/or engage in some form of communication.""

""Humpback whales often exhibit inquisitive, friendly behavior towards boats and human swimmers,"" said co-lead author Jodi Frediani, marine wildlife photographer and U.C. Davis Affiliate. ""We've now located a dozen whales from populations around the world, the majority of which have voluntarily approached boats and swimmers blowing bubble rings during these episodes of curious behavior.""

The team's findings were recently published in Marine Mammal Science in a paper titled ""Humpback Whales Blow Poloidal Vortex Bubble Rings."" The study analyzes 12 bubble ring-production episodes involving 39 rings made by 11 individual whales.

Similar to studying Antarctica or other terrestrial analogs as a proxy for Mars, the Whale-SETI team is studying intelligent, non-terrestrial (aquatic), nonhuman communication systems to develop filters that aid in parsing cosmic signals for signs of extraterrestrial life. As noted by Karen Pryor, ""patterns of bubble production in cetaceans constitute a mode of communication not available to terrestrial mammals"" (Pryor 1990).

Other team members and coauthors of the paper are Dr. Josephine Hubbard (Postdoc, U.C. Davis), Doug Perrine (Doug Perrine Photography), Simon Hilbourne (Marine Research Facility, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia), Dr. Joy Reidenberg (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY) and Dr. Brenda McCowan, ( U.C. Davis, Veterinary Medicine), with specialties in animal intelligences, photography and behavior of humpback whales, whale anatomy, and the use of AI in parsing animal communication, respectively. An earlier paper by the team was published in the journal, PeerJ, entitled, ""Interactive Bioacoustic Playback as a Tool for Detecting and Exploring Nonhuman Intelligence: ""Conversing"" with an Alaskan Humpback Whale."" The authors would like to acknowledge the Templeton Foundation Diverse Intelligences Program for financial support of this work.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How outdated phones can power smart cities and save the seas","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250608072443.htm","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 14:20:30 GMT","

Each year, more than 1.2 billion smartphones are produced globally. The production of electronic devices is not only energy-intensive but also consumes valuable natural resources. Additionally, the manufacturing and delivery processes release a significant amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, devices are aging faster than ever — users replace their still-functional phones on average every 2 to 3 years. At best, old devices are recycled; at worst, they end up in landfills.

Although the most sustainable solution would be to change consumer behavior and consider more carefully whether every new model truly requires replacing the old one, this is easier said than done. Rapid technological development quickly renders older devices obsolete. Therefore, alternative solutions are needed — such as extending the lifespan of devices by giving them an entirely new purpose.

This is precisely the approach tested by researchers Huber Flores, Ulrich Norbisrath, and Zhigang Yin from the University of Tartu's Institute of Computer Science, along with Perseverance Ngoy from the Institute of Technology and their international colleagues. “Innovation often begins not with something new, but with a new way of thinking about the old, re-imagining its role in shaping the future,” explained Huber Flores, Associate Professor of Pervasive Computing. They demonstrated that old smartphones can be successfully repurposed into tiny data centers capable of efficiently processing and storing data. They also found that building such a data center is remarkably inexpensive — around 8 euros per device.

These tiny data centers have a wide range of applications. For example, they could be used in urban environments like bus stops to collect real-time data on the number of passengers, which could then be used to optimize public transportation networks.

In the project's first stage, the researchers removed the phones' batteries and replaced them with external power sources to reduce the risk of chemical leakage into the environment. Then, four phones were connected together, fitted with 3D-printed casings and holders, and turned into a working prototype ready to be re-used, fostering sustainable practices for old electronics.

The prototype was then successfully tested underwater, where it participated in marine life monitoring by helping to count different sea species. Normally, these kinds of tasks require a scuba diver to record video and bring it to the surface for analysis. But with the prototype, the whole process was done automatically underwater.

The team's results show that outdated technology doesn't have to end up as waste. With minimal resources, these devices can be given a new purpose, contributing to the development of more environmentally friendly and sustainable digital solutions.

“Sustainability is not just about preserving the future — it's about reimagining the present, where yesterday's devices become tomorrow's opportunities,” commented Ulrich Norbisrath, Associate Professor of Software Engineering.

When DNA breaks inside the cell, it can spell disaster, especially if the damage occurs in areas of the genome that are difficult to repair. Now, scientists Irene Chiolo and Chiara Merigliano at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences have discovered that a protein called Nup98, long known for helping traffic molecules in and out of the cell's nucleus, plays another surprising role: guiding the cell's most delicate repairs and reducing the risk of genetic mistakes that can lead to cancer. Their findings were published in Molecular Cell.

With support from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the American Cancer Society, the researchers revealed that Nup98 forms droplet-like structures deep inside the nucleus. These ""condensates"" act as protective bubbles around broken strands of DNA in areas called heterochromatin -- zones where the genetic material is so tightly packed that making accurate repairs is especially challenging.

Heterochromatin -- a major focus of Chiolo's research -- is filled with repeated DNA sequences, making it easy for the cell to confuse one stretch for another. Nup98's droplets help lift the damaged section out of that dense zone and create a safer space where it can be repaired accurately, reducing the chance of genetic mix-ups that could lead to cancer.

The researchers also found that Nup98 helps mobilize the damaged site in tightly packed heterochromatin, so it can reach a different part of the nucleus where repair is safer.

Coordinating the repair crew

Timing is everything when it comes to DNA repair, and one of Nup98's most important roles is knowing when to say, ""Not yet.""

The protein's droplet-like condensates act as a temporary shield around damaged DNA, keeping out certain repair proteins that can cause trouble if they arrive too soon. One of those proteins, called Rad51, can accidentally stitch together the wrong pieces of DNA if it gets involved too early in the process.

""The Nup98 droplets keep Rad51 away until other mechanisms have done their work to line up the correct pieces,"" Chiolo said. ""Only once the damaged heterochromatin moves into a different nuclear space, Rad51 can safely finish the repair.""

By coordinating this carefully staged process, Nup98 helps cells avoid dangerous genetic rearrangements -- a key part of maintaining genome stability and slowing processes responsible for cancer and aging.

Implications for cancer and therapy

Although the researchers studied cells of fruit flies, the insights gained can help explain how similar DNA repair mechanisms work in humans. Many DNA repair mechanisms in fruit flies are shared across species, making them a powerful model for understanding genome stability.

The Nup98 discovery could have real-world impact, especially for diseases like acute myeloid leukemia, where mutations in Nup98 are known to play a role. By elucidating how Nup98 guides DNA repair, scientists hope to uncover why its mutations are so dangerous -- and how to harness the mutations to disrupt cancer cells in targeted treatments.

""Eventually, we may also be able to turn Nup98 mutations that lead to cancer, especially acute myeloid leukemia, into treatment targets -- either by specifically disrupting the cells carrying the mutation or by inactivating the harmful functions of the mutated proteins,"" Merigliano said.

The team also sees long-term potential for therapies that could enhance or mimic Nup98's protective functions, reducing the risk of genome instability, which is a major factor not only in cancer, but also in aging and other genome instability disorders.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This battery self-destructs: Biodegradable power inspired by ""Mission: Impossible""","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250607231828.htm","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 05:27:59 GMT","

In the Mission: Impossible films, superspy Ethan Hunt -- played by Tom Cruise -- gets orders from his superiors on various devices that self-destruct in five seconds.

Could electronics disintegrate into nothing in real life? Binghamton University Professor Seokheun ""Sean"" Choi has researched disposable ""papertronics"" over the past 20 years, but the hardest part about making so-called transient electronics is the battery.

""Transient electronics can be used for biomedical and environmental applications, but they must disintegrate in a biosafe manner,"" said Choi, a faculty member at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

""You don't want to have toxic residues inside your body. That type of device is called bioresorbable electronics. For transient or bioresorbable electronics, the key challenge is the power source -- but most power sources, like lithium-ion batteries, include toxic material.""

Choi and his student research team took lessons from their previous research into biobatteries and applied that knowledge to a new idea: In a paper recently published in the journal Small, they show the potential of using probiotics -- live microorganisms that offer health benefits when ingested but are otherwise harmless to the environment or humans.

Maedeh Mohammadifar, PhD '20, a graduate of Choi's Bioelectronics and Microsystems Lab, developed the original dissolvable microbial fuel cell during her time as a Binghamton student.

""We used well-known electricity-producing bacteria, which is within biosafety level 1, so it is safe -- but we were not sure what would happen if these bacteria were released into nature,"" Choi said. ""But whenever I made presentations at conferences, people would ask: 'So, you are using bacteria? Can we safely use that?'""

Current PhD student Maryam Rezaie led the latest research using a premade blend of 15 probiotics.

""It's well documented that probiotics are safe and biocompatible, but we were not sure if those probiotics have electricity-producing capability,"" Choi said. ""There was a question, so she did a lot of experiments on that.""

Early results proved unpromising, he added, but ""we didn't give up. We engineered in an electrode surface that might be preferable to the bacteria, using polymer and some nanoparticles to hypothetically improve the electrocatalytic behavior of probiotics and give them a boost.""

The modified electrode was porous and rough, which offered excellent conditions for bacteria to attach and grow, and that improved the microorganisms' electrogenic capability. Coating the dissolvable paper with a low pH-sensitive polymer -- meaning that it will work only in an acidic environment like a polluted area or the human digestive system -- increased the voltage output and the duration that the battery operated.

Although they produced only a small amount of power, Choi looks at the experiments as a proof of concept for him and future students to build on.

""Other research must be done,"" he said. ""We used probiotic blends, but I want to study individually which ones have the extra electric genes, and how synergistic interactions can improve the power generation. Also, in this research we developed in a single unit of a biobattery. I want to contact them in series or parallel to improve the power.""

It's not easy keeping up with everything that's written on the web, especially not if you've got a dozen open browser tabs vying for your attention. This is where read-it-later apps come in.

These apps let you siphon off articles you want to get back to later, at a more leisurely pace, when the work of the day is done. You can catch up on your reading in bed, on the subway, over breakfast, or whenever you like.

Sadly, we just lost one of the more capable read-it-later apps: Mozilla is shutting down Pocket as it focuses its efforts on its Firefox browser, and Pocket data will be permanently deleted on October 8. If you're looking for a new home for your archive of articles, or you're keen to see what read-it-later apps are capable of doing for the first time, you'll find our pick for the best options below.

Instapaper offers a clean, calm interface.

Instapaper is one of the oldest and most comprehensive read-it-later apps out there, and it does a fine job of turning chaotic webpages into calm, orderly blocks of text that look like they're displayed on an e-reader. Articles can be added straight from your browser, pasted in manually, or added via email, and there are apps for reading saved articles in the web browser and on your mobile devices.

There are lots of neat little features hidden away in Instapaper, like the ability to organize articles with folders and tags. If you decide you like Instapaper enough, there's a paid tier too: For $6 a month it adds features including the option to have articles read out to you, a “'speed read”' mode that displays one word at a time, and the ability to send articles to an Amazon Kindle.

Instapaper (freemium) for web, Android, iOS

Use Feedly to track your favorite sites on the web.

Feedly can help you keep up with everything being published on your favorite sites, and curate a read-it-later list of articles you want to get back to when you have the time. You get a host of features for sorting the incoming deluge of posts, from filters and keyword searches to folders for organization and a choice of list layouts across your devices.

Articles can be saved or shared with a click or a tap, and as your read-it-later section is built up, it appears in the main navigation pane. You can either read simplified articles in Feedly, or click out to the originals on the web. A Feedly Pro subscription ($7 a month) lets you monitor more feeds and access more advanced features like integrations with apps like OneNote, Evernote, and LinkedIn.

Dell is in the middle of a transition. It has a new logo, and a new simplified approach to branding. The Dell 14 Plus is among the first laptop to launch to test the waters in this new era, which is seeing the end of subbrands like XPS and Inspiron. While the more exciting XPS replacement is still to come, the Dell 14 Plus has arrived to step into the shoes of the old Inspiron Plus laptops.

While it's far from the most exciting laptop in the world, it offers a solid balance of quality and value, if only it had more configuration options available to properly classify it as a cheap laptop.

The Dell 14 Plus isn't what I'd call a pretty laptop. But I don't think it's trying to be. Instead, it's trying to be inoffensive. In the past, that might have meant a plastic, black shell. These days, it means a silver chassis with as few distractions or ornaments as possible. The Dell 14 Plus succeeds at doing that.

More importantly, the laptop feels quite sturdy in the hand. The lid has absolutely zero give, likely because of how tightly wound the hinge is. You can't open it with one finger though—in fact, there isn't even a lip on the lid for your finger. That lid is thicker than normal, too, despite the device being just 0.67 inches thick. That's not thin compared to a MacBook Air, no, but it's thin enough to feel modern for a laptop of this price. It also allows for enough room to squeeze in some legacy ports, including USB-A and HDMI. That's in addition to the two USB-C ports and the headphone jack. My only complaint is that both USB-C ports are on the left side, meaning it's the only side you can charge from.

One of the things that keeps the Dell 14 Plus from feeling like a more premium laptop is the screen. It has some thick plastic bezels, and it uses a heavy-handed matte finish. While that helps for deflecting glare, it cheapens the look of the display, making it appear dimmer and more saturated. That's too bad too, since the screen itself is a solid one. It's a surprisingly well-calibrated IPS panel with decent color coverage. According to my testing, it tops out at 332 nits of brightness, which won't blow your socks off, but won't detract too much from the experience.

I should mention that Dell offers a better display option on its 2-in-1 models. It's a glossy Mini-LED display, though it's not currently available from what I can see.

The Dell 14 Plus has a serviceable keyboard and touchpad. Upon receiving the unit, I was concerned about the quality of the touchpad, as its an aspect of mid-tier laptops that tends to get compromised. The touchpad isn't perfect—the surface isn't as smooth as I'd like. But I'm happy to report that this touchpad feels responsive, and the click mechanism isn't overly loud.

The Dell 14 Plus has just single processor options, the Intel Core Ultra 7 256V. This is Intel's modern, efficient CPU that delivers a solid jump in battery life over previous generations. I've tested this chip a number of times already, and the Dell 14 Plus handles it just fine. The Dell 14 Plus even does a job of staying relatively cool and quiet. This isn't the kind of laptop you buy for running heavy applications or games, but for the school, office work, or light content creation, the Dell 14 Plus has plenty of muscle.

It lasted for around 18 hours of battery life in my testing too, which is almost guaranteed to last you through the majority of a day, even under a heavier workload. In the past, a laptop like this would have limped by compared to a MacBook Air, but thanks to the Core Ultra 7 256V, it stands its ground.

One of my biggest problems with the Dell 14 Plus, though, is the lack of configurations. I think it really hurts the value proposition of this otherwise well-priced laptop. Dell only says a model that comes with 1 TB, meaning the starting price is $1,099. Maybe a 512GB model will be introduced at some point, but I have a feeling the high starting price is to leave room for the Dell 14 Base that's inevitably coming at some point. But to me, it cuts the legs out from underneath what could have been an affordable laptop.

Because let's be straight up: this isn't a premium-enough feeling laptop to start at $1,099. It's no MacBook Air, Surface Laptop, or even Dell XPS 14. It's the quality-of-life features that feel lacking by comparison. The design flourishes. The premium materials. The thickness of the chassis and bezels. It's not just aesthetics, either—the Dell 14 Plus has a pretty shoddy 1080p webcam and some atrocious speakers.

But higher-end laptops also don't come with 1 TB of storage at that price—meaning the Dell 14 Plus is at least a few hundred dollars cheaper when similarly configured. That's its calling card.

The good news is that I've seen the Dell 14 Plus and Dell 14 Plus 2-in-1 drop in price at Dell for certain discounts. Sometimes, those price cuts have even been as much as four hundred dollars. $700 for a decent laptop with 1 TB of storage is a great value. But even at its retail price, it's not a bad deal if you know you want this much storage. A MacBook Air will cost you $1,399 to include that much storage onboard.

For everyone else, wait until it goes on discount before buying it. When it does, the Dell 14 Plus is worth a purchase for the value alone.

One of the best parts of owning a bicycle is shopping for all the gear and accessories that you need to go along with it, from bike lights to stay visible on the streets to bike locks to keep it safe when you're at the shop. But no piece of equipment is more important than a bike helmet.

But does buying a more expensive helmet mean you get more protection? What features do you need for what you intend to do, and how often do you have to replace it? And what the heck does MIPS mean? Let me walk you through the jargon and help you make sure your brain stays safe in your skull.

That depends on the kind of riding you do. If you just ride 1 to 5 miles on city streets to work, a commuter or everyday helmet is fine. Some have more or less ventilation or look more or less cool. Others, like the Thousand Chapter MIPS ($145), have commuter-friendly features, like a punch-out hole that lets you lock up your helmet with your bike.

If you're a road cyclist, you need a road helmet like the Kask Utopia Y ($300), which takes aerodynamics, ventilation, and weight into account. A road helmet has to help you go against the wind, keep sweat from dripping into your eyes, and be comfortable for long hours of riding. Mountain biking helmets like the Smith Forefront 2 ($270) cover the back of the skull and often have a visor, and sometimes even include clips to fasten eye protection or googles.

The best way to buy a helmet is also the best way to buy a bike: Try it on. Most helmets today come with a dial system at the rear of the helmet, allowing the rider to adjust their helmets for a more precise fit than ever before. The adage goes “low, level, snug”: Your helmet should sit level on your head and cover almost all of your forehead.

A good rule of thumb is that your index finger should fit in the space between your eyebrows and your helmet. Anything more and the helmet isn't sitting on your head properly. The strap should be snug enough beneath your chin that you shouldn't be able to easily fit a finger between your jaw and the strap. You should also not be able to move the helmet more than an inch or so in any direction.

If you've bought a new bike helmet any time in the last few years, you've no doubt noticed a tiny yellow logo with the word “Mips” printed on it somewhere on the helmet's shell. Mips is an acronym that stands for “Multi-directional Impact Protection System.” It's an in-helmet system that reduces the rotational impact that is common during most crashes.

An inner webbing—what the brand calls its “low-friction layer”—fits snug to your head. This webbing is connected to the helmet's outer shell with a series of fasteners. The low-friction layer and the helmet's outer shell are able to move independently of one another. If you crash while wearing a Mips helmet, the mobility of the low-friction layer works to redirect the rotational forces of impact away from the head.

Mips was developed in the mid-1990s, when Swedish brain surgeon Hans von Holst realized that contemporary helmets weren't doing enough to protect against brain damage. Von Holst noticed that helmets were designed and tested for impacts at straight angles. However, cyclists very rarely have head-on impacts from a crash. Von Holst and his team began to test impacts from a variety of angles to develop a system that could rotate within the helmet, thereby diffusing the force of impact from the head.

After more than a decade of study and design, Mips launched its first product, a proprietary helmet, in 2007. Soon after, Mips became what's known as an “ingredient brand,” selling its technology to megabrands such as Giro, Smith, and Specialized. Hence, the now-ubiquitous little yellow logo.

While Mips is easily the most popular rotational impact system and arguably the industry standard, it's not the only one. Several companies have developed their own proprietary systems that essentially perform the same function as Mips.

For example, the motocross brand 100% outfits most of its new helmets with its proprietary Smartshock system, where a series of tiny elastomers allow the helmets' inner webbing to move independently of its outer shell while absorbing the forces of impact. According to 100%, Smartshock is effective across a wide range of speed and impact types.

Giro, one of the most popular helmet brands on Earth, recently released its new Spherical technology, which is a ball-and-socket system that allows an upper shell to rotate on top of a lower shell in order to redirect impact forces away from the head. (It's worth noting here, though, that the Giro Aries Spherical Helmet ($250) still has a Mips system.)

Trek, another of the world's biggest brands, rolled out its WaveCel system a few years ago. Essentially a crumple zone built into the helmet, WaveCel is a thick, firm inner layer that can flex to reduce initial impact, crumple to absorb energy on impact, and glide to, like Mips, redirect energy from the head. Finally, similar to Trek's WaveCel technology, the Koroyd system uses a series of tubes which crumple instantly and consistently on impact, absorbing the maximum force sustained during a crash. Some helmets, such as the Smith Persist ($130), meld both Mips and Koroyd systems beneath a single shell to offer an added layer of protection.

Even if you are a year-round rider and you have a helmet you love, the general rule of thumb is that you should retire it after three to five years. UV exposure, salt-laden sweat, and daily use all contribute to the degradation of helmets.

Finally, helmets are not meant to be worn after a crash. Even if the spill is minor and the helmet looks and feels perfectly fine, trash it and get a new one. Some brands even offer crash replacement options. Even if your helmet is trashed, take comfort in knowing that it's done its job and kept you safe. It deserves a peaceful, sweat-free retirement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A New Law of Nature Attempts to Explain the Complexity of the Universe","https://www.wired.com/story/why-everything-in-the-universe-turns-more-complex/","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

In 1950 the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi was discussing the possibility of intelligent alien life with his colleagues. If alien civilizations exist, he said, some should surely have had enough time to expand throughout the cosmos. So where are they?

Many answers to Fermi's “paradox” have been proposed: Maybe alien civilizations burn out or destroy themselves before they can become interstellar wanderers. But perhaps the simplest answer is that such civilizations don't appear in the first place: Intelligent life is extremely unlikely, and we pose the question only because we are the supremely rare exception.

A new proposal by an interdisciplinary team of researchers challenges that bleak conclusion. They have proposed nothing less than a new law of nature, according to which the complexity of entities in the universe increases over time with an inexorability comparable to the second law of thermodynamics—the law that dictates an inevitable rise in entropy, a measure of disorder. If they're right, complex and intelligent life should be widespread.

In this new view, biological evolution appears not as a unique process that gave rise to a qualitatively distinct form of matter—living organisms. Instead, evolution is a special (and perhaps inevitable) case of a more general principle that governs the universe. According to this principle, entities are selected because they are richer in a kind of information that enables them to perform some kind of function.

This hypothesis, formulated by the mineralogist Robert Hazen and the astrobiologist Michael Wong of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC, along with a team of others, has provoked intense debate. Some researchers have welcomed the idea as part of a grand narrative about fundamental laws of nature. They argue that the basic laws of physics are not “complete” in the sense of supplying all we need to comprehend natural phenomena; rather, evolution—biological or otherwise—introduces functions and novelties that could not even in principle be predicted from physics alone. “I'm so glad they've done what they've done,” said Stuart Kauffman, an emeritus complexity theorist at the University of Pennsylvania. “They've made these questions legitimate.”

Michael Wong, an astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC.

Others argue that extending evolutionary ideas about function to non-living systems is an overreach. The quantitative value that measures information in this new approach is not only relative—it changes depending on context—it's impossible to calculate. For this and other reasons, critics have charged that the new theory cannot be tested, and therefore is of little use.

The work taps into an expanding debate about how biological evolution fits within the normal framework of science. The theory of Darwinian evolution by natural selection helps us to understand how living things have changed in the past. But unlike most scientific theories, it can't predict much about what is to come. Might embedding it within a meta-law of increasing complexity let us glimpse what the future holds?

The story begins in 2003, when the biologist Jack Szostak published a short article in Nature proposing the concept of functional information. Szostak—who six years later would get a Nobel Prize for unrelated work—wanted to quantify the amount of information or complexity that biological molecules like proteins or DNA strands embody. Classical information theory, developed by the telecommunications researcher Claude Shannon in the 1940s and later elaborated by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, offers one answer. Per Kolmogorov, the complexity of a string of symbols (such as binary 1s and 0s) depends on how concisely one can specify that sequence uniquely.

For example, consider DNA, which is a chain of four different building blocks called nucleotides. Α strand composed only of one nucleotide, repeating again and again, has much less complexity—and, by extension, encodes less information—than one composed of all four nucleotides in which the sequence seems random (as is more typical in the genome).

Jack Szostak proposed a way to quantify information in biological systems.

But Szostak pointed out that Kolmogorov's measure of complexity neglects an issue crucial to biology: how biological molecules function.

In biology, sometimes many different molecules can do the same job. Consider RNA molecules, some of which have biochemical functions that can easily be defined and measured. (Like DNA, RNA is made up of sequences of nucleotides.) In particular, short strands of RNA called aptamers securely bind to other molecules.

Let's say you want to find an RNA aptamer that binds to a particular target molecule. Can lots of aptamers do it, or just one? If only a single aptamer can do the job, then it's unique, just as a long, seemingly random sequence of letters is unique. Szostak said that this aptamer would have a lot of what he called “functional information.”

If many different aptamers can perform the same task, the functional information is much smaller. So we can calculate the functional information of a molecule by asking how many other molecules of the same size can do the same task just as well.

Szostak went on to show that in a case like this, functional information can be measured experimentally. He made a bunch of RNA aptamers and used chemical methods to identify and isolate the ones that would bind to a chosen target molecule. He then mutated the winners a little to seek even better binders and repeated the process. The better an aptamer gets at binding, the less likely it is that another RNA molecule chosen at random will do just as well: The functional information of the winners in each round should rise. Szostak found that the functional information of the best-performing aptamers got ever closer to the maximum value predicted theoretically.

Hazen came across Szostak's idea while thinking about the origin of life—an issue that drew him in as a mineralogist, because chemical reactions taking place on minerals have long been suspected to have played a key role in getting life started. “I concluded that talking about life versus nonlife is a false dichotomy,” Hazen said. “I felt there had to be some kind of continuum—there has to be something that's driving this process from simpler to more complex systems.” Functional information, he thought, promised a way to get at the “increasing complexity of all kinds of evolving systems.”

In 2007 Hazen collaborated with Szostak to write a computer simulation involving algorithms that evolve via mutations. Their function, in this case, was not to bind to a target molecule, but to carry out computations. Again they found that the functional information increased spontaneously over time as the system evolved.

There the idea languished for years. Hazen could not see how to take it any further until Wong accepted a fellowship at the Carnegie Institution in 2021. Wong had a background in planetary atmospheres, but he and Hazen discovered they were thinking about the same questions. “From the very first moment that we sat down and talked about ideas, it was unbelievable,” Hazen said.

Robert Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC.

“I had got disillusioned with the state of the art of looking for life on other worlds,” Wong said. “I thought it was too narrowly constrained to life as we know it here on Earth, but life elsewhere may take a completely different evolutionary trajectory. So how do we abstract far enough away from life on Earth that we'd be able to notice life elsewhere even if it had different chemical specifics, but not so far that we'd be including all kinds of self-organizing structures like hurricanes?”

The pair soon realized that they needed expertise from a whole other set of disciplines. “We needed people who came at this problem from very different points of view, so that we all had checks and balances on each other's prejudices,” Hazen said. “This is not a mineralogical problem; it's not a physics problem, or a philosophical problem. It's all of those things.”

They suspected that functional information was the key to understanding how complex systems like living organisms arise through evolutionary processes happening over time. “We all assumed the second law of thermodynamics supplies the arrow of time,” Hazen said. “But it seems like there's a much more idiosyncratic pathway that the universe takes. We think it's because of selection for function—a very orderly process that leads to ordered states. That's not part of the second law, although it's not inconsistent with it either.”

Looked at this way, the concept of functional information allowed the team to think about the development of complex systems that don't seem related to life at all.

At first glance, it doesn't seem a promising idea. In biology, function makes sense. But what does “function” mean for a rock?

All it really implies, Hazen said, is that some selective process favors one entity over lots of other potential combinations. A huge number of different minerals can form from silicon, oxygen, aluminum, calcium, and so on. But only a few are found in any given environment. The most stable minerals turn out to be the most common. But sometimes less stable minerals persist because there isn't enough energy available to convert them to more stable phases.

“Information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge, and energy.”

This might seem trivial, like saying that some objects exist while other ones don't, even if they could in theory. But Hazen and Wong have shown that, even for minerals, functional information has increased over the course of Earth's history. Minerals evolve toward greater complexity (though not in the Darwinian sense). Hazen and colleagues speculate that complex forms of carbon such as graphene might form in the hydrocarbon-rich environment of Saturn's moon Titan—another example of an increase in functional information that doesn't involve life.

It's the same with chemical elements. The first moments after the Big Bang were filled with undifferentiated energy. As things cooled, quarks formed and then condensed into protons and neutrons. These gathered into the nuclei of hydrogen, helium, and lithium atoms. Only once stars formed and nuclear fusion happened within them did more complex elements like carbon and oxygen form. And only when some stars had exhausted their fusion fuel did their collapse and explosion in supernovas create heavier elements such as heavy metals. Steadily, the elements increased in nuclear complexity.

Wong said their work implies three main conclusions.

First, biology is just one example of evolution. “There is a more universal description that drives the evolution of complex systems.”

Second, he said, there might be “an arrow in time that describes this increasing complexity,” similar to the way the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the increase in entropy, is thought to create a preferred direction of time.

Finally, Wong said, “information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge and energy.”

In the work Hazen and Szostak conducted on evolution using artificial-life algorithms, the increase in functional information was not always gradual. Sometimes it would happen in sudden jumps. That echoes what is seen in biological evolution. Biologists have long recognized transitions where the complexity of organisms increases abruptly. One such transition was the appearance of organisms with cellular nuclei (around 1.8 billion to 2.7 billion years ago). Then there was the transition to multicellular organisms (around 2 billion to 1.6 billion years ago), the abrupt diversification of body forms in the Cambrian explosion (540 million years ago), and the appearance of central nervous systems (around 600 million to 520 million years ago). The arrival of humans was arguably another major and rapid evolutionary transition.

Evolutionary biologists have tended to view each of these transitions as a contingent event. But within the functional-information framework, it seems possible that such jumps in evolutionary processes (whether biological or not) are inevitable.

In these jumps, Wong pictures the evolving objects as accessing an entirely new landscape of possibilities and ways to become organized, as if penetrating to the “next floor up.” Crucially, what matters—the criteria for selection, on which continued evolution depends—also changes, plotting a wholly novel course. On the next floor up, possibilities await that could not have been guessed before you reached it.

For example, during the origin of life it might initially have mattered that proto-biological molecules would persist for a long time—that they'd be stable. But once such molecules became organized into groups that could catalyze one another's formation—what Kauffman has called autocatalytic cycles—the molecules themselves could be short-lived, so long as the cycles persisted. Now it was dynamical, not thermodynamic, stability that mattered. Ricard Solé of the Santa Fe Institute thinks such jumps might be equivalent to phase transitions in physics, such as the freezing of water or the magnetization of iron: They are collective processes with universal features, and they mean that everything changes, everywhere, all at once. In other words, in this view there's a kind of physics of evolution—and it's a kind of physics we know about already.

The tricky thing about functional information is that, unlike a measure such as size or mass, it is contextual: It depends on what we want the object to do, and what environment it is in. For instance, the functional information for an RNA aptamer binding to a particular molecule will generally be quite different from the information for binding to a different molecule.

Yet finding new uses for existing components is precisely what evolution does. Feathers did not evolve for flight, for example. This repurposing reflects how biological evolution is jerry-rigged, making use of what's available.

Kauffman argues that biological evolution is thus constantly creating not just new types of organisms but new possibilities for organisms, ones that not only did not exist at an earlier stage of evolution but could not possibly have existed. From the soup of single-celled organisms that constituted life on Earth 3 billion years ago, no elephant could have suddenly emerged—this required a whole host of preceding, contingent but specific innovations.

However, there is no theoretical limit to the number of uses an object has. This means that the appearance of new functions in evolution can't be predicted—and yet some new functions can dictate the very rules of how the system evolves subsequently. “The biosphere is creating its own possibilities,” Kauffman said. “Not only do we not know what will happen, we don't even know what can happen.” Photosynthesis was such a profound development; so were eukaryotes, nervous systems and language. As the microbiologist Carl Woese and the physicist Nigel Goldenfeld put it in 2011, “We need an additional set of rules describing the evolution of the original rules. But this upper level of rules itself needs to evolve. Thus, we end up with an infinite hierarchy.”

The physicist Paul Davies of Arizona State University agrees that biological evolution “generates its own extended possibility space which cannot be reliably predicted or captured via any deterministic process from prior states. So life evolves partly into the unknown.”

“An increase in complexity provides the future potential to find new strategies unavailable to simpler organisms.”

Mathematically, a “phase space” is a way of describing all possible configurations of a physical system, whether it's as comparatively simple as an idealized pendulum or as complicated as all the atoms comprising the Earth. Davies and his co-workers have recently suggested that evolution in an expanding accessible phase space might be formally equivalent to the “incompleteness theorems” devised by the mathematician Kurt Gödel. Gödel showed that any system of axioms in mathematics permits the formulation of statements that can't be shown to be true or false. We can only decide such statements by adding new axioms.

Davies and colleagues say that, as with Gödel's theorem, the key factor that makes biological evolution open-ended and prevents us from being able to express it in a self-contained and all-encompassing phase space is that it is self-referential: The appearance of new actors in the space feeds back on those already there to create new possibilities for action. This isn't the case for physical systems, which, even if they have, say, millions of stars in a galaxy, are not self-referential.

“An increase in complexity provides the future potential to find new strategies unavailable to simpler organisms,” said Marcus Heisler, a plant developmental biologist at the University of Sydney and co-author of the incompleteness paper. This connection between biological evolution and the issue of noncomputability, Davies said, “goes right to the heart of what makes life so magical.”

Is biology special, then, among evolutionary processes in having an open-endedness generated by self-reference? Hazen thinks that in fact once complex cognition is added to the mix—once the components of the system can reason, choose, and run experiments “in their heads”—the potential for macro-micro feedback and open-ended growth is even greater. “Technological applications take us way beyond Darwinism,” he said. A watch gets made faster if the watchmaker is not blind.

If Hazen and colleagues are right that evolution involving any kind of selection inevitably increases functional information—in effect, complexity—does this mean that life itself, and perhaps consciousness and higher intelligence, is inevitable in the universe? That would run counter to what some biologists have thought. The eminent evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr believed that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence was doomed because the appearance of humanlike intelligence is “utterly improbable.” After all, he said, if intelligence at a level that leads to cultures and civilizations were so adaptively useful in Darwinian evolution, how come it only arose once across the entire tree of life?

Mayr's evolutionary point possibly vanishes in the jump to humanlike complexity and intelligence, whereupon the whole playing field is utterly transformed. Humans attained planetary dominance so rapidly (for better or worse) that the question of when it will happen again becomes moot.

But what about the chances of such a jump happening in the first place? If the new “law of increasing functional information” is right, it looks as though life, once it exists, is bound to get more complex by leaps and bounds. It doesn't have to rely on some highly improbable chance event.

What's more, such an increase in complexity seems to imply the appearance of new causal laws in nature that, while not incompatible with the fundamental laws of physics governing the smallest component parts, effectively take over from them in determining what happens next. Arguably we see this already in biology: Galileo's (apocryphal) experiment of dropping two masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa no longer has predictive power when the masses are not cannonballs but living birds.

Together with the chemist Lee Cronin of the University of Glasgow, Sara Walker of Arizona State University has devised an alternative set of ideas to describe how complexity arises, called assembly theory. In place of functional information, assembly theory relies on a number called the assembly index, which measures the minimum number of steps required to make an object from its constituent ingredients.

“Laws for living systems must be somewhat different than what we have in physics now,” Walker said, “but that does not mean that there are no laws.” But she doubts that the putative law of functional information can be rigorously tested in the lab. “I am not sure how one could say [the theory] is right or wrong, since there is no way to test it objectively,” she said. “What would the experiment look for? How would it be controlled? I would love to see an example, but I remain skeptical until some metrology is done in this area.”

Hazen acknowledges that, for most physical objects, it is impossible to calculate functional information even in principle. Even for a single living cell, he admits, there's no way of quantifying it. But he argues that this is not a sticking point, because we can still understand it conceptually and get an approximate quantitative sense of it. Similarly, we can't calculate the exact dynamics of the asteroid belt because the gravitational problem is too complicated—but we can still describe it approximately enough to navigate spacecraft through it.

Wong sees a potential application of their ideas in astrobiology. One of the curious aspects of living organisms on Earth is that they tend to make a far smaller subset of organic molecules than they could make given the basic ingredients. That's because natural selection has picked out some favored compounds. There's much more glucose in living cells, for example, than you'd expect if molecules were simply being made either randomly or according to their thermodynamic stability. So one potential signature of lifelike entities on other worlds might be similar signs of selection outside what chemical thermodynamics or kinetics alone would generate. (Assembly theory similarly predicts complexity-based biosignatures.)

There might be other ways of putting the ideas to the test. Wong said there is more work still to be done on mineral evolution, and they hope to look at nucleosynthesis and computational “artificial life.” Hazen also sees possible applications in oncology, soil science and language evolution. For example, the evolutionary biologist Frédéric Thomas of the University of Montpellier in France and colleagues have argued that the selective principles governing the way cancer cells change over time in tumors are not like those of Darwinian evolution, in which the selection criterion is fitness, but more closely resemble the idea of selection for function from Hazen and colleagues.

Hazen's team has been fielding queries from researchers ranging from economists to neuroscientists, who are keen to see if the approach can help. “People are approaching us because they are desperate to find a model to explain their system,” Hazen said.

But whether or not functional information turns out to be the right tool for thinking about these questions, many researchers seem to be converging on similar questions about complexity, information, evolution (both biological and cosmic), function and purpose, and the directionality of time. It's hard not to suspect that something big is afoot. There are echoes of the early days of thermodynamics, which began with humble questions about how machines work and ended up speaking to the arrow of time, the peculiarities of living matter, and the fate of the universe.

Bill Atkinson, an engineer who played a key role in the development of the Macintosh and other landmark Apple products, has died of pancreatic cancer. 

After Atkinson's family announced his passing on Facebook, Wired's Steven Levy provided an overview of Atkinson's many accomplishments as Apple employee number 51 . In addition to the Macintosh, the Apple projects he either created or contributed to include the Lisa computer, QuickDraw, the Magic Slate (a precursor of the iPad), and HyperCard (a precursor to the World Wide Web).

Atkinson, who was 74, eventually became passionate about nature photography and, when he was diagnosed with cancer last year, wrote on Facebook that he had “already led an amazing and wonderful life.”

In a post on X, Apple CEO Tim Cook described Atkinson as “a true visionary whose creativity, heart, and groundbreaking work on the Mac will forever inspire us.” And Daring Fireball's John Gruber wrote that “with no hyperbole,” Atkinson “may well have been the best computer programmer who ever lived.”

There was palpable excitement around Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) last year. The company was about to unveil its AI capabilities, with the tech world expecting the company to unveil an AI platform capable of competing with Google and OpenAI. The demos Apple showed off at the time were compelling, but the follow-through has been underwhelming, leaving both developers and consumers wanting more.

Apple's broader struggles with AI have become clearer over the past year. Its ambitions around personalized intelligence have faced delays, and its rollout of new tools has been inconsistent. The vision that Apple sold in 2024 — a seamless blend of on-device AI, revamped Siri interactions, and powerful new developer capabilities — has yet to materialize in full.

Apple Intelligence features saw a staggered rollout that came with several hiccups. The personalized version of Siri that was showcased last year has been delayed, which matters because Apple framed the new Siri as a cornerstone of its AI strategy — a context-aware assistant that could understand user behavior across apps. Without it, the company's AI value proposition looks surprisingly thin.

This also meant that developers couldn't take full advantage of the new AI-powered Siri, and users couldn't rely on the assistant to perform in-app actions as promised. For developers, that's a lost opportunity to build more interactive, intelligent app experiences. For consumers, it's another promise unfulfilled. And for Apple, it raises concerns about how competitive its AI stack really is compared to its increasingly powerful rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft.

With WWDC 2025 now just around the corner, expectations for consumer-facing Apple Intelligence features are more cautious than last year. Most developers and analysts are now hoping for incremental improvements: smoother integration of AI into native apps, and tools that empower developers to actually use the AI that Apple is building. (No one is expecting much on the Siri front.)

One of Apple's best opportunities lies in enabling AI-assisted app development. The rise of tools like Cursor, Replit, and Bolt.new has made code generation a whole lot easier, helping developers, and even non-developers, bring products to life faster. 

AI-powered apps have found the web an effective distribution platform. ChatGPT, for instance, gained massive traction on the web before launching native apps for iOS and Android. At the same time, tools like WordPress, Hostinger, Canva, and Figma now let non-technical users create simple apps using natural language prompts. Apple needs to modernize here, too.

Ideally, new AI tooling should allow more developers to create apps and post them on the App Store. That would enrich the iOS app ecosystem and open up new revenue opportunities for Apple, which is even more critical now that some of its App Store income is under threat.

Apple has made some announcements, but many have yet to materialize. Swift Assist, a coding assistant for Xcode, was shown off last year but hasn't seen wide release. Apple is also reportedly working on an Anthropic-powered AI coding tool and plans to open access to its own AI models for developers. The goal is to lower the barrier for building iOS apps, both for pros and newcomers.

However, there are two things to consider: the web's dominance as an application distribution platform and new regulations that bar Apple from charging fees in the U.S. for payments outside the app.

The second part is a particularly big deal. In April, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers asked Apple to remove restrictions around linking to outside payment methods for digital purchases in apps for the U.S. App Store. More importantly, the ruling also barred Apple from charging any fees for these kinds of payments. On Wednesday, a U.S. court rejected Apple's appeal to put a stay on the ruling.

This means developers will encourage customers to purchase subscriptions and add-ons outside the App Store, also possibly at a discounted rate compared with their App Store prices. 

This ruling could also spur other regulators to put similar pressure on Apple and cull App Store fees for third-party payments. Earlier this week, Apple reported that it generated $1.3 trillion in billings and sales in 2024, with 90% of that value generation happening without paying Apple a commission. But even some percentage of the remaining $130 billion means many billions in revenue for the company.

Amid all this, Apple needs to reassert the value of its ecosystem. It's not clear if Apple will cut its commissions, but it will be interesting to see what kind of App Store features the company launches to make native iOS apps a more lucrative avenue for developers.

As WWDC 2025 approaches, Apple is in the unusual position of having to share a better story. Its AI ambitions are being challenged not only by faster-moving competitors but also by changing legal and economic realities. To succeed, Apple has to demonstrate that it can deliver on AI, for end users and the developers who power its ecosystem. Especially in a world where AI accelerates everything, Apple can't afford to lag behind.

NASA engineers have spent the past decade developing a rugged, partially autonomous lander designed to explore Europa, one of Jupiter's most intriguing moons. The space agency got cold feet over the project, but engineers are now targeting a new destination for the probe: Enceladus.

Europa has long been a prime target in the search for extraterrestrial biology because scientists suspect it harbors a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, potentially teeming with microbial life. But the robot—packed with radiation shielding, cutting-edge software, and ice-drilling appendages—won't be going anywhere anytime soon.

In a recent paper in Science Robotics, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) outlined the design and testing of what was once the Europa Lander prototype, a four-legged robotic explorer built to survive the brutal surface conditions of the Jovian moon. The robot was designed to walk—as opposed to roll—analyze terrain, collect samples, and drill into Europa's icy crust—all with minimal guidance from Earth, due to the major communication lag between our planet and the moon 568 million miles (914 million kilometers) away.

Designed to operate autonomously for hours at a time, the bot came equipped with stereoscopic cameras, a robotic arm, LED lights, and a suite of specialized materials tough enough to endure harsh radiation and bone-chilling cold. Temperatures on the moon range from about -210 degrees Fahrenheit (-134 degrees Celsius) at its equator to as low as -370 degrees F (-223 degrees C) at its poles.

After years of development—including testing in JPL's labs, advanced simulations, and a final field trial on icy terrain in Alaska—the Europa Lander aced its tests. It was ready to take on the solar system's frosty frontier. But the space agency has now pulled the plug on the mission.

According to the team, the challenges of getting to Europa—its radiation exposure, immense distance, and short observation windows—proved too daunting for NASA's higher-ups. And that's before you take into consideration the devastating budget cuts planned by the Trump administration, which would see the agency's funding fall from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion. The lander, once the centerpiece of a bold astrobiology initiative, is now essentially mothballed.

But the engineers aren't giving up. They're now lobbying for the robot to get a second shot—on Enceladus, Saturn's ice-covered moon, which also boasts a subsurface ocean and has proven more favorable for robotic exploration. Enceladus is still frigid, but has lower radiation and better access windows than Europa.

Whether the ice-walker gets a new lease on its semi-autonomous life remains to be seen. But the robot was built for a moonwalk—albeit a relatively rigid and clanky one—and it deserves its moment.

Who says a robot vacuum can't be a statement piece? While it may not have the name recognition of Roomba or Roborock, Dreame has quietly been making some of the best (and most attractive) robot vacuum/mops for the last few years, and its new flagship model—the X50 Ultra—has all of the features you expect from a top-of-the-line unit (with a price to match). It fared better in some of my toughest tests than any other robovacs to date, but it also hit some snags along the way.

See X50 Ultra at Amazon

For starters, the X50 Ultra looks a lot like every other high-end robovac on the market today. Seriously, it bears so much resemblance to Roborock's Saros 10, I would think it's the same vacuum just with different labeling. It even has the same retracting LIDAR turret, which also makes me wonder if these are all made in the same factory. That digression aside, the vacuum's docking station looks sleek and modern. I'd call it the most attractive one I've tested to date, which is good because at 13.4 x 18 x 23 inches, it will be somewhat prominent in your home. The dock can wash the vacuum's mop pads with 176-degree Fahrenheit water, which is good for killing bacteria. The two water reservoirs (one for clean and one for dirty) are both massive, and for the three weeks of my testing, I never had to change them. It also comes with a disposable vacuum bag pre-installed and a small reservoir of floor cleaning solution.

Dreame X50 Ultra

If you can stomach the price, the Dream X50 Ultra handles vacuuming and mopping like a champ.

Pros

Cons

Underneath the vacuum, you'll find split, dual roller brushes (again, uncannily similar to the brush system on a lot of Roborock models), and it can suck at a considerable 20,000 Pa, putting it right up there with the most powerful competitors. The X50 Ultra also has dual, rotating mop pads, one of which can extend away from the body to clean closer to walls; the mop pads can detach and remain in the base during vacuum-only tasks. There's also a sweeper arm with three brushes that can extend outwards to help bring debris into the path of the vacuum. The bot features a LIDAR turret (which retracts when going under low furniture) as well as extends in the front for navigation.

Setting up the X50 Ultra is straightforward—you pretty much fill the clean water reservoir, install the detergent bottle, and plug it in. Then, you control everything using a companion app, which first requires scanning the QR code under the robot's hood, installing any firmware updates, and then having your home mapped. The initial scan of my apartment was very quick. The X50 Ultra didn't drive everywhere, so I was worried it missed some areas, but it managed to account for every square foot. You'll have to spend a few minutes naming the rooms and editing the dividing lines between them, but that's par for the course with robovacs.

For my first clean, I just selected CleanGenius mode, which is the default and its most “intelligent” mode. It suggested I start with an initial deep clean, which I thought was a nice touch, but it didn't exactly impress me out of the gates. For starters, the X50 Ultra picked a wildly inefficient route for cleaning my apartment, starting with my kitchen (fine) and then driving all the way across to the bedroom, skipping several areas in between. Then it skipped to the living room, and so on. Within the room, the X50 Ultra seemed to waste a lot of movement just kind of looking around, spinning in circles, and generally meandering. The pattern it made on my carpet was just randomness. The whole vacuuming took 80 minutes total, which was 11 minutes longer than the next slowest vacuum I've tested (the Roborock Saros Z70), even on their deepest-cleaning modes. While the X50 Ultra made it through my one-bedroom apartment on maximum power, the battery was down around 30% by the end of it. That means in a bigger house it might have to stop and recharge mid-cleaning before it continues (or you could reduce the suction power).

The X50 Ultra also missed a fair amount of dirt on the initial run. I was surprised by how many little bits and pieces were still strewn about the kitchen and hallway, so after the floor dried, I sent the robot back to those areas, but this time on Max+ vacuum power. The robovac is a lot louder in that mode, but it did manage to suck up everything in the middle of the rooms. Unfortunately, the edge cleaning was a serious letdown. Even with its extending sweeper arm, it just missed a ton of stuff near the walls.

See X50 Ultra at Amazon

Dreame's robovac does a very good job of mopping, and it managed to clean up three ketchup spots at varying stages of drying as well as some congealed grease on my floor. Unfortunately, again, it struggled to clean the edges. I'd spilled some juice on the floor right next to my sink (a common place for liquid accidents), and the spot was basically aligned with the edge of an overhanging cabinet. Somehow it didn't get to the spill at all, even though it was well within reach of its extendable mop pad. I will say, though, that the mopping action is whisper quiet. Some of the mops on Roborock's bots scream like banshees. The X50 Ultra was easily the quietest mop in a robovac that I've tested.

Generally, the object recognition on the X50 Ultra is strong. It carefully avoided an orange USB cord on hardwood, and it dodged a white cord on a white rug. Its object detection isn't always perfect—one time it slurped up a black cord on the white rug (which you'd think would be the easiest to see), and I had to turn the bot over and free it from the vacuum brush (a very easy, tool-less affair). The X50 Ultra managed to avoid things like socks and slippers, though, and often labeled them correctly on the map when it saw them. Dreame claims the X50 Ultra can identify over 200 objects, and you can have it set to automatically photograph them if you want that for some reason.

For its toughest test, I threw down my notorious Snack Gauntlet, consisting of goldfish crackers, pumpkin seeds, pistachio shells, some scattered oats, and bits of oregano around the edges of walls, and I distributed them both on hardwood and a medium-pile carpet. It's mostly good news here. The X50 Ultra fared better than any other robovac I've tested in the areas that it reached. Almost all bots really struggle with the pistachio shells and tend to sort of choke on them. This bot didn't bat an eye, hoovering them up effortlessly and quietly. It also didn't crush or regurgitate any of the goldfish or seeds, which is a common issue. The X50 Ultra even got some oats hiding under my TV cabinet—something no other robovac that I've tested has achieved. The vacuum and spinning brush system performed incredibly well here.

The X50 Ultra still suffered from the aforementioned edge issues. Cleaning along the walls was spotty (I used dried oregano so I could clearly see places it missed). The robovac was also inconsistent in the corners, nearly always leaving at least a bit of debris (sometimes more). If a piece of food was within an inch or so of some furniture or a wall, it just missed it completely. I put a couple of shells under cabinet overhangs (which it can get under), and the bot missed those, too. It's especially frustrating because the X50 Ultra performed better than any other vacuum in the open floor.

There are some other excellent features worth mentioning. For starters, the X50 Ultra can vault itself over thresholds up to 1.65 inches tall, which is the biggest climb for any robovac on the market, and it does it with two clever extending legs that sort of catapult it over things. It's cool to watch, and it worked well. The X50 Ultra also has voice commands built right into it, so while you can pair it with Google Home, Apple Home, or Alexa, you don't have to, and you can give it very specific commands (e.g., “vacuum the bedroom,” “mop the kitchen,” etc.)—and it will hop to.

I also love that the X50 Ultra leaves its mop pads on the dock when it doesn't need them, which should help keep your rugs drier. Even if you're doing both at once, the robovac will raise up the mop pads a full 10.5mm (0.4 inches), which should be enough to keep them above most (non-shag) carpets. It can also lower its LIDAR mast, making the bot roughly 3.5 inches tall. Overall, Dreame's companion app is solid, and while it doesn't have quite as much polish as Roborock's apps it offers effectively all the functionality you could want, including remotely controlling the bot with POV video, taking photos of your pets, and pretty granular adjustments for all of the features, such as how much water the mop should use, how aggressive the sweeping arm should be, etc.

Ultimately, the X50 Ultra is a very good robot vacuum/mop. While it's slower than I'd like, the real thing that keeps it from being Great with a capital G is its poor performance around edges, corners, and furniture. I will say, though, that it seems to be a limitation of the software rather than the hardware, which gives me some hope that this could be addressed in future firmware updates. But for now, for a robot vacuum that currently sells at between $1,400 and $1,700, I expect to not have to vacuum/mop any edges by hand after it's done its main cleaning.

Roborock has established itself as a premium brand within the robot vacuum space with most of its newer models now being offered at more than $1,000 and even some of its best-selling models being above $2,000. Despite this move towards luxury pricing, there are still fantastic deals to be found on units that are feature-rich and incredibly competent—products that were new two years ago and that are still leading the pack in home automation.

Roborock Qrevo S is a great case in point, and it offers performance and ease of use equal to far more expensive options. Now, Amazon is offering the Qrevo S for an all-time low of only $459 which is a whopping 43% off its standard $799 list price. It's a bargain that's hard to resist if you're seeking premium cleaning power on a budget.

See at Amazon

The multi-functional docking station excels with a very hands-off experience for users: the dock automatically washes and dries the mop pads with hot air but it also cleans the robot's dustbin without assistance and refills its water tank as well with the capability to constantly mop areas measuring up to 4,305 square feet. That's seven weeks of hassle-free cleaning with the only upkeep required being the occasional draining of the dock's larger water and dust reservoirs.

Its heavy-duty 7,000 Pa suction power is one of the strongest available on the market, and it is capable of pulling hair, dirt and dust out from deeply embedded carpets and hardwood and tile crevices. Its multi-directional floating brush minimizes hair tangling for continuous cleaning effectiveness even in pet- or long-haired-resident households. The vacuum comes with a cutting-edge 10mm auto mop raise mechanism which allows it to seamlessly transition between vacuuming carpets and mopping hard floors without leaving wet marks or dirty streaks.

The performance in terms of mopping is equally impressive courtesy of dynamic dual spinning mops that work at a rate of 200 RPM. Combined with 30 adjustable levels of water flow, these mops allow you to customize cleaning intensity for different floor types remotely from the app. You enjoy spotless and streak-free floors that gleam like a pro after every pass. The Qrevo S comes equipped with advanced obstacle avoidance technology powered by PreciSense LiDAR navigation and 3D mapping.

At its all-time low price on Amazon, the Qrevo S offers an incredible value proposition.

Google just blocked ad-blockers, again.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


YouTube has recently expanded its ad-blocking measures, closing the loopholes that browsers and other third-party extensions with ad-blocking capabilities used to remove ads from YouTube videos. The company first started experimental measures against ad-blockers in 2023, before going full steam ahead in 2024. But even so, a few apps, including Mozilla Firefox (and extensions), exploited weaknesses in YouTube's protection over the past few months. However, this is no longer the case, according to 9to5Google, and some users who previously bypassed ads reported they can no longer play YouTube videos unless they add the video hosting site to their adblocker's allowlist or disable their ad-blocker altogether.

You can subscribe to YouTube if you want to get rid of ads on the platform, but many people do not like doing that. After all, why pay a monthly fee when there is an easy way to get around the ads? And when the company first tried implementing the ad-blocker ban, there was a massive uproar online and in the real world. It even went to the point that a privacy consultant in the EU filed a criminal complaint against the company for “unlawful surveillance.”

The aforementioned ruckus died down with the discovery of ad blocker-blocker loopholes. But now that Google has acted again to close loopholes, people are up in arms about the measures.

Nevertheless, it seems that not everyone has been affected by this change yet. Users in Southeast Asia and Europe still seem to have fully-functioning ad blockers for YouTube. We do not know if YouTube hasn't implemented the changes in those regions yet, or if updated filter-lists have already been deployed by ad blockers devs to counter the latest ad blocker-blocker efforts.

While we understand the need for Google to make money, people will still want to access their services for free and without any irksome interruptions. So, as long as there is a demand, there will definitely be a supply. This will likely be the whack-a-mole game that YouTube, and its parent company Alphabet, will need to do as long as it exists.

Microsoft is gearing up for an offensive on SteamOS.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Signs of Microsoft's efforts to bring its Windows and Xbox platforms closer together have started appearing online. Case in point, the just-dropped YouTube trailer for MIO: Memories In Orbit shows the game's availability on both Steam and ""Xbox PC."" Microsoft's press release for Gears of War: Reloaded also mentioned that it's coming to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox PC, Xbox Cloud Gaming, PlayStation 5, and Steam this summer. This shows how the company is pushing for gamers to use the Xbox app on their gaming PCs instead of just installing a title directly, with Redmond aiming squarely at Steam.

Aside from these mentions, the Xbox App also received a massive change — Xbox users can now see their Xbox console games in the Xbox app library on their PCs. The Verge believes that this was intentional on the part of Microsoft to “closely combine its Xbox and Windows stores.”

While the Nintendo Switch pioneered modern handheld consoles (with the Switch 2 dropping in stores a few days ago), Steam Deck revolutionized it in 2022 when it allowed gamers to play their favorite PC games on such a portable device while running SteamOS. Other PC manufacturers soon followed suit, with Asus, Lenovo, MSI, and even Zotac launching their own competitors. All of them used Windows 11 — until Lenovo launched the Legion Go S With SteamOS.

This console ditched Windows in favor of Valve's Linux-based operating system, so it's normal for one to think that this would primarily be a Steam Deck competitor. But since the Legion Go S is also available with Microsoft's OS, reviewers were able to compare the performance of both devices with the same specifications. Some initial reviews claimed that the Valve-powered device could outperform by Windows-powered version by as much as 75%. Although not surprising, the results probably still alarmed Microsoft, with reports saying the company shelved its work on a first-party Xbox handheld to focus on revamping Windows 11 portable performance.

To be fair, Microsoft has already had something like this in the works for months (or maybe even years) now. News leaked that Asus has been working on Project Kennan, a handheld gaming console that will carry the Xbox brand and has been more closely integrated with Xbox Game Pass. The OEM even dropped a teaser a couple of days before Nintendo launched the Switch 2, although details about the actual console are still sparse. Nevertheless, we expect it to arrive in late 2025, which is the likely reason why we're starting to see Xbox PC logos on game launches.

The Microsoft Xbox Series X|S is sorely lagging behind the Sony PlayStation 5 in sales, with the PS5 estimated to have sold over 75 million units — more than double the Xbox Series X|S's total of over 33 million units. Windows is still king in PC gaming, but its leadership is being threatened by SteamOS. Most desktop and laptop gamers still stick with Windows, even though you can install SteamOS on your PC (but it isn't mainstream gaming desktop ready, as yet). However, handheld gamers now have an option between Windows and SteamOS on the same device, and this likely has kept Microsoft and Xbox executives awake at night.

A new way to fix locked firmware issues with used hardware, perhaps.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A PC enthusiast has used ChatGPT to circumvent the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) features of a used tablet. Thanks to OpenAI's chatbot (and BIOS programmer hardware), XDA forums member Deskmodder then managed to update the obsolete Android 6.0-powered Panasonic ToughPad FZ-A2 tablet's UEFI BIOS and install Windows 10 and Linux Mint. It is good to see barriers to the re-use of serviceable old hardware being eradicated.

Above, we mentioned that the ruggedized Panasonic tablet was saddled with a rather old version of Android. However, this device was in some ways tamper-proof due to it being locked with Factory Reset Protection (FRP).

FRP is most commonly used in securing Android devices, and means that the original credentials need to be input to reset it. It works as a basic security measure to restrict significant changes to administrators and prevent stolen devices being easily wiped and resold. Second hand devices should be reset by the previous owner/administrator before being passed on, but obviously this doesn't always happen.

Deskmodder seems to have been aware of the device's FRP lock, but explains “seeing that it has an Intel CPU (Atom X5 8550) and a traditional x86 UEFI BIOS, I thought I'd try to hack it to run something else.” That's the spirit.

With ChatGPT and a CH341A flash programmer at hand, the intrepid modder went through the following process:

The system tinkering enthusiast has also shared their original ChatGPT conversation for the BIOS hacking, if you are interested enough in the process.

We note that Deskmodder has moved onto new milestone since their original post where Linux Mint was successfully shoehorned onto the ToughPad. Specifically, they have managed to get “Windows 10 up and running.” Sadly, at the time of writing they are still reporting a handful of driver issues.

Deskmodder's tale raises the possibility of making better use of old firmware-locked PCs. That is, unless the AI just ‘got lucky' in this case, despite the enthusiast asserting there was “no information on the hack I did online, and I may be the first to attempt this.”

Used marketplaces are littered with ex-corporate laptops, with effective re-use hampered by forgotten firmware passwords. Some models/generations of devices can be bought and unlocked using known patching tools, but there are plenty that aren't patchable to unlocked firmware versions yet. It would be good if these products could be reused more effectively thanks to AI tools. Many devices seem too good to be recycled for spares or scrap.

ALAJUELA, Costa Rica – The U.S. U-20 Women's National Team fell to Canada 1-0 in the semifinals of the 2025 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship. It was just the fourth-ever loss for the USA at this competition dating back to 2002.

With no Third-Place Match in this year's tournament, the USA heads home having already qualified for the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup by advancing to the semifinal after winning its first two games in Group A. The USA had won a record seven Concacaf championships at this age level, including six of the last eight. The loss marked the first time the USA has not advanced to the title game of this tournament in the past 12 Concacaf U-20 championships.

The 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup will be held from September 5–27 next year in Poland.

It was an end-to-end match with Canada's powerful striker Annabelle Chukwu, who plays at Notre Dame, providing most of the danger for her side. The USA controlled 65% of the possession, had more corner kicks (5-3) and outshot Canada 12-9 for the game. Canada did have a higher expected goals over the USA – 0.94 to 0.45 – but the USA had an edge in shots on goal at 5-2. Unfortunately for the young Americans, one of those two went into the net, and USA could not find a way through a hard-tackling and gritty Canada defense and an in-form goalkeeper.

Canada broke the deadlock in the 56th minute as Teegan Melenhorst chipped a short pass behind the U.S. defense to Léa Larouche, who slotted home from six yards out into the lower right corner past charging U.S. goalkeeper Caroline Birkel.

The USA had its chances. Forward Mary Long came on in the 61st minute in place of Izzy Engle and smashed a left-footed shot off the crossbar in the 71st minute. That ignited a tremendous push for an equalizer in the last 20 minutes plus seven more of stoppage time, but the USA could not beat experienced Canadian goalkeeper Noelle Henning, who played a solid match while making five saves.

An 87th-minute shot from midfielder Linda Ullmark tested Henning and she had to parry the bouncing ball away for a corner kick. In the sixth minute of stoppage time, a hard shot from Ullmark challenged Henning again, but the diving ‘keeper was once again up to the task.

Forward Chloe Ricketts, who came on at halftime, created some problems for Canada down the left flank, but in the end the Americans could not produce a goal and were shut for just the second time in the history of this tournament. The only other time the USA failed to score at a Concacaf U-20 championship was also to Canada in the championship game of the 2008 tournament, also a 1-0 loss. The USA has played 66 total matches in this tournament in its history.

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. — Despite rainy weather, thousands of fans packed Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford on Saturday to watch the U.S. Men's National Soccer Team take on Turkey in a friendly match.

Turkey ultimately prevailed by a 2-1 decision, but that didn't stop attendees from enjoying the experience of catching the national team locally. 

Fans like Ed Szymanski lined up and tailgated for hours before the game, eager to catch a rare live appearance by the national team in Connecticut.

“No place I'd rather be. The rain is not great, but it's worth it to be here. You don't get to see the U.S. national team here too often, so when they are here, I make it a point to show my support,” Szymanski said.

Saturday's match marked the team's first game in Hartford since 2023. 

The U.S. is gearing up for a busy summer, including the CONCACAF Gold Cup, which will be hosted by the United States and Canada from June 14 to July 6.

Fans like Brendan McCabe were also looking ahead to 2026, when the U.S. will co-host the FIFA World Cup.

“We're waiting for the World Cup, okay? We're gonna make a move for the World Cup, we're going hard this year,” McCabe said.

Excitement was especially high for East Hartford native Patrick Agyemang, who made the national team.

“A lot of us played soccer growing up, we love to support the boys. Local kid, it's a great thing that he's here playing with the team,” McCabe said.

Fans Katie Tougas and Colleen Demko shared that sentiment.

“It's so exciting to see someone from Connecticut here. We're rooting him on and we're really excited to watch him play today,” Tougas said.

“In a sport where there's so much hype from overseas, [seeing] someone local to Connecticut being this far along and doing so great is really awesome,” Demko said.

With recent changes to the roster and a new head coach at the helm, many people are eager to see how the team performs heading into tournament season.

National teams don't visit East Hartford often, and fans were thrilled to have the chance to see Team USA close to home.

“Let's go USA,” Szymanski said.

A third straight loss didn't prevent Mauricio Pochettino from thinking big.

“We need to believe. We need to compete like today and for sure we're going to have the possibility to win the World Cup,” the U.S. coach said after the Americans lost their third straight game, wasting an early lead in a 2-1 defeat to Turkey in a friendly on Saturday.

Jack McGlynn scored 59 seconds in for the U.S., which was missing many regulars as Pochettino revamped his roster following a dismal performance at the CONCACAF Nations League final four in March.

Turkey took advantage of a sloppy defense as Arda Güler and Kerem Aktürkoğlu scored in a 2-minute, 20-second span midway through the first half.

While the U.S. had 60% possession and outshot Turkey 13-11, the Americans dropped to 5-4 under Pochettino, who took over after first-round elimination at last year's Copa America led the U.S. Soccer Federation to fire coach Gregg Berhalter.

They have lost three straight for the second time in a year.

“Today, who is going to tell me, oh, we showed lack of, we showed lack of — lack of what today?” said Pochettino, a 53-year-old from Argentina who coached Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. “The team showed what (it) needed to show. … Playing in this way, they are going to win most of the games.”

Coaching a nation that hasn't reached the World Cup semifinals since 1930 or the quarterfinals since 2022, Pochettino changed eight starters from the Nations League loss to Canada in March and kept only left back Max Arfsten, winger Diego Luna and forward Patrick Agyemang.

“Some guys that are coming in — and they're not thinking twice about taking someone on. It's not playing safe. It's like, let's take risks and try to go after this thing,” said midfielder Tyler Adams, who entered at the start of the second half. “I think having fresh faces, guys that aren't fearless, young guys, that's going to help us.”

With a year to go before co-hosting the World Cup, the U.S. plays Switzerland on Tuesday at Nashville, Tennessee, in another friendly, then opens the CONCACAF Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15.

“I am really sad because I think this group of players are working so hard and I think we deserve (a) better result today,” Pochettino said. “I think we performed well. I think we're brave enough. I think the attitude was: Go and press, match in every single aspect a team like Turkey that is one of the best teams in the last year in Europe.”

Defender Alex Freeman, a 20-year-old son of former NFL All-Pro receiver Antonio Freeman, started in his U.S. debut. Matt Freese, a starter at Major League Soccer's New York City, made his debut in goal. 

Matt Turner, the usual starter since 2022, didn't play for Crystal Palace after March 1.

Midfielder Quinn Sullivan and defender Nathan Harriel made debuts as 65th-minute substitutes.

McGlynn scored when he ran onto a pass from Malik Tilman, took several touches, cut inside and curled a left-footed shot from just outside the penalty area inside the far post for his second goal in five international appearances. 

It was the earliest U.S. goal since Shaq Moore scored 20 seconds in against Canada during the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Turkey tied it in the 24th minute when Freese tapped the ball to Johnny Cardoso, whose pass ricocheted off a leg and past Freese for Güler's fifth international goal.

Then in the 27th, Miles Robinson tried to clear Oğuz Aydın's shot and the ball went to Aktürkoğlu, who one-timed a bouncing shot past Freese for his 12th international goal and sixth in eight games.

“Of the goals that we concede, that created a big mess on the team,” Pochettino said.

EAST HARTFORD, Connecticut — Neither the rain, nor the fact that his team had just lost, dampened Patrick Agyemang's mood as he walked along the edge of the playing surface at Rentschler Field.

Still wearing his Team USA gear, the tall 24-year-old moved slowly. He signed posters, balls, Team USA kits, even a Christian Pulisic jersey and whatever else the kids handed down to him after the United States Men's National Team's 2-1 loss to Türkiye on Saturday. He chatted and patiently posed for pictures, even handling strangers' phones to better frame the selfie for them.

Just over 15 years ago, Agyemang was in those same bleacher seats. He watched in awe as the American national team faced the Czech Republic on May 25, 2010. It didn't matter that USA lost 4-2. Agyemang was enthralled.

“I was one of those kids. It's amazing,” said Agyemang, smiling at the memory. “I just wanna continue being a figure to look up to, and I hope I can continue doing that.”

Agyemang's soccer career began a couple of good kicks from the spot where he's standing. He grew up across town in East Hartford and saw the excitement, not to mention the traffic, that came to town every time the Untied States men's and women's national teams hosted games at the region's best grass field.

He had the same dream of being part of it that so many of his friends did. But reaching that level was more than a long shot. Major League Soccer teams identify the most promising kids, sometimes as young as 12. They invite them to enroll in their academies, which help cultivate talent and prepare players for professional careers.

But they were't interested in Agyemang. 

Today he's among the top 25 goal scorers in the MLS. At East Hartford High School, he was ignored by all seven Division I schools in Connecticut and Agyemang ended up at Division III Eastern Connecticut State for two seasons before transferring to Rhode Island.

He shined for the Rams and the semi-pro Western Massachusetts Pioneers before being selected by Charlotte F.C. in the MLS Superdraft.

After scoring 10 goals for Charlotte last year, Agyemang was named to the national team roster in January and had goals in his first two career matches against Costa Rica and Venezuela.

On Saturday, he got the chance to play at home. He secured 25 tickets for friends and family, including his parents, who'd never seen him don red, white and blue before.

“It was nice just being here. This is my hometown, so to be back here it was amazing,” he said. 

The American roster that faced the Turks didn't feature many players who have locked up a spot on the Team USA roster for next year's World Cup, which is almost exactly a year away. Like Agyemang, most of the players were trying to improve their chances to crack the roster.

It was an opportunity for the young striker to prove something against tougher competition.

“It was maybe his first time playing against two center backs with their experience and their quality, they are playing in the top in Europe,” Mauricio Pochettino said. “Today I saw Patrick fight with two players who are some of the toughest center backs in the world.”

While fighting against them is a good first step, Agyemang was focused on thriving. 

“I want be able to to perform here consistently. That's the next step for myself and obviously I know I could do it and that's what I'm gonna work for,” he said. “I want to adjust and be able to perform here on a high level consistently.”

While he's not ignoring the tantalizing prospect of making Team USA's World Cup roster, he's more focused on improving than auditioning at this point.

“I just want to continue getting better, I'm still relatively new to this environment and obviously the level of it is different. I want to be able to continue learning and adjusting.”

He hopes the kids he met will draw inspiration from his attempt.

“It was a journey. It was ups and downs. It was not straightforward at all. I struggled in each step,” he said. “I just want everyone to know if you're really committed, you can't worry about the noise because I heard it all. I still hear it all. But at the end of the day, as long as you keep going anything can happen.”

International Football

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. – U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino had just finished delivering a long answer about Jack McGlynn's performance in the U.S.'s 2-1 loss to Turkey on Saturday when he paused and looked around at the room in front of him.

“It's a good thing we are talking about soccer, eh?” he asked. “That is a good thing. Fútbol.”

Advertisement

The implication, of course, was that much of Pochettino's ire after March's Concacaf Nations League failure — and really, the frustration of the fanbase — centered less around the actual soccer in losses to Panama and Canada. Yes, that team also failed to impress with what it did on the field, but more concerning was the lack of effort. The absence of fight. The appearance of indifference.

The inclusion of several MLS players for this camp was meant to add a bit more hunger to a team that seemed to lack some of that internal motivation. The challenge changed a bit when 10 U.S. regulars weren't available via Club World Cup commitments, injuries, personal reasons or a desire for rest, in the case of Christian Pulisic. Almost the entire group has been filled with hopefuls now.

However, in a way, it allowed Pochettino to lean further toward the goal of the Gold Cup tournament, which starts for the U.S. against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15. He clearly wants to try to inject competition and desire into the group.

So while it was odd, and certainly spoke to the negative state in which this program currently finds itself, that Pochettino and the players were mostly upbeat after a third consecutive loss, it was just as telling that they found satisfaction in hitting what had long been considered a bare minimum for the USMNT.

“I think we need to be positive, because today I think only we can talk about fútbol action, soccer action,” Pochettino said. “The team showed great energy, great mentality, great attitude. And then it's this type of game that maybe, if you make a mistake, you can lose. But you made a mistake because it's soccer, it's fútbol. That is why I think I am so, so happy about the way that I think we delivered the show and in the way that we tried to play.”

It wasn't completely unfair of Pochettino to feel as if there were positives to hold onto in the loss to a talented Turkey side. The U.S. was the better team for the first 20 minutes. Pochettino correctly pointed out that, until Johnny Cardoso made an egregious mistake in his own box and gifted Turkey a goal, the U.S. seemed in control.

The inexperienced American side struggled to regain composure after Cardoso's extra touch and attempted pass caromed off Turkey's Arda Güler, the 20-year-old Real Madrid winger, and into the net. Only about two minutes later, a poor clearance was easily put home by Kerem Aktürkoğlu, who plays his club soccer at Benfica, to give Turkey the lead.

The U.S. held on through the rest of the first half, but came out after halftime with renewed energy and much more purpose. It created chances — a weakness for this team over the past two cycles — and they probably should have had an equalizer. Malik Tillman's point-blank header was the best opportunity, but there were a few other decent looks, as well, including two at the back post from Max Arfsten.

“So many positives to take away from that game,” U.S. midfielder Tyler Adams said. “I was saying before, as we were walking off the field, I think it's one of the first times that we've gone down, and we've created so many clear chances afterwards. So I think that's a huge positive for us. Now, it's just about putting the ball in the back of the net.”

After five days together, Pochettino felt the soccer could be fine-tuned and fixed. There were many more details that the group would continue to add and build into how they played on Saturday. And Pochettino felt the game provided important experience for many of the players. For one, he pointed to Patrick Agyemang, 24, battling with two center backs, Çağlar Söyüncü and Merih Demiral, who have played at “the highest levels.”

But Pochettino's focus was on the type of effort the team showed on the field.

It has been clear in the head coach's comments the past few weeks that he was frustrated with the pool — or at least with how things played out in March — and that he was also tuned in to what people were saying about the team.

This summer and the forthcoming Gold Cup seem to be about sending a message. On Saturday, Pochettino put up the first smoke signals of his intent.

But there is now an odd sort of dynamic where this group, filled with debutantes and unproven national team players, can set a standard that is meant to carry through to next summer's World Cup — and to the “golden generation” of players that carry so much expectation into that tournament.

That's not an assumption. Pochettino said as much.

“If I decide in September (to call a) different roster, what I want is the same level of commitment, attitude,” the veteran coach said. “Today, who is going to tell me: ‘Oh, we have showed a lack of…'? ‘We showed lack of…' Lack of what?

“Today, I think we can all agree the team showed what it needed to show. And then if the opponent is better or had more luck or you made a mistake, it's not a problem. But for sure, playing in this way, we are going to win most of the games.”

Saturday's “first step” in the rebuilding process was a loss. If the message is going to truly take hold, the U.S., and Pochettino, will need the results to follow, too.

The U.S. men's national team failed to end its current winless run on Saturday in Connecticut, but remains positive heading into its final pre-CONCACAF Gold Cup match. 

Mauricio Pochettino's squad suffered a 2-1 friendly loss to No. 27 ranked Turkey at Rentschler Field in the first match of a busy June schedule. Jack McGlynn's second international goal was cancelled out by a pair of quick goals from Arda Guler and Kerem Akturkoglu, handing the Americans their third three-match losing streak in consecutive years. 

Tyler Adams, Haji Wright, and Quinn Sullivan were among the second-half substitutions which came close to sparking a comeback in the match while Luca De La Torre and Malik Tillman delivered positive performances. Pochettino voiced his team's positives in the match and believed they deserved a better outcome overall.  

“The performance was good,” Pochettino told media postgame on Saturday. “We faced a team like Turkey, which is a very good team with the experienced players at the top. This group of players after playing together for the first time, I think we started the game so well. We played 20 minutes at a high level. We did very good things, very good things. It had an emotional impact when we conceded after we scored in the second minute, after we conceded the first, we conceded the second goal and that was difficult.

“I am really sad because I think this group of players are working so hard and I think we deserved a better result today,” he added. “But if we go to only focus on the performance, I think we perform really well and now we can be focused on how we can improve on the situation and be focused only on game situations.”

Pochettino doesn't have several of his star players this summer including Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, and Yunus Musah, opening the door to many fresh faces. Sullivan, Alex Freeman, and Matt Freese all earned their senior debuts in Saturday's match while McGlynn and Max Arfsten were among the young MLS contingent to earn important minutes in their development. 

Despite the USMNT now being winless in their last three matches, and next set to face off with No. 20 ranked Switzerland on Tuesday, Pochettino expected some growing pains heading into the Gold Cup.

“We knew that the level of the players are at different levels, that is why these two weeks are important to prepare for the Gold Cup,” Pochettino said. “I think we want to win and compete really well in the Gold Cup. And it's going to be tough, of course it's going to be tough. But I think what we expect is what we saw.

“I think what I cannot complain about is that every single player was very connected with the team,” he added. “Even the players that didn't play, they were helping the team, the players that were playing, knowing that maybe they have the opportunity or the chance to play in the next one and they need also the help from the teammates that they are going to play. And that is why I think the impact of the whole team, I am so happy with that.”

Should the USMNT suffer defeat in Nashville on Tuesday, it will mark their first four-match losing streak since 2007.

we are backwards.  we are tentative the end you should be aggressive; swashbuckling the end you should be low risk.

Blablabla. Another game, another loss. At this rate Poch might be canned if we blunder the Gold Cup. A really crappy time for the USMNT and its supporters.

Mcglynn has the tools to be a traditional 10. Passing and creative with an excellent left foot. But with that being said I think he could be a very useful sub in multiple positions. Not necessarily a starter.

I liked what Quinn brought off of the bench. Agyemang has many tools which will be useful. I want to see Luna and Tillman combine a bit more. And I think Mckenzie and Richards is the pairing going forward. I like LDLT ability to break through the lines with his dribbling just needs to get a bit quicker in his decision making. Would like to see how Brendo looks on the right.

i do think we “subbed backwards,” ie, started backups then subbed towards the intended lineup.  however for the Hope Merchants, it was the subs who scored through a quick attack punctuated by mcglynn's direct go to goal effort.  but they were dominated after 15′ and lost the contest.  the starters were more even with turkey (0-0 second half) but a lot of the attacks turned into the same old crossing, LDLT hitting ok hopeful crosses to the far post.  not dropped on a head but more played into space.

i thought 1-2 was a crap result.  turkey is just ok.  turkey lost to montenegro and was in a NL group with wales.  turkey and wales tied 0-0 twice.  we tied wales twice last cycle.  on paper this should have been a tie with zero improvement, a win if the coach is adding anything.  we instead lost.  that's regression.

people keep making Tomorrow excuses.  at some point this is supposed to actualize.

We lost but everything looked good with the exception of some MAJOR mistakes in the back (because of the pressure of playing out the back that are better made in friendlies than during a major tournament)……..and the teams inability to finish…..excluding Jack McGlynn!!!
Nobody looked sharp, dangerous or lethal in front of goal
The shot attempts on goal look desperate rather than calculated or deliberate
Haji Wright and Patrick Agyemang couldn't seem to get by anyone for a good strike on goal (Agyemang couldn't seem to use his size to hold off defenders at all)

——–USMNT——VS——-TURKIYE—–
———–60%——-POS——–40%———-

———–88%—–PASS AC—-84%———-
More possession, more touches on the ball,
better accuracy on passing……..yet
———–3————SOT———-5————
———-13———-SHOTS——11————

Johnny Cardoso made a dreadful mistake but the USMNT still dominated the midfield in the first half with him on the field
Overall we looked more well organized, structured and composed (for the most part) than out last 2-3 games
The real test will be THE SWITZERLAND GAME……as they were clinical and seemed to capitalized on every Mexico mistake ……..a Mexico with Santiago Giménez, Raúl Jiménez, Roberto Alvarado, Carlos Rodríguez, and Érik Lira. USMNT will need to tighten up defensively against Switzerland, as every error made by Mexico was almost converted into an opportunity and the Swiss came alive in the second half (were the US usually seem to die off) and Mexico just kind of lost focus and concentration.

Overall, I think this team exceeded expectations……they looked good, with a few issues that need to be addressed / corrected

Number of Passes for Turkiye is 441 not 44….lol

as they explained on the telecast, turkey, with their italian coach, is content to let you possess the ball, let you make the mistakes and punish them.  we've been selling “we're a possession team now” for years, and what of it.

i mean, we could barely find the strikers.  who cares if we lead the world in passing around the back.  the endgame to soccer is get the ball to players in the danger zone and attack the net.

and we proved for the umpteenth time that playing from the back costs us more pitifully easy punishment than it gets us clever long build goals.

The view from the stands:

– The stadium had higher attendance than I expected given the steady rain
– The US team started pretty well playing the possession-based game MP is trying to implement, but lost their composure and focus after falling behind.
– The US team had no real threats on the wings, and once Turkiye realized that, they made the necessary adjustments
– Agyemang as the target striker has the tools and athleticism, but needs a lot more improvement to jump ahead of Balogun or Pepi
– Cardoso, despite the gaffe, did well for much of the time. Though his replacement, Adams, was a noticeable upgrade.

Agyemang had the touch of a young Jozy Altidore. . . . that is not intended to be a compliment.

johnny was basically on the hook both goals, are you kidding me.  on the first goal, if you start to feel that noose tighten, that ball is either row Z or hit to midfield.  we are being taught to not panic, to try and be clever, precisely when one should not.  and there is zero upside to playing from the back.  i struggle to remember 110 yard build goals.

people chuckled at my expense but the lack of wing quality was foretold in the callup sheet.  you have to call up specialist wings to get good wing play.  we had wright wide, we had LDLT wide, what did we expect?  to be fair, mcglynn accomplished some — was basically the whole first half offense — but he was inverting.

i thought we were more dangerous when we fed agyemang and wright but i thought wright was showing to the ball more.  agyemang wants to sit back, pin the defender, then spin.  and we couldn't find the 9 the whole first half.

Thought Tillman had his best game yet for us, I so wish he would have converted that header from the six, would have made it a statement game for him.  LDLT was really good.  If you could take away the Johnny mistake and the next five minutes it would have been our best performance under Poch.

the cardoso/LDLT MF of the first half got spanked.  are you kidding me.

Certainly better than the last few games, and we looked good at times, but weaknesses are still apparent. Is the US attacking in the style that Pochettino wants? I much prefer how Turkiye attacks. When they went into attack they moved quickly. passed quickly and were in the US third within not many seconds. We need to move the ball a lot quicker. Too often, too, we did not move enough off the ball, especially when facing their press. Too often our passes weren't hit with enough speed, almost as if they didn't trust their teammates to be able to handle passes with pace. Every second lost gives the defense more time to adjust and get into place. The Turks didn't have that problem and their quickness put our defense under a lot of pressure.  I can't stop from remarking about Cardoso's error. How do you kick the ball right into an opponent no more than 5 feet in front of you? I remember that Cardoso had a teammate wide open to his left with no one around. Why Cardoso even tried to pass up the middle is inexpolicable. While Austen missed one very good chance and another decent chance, I think Tillman's failure to convert was worse, considering how often he was scoring in Holland.

it's not “inexplicable,” he forced the pass.  we force the pass all the time.  you see it's a dumb idea but we're being taught to pass from the back and egg the opponent to come forward then try and cleverly work out of it.  we're not that slick.  do the boring things.

nor are we slick enough other end of the field to break down teams half court soccer.

the goal was first 15 we're playing long outlets and even a little kickball, flick it wide, go to goal.  that's quick.  you don't have to break down 11 men, you start putting defenders behind you and you can play into space.

but i generally agree.  i prefer their style.  swarm the mids, win the ball.  get it wide early.  speed or wall ball down the wing.  go to goal.  quit slow play.  quit nibbling at the edges.  get it in smaller number situations, more green space, and attack the net.

last point, but we are way overcommitting near side.  the weak side is open all day.  that's part of what you were seeing.  when they switched, the guy would have 20 yards.  or even on some crosses i'd be like is anyone marking that far post runner.  holland abused that.

The U.S. men's national team's lack of final-third quality cost them in Saturday's home friendly loss to Turkey.

Jack McGlynn scored the USMNT's opening goal in East Hartford, but Turkey battled back to earn a 2-1 road victory. It marked the first three-match losing streak for the Americans since Summer 2024.

McGlynn struck early for the USMNT, calling his own number on the opening attack of the match. Malik Tillman sprayed a pass out to McGlynn on the right wing, before the Houston Dynamo midfielder curled a left-footed shot into the bottom-left corner for a 1-0 lead.

It marked McGlynn's second goal of his USMNT career.

Turkey would respond though in the first half, receiving a bit of luck on its equalizing goal. Arda Guler pressured Johnny Cardoso's clearance which led to a deflection past Matt Freese for a 1-1 equalizer.

Kerem Akturkoglu propelled Turkey in front three minutes later, rifling home in the box after Miles Robinson's attempted clearance fell to the midfielder.

The USMNT improved after halftime but Turkey's Berke Ozer helped his side hang on for the victory. Patrick Agyemeng was denied by the 25-year-old before Tillman's header was also repelled.

Mauricio Pochettino made six changes off of his bench, but the Americans failed to find a tying goal before the final whistle.

The USMNT will next face Switzerland on June 10 in their final friendly before the CONCACAF Gold Cup. 

we subbed backwards which almost made it into a january game in meaning.  january games you grab the performers.

of the starters — richards and mcglynn.  the former is not adding to the pile.  the latter is showing supersub signs, that is useful.
of the subs — adams and wright.  nothing added.

this is why i complain about the callsheets.  we lost the game and maybe found 1 new player.  the performance of many no-names was predictable as many had an indifferent previous cap or two.

x-factor guys who merit another shot–
luna — i would like to see him tried at 6
freeman — decent defense but very sloppy
agyemang — needs to show to the ball more

luna i thought he disappeared and got outplayed by mcglynn as an attacking force against a world cup level team.  but he comes across as having a 6-type motor, a willingness to chase and get stuck in, and then would have great attacking upside in support of a true 10.   i'd rather have him scrapping then playing nice passes than see johnny out there.

i don't understand why i was watching —
sullivan
LDLT (MF was getting whooped, and his crosses aimless)
harriel
white
and that was predictable from past experience

this has become too “pecking order” and not enough “here's your cap or two, impress me.”  we keep circling back to mediocrity or worse, because it seems to have been annointed next guy up in the abstract, independent of how caps go.

games over practice.

IV,

“i don't understand why i was watching —
sullivan
LDLT (MF was getting whooped, and his crosses aimless)
harriel
white
and that was predictable from past experience”

You got what you wanted; a look at “fresh faces”.
You should own the consequences.

spin

he's been coach a year and that was #27 in the world, not brazil.  as i said other comment, they tied wales twice this year.  we tied wales twice.  connect the dots.

the scheme doesn't work.  if the concept only works when jedi shows, that's talent and not tactics.

are people serious the offense — LDLT crossing it far post vaguely in arfsten or tillman's area — was good?  mcglynn is more dangerous than that dribbling to goal by himself.  idea is have complex tactics more effective than just freelancing.  otherwise why bother.

we couldn't find the 9 the whole first half.

the non-adams MF defense is so bad it's hard to tell if the CBs suck or are just not being shielded right.

the weak side is wide open on our defense.

freese longballed about 3 times, 2 became attacks.  johnny tried to pass from the back, U10-style richocet goal.  hmmm

Cardoso, for all his club form so far, seems to be that player that you know a mistake is going to happen that's gonna be costly. That reputation is really starting to stick with him already so early in his national team career. Unless he has a great gold cup, or a club form that is just on another level in the future, he's going to be a bench player on the national team if he continues to be selected. I'm hoping Luna has a great gold cup, as he just seems to be that player who plays with a chip on his shoulder every game. He's not afraid to get nasty and be aggressive.

Cardoso sucks he gave ball away to Canada in our own half too, smh

Surprising how poor Cardoso was during that stretch of the first half.  Then he was otherwise anonymous until being subbed at half-time.  

He had such a good season in La Liga .  I understand that La Liga is not a low level league (sarcasm).   I cant believe that he sucks, but yes certainly smh.  

I wonder what he does for his club team that he has not been able to bring to the USMNT.   Is it just the surrounding players?    Is it his moustache?  A real mystery.

i thought he looked like the same guy played himself off the roster before.  y'all keep thinking someone gets transfer interest they must be playing amazingly.  all it means is you convinced one pair of eyes.

as we saw, things are more complicated than that.  you'd think we'd have learned “club form may not translate” from sargent, etc. already.  there need to be NT consequences for these games.

flush screwups, call new faces.  quit pretending like agent transfer buzz means they fixed it.

part of the dutch idea on build from the back is egg the opponent forward then escape.  so you think you're slick and clever and force the ball you shouldn't.  i think that's teaching horrible decisionmaking.  you feel the noose tightening in front of the net and don't have a wide open teammate, that ball has to be launched.  it's ugly but it's better than 0-1.

it's kind of like the naive pressing and leaving the weak side wide open.  maybe if we won the ball constantly.  we don't.
we need to do vanilla and smart.  go to goal, create chances, reduce mistakes, mark your man.  we aren't good at cute.  we're losing at cute.

Even though we lost, I loved that the team of youngsters still had fight in them, and would could physical if they had to. Had their chances, but they didn't go in. Of course, the obvious dumb mistakes cannot happen. Before Cardoso's mistake, it was an even game. USA was working the ball really well, and then you could tell that lowered their mentality after that.

Nice to Yildiz and Guler playing for their country

Again giving up goals that could have been avoided. You can't lose the ball in your own 18yd box trying to be cute with it, and the inability to clear balls out of the box has become a joke with this team. Offensively some really good patterns of play early on and at points in the second half, but it's not consistent enough, which is obviously due to constant changing of players in lineups. There were too many touches on the ball in good and bad spots leading to turnovers and what really frustrated me was not shooting on goal quick enough also because of extra touches. This result could and should have been avoided but ironically enough I'm not mad about it bc of the ever changing lineups, and some of the good I saw

Arfsten missed two very clear chances to tie the game at the far post, but otherwise, he did very well in spite of not being a very good left back.

The USMNT had some very nice crosses today. 

2-2 would have been a fair result.

i could do long-winded but won't here.  the tactics suck.  the goal is not how we normally play.  the struggle is.  that says it all.

IV

“the goal is not how we normally play. the struggle is. that says it all.”

Soccer is about goals.
Score that second goal and “how we normally play” means nothing.

National team soccer is not about what it looks like might happen.
It's about what does happen.

Jad some good opportunities to score more. Unfortunate to see the Cardoso mistake. It was a decent performance. Really wish Mcglynn had some more athleticism.

there is a such thing as a sub.  every player doesn't need to project as a 90 minute starter athlete.  you put mcglynn in 0-0 or 0-1 late in a game and tell him to go to goal and crack one.  maybe pair that with wings who can actually cross and someone like vazquez who can head.

i have seen U16 teams with a better idea how to use a roster to an endgame.  some guys can be part of a stalemate package, or a comeback package, be there for specific reasons.  mcglynn can shoot.  kind of preki.  preki didn't have to start.

The $1 billion Club World Cup kicks off Saturday at Hard Rock Stadium with Lionel Messi and his Inter Miami teammates facing Egyptian power Al Ahly. After much debate about qualification rules and player overload due to an ever-expanding FIFA calendar, 32 of the best club teams in the world will vie for supremacy over the next month, with the final on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

The tournament will also serve as a dress rehearsal for the 2026 World Cup, which is being hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada next summer.

Players to Watch

Lionel Messi (Inter Miami): The Argentine legend will celebrate his 38th birthday during the Club World Cup and has shown that he hasn't lost his touch. It remains to be seen whether his team can compete with the world's elite clubs, but Messi surely is up to the task. 

Kylian Mbappé (Real Madrid): French star finished with 42 goals in all competitions in his first season with Madrid, broke Iván Zamorano's record for the most goals in a debut season and won European Golden Boot.

Harry Kane (Bayern Munich): The 31-year-old England captain scored 37 goals across all competitions (26 in 31 Bundesliga appearances and 11 in 13 UEFA Champions League games). He also had 11 assists.

Omar Marmoush (Manchester City): Egyptian forward left Eintracht Frankfurt in January and made an immediate impact at Man City with eight goals in 22 games. 

Désiré Doué (PSG): French 20-year-old was Man of the Match (a pair of goals and an assist) in the Champions League final and was instrumental in PSG winning the quadruple (Ligue 1 title, Coupe de France, Trophée des Champions, Champions League).

Franco Mastantuono (River Plate): This 17-year-old midfielder is already being anointed as the next great player out of Argentina after becoming the youngest player ever to appear in an official game for the senior national team. He is reportedly headed to Real Madrid for a $45 million transfer fee after being wooed by PSG and Manchester United. 

Cole Palmer (Chelsea): Left his childhood club Manchester City for Chelsea in 2023 and went on to score 40 goals across all competitions over the past two seasons.

Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan): The Argentine has scored 20-plus goals in five of the past six seasons, won Serie A Most Valuable Player and won the Golden Boot while leading Argentina to the 2024 Copa America title.

Estevao (Palmeiras): This 18-year-old Brazilian is Palmeiras' leading scorer this season, with eight goals in all competitions so far in 2025. He has made four appearances for the Brazilian national team and is headed to Chelsea for a reported $68 million transfer fee.

Erling Haaland (Manchester City): Norwegian 24-year-old has won the Golden Boot at the U-20 World Cup, UEFA Nations League (twice), Premier League (twice) and Champions League (twice). 

Others to keep an eye on: Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Rodri (Manchester City), Ousmane Dembele (PSG), Julian Alvarez (Atletico Madrid), Karim Konate (Salzburg), Kenan Yildiz (Juventus), Fidel Ambriz (Monterrey), Jamie Gittens (Dortmund), Kaua Elias (Flumeninse), Amanallah Memmiche (Tunis)

How did teams qualify?

Each confederation was awarded a set number of places based upon its strength. UEFA has 12 slots, CONMEBOL six. Four each for Concacaf, Asia and Africa, plus one for Oceania. There was also a spot reserved for the host country, which FIFA granted to Inter Miami as winner of the 2023 Leagues Cup and 2024 Supporters' Shield for best regular season record. It also didn't hurt that Messi is a world legend and big draw wherever he plays.

Inter Miami's selection for the tournament was controversial because the team has not won an MLS Cup, but league commissioner Don Garber defended FIFA's decision.

“I think it's exciting and I'm glad that we have a showcase for Miami,” Garber said. “This is FIFA's tournament, and they picked a host. They have the right to do that..there was no rule that said the MLS Cup winner needs to be in the Club World Cup.

“I think it was smart. I'm excited about putting Miami up in a showcase around the world to kick off the Club World Cup in our country, in our stadiums as a launch to the World Cup and I couldn't be more excited about it.”

How to watch the Club World Cup 

All 63 matches will be livestreamed for free on DAZN.com. Twenty-four games will also be shown on TNT, TBS, TruTV in English. Univision and TUDN will show games in Spanish.

Today's News

FIFA Club World Cup

Their failure to win any major trophies last season has led to a revolution at Real Madrid, starting with a change of head coach: Xabi Alonso in for Carlo Ancelotti.

The Italian, who already has a new job managing Brazil's national team, was given an honourable farewell by the Santiago Bernabeu as the coach with the most titles (15) in the club's history, though the arrival of Alonso has brought a boost of enthusiasm.

The board has also acted quickly to improve the squad. Luka Modric, the player with the most trophies (28) in the club's history, and Lucas Vazquez will not have their expiring contracts renewed — both will leave, but not until after a last hurrah at this tournament. Jesus Vallejo, another whose contract ends on June 30, has been informed he won't be part of the squad travelling to the United States for the Club World Cup.

In terms of playing arrivals, there are two big names in already. Centre-back Dean Huijsen signed from Bournemouth after Madrid triggered his £50million ($67.7m) clause. Trent Alexander-Arnold could have arrived for free on July 1 once his contract at Liverpool ran out but Madrid have paid €10million (£8.4m; $11.4m) for to get him a couple of weeks early specifically so he can play in this tournament. And The Athletic reported last month that Madrid were in talks with Benfica about left-back Alvaro Carreras.

These early moves are no coincidence: Madrid is very interested in this new-look Club World Cup, for footballing, prestige and economic reasons.

Follow the Club World Cup on The Athletic this summer…

Their past year has been very disappointing. After winning the Champions League and La Liga in 2023-24, and despite bringing in Kylian Mbappe as a free agent from Paris Saint-Germain, Madrid failed to land any of the three main trophies this campaign.

They did lift the European Super Cup in August by beating Europa League winners Atalanta and added the Intercontinental Cup — the annual competition that used to be called the Club World Cup before FIFA got fancy — in December against Mexico's Pachuca (now one of their three opponents in the group stage of this tournament), but failed to make the grade in the other competitions.

They finished second in La Liga behind Barcelona, who also beat them in the final of the Copa del Rey (and also the Spanish Super Cup), and were eliminated by Arsenal in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, losing 5-1 over the two legs.

However, Madrid have 15 European Cup/Champions League titles compared to Milan's next-best seven, 36 Spanish championships compared to Barcelona's second-biggest total of 28 and five Club World Cups, two more than anyone else (also Barca) — in other words, they are historically the dominant team in Spain, in Europe and worldwide, so are always going to be among the favourites.

Madrid are one of 12 European sides in the 32-team tournament, which they qualified for via the continental champions' route, winning the Champions League in 2022 (which by itself ensured their presence at the Club World Cup) and doing so again in 2024.

We don't really know yet, as Alonso will make his debut as Madrid coach at this Club World Cup. However, from his time at Bayer Leverkusen in Germany, we can expect a very vertical and entertaining style of football.

Alonso said when he was presented to the media as Ancelotti's replacement that he wanted to “ignite the fans”. He said his goal is to “transmit emotions, joy, that people enjoy, that they go to the stadium to enjoy, that on TV all over the world watching us they say, ‘That's the team I like; that's my team, that's my Real Madrid'”. He added: “If we manage to ignite that, we will have an unstoppable force.”

In terms of his likely line-up, Eduardo Camavinga and Endrick are injured and will not play at this tournament, and Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba are not expected to be involved in Madrid's first group game for the same reason. Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao, out since October and November with serious knee injuries, might be unfit too.

Alonso has returned to Madrid as a coach almost 11 years after his last game for them as a player, having won a Champions League and La Liga among other titles in his five seasons.

After retiring as a Bayern Munich player in 2017, he began his coaching career at Madrid's academy, before moving on to lead the B team at Real Sociedad — another Spanish club he also played for — and then getting the top job at Leverkusen in October 2022.

He quickly won the first Bundesliga in that club's history in 2024, going through the 34-game league season undefeated, and also steered them into the Europa League final, losing that game to Italy's Atalanta.

Now, with the experience from his playing days in Spain, England (with Liverpool) and Germany under big names including Jose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Ancelotti, he is considered one of the best coaches in the world, despite being just 43 years old.

He was long ago picked out by Madrid's decision-makers as the one to succeed Ancelotti when the Italian's time at the helm came to an end.

Kylian Mbappe.

The French striker's first few months at Madrid were very disappointing, with only nine goals in his first 19 games until early December. “In Bilbao (on December 4, he missed a penalty away against Athletic Club as Madrid lost, 2-1), I hit rock bottom,” he admitted.

After that, he played much better and the 26-year-old finished with the best goal stats ever for a Madrid debut season, his 43 in all competitions surpassing the 37 of Chilean forward Ivan Zamorano in the 1992-93 season. His total of 31 league goals earned Mbappe the ‘Pichichi' award as La Liga's top scorer and also the European Golden Boot for the most goals across Europe's top domestic divisions.

Arda Guler, a 20-year-old known as ‘The Turkish Pearl', is one of Madrid's latest big bets on young talent.

Signed in 2023 from Fenerbahce in his homeland, Guler's debut season was marred by injuries. But he ended the most recent campaign as a starter for Ancelotti. Now, with Alonso, who wanted him for Leverkusen before Madrid bought him, he is looking to cement himself in the line-up.

He can operate in attack both from the right flank and as a playmaker and has also been used, for Turkey's national team and in recent months by Madrid, as an offensive midfielder.

He has quality, precision and a magical left foot.

Madrid fans are crazy about him.

“Hasta el final, vamos Real!” (“Until the end, come on Real!”) is probably the most iconic.

It speaks of the unwavering ambition, confidence and faith of a team who can never be given up on, because they rise to improbable comebacks, especially when playing at the Santiago Bernabeu. Their 2021-22 Champions League campaign, where they lifted the trophy after rallying from being behind at home in second legs to win ties against Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City in the knockout rounds, is a good example.

Barcelona. At the beginning of the 20th century, the rivalry was greater with neighbours Atletico Madrid, who will also play in this Club World Cup, but over the years their matches with Barcelona, a fixture now called El Clasico, have become heated and drawn the most interest, although the cities are almost 400 miles apart.

Many voices at Madrid, in the offices more than the dressing room, have long pointed to this Club World Cup as the most important competition of the lot for them.

They want to be the first club to win the expanded tournament to help them become a reference among the North American public — and they want the €100million+ in prize money that goes to the eventual champions, too.

Their many successes and proud history are well known, so there are plenty of arguments to support Madrid in this competition… and also to want anyone but them to win it.

Perhaps a point in their favour is the beautiful and modern football Alonso is expected to pursue.

The Real Madrid goalkeeper is expected to play in Ukraine's second game of the Canadian Soccer Shield tournament on June 10. 

In the aftermath of Ukraine's 4-2 defeat against Canada on Saturday, head coach Serhiy Rebrov answered Managing Madrid's question on the status of Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin at the post-match press conference in BMO Field, Toronto. 

Mehedi Hassan (Managing Madrid): Hi Serhiy, welcome to Canada first of all, tough game—hope you guys will bounce back against New Zealand. I just wanted to ask you about Andriy Lunin—how do you see his physical level ahead of the Club World Cup that's coming up with Real Madrid?Serhiy Rebrov (Head Coach, Ukraine): He is absolutely fine, we have three goalkeepers. Andriy is going to play in the second game. He's good and he is preparing for the next game. He's ready for the World Cup. 

Here is the video of the interactions between Serhiy and Managing Madrid:

Lunin stayed on the bench for the entirety of the 90 minutes of Ukraine's difficult start in the four-team invitational competition among hosts Canada, Ukraine, Côte d'Ivoire and New Zealand. 

As per the head coach, Lunin is expected to play in their second game against New Zealand on June 10. These will be important minutes for him to get back into some sort of rhythm before reporting to Xabi Alonso for the preparations of the FIFA Club World Cup in the USA, starting just under a couple of weeks from now. 

Lunin is expected to remain as Thibaut Courtois's deputy in the global tournament but the team will obviously expect him to be in the best shape to appear at any moment if required.

Chelsea could be set for a busy few days in the transfer market as they prepare to head across the Atlantic for the Club World Cup. The west Londoners will face Club Leon, Flamengo and ES Tunis in the group phase of the new-look competition. They will be hoping to give a good account of themselves, having been buoyed by their recent triumph in the Conference League and securing a top-five finish in the Premier League.

It has already been a productive window for the Blues, who signed Liam Delap from Ipswich Town earlier this week. The former Manchester City man penned a six-year deal at Stamford Bridge and will travel to the Club World Cup with his new team. He was initially expected to feature for England under-21s in the upcoming Euros, but was not named in Lee Carsley's final squad.



It seems Chelsea could add to the Delap signing with three additional deals before the Club World Cup gets underway. They are said to be making rapid progress in their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens, who has emerged as a top target.

According to RMC Sport, personal terms have already been settled with Gittens eager to join the Blues. He is said to have given the green light to a seven-year contract, but negotiations at club level are still ongoing.

Fabrizio Romano, meanwhile, reports that Chelsea have submitted an opening bid in the region of £29.5million. Gittens remains under contract until the summer of 2028, meaning Dortmund are under no pressure to sell if their demands are not met.

Chelsea also remain in talks over a move for AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, with Enzo Maresca eager to recruit an established stopper. He has also reached an agreement on personal terms with the Blues, according to TEAMtalk.

It is said that Maignan is eager to leave the San Siro and play in the Champions League next season. The report adds that he could be involved for Chelsea at the Club World Cup if a deal can be done over the next few days.

Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike is another reported target for Chelsea, having piqued their interest with his prolific form in Germany. He scored 22 goals in the season just gone and has been touted for a big move to the Premier League this summer.

Chelsea are firmly in the hunt to complete a deal before the Club World Cup but have reservations about Ekitike's asking price, according to Bild. Frankfurt are said to be demanding £84.3m, but the Blues are unwilling to go beyond £67.4m.

Time is running out for Chelsea to sign all three players, with the first part of the summer transfer window set to end on Tuesday. But if they can get those deals over the line, they will be able to travel to the Club World Cup with a revamped squad.

 Chelsea will reportedly sign Mike Maignan before the transfer window closes on Tuesday for the Club World Cup. 

football.london understands the Blues approached Milan about the France international earlier this week, and talks with the Italian club, who Maignan captains, have been ongoing ever since. The player has been on their radar for multiple years and is approaching the final 12 months of his current contract. 

 Chelsea see the current situation as an opportunity to acquire a world-class goalkeeper this summer. He was named in the European Championship team of the tournament last summer and has twice made the Serie A team of the year. 

football.london understands Milan were demanding £25million, a price the club had reservations over due to the player's age - Maignan turns 30 next month - and contractual situation. La Gazzetta dello Sport now reports that the expectation is they will reach a compromise of €18million (£15million). 

 The Blues are also said to have tried including Djordje Petrovic or Kepa Arrizabalaga in any deal. Milan are said to have Mile Svilar of Roma, who was named best goalkeeper in Serie A last season, as their top target to replace Maignan, with Elia Caprile and Zion Suzuki as alternatives. 

Gazzetta claims it is a ""matter of days, maybe hours"" before the deal is done, with Chelsea wanting the goalkeeper registered for the Club World Cup. Milan have reputedly given in after tough negotiations due to the player wanting to leave.

Recent contract talks are said to have left Maignan disappointed. They allegedly agreed on a €5million, four-year extension, only for the club to backtrack because of the player's performance and physical condition over the final months of the season.

 The newly-reappointed Milan head coach, Massimiliano Allegri, is said to have tried to convince the goalkeeper to stay. He reputedly would have been happy for Maignan to stay, but the feeling is seemingly not mutual.

The FIFA competition featuring 32 clubs gets underway next Friday in Florida with the final earmarked for 13 July.

For 32 of the biggest club sides in the world, a new tournament will take centre stage this month with the first ever expanded FIFA Club World Cup kicks off in Miami on June 14.

Some of the biggest names in club football from around the planet (Real Madrid, PSG, Boca Juniors, Al Hilal, Bayern Munich, Chelsea...) will converge on the United States with the final earmarked for July 13 in New Jersey with the competition also serving as a logistical acid test for FIFA with the 2026 World Cup just a year away.

Whilst the tournament has had its fair share of critics, FIFA have made the competition an attractive proposition for the 32 participating teams with a total of $1 billion as a total prize fund. This is without precedent in the world of soccer and FIFA is eager to ensure that teams take this summer's expanded tournament seriously.

Group A: Palmeiras, Porto, Al Ahly, Inter Miami

Group B: PSG, Atlético Madrid, Botafogo, Seattle Sounders

Group C: Bayern, Auckland City, Boca Juniors, Benfica

Group D: Flamengo, Chelsea, Espérance Sportive de Tunisie, LAFC

Group E: River Plate, Urawa Red Diamonds, CF Monterrey, Inter Milan

Group F: Fluminense, Borussia Dortmund, Ulsan HD, Mamelodi Sundowns FC

Group G: Manchester City, Wydad AC, Al Ain, Juventus

Group H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal, Pachuca, FC Salzburg

When it comes to studying the betting patterns ahead of the competition as to who will lift the elaborate trophy at MetLife Stadium on July 13, everything points to the victorious side coming from Europe.

As things stand, Real Madrid are the number one favourites according to Oddschecker.com.

‘Los Blancos' (4/1) are closely followed by PSG (5/1) in second place with Manchester City touted as third favourites.

The first non European team to feature in the Oddschecker listing is Brazilian side Flamengo (33/1) who are quoted as being ninth favourites.

Auckland City, Espérance de Tunis and Wydad Casablanca are all considered the rank outsiders with the New Zealanders ranked at 1000/1 to win the first 32 team Club World Cup title.

International Football

Luciano Spalletti says he has been sacked as Italy head coach ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Spalletti confirmed the news at his news conference on Sunday ahead of Italy's World Cup qualifier against Moldova. That followed increased pressure after Spalletti's side opened their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign with a 3-0 defeat by Norway on Friday, a result which Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma described as “not acceptable”.

“I spoke with (Italian Football Federation president Gabriele) Gravina last night and he informed me that I will be relieved of my duties as national team coach,” Spalletti said. “I am disappointed: given the relationship we have, I had no intention of stepping down. Especially when things are not going well, I would have preferred to stay and do my job.

“However, it is a dismissal and I have to accept it. I have always seen this role as a service to my country and I want to facilitate the future of the national team. I think it is right to seek the best solution.”

Spalletti asked if he feels betrayed. Gets up, walks out

— James Horncastle OMRI (@JamesHorncastle) June 8, 2025



Spalletti took charge of Italy in August 2023, replacing Roberto Mancini. He oversaw a difficult 2024 European Championship campaign as they exited with a 2-0 defeat by Switzerland in the round of 16, winning just one match in the tournament. The 66-year-old has won 11 of his 23 matches in charge of Italy.

Italy reached the knockout stages of the UEFA Nations League but were ousted by Germany in the quarter-final after a 5-4 aggregate defeat.

Four-time champions Italy have not qualified for the World Cup since 2014, despite winning Euro 2020 under Mancini. They sit fourth of five in their qualifying group for the 2026 edition with zero points, but have played one match as opposed to two or three so far due to their participation in the Nations League.

Spalletti previously led Napoli to the Serie A title in the 2022-23 campaign.

Analysis by Italian football writer James Horncastle

Some felt Spalletti should have already gone after Italy's insipid display against Switzerland at the Euros last summer. In fairness, he deserved more time.

People are quick to forget Spalletti was supposed to be on sabbatical after leading Napoli to their first league title in 33 years. His country called when Roberto Mancini resigned during the qualifiers for the Euros after receiving a head-turning offer from Saudi Arabia.

Spalletti has been up against it from the start, taking over at a time of extreme generational transition. Betting scandals implicating Sandro Tonali and Nicolo Fagioli, the marginalisation of Federico Chiesa at Liverpool and a spate of injuries have not helped. But nor has Spalletti's handling of some players and the media.

Friday's 3-0 defeat against Norway came after a fallout with Francesco Acerbi, who turned down a call-up at a time when the national team was already without five centre-backs. That Mancini liked Acerbi's social media post explaining his decision appeared to rattle Spalletti, who hoped his predecessor's phone had been hacked.

Nine points adrift of Norway with two games in hand in their World Cup qualifying group, the nation fears another play-off and missing out on a third consecutive edition of the tournament. The Italian Football Federation is expected to consider Claudio Ranieri, Stefano Pioli and Fabio Cannavaro as prospective replacements.

FIFA are playing fast and loose with the fitness of the world's best players ahead of this month's newly expanded Club World Cup, according to David James.

The expanded tournament which begins next weekend, will feature 32 teams from all corners of the globe compete in the USA over the next month after FIFA abandoned the old format that saw just seven teams take part, with just seven games played in total.

The year's final will be the 63rd game of the tournament and James has dubbed it ‘a joke'.

“If I were Manchester City, I would declare my entire first team injured and send the youth team to the Club World Cup,” he told FourFourTwo, speaking on behalf of Prime Casino. “I think it's a joke. You've got the best players and the best teams in the world complaining about too many games, then you introduce this tournament.

“You're trying to work out who benefits, especially when you look at some of the outfits in it, who – as far as I can consider – haven't even got a world ranking of the stature to be involved with the best in the world.”

James - who FourFourTwo ranked at no.5 in the list of the the greatest-ever Premier League goalkeepers - believes the reason for this expanded tournament, which is putting players at risk, is simple: corporate greed.

“The old format was fine,” he continues. “This format just looks like an opportunity for someone to make more money out of players. They're being flogged for it. It's not that players shouldn't be able to go and take part in these matches, but I think it's an event too far.

“I know there's some obligation for being in it that you have to put your best team forward, but if players are injured, they're injured, so declare them injured.

“You've got sports science teams looking at recovery periods – if you're a team like Man City, most of your squad is involved on international duty as well, and what benefit is it to a club when the players that you depend on for nine months of the season are being compromised for one competition?”

“It was FIFA that wanted to change the format, but you're asking fans to travel around the world to follow their sides. I don't like it. Because it's a new format, there will be a lot of opinions similar to mine: that this is never going to work.

“But if it sustains itself and becomes a regular fixture, then in the future we'll be talking about teams planning on going out there to win it, knowing it's going to be a highly competitive event. At the moment, though, there will be players who are just absolutely knackered come the start of the season.”","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

Borja Díaz

Real Madrid is focused on the signings they can make ahead of the Club World Cup this summer. Huijsen and Alexander Arnold were the first two reinforcements they officially announced. In the coming week, they hope to keep doing the same with several more players.

But things are getting more complicated than expected for the Madridists with Álvaro Carreras. Benfica has gotten serious and could cause a problem for the young full-back. For now, they've forced him to travel to the United States with the rest of the Portuguese team.

For now, the agreement with Real Madrid hasn't been reached, which has caused some unease. Especially considering that the transfer window opened by FIFA closes on the 10th. If they haven't signed him by then, Carreras could miss out on the World Cup.

This will happen if Benfica includes him in their squad list and officially registers him for the World Cup. If that happens and he later ends up signing for Real Madrid, it'll be a mess. He won't be able to play in the tournament this summer with the Madridists, but he also won't be able to do so with the Portuguese team.

Xabi Alonso has insisted on signing Álvaro Carreras to have him already for the Club World Cup. With Mendy injured, he knows he'll only have Fran García available for the left-back position. He wanted to have a couple of options to face this title with guarantees.

It seemed there wouldn't be any problems, since the former Madridist youth player wants to return to Real Madrid. He has already communicated this to Benfica, making his intentions clear to the Portuguese team. But that hasn't managed to unblock the negotiations so far.

There are still a couple of days left for the Whites to get the deal closed. That way, Carreras will be at the World Cup and will do so under Xabi Alonso's orders. That's everyone's desire, but for now, it hasn't been confirmed.

Romania came into the match in the Austrian capital of Vienna in fine form after winning seven of their last eight games (L1), and it didn't take Mircea Lucescu's side long to flex their attacking muscles.

Only eight minutes had passed before two early appeals for penalties were turned down by referee Maurizio Mariani. An all-action beginning to the contest continued with Horatiu Moldovan producing a fine save to keep Sabitzer from opening the scoring.

The deadlock then should have been broken nine minutes later. Up from the back for another Austrian attack, Maximilian Wober disappointingly displayed why his particular skill set is at the opposite end of the pitch, not in the final third, as he blazed high into the stands from relatively close range. 

Austria authoritatively continued to search for the game's opening goal before half-time, but it appeared at first sight that Das Team would have to settle for a goalless game at the break as Moldovan twice denied Sabitzer in between acrobatically keeping out Romano Schmid's fierce strike.

However, that all changed in the 42nd minute as Wober's header back into the danger zone was powerfully volleyed in by Michael Gregoritsch.

Even after coming under increasing pressure throughout the opening quarter-hour of the second half, which saw Denis Dragus nearly equalise for Romania, Austria fortuitously put the game to bed after 60 minutes.

Leading by example, Sabitzer finally got his name onto the scoresheet with a strike from just outside of the area that took a double deflection before it beat Moldovan at his near post.

Despite being two goals to the good, Austria were left indebted to Patrick Pentz throughout the concluding stages, as he pulled off two stunning saves to prevent Nicolae Stanciu's set-piece and substitute Adrian Sut's ambitious long-range effort from setting up an intriguing finale.

Denis Alibec headed home a late consolation for Romania with the last kick of the match, however, it was too late to spoil an opening day FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifying success for Austria that puts them in good stride for their match against Group H outsiders San Marino on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Romania will return home to familiar surroundings as Cyprus are the visitors to Bucharest.

From missing stars and top teams to concerns over player welfare, here are five key talking points before the 2025 Club World Cup.

A new-look FIFA Club World Cup, featuring 32 teams, kicks off in the United States on June 14 and runs through to the final on July 13.

In advance of the tournament, Al Jazeera takes a look at the top five talking points:

FIFA's decision to expand the Club World Cup from a six- or eight-team tournament to a supersized 32-team edition has been criticised by FIFPRO, the global football players' union, and the World Leagues Forum (WLF).

Legitimate questions have been raised about the extra workload on players due to the increased number of matches, and the corresponding reduction in rest and recovery time for players in a shortened off season.

“The FIFA Council's decision to schedule the first edition of the 32-team FIFA Club World Cup between 15 June and 13 July 2025 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives,” FIFPRO said in a statement in December.

A report released by FIFPRO and Football Benchmark in April found that several Club World Cup-bound players are among the most overworked for the 2024-25 season.

The report's findings estimated that Real Madrid's Federico Valverde, who made 43 back-to-back appearances up until April 1 with fewer than five days of recovery time before these matches, could potentially reach 65 back-to-back appearances for club and country by the end of the season, racking up close to 7,000 minutes and 78 games.

The WLF, an organisation representing 44 major professional leagues that is chaired by Premier League chief Richard Masters, said the organisation was unhappy that it had been overlooked in FIFA's decision-making process.

According to the Reuters news agency, Masters accused FIFA of prioritising its own commercial interests, adding that the June-July schedule would affect player availability for national leagues at the start of the season in August.

While the expansion of the Club World Cup to 32 sides allows more teams a chance at testing themselves against some of the biggest names in global club football, it also raises questions about the competitiveness of the tournament.

With every group having at least two clubs from Europe or South America, teams from the other continental confederations, such as Asia or Africa, could find themselves having very little chance of glory against the heavyweights of the game.

For example, in Group G, Moroccan side Wydad AC and UAE Pro League Al Ain are pitted against Manchester City and Juventus, who have been supremely successful on the domestic and continental stage.

Teams from the European confederation (UEFA) have historically dominated the Club World Cup, winning 16 of the 20 editions played to date. The remaining four have all been won by clubs from the South American confederation (CONMEBOL).

So, history suggests that the presence of European or South American sides could lead to lopsided matchups in this year's edition.

While Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe will play at the tournament, fans will be denied an opportunity to watch many of the elite performers from the 2024-25 season, such as Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, the Premier League's Golden Boot winner, or teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal, who won three trophies this year with Barcelona.

Salah created history as the first player in Premier League history to finish a season with the most goals and assists as well as win the Player of the Season award. But one of the most in-form forwards in the world will not be among the players in the US as Liverpool could not qualify for the tournament, with Manchester City and Chelsea earning spots from the English quota.

Further confusing the selection of teams was FIFA's abrupt decision to give the host nation a spot and award it to Inter Miami, underlining the opaque nature of the qualifying criteria for the tournament which won't feature Liverpool, Barcelona or Napoli, who have all just been crowned champions in three of the most prestigious leagues in Europe.

Inter Miami gained entry by topping Major League Soccer's regular season standings, despite losing in the first round of the playoffs – a decision critics say shows FIFA's desperation to have Inter's Argentina great Messi at their inaugural showpiece.

Apart from the winners of each confederation's premier club competitions, teams qualified according to a ranking based on their performances over a four-year period. Barcelona, the current La Liga champions, missed out on a spot due to the four-year club coefficient rankings and two-team restrictions, as their archrivals Real Madrid qualified for the Club World Cup alongside Atletico Madrid.

The Catalan giants, fielding some of the most exhilarating footballers on the planet, such as 17-year-old wonderkid Yamal or the goal-scoring genius of Raphinha, are a huge omission from the club-based tournament.

Prodigious talents like Romelu Lukaku and Scott McTominay, who ushered Napoli's stunning 2024-25 Serie A title charge in Italy, will also not play.

In the build-up to the tournament, FIFA announced the creation of a special transfer window, allowing participating clubs to make last-minute transfers before their teams board the flight to the US.

FIFA has said signings can be made from June 1 to June 10 as well as June 27 to July 3, explaining that the objective of the latter window is to encourage clubs and players whose contracts are expiring “to find an appropriate solution to facilitate the players' participation”.

The introduction of this transfer window is unique as signings usually either take place in the close season or the middle of the season, known as the summer and winter windows for European clubs.

FIFA's move has led to speculation that Cristiano Ronaldo could be one of those players to put pen to paper during the window on a short-term deal for one of the participating clubs. Spanish newspaper Marca reported in late May that a club in Brazil had submitted an offer to sign Ronaldo. Botafogo – one of four Brazilian clubs competing at the tournament – have been linked with the veteran forward.

Ronaldo, 40, has hinted he could leave Al Nassr after declaring that a “chapter is over” hours after the Saudi Pro League finished. Al Nassr have not qualified for the Club World Cup, unlike fellow Saudi side Al Hilal, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino recently said “there are discussions” over Ronaldo playing at the Club World Cup.

The Portugal star confirmed on Saturday that he had received “quite a few” offers from participating clubs to play for them at the tournament, but had decided against accepting any.

Should a Ronaldo transfer ultimately occur, the Club World Cup could see Messi and Ronaldo face-off in the US market, greatly boosting media interest, ticket sales, TV viewership figures, and enhancing the overall appeal of the tournament. The duo, who are arguably the greatest players of their generation, last played in the same competition at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

A club which has already benefitted from this special transfer window is Real Madrid, which was able to reach an agreement with Liverpool to sign defender Trent Alexander-Arnold early and make him available for the tournament.

The right back was scheduled to join the Spanish giants on a six-year deal as a free agent after his Liverpool contract expired on June 30, but according to The Athletic, Real paid Liverpool 10 million euros ($11.4m) to fast-track the process and get him on board for the Club World Cup.

Fans in the US will get a glimpse of what the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil will look like when they attend the Club World Cup matches this year.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be co-hosted by the US alongside Canada and Mexico, running for more than a month with 100+ matches.

Among the 12 stadiums that will host the new-look Club World Cup, some have also been chosen as venues for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will have 48 participants for the first time.

MetLife Stadium, an 82,500-seater in New Jersey, will host the semifinals and the final of the Club World Cup as well as the final of next year's prestigious World Cup.

Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, Seattle's Lumen Field and Miami's Hard Rock Stadium are the other venues which will be involved in both tournaments.

The venues, though, might not be filled to their full capacity as organisers have struggled to sell tickets, with club fan tickets, general public tickets, and hospitality sections all still up for sale on the official FIFA site, nearly two weeks out from the start of the event.

Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz has won the third set in the Roland Garros final to gain a foothold against rival Jannik Sinner. The Italian leads the Spaniard 6-4, 7-6(4), 4-6 after three hours and five minutes of high-octane action on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Alcaraz and Sinner have enjoyed a riveting rivalry since their maiden meeting at the ATP Masters 1000 in Paris in 2021, with the Spaniard leading the Italian 7-4 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. However, this is their first clash in a major final and it has lived up to the hype so far.

After Sinner won the opening set, he remained composed in the second set, recovering from squandering a 5-2 lead to prevail in the tie-break and double his advantage. However, Alcaraz has refused to go away, showing the champion's spirit that has helped him to four major titles in the early years of his career.

The Spaniard struck his groundstrokes with more aggression and penetration to frequently force Sinner out of position and off balance, clinching the third set after initially failing to serve out at 5-3.



Alcaraz is bidding to become the eighth man in the Open Era (since 1968) and just the third this century to successfully defend his Roland Garros crown. If the 22-year-old can turn the tables and clinch his fifth major, he will maintain his flawless record in Slam finals. He has never won a match at a major after losing the first two sets but holds a 12-1 record in fifth sets, while Sinner is 6-9 at the same stage.

Three-time Slam champion Sinner is also unbeaten in major finals and is on a 20-match winning streak at this level, having won the US Open in September and the Australian Open in January. The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings is looking to become just the fifth man in the Open Era to clinch three consecutive major titles and the second Italian man in the Open Era to lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy after Adriano Panatta in 1976.

Last month, Sinner reached the final in Rome before he lost to Alcaraz in straight sets. The 23-year-old is 18-1 on the season, according to the Infosys Win/Loss Index, and has yet to drop a set in Paris, highlighted by his semi-final win against three-time Roland Garros champion Novak Djokovic.
Alcaraz leads the Tour in 2025 with matches won (36) and titles claimed (3). If the 22-year-old can lift his fifth major trophy, he will become the third youngest man in history to reach that milestone after Bjorn Borg (21) and Rafael Nadal (22).
In an engaging first set, there were 11 break points across the 10 games, with eight saved. Sinner found his range as the set went on, with his relentless baseline ballstriking and aggressive court position rushing Alcaraz, who received a medical timeout at 4-5 after clay blew into his eye. Following the stoppage, Sinner came out and broke the Spaniard's serve to seal the opening set on his first set point after 63 minutes.
Sinner continued to play proactively at the start of the second set, frequently gaining the first blow in the baseline rallies to race 3-0 ahead. From 5-2, the Italian looked on course to move two sets ahead but Alcaraz increased his aggression on return and enjoyed more success when moving forward to rally to 5-5. From there, Sinner showed why he'd won 47 of his past 49 matches. The top seed kept his composure, blocked out the crowd's support for Alcaraz and continued to hit with relentless depth, winning the tie-break to move into a two-set lead.
Alcaraz did not fade in the third set, though. He stood closer to the baseline to rush Sinner, who led by a set in the third set, and gained the decisive break of the set in the 10th game, striking a number of stunning forehand winners to keep his chances alive.
Did You Know?
With both Alcaraz and Sinner reaching the final, the duo has now combined to win each of the past six Grand Slam titles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Scouting Report: Zverev, Fritz lead Stuttgart; Medvedev headlines 's-Hertogenbosch","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/suttgart-shertogenbosch-scouting-report-2025","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 09:02:37 GMT","

The grass-court season commences on the ATP Tour this week. There is ATP 250 action at the BOSS OPEN in Stuttgart and at the Libema Open in ‘s-Hertogenbosch.

Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz lead the field in Germany, while Daniil Medvedev and Ugo Humbert are the top two seeds in The Netherlands. ATPTour.com looks ahead at five things to watch at each event.



FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN STUTTGART
1) Zverev leads the field: Zverev will make his first appearance in Stuttgart since 2019. The 28-year-old arrives on home soil off the back of a quarter-final exit at Roland Garros and will be hoping for a smooth transition to the grass courts. The 28-year-old has won 24 tour-level titles but has never triumphed on grass. The top seed faces Corentin Moutet or 2013 champion Fabio Fognini in the first round.

2) Can Fritz find form? Fritz's up-and-down season continued at Roland Garros, where he suffered a first-round loss to Daniel Altmaier. The 27-year-old is the second seed at the ATP 250 event and is seeking his fourth grass-court title, having won in Eastbourne on three occasions.

3) Shelton, Felix threats: Ben Shelton went 4-4 on grass last season, which included an opening-round defeat in Stuttgart. The third-seeded American will meet Damir Dzumhur or a qualifier in his opening match at this year's event. Felix Auger-Aliassime is a two-time finalist at the BOSS OPEN (2019, 2021) and will be seeking his third title of the season. The Canadian also lost in the first round at Roland Garros.

4) #NextGenATP stars Tien & Engel in action: Learner Tien, 19, and Justin Engel, 17, will both make their Stuttgart debuts. Tien, currently third in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, has never played on grass at either tour-level or ATP Challenger Tour level. Germany's Engel has received a wild card and will meet a qualifier in the first round.

5) Krawietz/Puetz top seeds in doubles: Germans Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz continue the quest for their first title of the season on home soil in Stuttgart. Singles star Fritz is also in doubles action, teaming with Jiri Lehecka.



FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN ‘S-HERTOGENBOSCH
1) Medvedev chasing form: Medvedev arrives on the grass off the back of a disappointing first-round exit to Cameron Norrie at Roland Garros. The top seed in ‘s-Hertogenbsoch, the 29-year-old will hope to add to his only previous grass-court title (Mallorca 2021). Medvedev is 18-11 on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and at No. 11 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

2) Humbert second seed: A semi-finalist in ‘s-Hertogenbosch last year, Humbert returns this season hoping to put his injury issues behind him. The Frenchman retired during his second-round clash against Jacob Fearnley at Roland Garros after going over on his ankle but is fit enough to compete at the ATP 250. The 26-year-old opens against Rinky Hijikata or a qualifier.

3) De Jong, Van de Zandschulp lead home hopes: Jesper de Jong and Botic van de Zandschulp will lead Dutch hopes after receiving wild cards. There has been Dutch success at the ATP 250 in the past, with Tallon Griekspoor lifting the trophy in 2023 and Tim van Rijthoven in 2022.

4) Basavareddy uses Next Gen entry: Nishesh Basavareddy has used his Next Gen entry spot to compete in ‘s-Hertogenbosch. Next Gen players ranked in the Top 250 are eligible for one ATP 250 main draw spot each season. The 20-year-old American has never played a tour-level or ATP Challenger Tour match on grass.

5) Mektic/Venus top seeds: Nikola Mektic and Michael Venus headline the doubles field. The top seeds won their only title of the season in Auckland in January. Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool are the second seeds. The Brits have triumphed in Brisbane and Doha this year.

13:26 CET - Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini are the women's doubles French Open champions! The Italian duo have followed up their triumph in Rome with victory here in Paris, beating Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1.

On the same court in which they clinched Olympic Gold just under a year ago, they are victorious once more. For Errani, it is her ninth Grand Slam title in doubles, while Paolini has her hands on her very first. A great moment for both of them, as Italian tennis continues to thrive.

11:30 CET - Welcome back to the Tennis Tracker on the final day of the French Open, and what an absolute treat there is in store.

Before the tournament began, every tennis fan would have wanted to see world number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the showpiece event, and that is exactly what has happened.

Sinner has had a near-flawless run to the final. Taking part in his second tournament since returning from a drugs ban, the Italian hasn't dropped a single set and saw off 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in a high-quality last-four clash.

His relentless and suffocating brand of tennis has been too much for anyone, and he will be looking to produce that against an opponent who has beaten him in their last four meetings. Victory would see him win his first French Open and fourth Grand Slam, which would take him level with Alcaraz.

It hasn't been as plain sailing for Alcaraz, who has dropped a set in four of his matches. He didn't look his best against Lorenzo Musetti in his semi-final, but eventually managed to overcome his ailing opponent, who retired with an injury in the fourth set.

However, Alcaraz tends to save his best for Sinner, and there is little doubt that the Spaniard is a better clay-court player than his rival. At one point, Alcaraz trailed the head-to-head 4-3, but now leads it 7-4. If he can continue his winning run over Sinner, he will pick up his second title at Roland Garros and his fifth Slam.

It is a match that is so hard to call, and everyone will be hoping that it is an absolute thriller. Neither player has lost in a Grand Slam final before, so something will have to give. Proceedings get underway around 15:00 CET.

Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz has won the third set in the Roland Garros final to gain a foothold against rival Jannik Sinner. The Italian leads the Spaniard 6-4, 7-6(4), 4-6 after three hours and five minutes of high-octane action on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Alcaraz and Sinner have enjoyed a riveting rivalry since their maiden meeting at the ATP Masters 1000 in Paris in 2021, with the Spaniard leading the Italian 7-4 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. However, this is their first clash in a major final and it has lived up to the hype so far.

After Sinner won the opening set, he remained composed in the second set, recovering from squandering a 5-2 lead to prevail in the tie-break and double his advantage. However, Alcaraz has refused to go away, showing the champion's spirit that has helped him to four major titles in the early years of his career.

The Spaniard struck his groundstrokes with more aggression and penetration to frequently force Sinner out of position and off balance, clinching the third set after initially failing to serve out at 5-3.



Alcaraz is bidding to become the eighth man in the Open Era (since 1968) and just the third this century to successfully defend his Roland Garros crown. If the 22-year-old can turn the tables and clinch his fifth major, he will maintain his flawless record in Slam finals. He has never won a match at a major after losing the first two sets but holds a 12-1 record in fifth sets, while Sinner is 6-9 at the same stage.

Three-time Slam champion Sinner is also unbeaten in major finals and is on a 20-match winning streak at this level, having won the US Open in September and the Australian Open in January. The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings is looking to become just the fifth man in the Open Era to clinch three consecutive major titles and the second Italian man in the Open Era to lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy after Adriano Panatta in 1976.

Last month, Sinner reached the final in Rome before he lost to Alcaraz in straight sets. The 23-year-old is 18-1 on the season, according to the Infosys Win/Loss Index, and has yet to drop a set in Paris, highlighted by his semi-final win against three-time Roland Garros champion Novak Djokovic.
Alcaraz leads the Tour in 2025 with matches won (36) and titles claimed (3). If the 22-year-old can lift his fifth major trophy, he will become the third youngest man in history to reach that milestone after Bjorn Borg (21) and Rafael Nadal (22).
In an engaging first set, there were 11 break points across the 10 games, with eight saved. Sinner found his range as the set went on, with his relentless baseline ballstriking and aggressive court position rushing Alcaraz, who received a medical timeout at 4-5 after clay blew into his eye. Following the stoppage, Sinner came out and broke the Spaniard's serve to seal the opening set on his first set point after 63 minutes.
Sinner continued to play proactively at the start of the second set, frequently gaining the first blow in the baseline rallies to race 3-0 ahead. From 5-2, the Italian looked on course to move two sets ahead but Alcaraz increased his aggression on return and enjoyed more success when moving forward to rally to 5-5. From there, Sinner showed why he'd won 47 of his past 49 matches. The top seed kept his composure, blocked out the crowd's support for Alcaraz and continued to hit with relentless depth, winning the tie-break to move into a two-set lead.
Alcaraz did not fade in the third set, though. He stood closer to the baseline to rush Sinner, who led by a set in the third set, and gained the decisive break of the set in the 10th game, striking a number of stunning forehand winners to keep his chances alive.
Did You Know?
With both Alcaraz and Sinner reaching the final, the duo has now combined to win each of the past six Grand Slam titles.

Coco Gauff became the first American in a decade to lift the trophy after the women's singles final at Roland-Garros and she was asked what it means to represent the United States. 

After defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in three sets to win the French Open, Gauff was asked what it's like traveling the world as an American.

""It means a lot. Obviously there's a lot going on in our country right now,"" Gauff responded, via The Tennis Letter. ""Just to be a representation of that and a representation of people that look like me in America, who maybe don't feel as supported during this time period. Being that reflection of hope and light for those people.""

Gauff continued by bringing up this past year's presidential election, and the response by the country after President Donald Trump was elected for his second term. She referred to it as a ""down period"" in the States. 

""I remember after the election and everything, it felt like a down period a little bit. My mom told me during Riyadh, try to win the tournament just to give people something to smile for. That's what I was thinking about today,"" Gauff said. 

Despite the ""down period"" comment, Gauff said she is ""definitely patriotic.""

""Some people may feel some type of way about being patriotic and things like that, but I'm definitely patriotic. I'm proud to be American. I'm proud to represent Americans that look like me and people who kind of support the things that I support,"" Gauff added.

The 21-year-old dropped to the clay and covered her face at Roland-Garros following a thrilling match against Sabalenka. Gauff lost the first set in a tiebreak, but fought back to win the second set, 6-2, and came away with her second Grand Slam after a third-set 6-4 finish. 

The last American to win the French Open? Serena Williams lifted the trophy in 2015. 

""The crowd really helped me today,"" Gauff said after the match, as celebrities like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman and many more were noticeably cheering her on throughout the match. ""You guys were cheering for me so hard, and I don't know what I did to deserve so much love from the French crowd. But I appreciate you guys.""

""Yesterday was a tough one. Coco handled the conditions much better than I did and fully deserved the win. She was the better player yesterday, and I want to give her the credit she earned,” wrote Sabalenka.

Sabalenka was broken nine times during the 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 loss, winning 48 percent of her first-serve points. She also contributed 70 unforced errors, with 39 coming on the backhand side.""You all know me... I'm always going to be honest and human in how I process these moments. I made over 70 unforced errors, so I can't pretend it was a great day for me. But both things can be true... I didn't play my best, and Coco stepped up and played with poise and purpose.During her post-match press conference, Sabalenka described her performance as “the worst final I ever played.” But the three-time major winner had also expressed a belief that Iga Swiatek would have defeated Gauff had the three-time defending champion advanced past Sabalenka in their semifinal.“if Iga would win me another day, I think she would go out today and she would get the win,” Sabalenka declared.

Gauff responded that it wasn't “a fair thing to say” and had preferred to play Swiatek given her recent 6-1, 6-1 win over the Pole.“The way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favorite to win. So I think she was the best person that I could have played in the final,” said Gauff.“Neither of them would have been the better shot. But it played out how it played out. That's why I'm here today.”

Emma Raducanu has revealed that she suffered another injury setback ahead of her Queen's campaign. The world No. 41 is starting her grass swing on home soil but hasn't been able to get as much time on the surface as she would have liked after a back issue resurfaced following the French Open.

Raducanu had been dealing with back spasms in Strasbourg last month and said she wasn't feeling 100 per cent going into Roland Garros. She still reached the second round there, but after returning home, her grass preparations were interrupted. The 22-year-old has only just started playing points in practice again, though she's raring to go at the Queen's Club, where she has also entered the doubles draw with Katie Boulter.

Ahead of the WTA 500 at Queen's, Raducanu explained: “I got back, like, end of last week, and then I had two days off after I finished in Paris and then got straight back on the court.

“Had a small interruption with a bit of a back spasm again, so that was a bit annoying. So that kind of hindered my grass prep, but the last few days I've managed to get on the grass and kind of just begin to try and find my feet.”

Raducanu still has a packed schedule for the grass swing and will also play in Berlin and Eastbourne before Wimbledon. For now, she is happy to manage the back issue.

“I can't really predict the future, how it's going to be, I know I've been managing my back for the last few weeks now, and it's something that comes and goes,” she continued.

“But, I mean, overall, I just have to manage what I can take care of and if these things happen, then I just need to deal with it and just keep doing the right things.

“It can be frustrating. I think when I was playing in Strasbourg in my second round match, it definitely hindered me, and first round in Paris, but I got through.

“And I think that just having to manage it, knowing that it keeps coming back, but I try not to let it get to me because I think I have a pretty good feel overall of when it happens, what to do and how to manage it. It does take a few days out, but all I can do is kind of deal with what's in front of me.”

Raducanu will open her singles campaign at Queen's against a qualifier. If she makes it to the second round, she'll face either reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova or Rebecca Sramkova.

But she doesn't have high expectations after her back issue flared up again.

She added: “My expectations, truthfully, are pretty low because as I said, I played points for the first time today.

“I've had maybe like, two, three days on the grass court, so it's not been much. But I just have to take it as it goes. I know that I'm doing what I can and I've dealt with everything as best as I can.”

Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu are to play doubles together for the first time in a British dream team at Queen's this week.

British No 1 Boulter has confirmed that the pair plan to team up as women return to Queen's for the first time in more than 50 years.

They will join forces alongside their commitments in the singles draw in order to maximise court time, as the grass season gets under way at the prestigious West Kensington club.

“I think myself and Emma, we've been wanting to play for a while now,” Boulter said on Sunday. “I think we've talked about it a lot of times, and unfortunately, it just hasn't quite happened for various reasons. I think [for the] first week on grass, to get a couple more matches is super important.

“I think we were actually here at Queen's, practising on the clay, and we decided we thought we'd come back and play on the grass together.

“It'll be extremely special. Obviously, she's a great player, and I'm looking forward to having the first of many more.”

Boulter, 28, and Raducanu, 22, have been neck-and-neck for the British No 1 spot this year, with the former set to move to a world ranking of No 34 on Monday and the latter just three spots behind her at No 37.

Their campaigns at Queen's therefore will be hugely influential in their attempts to secure a ranked seeding for Wimbledon next month, which will go to the top 32 seeds.

Raducanu faces a tough ask at Queen's though, having been drawn in the same half as top seed Zheng Qinwen, the reigning Olympic champion and world No 7. Should she progress from an opening round tie against a qualifier, Raducanu will come up against Barbora Krejcikova, last year's Wimbledon champion.

Boulter will also face a qualifier in the first round with a potential meeting in the second round against fifth seed Diana Shnaider.

The pair will then team up in the doubles to take on the Chinese duo of Wu Fang-Hsien and Jiang Xinyu, with a potential meeting with fellow British team Jodie Burrage and Sonay Kartal on the cards.

Raducanu also confirmed the latest development in her ongoing coaching saga with the return of Nick Cavaday, the man who decided to step away from the role earlier this year in order to prioritise his own health.

Cavaday oversaw Raducanu's training session on Sunday at Queen's and the 2021 US Open champion confirmed that he will team up with her current coach, Mark Petchey, having filled in this week while the latter remains in Paris on television commentary duty.

“I'm happy to see him healthy, first of all,” said Raducanu, who split from Cavaday in January to leave her looking for a seventh full-time coach in three-and-a-half years as a professional.

“I mean, it's been such a long time since we were last on court together in Australia, and Mark is in Paris commentating, so Nick was around and it was nice to just have a few days with him.”

Raducanu confirmed that the appointment of both Cavaday and Petchey will continue through to the end of Wimbledon next month. “They'll both be helping me throughout the grass,” she added.

“I think having Mark and Nick... both people who have banks of experience and I think they can complement each other really well and I trust both of them a lot. So that is a big fundamental for me. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to this upcoming season and see how it goes.”

Other British players to have secured wildcards are Kartal, Burrage and Francesca Jones, who will all feature in the first women's championship at Queen's Club since 1973.

Emma Raducanu felt “pretty good” after completing her first rigorous grass-court training session of the season as she manages an ongoing back issue in the build-up to Wimbledon.

The 2021 US Open champion, who suffered a second-round exit to Iga Swiatek at the French Open, has been hindered by persistent spasming for much of 2025.

She is set to play at Queens this week, with grand slam action at the All England Club scheduled to start on Monday, June 30.

“I got back (from Paris) last week and then I got straight back on the court,” Raducanu told a press conference.

“I had a small interruption with a bit of a back spasm again, which was a bit annoying and that hindered my grass prep. But the last few days I have managed to get on the grass.

“I can't really predict the future. I know I have been managing my back for the last few weeks now and it's something that comes and goes.

“It can be frustrating. I try not to let it get to me because I have a pretty good feel when it happens of how to manage it. All I can do is deal with what's in front of me

“Today was the first day I opened it up and played points on the grass. It is pretty early days and I can't say I have had a lot of prep on it. But I felt pretty good today.”

British number two Raducanu, who is ranked 41st in the world, was dismantled 6-1 6-2 by reigning champion Swiatek at Roland Garros.

Subject to overcoming a qualifier, she could face current Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova in the second round at Queens, while she is set to pair up with British number one Katie Boulter in the doubles.

“Playing a doubles match with Katie will hopefully give me a good feel for that surface and it will be positive,” the 22-year-old said.

“I really like playing with Katie. We've practised a few times together in the past at Billie Jean King Cup ties.”

In a shocking turn of events, the tennis world is buzzing with anticipation as a new American dream seems to be unfolding in the year 2025. With the likes of Madison Keys and Coco Gauff already making waves in Melbourne and Paris, the spotlight is now on Wimbledon, where a bold prediction has been made by former tennis pro Mardy Fish.

The 2025 Grand Slam season started off with a bang as Madison Keys claimed her first major title at the Australian Open, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in a thrilling final. Following Keys' triumph, Coco Gauff continued the American success story by clinching her second Grand Slam title at the French Open, solidifying her name alongside legends like Serena Williams.

Looking ahead to Wimbledon, Mardy Fish has caused a stir by backing Jessica Pegula as his top pick for the grass-court glory. Pegula, known for her resilience on the WTA tour, has had a rollercoaster season marked by both triumphs and setbacks. Despite a disappointing exit at the French Open, Fish's unwavering confidence in Pegula has set the stage for a potential American sweep of the Grand Slam titles this year.

As the tennis world gears up for Wimbledon, all eyes will be on Jessica Pegula as she aims to overcome recent challenges and make her mark on the prestigious tournament. With Madison Keys and Coco Gauff already setting the stage on fire in 2025, Pegula has the opportunity to rise above the criticism and shine on the grass courts of SW19. Will she be able to turn the tide and fulfill the American dream at the third Slam of the year? Stay tuned for all the action and drama as Wimbledon unfolds.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates as he won the semifinal match of the French Tennis Open against Serbia's Novak Djokovic at the Roland-Garros stadium in Paris, Friday, June 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena)AP

A matchup between the two best players in the world is set for the final in Paris, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz get set to square off in the championship match at Roland-Garros.

This was the battle everyone was hoping to see, but few expected it due to Sinner's struggles on the clay. Yet, the two-time Australian Open champion was able to maneuver his way through the field, not losing a single set thus far. That includes a straight-sets victory over Novak Djokovic in the semifinals.

That pits him against the high-flying Carlos Alcaraz. The athleticism of the defending French Open champion reminds many of another Spaniard, Rafael Nadal. Unlike Sinner, Alcaraz has dropped a few sets so far, but that has not stopped him from advancing to the fifth major final of his career. He's 5-0 in Grand Slam championship matches.

Alcaraz beat Sinner in last year's semifinals at Roland-Garros, and is 7-4 all-time against the Italian. The 2023 U.S. Open champion is 2-1 against Sinner in major tournaments, having also been victorious in the quarterfinals of the 2022 U.S. Open.

(1) Jannik Sinner vs. (2) Carlos Alcaraz

When: Sunday, June 8

Time: 9 a.m. ET

Where: Roland-Garros (Paris, France)

                All about the Jannik Sinner household.            

When World No. 1 Jannik Sinner steps onto the court, one has got to feel sorry for the tennis balls. The 23-year-old Italian is one of the most brutal offensive maestros on tour. A three-time Grand Slam champion, Sinner is turning glory-hunter in a positive sense at Roland Garros 2025. The reigning Australian Open and US Open winner will battle Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday in a bid to capture his maiden French Open trophy.

Behind every successful tennis player, is a supportive family that has sacrificed a lot. There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes which fans are occasionally unaware of. Over the years, Sinner has repeatedly stressed on the importance of his team and family. Born in South Tyrol, he started playing tennis at the age of 7 since his father liked the sport. But did you know that Jannik Sinner also has a brother? Let's find out more about him.

Mark Sinner is the elder brother of ATP starlet Jannik Sinner. He was born in Russia in 1998, making him close to three years older than Jannik. Sinner has previously tagged his elder brother Mark as his best friend and a close confidant.

On several occasions, Mark is not seen at his brother Jannik Sinner's matches. He is currently working as a trainer for the fire brigade in South Tyrol, near Austria. He reportedly said in a 2023 interview, “The relationship with Jannik is normal, like that of most brothers. We played tennis – we tried at least. For a few years, I managed to keep up with him. Then he took off and it was impossible to exchange shots.”

Jannik Sinner after losing to Carlos Alcaraz in Rome final:“Special thank you  to my brother who rather than being here is in Imola watching Formula 1.” 😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/8nPvHGZ7Vd

After his glorious triumph at the 2025 Australian Open where he retained his crown, Sinner was open in his admissions. “Having Mark here was maybe the best part of the victory. Nobody knows me better than him. For me, he is an important person. I call him, I confide in him, I know that I can tell him everything and he understands me.”

Yes, Jannik Sinner's brother Mark is adopted. He was reportedly born in Rostov-on-Don which lies in Russia. At the age of 9 months, he was adopted by the Sinner household. Parents Hanspeter and Siglinde worked as a chef and waitress respectively, and gave birth to Jannik two years after adopting Mark.

Sinner was born on August 16, 2001 in the town of Innichen in South Tyrol, Italy. He grew up in Sexten which is his family hometown. Sinner's mother Siglinde has German roots and his father Hanspeter worked as a chef when they grew up. In fact, his love for tennis was one of the primary reasons for Jannik to pick up the racquet and start playing the sport.

After overcoming Daniil Medvedev in a thrilling 2024 Australian Open final, Sinner expressed his heartfelt gratitude to his parents. “I wish that everyone could have my parents, because they let me choose whatever I wanted to,” he emoted. “Even when I was younger, I tried some other sports and they never put pressure on me. I wish that this freedom is possible for as many young kids as possible. Thank you so much to my parents!”

Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Joshua Mayne

Winning a grand slam title is something most tennis players dream of from the day they start swinging their racquet. 

Despite the difficulty of winning a grand slam tournament, a select few have dominated on the biggest stage throughout the years. 

The past two decades, in particular, have seen certain players cement their place in history by winning a record number of grand slam titles. 

In 2025, the battle for those records continues, with Roland-Garros at the pointy end.

MORE: Who is the current men's world No.1? | Who is the current women's world No. 1?

In running order, the four grand slam events held each year are:

The French Open is played on clay, Wimbledon on grass and the other two are held on hard courts. 

Wimbledon is the oldest grand slam event, founded in 1877, followed by the US Open four years later, the French Open in 1891, and the Australian Open in 1905. 

Novak Djokovic and Margaret Court currently hold the record for most grand slam singles titles. They have each won 24.

Djokovic took the lead outright in the men's game by winning his third Roland-Garros title at the 2023 French Open when Rafael Nadal was ruled out through injury.

Nadal had taken sole ownership of the men's singles record after edging past Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic with his 2022 Australian Open triumph. He then extended his lead at that year's French Open before Djokovic pulled back within one at Wimbledon.

Djokovic's victory in the 2023 Australian Open final, where he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas, saw him draw level with Nadal at the top of the men's standings and, after losing a five-set thriller to Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final that year, he beat Daniil Medvedev in straight sets at the US Open.

That meant a third grand slam in 2023 and a victory that drew him level with Court's iconic haul of 24 major tournament triumphs.

Swiss great Federer won't add to his grand slam haul after announcing his retirement following the Laver Cup in September 2022, while Nadal's chances of catching Djokovic again are also over after retiring following the Davis Cup in November 2024.

Court, meanwhile, looked set to be caught by Serena Williams, but the American failed to win any of her last four grand slam finals and has also since stepped away from the sport. 

*Active players have been bolded

The term 'Grand Slam' actually refers to the achievement of winning all four tournaments in the same year. 

Winning one title is hard enough, but winning all four straight is extremely difficult. 

American Don Budge was the first to achieve a Grand Slam in 1938, with Australian Rod Laver the only other men's singles player to repeat the feat. 

Maureen Connolly was the first woman to pull it off in women's singles when she did so in 1953. Margaret Court and Steffi Graf are the only other players to have done the same since. 

If a Grand Slam wasn't rare enough, a Golden Slam requires players to also win Olympic gold on top of the four grand slam events in the same year. 

Steffi Graf was the first to complete a Golden Slam in 1988, with only wheelchair players Diede de Groot and Dylan Alcott managing to replicate the feat since. 

Joshua Mayne is a content producer for The Sporting News currently based in Sydney, Australia. He has previously worked as a newsreader at 2SER and a journalist at Ministry of Sport. Joshua specialises in rugby league, motorsport and tennis. He is still waiting for Arsenal to win the Premier League again.

The world No. 1 expressed a belief that had she lost to Swiatek, the Pole would've beaten Gauff in Saturday's championship.ByTENNIS.comPublished Jun 08, 2025 copy_link

Disappointed and frustrated aren't strong enough words to describe what Aryna Sabaelnka was feeling after losing out on adding the Roland Garros title to her Grand Slam trophy haul Saturday. Wounded, perhaps, does slightly more justice.On a day where Sabalenka described her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 defeat to Coco Gauff as “the worst final I ever played”, the world No. 1 concluded her press conference by expressing her belief that had she lost to Iga Swiatek in the semifinals, the Pole would have gone on to clinch a four-peat in Paris.“If Iga would win me another day, I think she would go out today and she would get the win. Yeah, it just hurts,” said the three-time major winner. ""Honestly hurts. I've been playing really well, and then in the last match, go out there and perform like I did.”

On a day where Sabalenka described her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 defeat to Coco Gauff as “the worst final I ever played”, the world No. 1 concluded her press conference by expressing her belief that had she lost to Iga Swiatek in the semifinals, the Pole would have gone on to clinch a four-peat in Paris.“If Iga would win me another day, I think she would go out today and she would get the win. Yeah, it just hurts,” said the three-time major winner. ""Honestly hurts. I've been playing really well, and then in the last match, go out there and perform like I did.”

“If Iga would win me another day, I think she would go out today and she would get the win. Yeah, it just hurts,” said the three-time major winner. ""Honestly hurts. I've been playing really well, and then in the last match, go out there and perform like I did.”

Sabalenka notably ended Swiatek's 26-match win streak at the clay-court major, but Gauff also had a recent win over their mutual rival—sweeping Swiatek over a pair of 6-1 sets to reach the Madrid final before losing that 1000-level championship to Sabalenka.Upon hearing what Sabalenka said, Gauff understanbly saw it far differently.“I don't agree with that. I'm here sitting here (laughter). Last time I played—no shade to Iga or anything—but I played her and I won in straight sets. Yeah, I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can really happen,” she said.Read more: After ""worst final ever,"" Aryna Sabalenka set for tequila, gummy bears and “flight to Mykonos”

Given the way this season had played out to this point, Sabalenka wasn't the woman Gauff was hoping to see across the net. Swiatek's last title run came at 2024 Roland Garros, while the top seed came into Saturday's clash with a 40-6 record and three crowns from six finals in 2025.See it: Coco Gauff celebrates Roland Garros title with parents, toasts champagne at Tennis Channel set“Honestly the way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favorite to win,"" Gauff said.

Her being No. 1 in the world was the best person to play, so I think I got the hardest matchup just if you go off stats alone.“Obviously, Iga being a champion here, it was going to be a tough match either way.

If you asked me, honestly speaking to you guys who I wanted to play, it was Iga just because I felt Aryna was playing so good, and she was.”Gauff has now won both of her majors against Sabalenka from a set down, adding to her 2023 US Open breakthrough.

David E. Kelley is holding onto hope that Big Little Lies will return for a third season. 


	Season two of the HBO series arrived in 2019, two years after season one debuted. It's been half a decade since the show debuted new episodes, though the series creator told People that he's “hopeful” season three will “happen.”




	“We're hoping it happens,” he said Monday at the Gotham TV Awards. “We had a great time doing the first two seasons and we all want to do it again … I'm hopeful it'll happen.”

Big Little Lies featured an A-list slate of stars, including Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Lauren Dern, Meryl Streep, Zoë Kravitz and Shailene Woodley. If a third season does come to fruition, Kelley noted that no one is “under contract” at the moment, but they'd “need to corral a lot of high-caliber talent and their publicists, but everyone is very committed to it.” 

	











	Kelley praised Liane Moriarty, the author of the novel the TV series is based on, for the continued interest in the show. He also teased that Moriarty has “written another book” that a potential next season “will be based on.”


	“I think it's a credit to Liane Moriarty, too, who wrote the original book,” he said. “And she's written another book that season three will be based on. It's a pretty good collection of talent.”


	In January 2024, sources told The Hollywood Reporter stars and exec producers Witherspoon and Kidman were developing an idea for season three that they were looking forward to pitching to the network. Five months later, the actresses opened up about their hopes for a new season in an interview with Vanity Fair, somewhat indicating that a new installment was happening. 

	











	“I've got Laura [Dern] calling me and Zoë [Kravitz] and Shailene [Woodley]. They're all like, ‘Nic said that we're making Big Little Lies season three?'” Witherspoon said, to which Kidman rebutted, “But we are now! We're moving fast and furious, and Liane [Moriarty] is delivering the book.”

The helmer, speaking at a 25th anniversary celebration of the Christian Bale starrer at the Tribeca Festival, says the world is ""so much worse than when I was making the film,"" specifically calling out ""open fascism.""


							By 

	Katherine Schaffstall



American Psycho director Mary Harron admitted that the cult classic film is just as relevant today as it was when it was released in 2000 while celebrating its 25th anniversary during a conversation with Hasan Minhaj at the 2025 Tribeca Festival on June 7.


	The horror film, which takes place between 1987 and 1989, follows investment banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as he deals with murderous fantasies. Harron told Minhaj she believed that Wall Street employees were “dinosaurs” at the time of filming and that we would “never see” men like that in the future.

	“Not that there wouldn't be rapacious Wall Street behavior and greed,” she continued. “It was true, actually, for a few years after the film came out. It was much better hidden.” However, Harron pointed out that people are still “reveling in bad behavior” and “the joy of being overly racist” today. She continued, “I would never have thought you would see that.”


	Minhaj said that Bateman seemed to say “the quiet part of loud” in his voiceovers, while people in the present day seem much more comfortable using hateful and offensive rhetoric. Harron agreed and explained that she viewed Bateman more as a symbol than as a person. “Patrick Bateman is like if you took everything terrible about, like, 20th century capitalism and about the Reagan era,” she said, listing cruelty, despising the poor, sexism and racism as some of the issues he wasn't afraid to glorify. Meanwhile, she said that the character also represents the “triumph” of “male dominance and money.”


	When Minhaj asked if “reality now is oddly mimicking” the plot of the movie, Harron admitted that her views of the world have changed since it was made. “I would've said when we were making [the] film, you know, the arc of history bends towards justice. And now I think maybe the arc of history is like a corkscrew or maybe it's a rollercoaster,” she said. “Maybe it doesn't just bend towards justice. I would like to think that we'll get through this and find better times.”

	











	After noting that she never would have imagined the state of the world would look like it does in 2025, Harron added, “It's so much worse than when I was making the film. You know, open fascism.” She also pointed out that the direction of today's society may be “why people still like this film” today.


	Harron, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Guinevere Turner, reflected on the popularity of Bateman today after Minhaj pointed out that there are some people that view the character as aspirational. “I know the film is very popular with Wall Street guys and Guinevere and I were, ‘Wait, what? Like, we're making fun of this,'” she said. “I don't know. I can't explain it.”


	She then theorized that people may find the character to be aspirational because he “has everything materially that a person would want” and that he “does whatever he wants.”


	The movie also includes several mentions of the Trump family, while Donald Trump is mentioned in the 1991 Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name that the movie is based on. “It was as a quasi-celebrity,” she said of Trump being mentioned, noting that Bateman's fiancée Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon) complained about his obsession with the now-president. “That, I thought, was part of his dorkiness, really. ‘Cause Donald Trump in the 80s, you know, New Yorkers did not really think of him as cool. He was just, like, he was kind of a joke.”


	Also during the interview, Harron reflected on why Bale was the perfect person to play Bateman after the role was re-cast several times. “It was very strange because he hadn't actually done anything like that before in his work,” she said, adding that Leonardo DiCaprio briefly had the role.

	











	Harron explained that Bale was the only actor up for the role who viewed the script as “funny” as she did, which gave her confidence that he was the perfect person to play Bateman. “It was basically that we had the same sense of humor,” she said of why he ultimately got the role. “The other actors I met, some of them well known and certainly better known than Christian at the time, I could tell that they thought Bateman was sort of cool. And to me, it's like there's nothing cool here. We're not doing the coolness. We're doing the absurdity of him. So, I knew that it was very important we be on the same page.”


	The conversation concluded with Harron recalling how difficult it was to get the film made until Lionsgate agreed to produce it. “I would never have imagined that it would be so embraced,” she said of the film's legacy.

The two musicians hit the stage together in red outfits to perform a rendition of Talking Heads' 1983 hit.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Olivia Rodrigo had a surprise for fans during the Governors Ball Music festival on Saturday night: special guest David Byrne. 


	The Talking Heads band member joined the Grammy winner on stage to perform a rendition of his band's 1983 hit “Burning Down the House.” 




	The two musicians somewhat matched during their Gov Ball performance, with Rodrigo sporting an all-red bra and short set while Byrne wore a white T-shirt and red overalls. Rodrigo and Byrne danced (and ran) around the stage together while taking turns singing lines from the track after the festival was postponed due to weather.

	After embarking on her sold-out, 95-date GUTS World Tour, Rodrigo has been headlining festival after festival. In a few weeks, she'll be in the U.K. to headline Glastonbury 2025, and later this summer, the “bad idea right?” singer will make her Lollapalooza debut.

	Notably, “Burning Down the House” peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the year of its release, making it the highest charting track for the rock band. The song, too, earned the Talking Heads a Grammy nom at the 26th annual awards ceremony.  


	Earlier this week, the band released the long-awaited music video for “Psycho Killer,” starring Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan.

The Day Two headliner at New York's Governors Ball festival had a surprise guest in the form of the Talking Heads frontman. 


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



	“We're in for nasty weather,” prophesied David Byrne 42 years ago on his band Talking Heads‘ biggest  Billboard Hot 100 hit. He probably wasn't making specific predictions about 2025's Governors Ball festival in New York, but that's certainly what was in store for attendees Saturday (June 7), as heavy rain and possible thunder and lightning forced the fest to delay its Day Two start time by four hours. 

	











	As a result, headliner Olivia Rodrigo didn't take the stage at Gov Ball until 9:35 p.m. ET — but the packed audience showed that few if any fans had been deterred by the bad weather and late start time. And along with her usual captivating set of heart-rending acoustic ballads and stomach-punching alt-rock riffers, Rodrigo had a surprise in store for those who'd stuck around with a Byrne guest appearance, as he came out to duet with the singer-songwriter on the Heads' 1983 smash “Burning Down the House.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	After being introduced by a starstruck Rodrigo, Byrne — who could be seen earlier in the night checking out Feid's performance at the Kiehl's stage — emerged in an all-white outfit, covered by red overalls to match Rodrigo's own two-piece getup. The two traded off lines throughout the always-incendiary new wave classic, and then Rodrigo joined Byrne in some of his signature on-stage moves — bending her knees, running in place, and generally looking his traditional combination of charmingly stilted and impossibly cool.

The ""Leave Me Alone"" singer laughed and blew kisses from the back of a pickup truck draped with a transgender flag at WorldPride in Washington, D.C.

	Associated Press



	Gray skies and drizzle gave way to sunshine, multicolored flags and celebrations as the nation's capital held the WorldPride parade Saturday (June 7).


	Tens of thousands of people participated in parades and other festivities, in defiance of what activists say is an unprecedented assault on the LGBTQ+ community that challenges the rights for which many have fought over the years.


	A rainbow flag the length of three football fields flowed through the streets, carried by 500 members of the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, D.C., to kick off the parade. Behind them, people waved Pride flags and flags representing the transgender, asexual and bisexual communities from atop a bus.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Singer-songwriter and actor Reneé Rapp laughed and blew kisses from the back of a pickup truck draped with a transgender flag while Laverne Cox, a transgender actress and activist known for her role in Netflix's Orange is the New Black, waved from an open convertible.

	











	“Pride means us looking out for each other no matter what,” she declared to the crowd as the convertible rolled to a stop. “We know how to be there for each other.”


	Many LGBTQ+ travelers have expressed concerns or decided to skip WorldPride due to anxieties about safety, border policies and a hostile political climate that they say hearkens back to another time. But that did not keep international travelers and other participants away, with groups visible from Iran, Namibia, Kenya and Russia.Along the parade route, hundreds gathered outside the National City Christian Church as rainbow flags and balloons lined its steps and columns. A child with rainbow face paint blew bubbles at the base of the steps while Whitney Houston's “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” blared from loudspeakers.


	“D.C. is already one of the biggest cities in the country for celebrating Pride,” said Cheo White, 33, from Annapolis, Maryland, “But we are all collectively more united and turning out more because of what's happening in the White House.”


	Many have said the gathering has taken on a new meaning amid the Trump administration's aggressive policies against protections for transgender Americans and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.


	White's partner, Nick Kerver, 26, who was visiting from Toledo, Ohio, said Pride has “always been a political tool” but has taken on more importance this year amid mounting threats to the LGBTQ+ community, especially transgender and nonbinary Americans.


	“It feels more important than ever,” Kerver said while wearing a rainbow hat, sunglasses and a T-shirt. “But we also have to get involved in our local communities too.“


	David Begler, a 58-year-old gay man from Philadelphia, expressed disappointment that many international travelers felt unsafe visiting D.C. for WorldPride but said he appreciates its presence in the city during this political climate.

	











	“It's the perfect time to have WorldPride in D.C.,” Begler said. “We need it right now. I want us to send a message to the White House to focus on uplifting each other instead of dividing.“


	Stay DeRoux, 36, usually plans a day trip to D.C. Pride from her home in Fredericksburg, Virginia. But this year, she and her wife, Deenie DeRoux, planned a full weekend. “This is a really big year,” Stay DeRoux said. “There's been a lot of turmoil. So it's an amazing thing to be among allies, among people who love because we've experienced so much hate on a daily basis.”


	For the day, the idea of threats and opposition took a backseat to the celebration. Streets were closed, but filled with floats, and impromptu parties broke out with music and food in streets adjoining the parade route. Cynthia Erivo was set to perform on the Capitol Stag following the parade.


	Johnny Cervantes Jr., dressed in a black suit and top hat, headed to a grandstand at a church-themed float to marry his partner of 28 years, Freddie Lutz, owner of Freddie's Beach Bar and Restaurant in Arlington, Virginia.


	Events culminate Sunday with a rally and protest march and a giant street party and concert (headlined by Doechii) covering a multi-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.


	“This is WorldPride in the best city in the world,” Mayor Muriel Bowser declared as she walked the parade hand-in-hand with her daughter, Miranda.

Bruce Willis found ways to continue to work and appear on screen through the beginning of his degenerative illness, his wife has revealed in her forthcoming book.


Australian News.com. au website reports that Willis's plan to continue working as long as he was able will be detailed in Emma Heming Willis's upcoming book – one she calls “not a memoir but under the category of self-help” – The Unexpected Journey, due for release in September.


	The Die Hard star announced in February 2023 that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. He had retreated from the spotlight a year earlier due to his deteriorating health.

	However, according to news.com.au, Heming Willis's book will reveal that her action hero husband had found ways to continue to work on films such as Assassin (2023) and the Detective Knight series (2022-23), having directors reduce his dialogue and employing a trusted friend to feed him lines through an earpiece.


	The website adds that the actor's deterioration wasn't immediately apparently either on set or on screen, because Willis had always had a slow speech pattern, after having a stutter as a child – something he once told interviewer Michael Parkinson he was able to put to good effect:


	“It's how I got my sense of humour, because I realised, yeah I stutter, but I could make people laugh by doing stupid stuff.”


Heming Willis shared on Instagram that she had written the book to help others facing her husband's condition, as well as their families.

	











	She said: “I really wrote the book that I wish someone had handed me the day we got our diagnosis with no hope, no direction … not much. Today life looks different for me and our family because I was able to put support into place.”


	As well as his successful turns in the Die Hard franchise, Willis has enjoyed a string of hit films including Look Who's Talking, The Sixth Sense and Death Becomes Her. He had his breakthrough success in early 1980s TV series Moonlighting, co-starring with Cybil Shepherd as private detectives David Addison and Maddie Hayes.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	For the second time in just over a week, Sean “Diddy” Combs wants the judge in his sex-trafficking case to declare a mistrial and kick the whole sordid matter to the curb. 


	Citing “prosecutorial misconduct,” defense attorney Alexandra Shapiro wrote to Judge Arun Subramanian today to insist this case, which could see Combs behind bars for the rest of his life if found guilty,  should go no further. 


	“In this trial the government has presented testimony that it knew or should have known was materially false related to its allegation that Mr. Combs dangled Bryana Bongolan from the balcony of Cassie Ventura's apartment in September 2016,” Shapiro's correspondence stated with references to Bongoloan's height in relation to the Bad Boy Records founder and to apparent inconsistencies in the testimony this past week by the good friend  of Cassie Ventura. “Accordingly, to avoid an unfair conviction in this case the Court should grant a mistrial.”

	The 55-year-old Combs was arrested in September 2024 in a New York hotel lobby by a phalanx of police and federal officials on federal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and more. From Combs' crying ex-girlfriend “Jane” and her tales of abuse, and before that Ventura's pal Bongolan, who had told the court Wednesday that Combs had dangled her off a 17th-story balcony on September 26, 2016, the panel of eight men and four women in the courtroom has heard explicit and sometimes heartrending testimony about rapes, emotional and physical violence. They also listening, sometimes in obvious discomfort to tales of blackmail, narcotics being moved across statelines and an apparent arson attempt to Kid Cudi's car. 












Additionally, perhaps most damning, the jurors heard of a 2018 rape and the years of filmed drug-juiced “freak-offs” from the then very pregnant “Me & U” singer Ventura, male escorts,  and Comb's ex-personal assistant “Mia,” who also alleged Diddy repeatedly raped her. 


	Unlike the last mistrial request of May 28 in the Diddy case, which was made in the lower Manhattan courtroom where the May 12 starting trial is taking place, Judge Subramanian has not issued a quick order on the latest motion. Contacted by Deadline today, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment on the latest mistrial move. 


	Casting almost all of Bongolan's testimony, and by implication, the government's position in disrepute, defense attorney's Shapiro's somewhat redacted four-page letter also recommended the prosecution own up to what it supposedly knows. 


	“The government knew or should have known this testimony was perjured, and that Ms. Bongolan could not possibly have been injured by Mr. Combs on a Los Angeles balcony in the early morning hours of September 26, or even the day before that,” the Shapiro Arato Bach LLP partner wrote 


	“The government has long known that Mr. Combs was on the East Coast in late September, and specifically at around the time of this alleged incident,” Shapiro added with footnotes mocking what a simple Google search would tell the feds, with a name drop of the pardon considering current POTUS. “The government knew that he had stayed at Trump Hotel in New York City between September 24-29, 2016. In fact, the government had marked as GX7Y111 the records of this hotel stay, which are now in evidence. And it has had other evidence in its possession for some time showing Mr. Combs's travel schedule and proving that he was on the East Coast when it told the jury he dangled Ms. Bongolan over a balcony in front of Ms. Ventura.”


	A link to a New Jersey website's September 26 review of Diddy's show in Newark on September 25 that the defense provides in their letter brought up the “Puff Daddy's Bad Boy reunion tour ignites Newark, despite B.I.G. hole” article. 


	Not content to let the Bongolan matter make their case for mistrial, the defense spend the last pages of the letter rehashing their previous unsuccessful mistrial effort. Specifically, on the matter of some destroyed fingerprints of Kid Cudi a.k.a. Scott Mescudi from 2012,  they claim “the government's motive all along must have been to suggest that Mr. Combs had corrupt influence over the LA authorities.” Putting the pretty powerful testimony of Combs' former aide “Mia” under the microscope over an incident where some LAPD officers let the personal assistant off the hook from driving infractions because she revealed she worked for Diddy, the letter gets very specific. “In other words, the subsequent questioning of Mia, even if itself permissible, further corroborates that the government's real purpose in its questioning of the fire inspector, Lance Jiminez, was to improperly suggest that Mr. Combs corruptly caused the destruction of the fingerprints.”


	At the tail end of a week that saw the judge reprimand Combs for interacting with the jury and threatening to toss him out of the courtroom for his own trial, today's letter ends: “This constitutes another instance of prosecutorial misconduct. Accordingly, the Court should grant a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct.”

	











	Scheduled to pick up on June 9 for another week, the trial is set to run from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. ET day-in, day-out. With more testimony from accuser “Jane” expected on Monday and maybe Tuesday, the trial will likely see the prosecution rest its case and the defense will pick up the baton.

Scott Pelley said that a settlement of Donald Trump‘s lawsuit would be “very damaging” to the reputation CBS and Paramount, while the 60 Minutes correspondent also defended a recent commencement speech where he warned of the threats to freedom of speech.


	Appearing on CNN‘s post show following the live telecast of Good Night, And Good Luck, Pelley sat down down fellow 60 Minutes correspondent and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper.


	“If there is a settlement, and as part of a settlement, there's an apology, how damaging is that to CBS?”

	“It will be very damaging to CBS, to Paramount, to the reputation of those companies,” Pelley said. “I think many of the law firms that made deals with the White House are at this very moment regretting it. That doesn't look like their finest hour.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	As CBS-parent Paramount Global seeks Trump administration approval of its merger with Skydance, company lawyers have been in talks to settle the president's lawsuit against the network. Trump sued CBS for $20 billion over the way that a 60 Minutes edited an October interview with Kamala Harris. The lawsuit, filed under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a law typically invoked for false advertising claims, has been deemed baseless by a number of legal observers.


	Cooper called the situation “very strange.”


	“You really wish the company was behind you 100%, right?” Pelley said. “You really wish the top echelons of the company would come out publicly and say, ‘60 Minutes, for example, is a crown jewel of American journalism, and we stand by it 100%. I haven't heard that.”


	“On the other hand, my work is getting on the air, and I have not had anyone outside 60 Minutes put their thumb on scale and say, ‘You can't say that. You should say this. You have to edit the story this way. You should interview this person.' None of that has happened. So I while I would like to have that public backing, maybe the more important thing is the work is still getting on the air.”

	











	Still, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, Bill Owens, resigned in April, concluding that he no longer had the ability to make independent decisions about the show. The newsmagazine has in the past enjoyed freedom from corporate interference.


	Pelley said, “Bill's decision to resign may not have been much of a decision for him, because he was always the first person to defend the independence of 60 Minutes. Bill didn't work for Paramount. Bill worked for our viewers, and he felt very keenly about that, and so I'm not sure Bill had any choice once the corporation began to meddle in Bill's decisions about the editorial content, or just place pressure in that area. Bill felt he didn't have the independence that honest journalism requires.”


	During CNN's post-performance coverage of Good Night, And Good Luck, Cooper also talked to a panel that included Kara Swisher, Connie Chung, Abby Phillip and Bret Stephens, with comparisons made to the situation that legendary CBS News journalist Edward R. Murrow faced as he took on Joe McCarthy, to today, as journalists are under attack by Trump and his allies.


	In their interview, Cooper asked Pelley how he thinks that Murrow would have handled the current situation at the network. 


	Pelley noted that Murrow's producer, Fred Friendly, went on to become president of CBS News and eventually quit in principle over a disagreement about coverage of the Vietnam War. 


	“I wonder if Ed might have done the same thing, given our present situation,” he said. “He would probably be waiting to see how this lawsuit with the president works out, and how the Paramount corporation deals with that and whether it fights. I think that would mean everything to Ed, and I also know where he would be on that question. It would be for fighting.”


	Pelley also addressed a commencement speech he gave to Wake Forest University last month, Speaking to Wake Forest University graduates, Pelley said that “our sacred rule of law is under attack. Journalism is under attack. Universities are under attack. Freedom of speech is under attack. An insidious fear is reaching through our schools, our businesses, our homes and into our private thoughts. The fear to speak. In America?”


	MAGA commentators blasted Pelley for the comments.


	Pelley, though, said that he “felt very strongly that this was something that needed to be said. It did not strike me that this would impact people's thought of me as a journalist, because part of that speech is a speech about freedom of speech. That should be non-controversial.”


	He said that “there was a little bit of hysteria among some about this speech. And I simply ask you, what does it say about our country when there's hysteria about a speech that is about freedom of speech?”


	Pelley said that what has surprised him the most about his reporting on the Trump administration is “how pervasive the fear is.” He said that it is more difficult to get people to talk about Trump on camera.


	“They do not want to stick their head up over the foxhole,” Pelley said. “And that is part of what the Wake Forest speech was all about, that we must not be in fear. This is exactly what Ed Murrow was saying in that editorial at the end of the McCarthy broadcast. We much not walk in fear of one another. We are not descended from fearful people.”


	Pelley said that he believe that the U.S. is moving in a “similar direction” as the McCarthy era. “People are silencing themselves for fear the government will retaliate against them, and that's not the America we all love.”

Olivia Rodrigo threw it back to the '80s this weekend to jam out with a new wave legend.


	During her Saturday performance at Governors Ball in New York City, the 3x Grammy winner was joined onstage by Talking Heads frontman David Byrne for a surprise performance of the band's 1983 single ‘Burning Down the House' for the crowd at Flushing Meadows—Corona Park.


	The British rocker matched Rodrigo's red performance look in a pair of matching overalls as they playfully re-enacted the choreography to the song.

	Byrne's surprise appearance comes after the Talking Heads were introduced to a new generation of fans with A24‘s 40th anniversary re-release of their 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, which grossed more than $5 million domestically after a limited run in 2023.

	Avant garde filmmaker Lars von Trier is no stranger to controversy, and Bryce Dallas Howard has her own story to share regarding the polarizing filmmaker who, among other instances, has courted rebuke due to allegations of sexual harassment by Björk and John C. Reilly's exit from film Manderlay over the killing of an animal.


	In a new interview with The Times U.K. to promote the soon-to-be-released Deep Cover on Prime Video, Howard discussed her background growing up on sets due to her father Ron Howard‘s rich directing and acting career. One such anecdote that was perhaps less glamorous was an interaction with the Melancholia director on the set of Manderlay, a credit which came early on in the Jurassic World star's career.

	Upon arriving to the set of the Danish director's film, she remembered “he started insulting me: ‘Your father's a terrible filmmaker.' I went, ‘Lars, what are you trying to see?' and he said, ‘Your angry face. I don't know what it looks like.'” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Then, von Trier threw a glass of water in her face, “so I threw a glass of water in his face. He goes, ‘Why did you do that?' and got up and left. That was my introduction to the Lars von Trier experience, but it wasn't like I went to my room and cried or anything. I was sort of delighted by it,” she said.


	Von Trier, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 2022 and was admitted to a care center in February 2025, has long been regarded as a problematic figure, whether for making jokes about sympathizing with Nazis due to his German roots or for his treatment of actresses and ways of depicting women on screen.

	











	In 2005's Manderlay, which also stars Willem Dafoe and Danny Glover, a woman and her father discover a plantation in rural Alabama circa the 1930s that is still operating under the conditions of slavery. The film, a sequel to 2003's Dogville led by Nicole Kidman, traces her conviction to facilitate the freedom of the enslaved people.

Maks Chmerkovskiy recently revealed that money impacted his “Dancing With the Stars” performances. The former “DWTS” pro shared how the paychecks and the need to get to the show's semifinals fueled his competitive behavior.

A post shared by Maksim Chmerkovskiy (@maksimc)

In a June 2025 interview with Us Weekly, Chmerkovskiy gave some insight into the biggest motivation for him in the “Dancing With the Stars” competition — money.

“There's definite ways to influence you to want to do your best and stay on and so I think that somebody like me, for example, that backfires,” he said.

The former “DWTS” pro continued, “Sometimes that competitiveness kicks in because on top of it, if I don't keep making it week after week, I don't get paid. And so now my time here becomes, like, ‘Now I'm wasting time.'”

Chmerkovskiy shared that making it to the semifinals meant he would get a “paycheck all 10 weeks.”

During his 15 seasons on “DWTS,” Chmerkovskiy made it to the finals five times and won season 18 with partner Meryl Davis.

Of his only win, he shared, “I don't think I had a bonus. Maybe I didn't. I dunno.” “The thing you know is how busy you are, how completely engulfed in the show you are. Especially at that time, I was under so much pressure to, like, ‘Oh, you have to win.'”

He called Meryl “an incredible partner,” adding, “And I think I was also at that time already ready to go all the way in that type of partnership.”

Chmerkovskiy also shared that the current pros' contracts have likely “evolved” from when he was on the show.

“I don't think [that's] the case anymore. I think there are some guarantees,” he said.

The former “DWTS” pro noted that he “had some incredible partnerships with people who were a certain type.”

He explained, “Honestly, it's whatever they want. They want to push themselves. They want to have a great time. They want to be athletically inclined. They want it to be more of a showmanship. It's whatever you want, but I just want you to have a fantastic time.”

A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)

Will Chmerkovskiy return to “Dancing With the Stars?

He hasn't ruled it out.

“I think today I would come back.  It doesn't matter whether it's to judge or to dance, I think it's just fun to even be in this situation,” he said.

Chmerkovskiy noted, “Who would've thought there were moments in talk about reminiscing. There were moments in my journey with ‘Dancing With the Stars' that I've never thought that 20 years later I will be as part of it as I was.”

As two of Hallmark Channel's most beloved leading men, actors Andrew Walker and Kristoffer Polaha are known for their onscreen romantic gestures. But on June 7, 2025, the two friends — who cruised together with fans in January 2024 — celebrated their real-life love stories, realizing that they share the same wedding anniversary with their wives. 

Both men paid tribute to their spouses in touching Instagram posts on June 7. Polaha marked 22 years with his wife, Julianne Morris, and Walker celebrated 13 years with his wife, Cassandra Troy. 

Walker commented on Polaha's post, “We've got the same anniversary brother! Happy Anniversary you two. ❤️” and Polaha replied, ” happy anniversary to you two lovebirds as well! Love you guys!!!”

A post shared by kristoffer polaha (@polahaha)

Polaha, who has starred in more than a dozen Hallmark romances, honored his real-life life story in his tribute to his wife, sharing a photo from their wedding and writing, “22 years ago today, in a little church on a rainy day in Florida, this girl said ‘I do,' I said it right back, and God used her to change the course of my life forever. Better in every single way.”

He continued, “I love you, Julianne, with every breath I take and every beat of my heart. You are the love of my life. Happy anniversary, baby. Here's to 50 more. Thank you for this adventure that we get to call our life together.” 

In 2021, Polaha told Highbrow Magazine that he met Morris while he was in Los Angeles, working on a TV pilot and it was “love at first sight.” Polaha said he noticed her right away when he walked into a Mexican restaurant, Casa Vega. At the time, Morris was an actress on “Days of Our Lives,” where she played Greta Von Amberg from 1998 to 2002, per IMDb. 

“She was surrounded by this whole circle of dudes, and it was like time stood still for a second,” Polaha told Highbrow. “Then, we all sat down at this table and it was a table that was kind of small, but she got squished in between two guys that she already knew. So, she orchestrated a move to another table, and she was at the end. I had a choice. I could sit next to some guy or I could sit next to her. I sat next to her and we talked. We talked the whole night.” 

The two spent quality time together before he flew back to New York, and then had “a really beautiful, innocent two-year courtship where we just took our time to get to know each other,” he told the outlet. 

He continued, “It was in that time where I was like, ‘I don't think that my career is going to amount to anything unless I have someone to share it with.' And I loved meeting Julianne when I did because I knew she wasn't marrying me for my money or my fame or anything other than the fact that she just loved me.”

Polaha and Morris share three sons — aspiring singer-songwriter Caleb, 20, aspiring filmmaker Micah, 19, and soon-to-be high school freshman Jude, 14. 

A post shared by Andrew Walker (@awalkk35)

Walker, meanwhile, posted a video montage of his wife out in nature at their temporary home in Vancouver, where he's been shooting a new Hallmark movie. 

The couple loves exploring nature with their sons — West, who's almost 10, and five-year-old Wolf — and have relished living on the water and near a bird sanctuary, regularly delighting in seeing bald eagles and other winged wonders on their property. 

In his post, Walker wrote, “13 years married ❤️ Happy anniversary @casstroywalker … 21 years ago, this bird woman walked into my life…Your love for life, friendship and the joy you bring to every moment is a gift I'll never not cherish. Thank you for sharing me with the birds. 😘” 

Before pursuing acting, Walker, who grew up in Vancouver, earned a full football scholarship to Boston College, per TV Guide, but suffered a career-ending ACL injury during a routine practice drill. 

The “Curious Caterer” star headed to Los Angeles to pursue acting, but met Troy in 2004 during a trip home, according to People. After she finished college, Troy moved from Montreal to Los Angeles in 2006 to live with Walker, the outlet reported, and they eventually eloped in 2012. 

On May 3, Walker also paid tribute to his wife on her birthday, writing in a post, “You're the heart of our family, the most incredible mom, and partner I never stop being grateful for. Your energy lifts us, your love grounds us, and every adventure is better because of you.”

Country star Jelly Roll opens up about touring with Post Malone and he was not holding back as he poured his heart into an Instagram post.

Jelly Roll has been on the road with Malone on the “Big Ass Stadium Tour”. On June 5, he shared a sweet message on Instagram.

A post shared by Jelly Roll (@jellyroll615)

“Dear Austin, I say this on stage in some way every night, but man, being on this tour with you has been unreal,” the caption reads. “I have never had more fun in my life. The energy of the people is incredible. You can feel the love reverberate around the stadium every night. And that's a testament to the spirit you embody and what you've done. I am honored to be opening up for you every night, I'm honored to call you brother and blessed to watch you perform every night. The genuine gratitude you have for everything is infectious. The world is yours young man, keep kicking its ass for the rest of us. You are making all your fellow outcasts and losers proud Posty. Thank you the opportunity, I don't take it for granted so I laugh, dance and sing from the soul every night.”

Fans took to the comments section to share their support for the singers.

“Can ya'll just tour every year together please. When you guys were in Toronto it was insane 🔥,” one fan commented.

“One of the best shows I've ever been to, because you put your heart and souls into it,” another fan commented, “and you are genuine good men who are humble and just work your… [butts] off for your fans. Truly so honored to have attended!”

The singers' next stop is the Magic City. The “Big Ass Stadium Tour” is taking over the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on June 8. The stadium is the home field for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League and has welcomed world-renowned artists such as Bad Bunny, Taylor Swift and Shakira.

The country stars have a collaboration, “Losers”, on Malone's album and fans have shown their love for the track.

“This song serves as an anthem for individuals who feel like outsiders or underdogs,” one fan shared, “it celebrates those labeled as ‘losers,' highlighting their resilience and sense of community. The lyrics invite people who feel they don't fit in to find solace and camaraderie. It expresses their empathy towards people who often struggle and find themselves unworthy and lonely for never being the ‘main guy', picture-perfect people, etc. It also tells them that there's at least somewhere for them to have people understand their feelings. Beautiful.”

Longtime Hallmark star Jodie Sweetin is known for her lighthearted roles as a beloved “Full House” alum and more than a dozen rom-coms and cozy mysteries. But on June 21, 2025, Sweetin will delve into a much more serious starring role, in Lifetime's “Dateless to Dangerous: My Son's Secret Life.”

In an interview published on June 7, Sweetin told People, “I believe it will be an interesting thing for people to see me do something a little different — not one joke in it.” 

Sweetin told People that her new movie is “about the radicalization of young men online right now.” According to a Lifetime press release, she plays the mom of teen siblings Miles and Haley, played by Alexander Elliot and Nikki Roumel, per Lifetime. 

Lifetime's logline for the movie says Sweetin's character, Noelle, who's newly separated, “works tirelessly to provide for her family while adjusting to their new reality. In an effort to bond with her brother, Haley coaches Miles through his romantic pursuits, only for him to face public humiliation.” 

“As sibling tensions rise,” the synopsis continues, “Noelle begins to notice troubling changes in her son – anger, isolation, and hostility toward her, Haley and friends at school. After yet another crushing rejection, Miles spirals into the toxic world of incels—a dark and shadowy online underworld that fuels his growing resentment. As he slips further into darkness, Noelle and Hayley must race against time to save him, desperate to reach him before he's consumed completely.”

Sweetin, who has two teen daughters — Beatrix, 14, and Zoie, 17 — called her dramatic role “a fun opportunity” and told People, “When I read the script, I was like, ‘Oh, this is for real, for real.' So, yeah … it's pretty intense.” 

Lifetime's “Dateless to Dangerous” premieres on June 21 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. 

A post shared by Hallmark Channel (@hallmarkchannel)

Although not quite as intense as her latest Lifetime role, Sweetin has delved into more serious subject matter in her most recent Hallmark movies, starring as Jane Da Silva in “The Jane Mysteries” franchise opposite Stephen Huszar. 

The first movie, “The Jane Mysteries: Inheritance Lost,” premiered on Hallmark Mystery in 2023, introducing Hallmark fans to her new character — a singer who inherited her family's non-profit detective agency. Huszar plays Detective John Cameron, who winds up helping as Sweetin's character dives into unsolved mysteries. 

Three more “Jane Mysteries” premiered on Hallmark+ in 2024 and debuted on Hallmark Channel in the spring of 2025. In October, Sweetin told First For Women that one of the things she loves about her character  “is that she goes back and fights for people that didn't have a voice or the resources and got overlooked.”

It's not clear if additional mysteries will be added to the franchise. The first four “Jane Mysteries” are available to stream on Hallmark+.

The “McConaissance” is officially back. Apple Original Films has dropped the teaser trailer for Matthew McConaughey's upcoming action drama “The Lost Bus,” a story is inspired by real events and helmed by the Oscar-nominated “United 93” director Paul Greengrass.

While no exact release date has been announced, “The Lost Bus” will hit select theaters and stream on Apple TV+ this fall. In a release, Apple TV+ described the movie as a “white-knuckle ride through one of America's deadliest wildfires.” McConaughey stars as a school bus driver alongside America Ferrera as a teacher. The pair teams up “to save 22 children from the terrifying inferno.”

Greengrass — who co-wrote the story with Brad Ingelsby — called “The Lost Bus” a tale of “quiet heroism,” adding that he was “honored to have been entrusted with the story.” It is based on Lizzie Johnson's book “Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire” and is produced by Inglesby and Gregory Goodman. Jason Blumhouse for Blumhouse Productions is on board, too, as a producer, as is Comet Pictures' Jamie Lee Curtis, who took the production to Blumhouse after hearing Johnson speak on NPR. Johnson also serves as an executive producer.

 










McConaughey took a six-year break from live-action roles, returning with a role in “The Rivals of Amziah King,” which premiered in March at SXSW. That part, he told Variety, helped him rekindle his love for acting — and through it he also rediscovered how his profession can be a “vacation” from his personal life.

“I remembered a couple of things: One, how much I truly enjoy performing. Two, I remembered, ‘hey, McConaughey, you're pretty damn good at this,'” he said. “And three, I remembered that acting is a vacation for me, and what I mean by vacation is that when I'm performing, it's my singular focus. When I walk out the door in the morning, my wife says, ‘Go kick some ass. I got the kiddos. We're good.' That's vacation. Because I'm not multitasking. I'm not compartmentalizing. I'm fully focused on finding the truth of my character.”

The sci-fi TV show Stranger Things was successfully pitched with a remix. Its creators, the Duffer Brothers, cobbled together a fake trailer featuring clips from Steven Spielberg's E.T. with its soundtrack replaced by the menacing synths of horror king John Carpenter. The effect was, according to Matt Duffer, “really fucking cool.” That integration of the vaguely familiar with the eerily sinister would power the show like it did for 2011 pastiche film Drive, itself working like Tangerine Dream put over Death Wish II.

Together, they served as a rebuttal to 30 years of the received wisdom of “'80s nostalgia,” the gags about asymmetrical haircuts and Rubik's Cubes that permeated slop like The Wedding Singer and The Goldbergs. It was a way of communicating through vibes instead of hack references, a Proustian madeleine for survivors of an America scarred by nuclear anxiety, exploding space shuttles, Satanic panic, Chinese stars, lawn darts, and Punky Brewster's friend getting trapped in the fridge. Do you want new wave or do you want the truth?

The Zoltar machine that predicted all of this was a 125-second YouTube clip of the obscure 1983 arcade game Laser Grand Prix soundtracked by a loop from Chris de Burgh's saccharine 1986 ballad “The Lady in Red.” Uploaded in the summer of 2009 and currently standing at 4.3 million views, the video—titled “Nobody Here” after its cycling, haunting refrain—would serve as something like an a-ha moment for people who craved something deeper than A-ha references, a big bang for a generation of musicians attempting to live on the edge of memory and imagination.

“Nobody Here” would reappear as the untitled 12th track on Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1, a profoundly inauspicious release—put out on a cassette, limited to a mere 100 copies, no text on the shell, no text on the back of the J-card. The artwork, borrowed from the box art of the tranquil Sega Genesis game Ecco the Dolphin, was close-cropped to feature a frowning shark instead of the playful cetacean. It would become the most influential cassette tape of the 21st century.

Released in 2010, Eccojams was a collection of 15 remixes all with the same concept: the dross of radio's past, slowed down, echoed, and run through some dream-logic computer effects. Songs both familiar and unfamiliar transmogrified into a sleep paralysis slurry of half-remembered traumas. Putting Toto's “Africa” in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City conjured the cool '80s of Don Johnson blazers, neon lights, and DeLorean doors. Putting Toto's “Africa” in the Eccojams funhouse conjures the lived '80s of wainscotted hallways, dust-caked mini blinds, station wagon interiors yellowed from cigarette smoke, lawns speckled with white dog shit and cathode ray TVs that play “The Star-Spangled Banner” at 4 a.m.

Chuck Person was not a real person (though the actual Chuck Person, the 1987 NBA Rookie of the Year, was naturally, a piece of '80s ephemera). “Chuck Person” was Daniel Lopatin, better known as Oneohtrix Point Never, a Brooklyn drone merchant who had spent the previous three years processing and reconstructing the abstract dreamscapes he culled from his Roland Juno-60. He was at the vanguard of the American noise scene in the hazy years when it retreated from feedback-soaked harshness into an unkanny kosmische. Alongside artists like Emeralds, Yellow Swans, Skaters, and Carlos Giffoni, noise music was starting to sound less like Texas Chain Saw Massacre and more like Tarkovsky's Stalker—and Lopatin was quietly training to become the house DJ for the “Zone.”

“[T]he entire point of Eccojams was that it was a DIY practice that didn't involve any specialized music tech knowledge,” Lopatin said in a Reddit AMA, “and for me it was a direct way of dealing with audio in a mutable, philosophical way that had very little to do with music and everything to do with feelings.” Like rope making or basket weaving, the Eccojam is a folk art requiring very little in the way of equipment or natural ability. He started doing it as a way to amuse himself at his job at a Boston textbook publisher. “I was nothing,” he said about the gig. “I was a piece of furniture. I could just feel the life draining out of me.” In his boredom, Lopatin ripped songs and videos from YouTube, slowing them to narcoleptic speeds using GoldWave and editing little films in Windows Movie Maker.

The first taste of Lopatin spelunking the collective unconscious was a 2009 DVD-R leadingly titled Memory Vague, a 33-minute mash-up of his music set to evocative detritus: '80s commercials for VCRs, golf balls, and Russian cassette players; creepy video logos; primordial video art and computer animations; obscure 1980 TV movie The Arrival; trippy 1985 new age curio Pilot Video Presents California Images: Hi-Fi for the Eyes and more. It included the first two released Eccojams—both posted to the YouTube page “sunsetcorp” that summer. “Angel” was a skipping, pitch-tweaked, highly phased reimagining of Fleetwood Mac's 1982 album track “Only Over You.” The aforementioned “Nobody Here” would become the “Blitzkrieg Bop” of phantasmal fuzzies.

Of course, Lopatin did not invent slowing down music to discover its hidden pleasures. Belgium's hedonistic “popcorn” clubs of the '70s featured popular American soul 45s spun at a sensuous 33 1/3. Perennial hip-hop breaks like the Winstons' “Amen Brother” and ESG's “UFO” were pitched down substantially when they appeared on the sampling bedrock compilations Ultimate Breaks and Beats. Pioneers like Ft. Lauderdale's Jam Pony Express and Houston's DJ Screw made hundreds of molasses-speed DJ mixes ideal for slow-motion crawls on Southern highways. Slowed-down cumbia records, renamed cumbia rebajada, were popularized by sonideros around Monterrey, Mexico in the '90s. English turntable artist Philip Jeck culled sooty fogs of dubby melancholy from crackling thrift-store vinyl that crawled along at a snail's pace. Lopatin himself credits DJ Screw and “plunderphonics” outlaw John Oswald for the genesis of the Eccojam. You can hear the bones of the Eccojam in Oswald pieces like the frenetic Madonna montage “madmod” and the stuttering Michael Jackson reconstruction “dab,” the latter released before the '80s had even concluded.

However, it was Lopatin's Eccojams that would strike a singular nerve in an era where it seemed like the bones of “the '80s” had been picked clean. Xennials like Lopatin had already lived through the emergence of quirky new-wave replicas, which had been around since the '90s. In the 2000s, every '80s subculture was given a light coat of paint and rebranded: Post-punk became “Brooklyn dance-punk,” obscure hip-hop songs became “random-rap mixtapes,” electro became “electroclash.” Nostalgia was the new normal and Eccojams arrived roughly concurrent with other critically overdissected microgenres all supposedly evoking the childhood of an era: UK “hauntology” (the eerie '70s), synthwave (the decadent '80s), hypnogogic pop (the wistful '80s) and chillwave (the blissful '90s). Everyone was feeling it all around, but Lopatin was the closest to actually touching it.

Unlike the music of, say, Ariel Pink or Washed Out, Eccojams are inextricable from their source material. Nearly 70 percent of the material on Eccojams Vol. 1 is constructed from actual music from the actual '80s: past-their-prime boomers going soft rock, R&B softies navigating the production techniques of quiet storm era, the adult contemporary ballads you'd hear at the grocery store. Most of the remaining 30 percent—including bits of a Byrds album track, Radio Disney balladeer JoJo, Belgian trance act Ian Van Dahl and Michael Jackson's mostly forgotten '90s remix album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix—had their own ephemeral appeal.

Lopatin's real feat with Eccojams is not his ethereal production techniques, but his curation. The crates had been dug, the reissues reissued, so Lopatin found the dollar bin records that hadn't been looted. And he didn't even have to leave YouTube to get them. His choices were unorthodox but prescient. Fleetwood Mac (“A2,” “B2”) would begin a new life as a Zoomer fave and meme soundtrack after a Glee episode that aired in 2011. Kate Bush (“B1”) would re-enter the Billboard singles chart at No. 4 after “Running Up That Hill” was used in a Stranger Things episode. Womack & Womack (“B7”), Alexander O'Neal (“A8”) and Teddy Pendergrass (“B2”) would all receive critical reappraisal once R&B became the new indie rock. Toto's “Africa” (”A1”) had an absolutely insufferable second life that's not worth going into here.

As a selector, Lopatin pillages these songs for their most forlorn and cryptic moments, exploding their hidden melancholia: “Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you,” “It doesn't matter anyway, you know it's just too little too late,” “I know that door that shuts just before.” “The key,” said Lopatin, “is if everyone can do it, then each piece reveals something about what its producer likes about it. So I'm always searching for the juiciest moment in a pop track to sample...and get into this hypnotic state with it.” Take the 1978 smash “Baker Street” by Gerry Rafferty. Director David Fincher jumps right to that iconic sax line to score a haunting staredown in 2007's Zodiac. Lopatin finds a sour lyrical shard of despondency, forcing Rafferty to repeat over and over again in what sounds like an opiate-saturated daze, “Another year and then you'd be happy.”

The album briefly created a small army of Eccojammers, most notably Laserdisc Visions and New Dreams Ltd., both pseudonyms of Portland-based producer Vektroid. However, this would quickly metastasize into “vaporwave,” a slowpoke collage-art music that plundered the '80s and '90s for R&B, smooth jazz, Japanese pop, muzak, video games, and Microsoft sound effects. Though many will cite chillwave or hypnogogic pop as the birth of too-online music, vaporwave was truly the first internet microgenre, a self-sufficient community ignored by any critical establishment larger than e-zines and vloggers. The vaporwave community instead blossomed in subreddits and Last.fm scrobbles, serving as the test kitchen for the next 15 years of weird little microscenes, from the fleeting (“seapunk,” “mallsoft,” “dariacore”) to the tectonic (the Haunted Mound/Bladee/TeamSESH axis of white trap that's breaking containment after nearly a decade in the internet's margins).

After Eccojams, the dustiest, most overlooked corners of Goodwill were rethought and re-appreciated. Drafthouse Films exhumed kitschy '80s genre films like the 1981 3D Western Comin' at Ya! and the 1987 karate musical Miami Connection. Reissue label Light in the Attic moved from Betty Davis and Rodríguez to successfully recontextualizing soft rock, adult contemporary, new age cassettes, and Japanese AOR. The “uncanny '80s” was explored in films like weirdo comedy Brigsby Bear, psychedelic horror Mandy, and nü-slasher MaXXXine. The “uncanny '90s” is next at bat with films like Skinamarink and I Saw the TV Glow. The folk tradition of the Eccojam lives on nearly unrecognizably in YouTube videos called “slowed + reverb,” where slowpoke versions of Hindi love songs get views in the tens of millions.

Critics and theorists mostly paint Eccojams and vaporwave as a critique of the market, with Simon Reynolds saying it reveals “the buried utopianism within capitalist commodities” in his essential 2011 nostalgia screed Retromania. That reading, while popular, fails to see the forest for the pixelated palm trees. “I think a lot of those Eccojams are just cathartic for me,” said Lopatin. “I make them when I hear something in pop music, and I'm just like, ‘Fuck, I just wanna hear that over and over.'” An Eccojam is a celebration of the ineffable. Like ASMR, horror movies, cat videos, rage bait, or pornography, it's a functional medium painstakingly calibrated to evoke a specific sensation. An Eccojam or a vaporwave song gives a listener a sense of placelessness, with the knowledge that “placelessness” is still an interesting place you want to visit.

“The sublime is located in all times and across all brows at once,” Lopatin told The Wire, railing against the “timbral fascism” that won't let synth musicians use chorus effects without seeming cheesy. With Eccojams, Lopatin uses the bit-compressed technology of the present to extract the sublime from the trash heap of the past, and provides instructions on how to access it in the future. Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you.

Jared Leto has “expressly denied” the allegations of sexual misconduct toward women, including minors, in a new report.


	Nine women, including some who were then underage when they first encountered the actor and 30 Seconds to Mars singer, spoke to Air Mail about their experiences with Leto. 


	One unnamed woman said she entered into a texting relationship when she was underage — “Do any of the little boys you hang out with fuck you?” she said Leto texted her — and that that things turned physical when she became 18. On one visit to his home, Leto “suddenly pulled his penis out and started masturbating. Then he walked over, grabbed my hand, and put it on him. He leaned in and said, ‘I want you to spit on it,'” the woman claimed.


	Model Laura La Rue told Air Mail that she first met Leto in 2008 when she was 16 — he was 36 at the time — and, despite knowing her age, still asked for her number. A year later, when she was 17, she'd begin visiting Leto's home, and on one occasion, “He just walked out, dick out, like it was normal… I thought maybe this was just what adult men do.” 

	











	(“Their communications contain nothing sexual or inappropriate and Ms. La Rue later applied to work as Mr. Leto's personal assistant, further underscoring the absence of anything inappropriate in any of their interactions” Leto's rep told Air Mail of La Rue's allegations; La Rue denied applying to work as Leto's personal assistant.)

	Rumors of Leto's impropriety have long been whispered about, with Air Mail resurfacing social media allegations made by women including a Los Angeles DJ named Allie Teilz, who in 2012 wrote on Facebook, “Youre [sic] not really in L.A. until Jared Leto tries to force himself on you backstage… In a kilt. And a snow hat,” and later wrote, “I was assaulted and traumatized by this creep when I was 17. He knew my age and didn't care. What he did was predatory, terrifying and unacceptable.” (Director James Gunn and actor Dylan Crouse have also openly accused Leto of misbehavior on social media.)

	











	In response to the Air Mail report, a rep for the actor said, “All of the allegations are expressly denied.”

	The White House announced Saturday night that President Donald Trump is deploying 2,000 National Guard troops amid protests to immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles. Trump issued a memorandum federalizing National Guard units for 60 days. 


	“To the extent that protests or acts of violence directly inhibit the execution of the laws, they constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States,” Trump said in the memo, adding that these National Guard units will “temporarily protect ICE and other United States government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.”


	The memo suggests Trump, via his Secretary Pete Hegseth, could choose to additionally deploy members of the “regular Armed Forces as necessary to augment and support the protection of federal functions and property in any number determined appropriate in his discretion.”

	











	In a post on X on Saturday evening, Hegseth wrote, “The violent mob assaults on ICE and Federal Law Enforcement are designed to prevent the removal of Criminal Illegal Aliens from our soil; a dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels (aka Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and a huge NATIONAL SECURITY RISK.” 


	He added: “Under President Trump, violence & destruction against federal agents & federal facilities will NOT be tolerated. It's COMMON SENSE.” Hegseth said that the Department of Defense is mobilizing “immediately.” “And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert,” he concluded.

	











	Trump's “Border Czar” Tom Homan first announced just hours before the official White House statement that the administration would send in the National Guard on Saturday evening to quell protests in the Los Angeles area.

	“This is about enforcing the law, and again, we're not going to apologize for doing it,” Homan said on Fox News. He continued: “We're already ahead of the game. We were already mobilizing. We're gonna bring National Guard in tonight. We're gonna continue doing our job. We're gonna push back on these people, and we're gonna [enforce] the law.”


	On Saturday night, following Homan's on-camera remarks, both national Democratic and Republican figures were scrambling to figure out if he was just mouthing off, or if the federal troops were actually on their way, or just … what the hell was going on.


	Two Trump administration officials say they learned about the alleged National Guard plans from journalists such as Rolling Stone's who had reached out to them on Saturday evening, asking for clarification. 


	White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt subsequently emailed out a statement Saturday evening announcing that “President Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester” in Los Angeles. 


	California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted on BlueSky an hour earlier, announcing Trump's plans to “take over the California National Guard and deploy 2,000 soldiers,” calling the move “inflammatory” and saying it would “only escalate tensions.”


	He added, “LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice. We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need. The Guard has been admirably serving LA throughout recovery. This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust.”

	The president can request, but not order, a governor to deploy their state's National Guard. The governor can refuse the request, and Trump would not be allowed under the Constitution to send National Guard troops to California from other states. The Trump administration has previously mulled invoking the Insurrection Act, which could allow the president to deploy the U.S. military domestically, federalize the National Guard, and send in troops to quell uprisings or civil disorder. 


	The White House told CBS News that Trump invoked his Title 10 authority to federalize and deploy the National Guard troops and did not invoke the Insurrection Act.

	











	On Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained hundreds of people in Los Angeles, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Saturday marked a second day of protests in there over the Trump administration's immigration policies and roundups. 


	Videos showed law enforcement shooting non-lethal rounds Saturday at protesters and using flash-bang smoke grenades.

	Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass posted on X Friday that her office had received reports of ICE in the city. “These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city,” she wrote. 


	“We will not stand for this,” she wrote.


	“We will,” FBI Director Kash Patel replied.


	Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, on Saturday called the protests “an insurrection against the laws and sovereignty of the United States.” He was writing in response to a video of protesters surrounding a federal detention center. 


	Last month, the Department of Homeland Security asked the Pentagon for 20,000 National Guard troops to play a role in deportations. They would be used for “guard duty and riot control,” NPR reported Friday. This would be the first time the National Guard is asked to carry out an immigration crackdown within the country, according to Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 


	In 2020, the Trump administration deployed out-of-state National Guard troops during protests in Washington, D.C. following the murder of George Floyd. This move was “unprecedented,” according to Joseph Nunn, counsel in the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program.

	“Trump has brought complete chaos to our communities,” Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) tells Rolling Stone. “We were promised that violent non-citizens would be deported. Then he deported a U.S. citizen child with cancer. Yesterday ICE mistakenly detained a deputy U.S. marshal. Nobody asked for this. And Americans are starting to say enough. It's time for Trump to pause his cruel immigration policies and come to Congress with a transparent and competent plan.”

Bruce Springsteen is performing his first-ever shows in Liverpool, England — the birthplace of the Beatles — this week, so naturally Paul McCartney came out to join the E Street Band for a couple of songs Saturday.


	Wednesday marked Springsteen's first concert in Liverpool, and it was a Beatle-less affair. Saturday brought the Boss back to the city's Anfield stadium, and it was a pretty routine E Street show again until the encore, when Springsteen and company welcomed out McCartney:


	“Thank you Liverpool. You're lucky tonight, we have a young man, a local young man from Liverpool, he's gonna play with us tonight, I think he has a lot of talent, and I believe he's gonna be going places,” Springsteen quipped in his introduction. “So let's bring out Paul McCartney.”


	McCartney first led the band on a rendition of the Fab Four classic “Can't Buy Me Love” — Springsteen and the E Street Band's first time performing that song live — followed by a rendition of Little Willie Littlefield's “Kansas City” that was popularized by Little Richard and then the Beatles on Beatles for Sale.

	











	The two rock legends have shared the stage together on a handful of occasions over the past dozen-plus years: At London's Hyde Park in July 2012, and again at New York's Madison Square Garden in September 2017 (both times they played “I Saw Her Standing There”).

	They also performed together during McCartney's East Rutherford, New Jersey gig in June 2022 (playing the Beatles' “I Wanna Be Your Man” and Springsteen's own “Glory Days”) and, most recently, a week later during McCartney's headlining set at Glastonbury.

	











	Mirroring the Beatles' own sojourn from Liverpool to Germany, Springsteen and the E Street Band's European tour next heads to Berlin on June 11. McCartney, who played a residency at New York's tiny Bowery Ballroom back in February, has no tour dates presently on his 2025 calendar.

Olivia Rodrigo welcomed David Byrne onstage during her headlining set Saturday at New York's Governors Ball festival for a rendition of the Talking Heads classic “Burning Down the House.”


	Toward the end of her weather-delayed set, Rodrigo brought out the “legendary” Byrne, who immediately launched into the Speaking in Tongues track. The two singers then traded verses on the track, with Byrne eventually dropping his acoustic guitar to engage in some synchronized dance routines with the Guts singer:


	Like much of the Talking Heads' work following the Stop Making Sense rerelease, “Burning Down the House” has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years: Paramore covered the track for the Talking Heads tribute album Everyone's Getting Involved, and later added it to their live repertoire. Dave Matthews Band also performed the 1983 song during their own induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

I
t was the kind of tragedy that happens all too often in a city of more than 8 million: a body found, beaten and bloodied, in the back of an ambulette in a far-flung corner of the Bronx. Skeletal branches created a cathedral over the lonely vehicle where the 64-year-old man had breathed his last, the winter-gray river placid in the background behind a ramble of fences. “It's a nice place to do bad things,” an unidentified neighbor told the press.


	When a reporter called Chiedza Makonnen, a designer in Ghana, to tell her that her ex-boyfriend, Peter Forrest, had been killed, the journalist was shocked when Makonnen replied that he wasn't just an ambulette driver. “She happened across my name because it kept coming up in searches involving him, because we lived together,” Makonnen says. “But when I told her he was the lead singer for 24-7 Spyz, she's like, ‘Wait a minute, I know that band.'” 


	This dynamic frontman, who's been hailed as a key figure in Black rock history, didn't die of opiates while touring on a broken hip, or in a mansion surrounded by friends — instead, Peter Forrest was blotted from this world senselessly. Who would kill this gentle, if admittedly arrogant, artistic whirlwind? Why was he driving an ambulette instead of touring the world? And, finally, why do we forget about musicians we once loved until they're dead?

	











	While working his gig at a private ambulette company at 6:30 a.m. on Jan. 13, 2025, Forrest found the door to the vehicle damaged, as though someone had broken in, according to court documents. He called his supervisor, but by the time his boss got back to him, there was no one to pick up the call. His supervisor tracked the ambulette via GPS to that remote location — about three miles away from where Forrest first radioed — and found him dead around 11 a.m. Cops and the prosecution determined that he was likely beaten to death with a fire extinguisher after interrupting someone robbing his vehicle.

	“That Tuesday, a Detective Doyle called me and asked me, ‘Did I know Peter Forrest?'” says Ray Anderson, a dapper man with a silver beard and slick style who was a longtime friend and collaborator. Forrest had listed him as a reference on his job application. When Anderson heard that his friend was assaulted, the musician was stunned. “He was always so full of life. He's one of the liveliest people you would have ever known,” he says. “And it really hurt me to my heart. Even now, I'm still trying to get over it.”


	Meanwhile, in Georgia, Forrest's daughter Valencia Claiborne woke up on Jan. 16 to a stream of missed calls; they all had New York area codes, but none belonged to her father. She got through to a family member, who broke the news. “I would never in a million years have thought my dad would have passed like this. It's still surreal. Someone took his life,” she says. “He didn't get to grow old.”


	Claiborne recalls that her dad had a postcard in his Bronx apartment with the words “the end” written on a black background. She doesn't know what appealed to him about it, even now. Maybe the typeface, maybe the sentiment. “When I was cleaning out his apartment, I saw another postcard with ‘the end' on there. I was like, ‘Yep, Dad. It is the end. Your memory is still here, but your presence is no longer here,'” she adds.


	There was no denying that Forrest had just that — presence, both onstage and off. He commanded rooms and stages in the Eighties, and he went on to mix and mingle with the likes of Nirvana, Alice Cooper, and Jane's Addiction before flaming out in the early Nineties. And, until the day he died, Forrest always tried to rekindle that fire.


	Peter Forrest was born on Dec. 6, 1959, in the Parkchester neighborhood of the Bronx, an idyllic planned community that didn'tallow Blacks until around the time of his birth. It's now predominantly populated by Blacks and Latinos. The youngest of 10, he was the son of Percy Forrest, a pitcher in the Negro Leagues who died in 1994. The younger Forrest was cagey with pals about a lot of the details of his childhood — and his only remaining brother did not respond to requests for an interview for this story — but everyone agrees that music was his lifeblood. “He had a lot of siblings, but his life was very, I would say, compartmentalized — like, if you knew him as a musician, you knew him as a musician,” Anderson says.

	Anderson and Forrest met in 1977, four years after DJ Kool Herc commandeered the turntables at a back-to-school party in Morris Heights and helped invent hip-hop in the process. Anderson and Forrest weren't really into the B-boy thing, but they both played in neighborhood bands and eventually joined forces. “The projects that we lived in, they had these terraces, and we would rehearse out there,” Anderson says. “The neighbors didn't mind. So every day, we would sit up and play. They just saw us as kids doing something positive. He and I clicked, and before you know it, we were like Frick and Frack. Everywhere you saw him, you saw me.”


	As a teen, Forrest joined the Army, an experience that would change both his music and his life. He met Valencia's mom at a nightclub when he was stationed in Georgia at what was then called Fort Benning, and was introduced to a whole new R&B scene in the process. When he got back to New York, he hit up Anderson and formed a new R&B/funk band called the Knights; they gigged around smaller venues like Celebrity Club and Smalls Paradise. “He had this vision of how he wanted his band to perform. We had our suits; we had our hair pressed. We were sharp; we were clean,” Anderson says.


	“One thing that Peter always had, he always had a vision, and he always had a gimmick,” he adds. “His theme was always: shock and awe. He always wanted to make their jaws drop. With that band, we always knocked them off their feet.”


	Pre-Army, in 1981, Forrest briefly crossed paths with Jimi Hazel — a funky, jovial guitarist with a teddy-bear vibe — when a brass player had left Hazel's band for Forrest's. Four years later, they bumped into each other in the Village — Hazel kitted out in paisley, pearls, and a pompadour, and Forrest trussed up like a punk-rock Theo Huxtable in penny loafers, chinos, and frosted tips.


	“We saw each other and ran to the middle of the street,” Hazel says. “Everybody said we're like oil and water. And it was like the running joke. And when we finally got together and sat down and played each other some material, it was a chocolate and the peanut butter kind of thing, and that was the beginning of what wound up being 24-7 Spyz.”


	The first iteration of Spyz formed in 1986, with Hazel on guitar, Rick Skatore on bass, Kindu Phibes on drums, and Forrest on vocals. Hazel's name was already a pseudonym — adopted from his “two fathers” Eddie Hazel and Jimi Hendrix — so Forrest adopted his first alter ego, P-Fluid. “Fluid” because no one could touch him, according to Hazel, although Makonnen says it was because he was always hydrated. (With water, that is. Forrest didn't drink or do drugs.) “The one thing about Peter early on that was well understood was his ego was larger than his talent,” Hazel says. “He was obnoxious, beautifully obnoxious. Some people loved him, some people hated him. But he was a good dude, no matter how you sliced it. He was a motherfucker. He just was a good one, though.”

	











	Bored by what music was on offer at the time —  “the Eighties had become all about drum machines and synthesizers and coke music,” says Hazel — the guys mixed and mingled their favorite genres into a kind of sonic fusion. Some hardcore thrash here, some R&B there, a smattering of rap over there. Before hitting the clubs, they spent a year rehearsing in their apartments on those trusty terraces. “We looked upon us being in these long-term rehearsals as sharpening our axes for battle,” Hazel says. Their first show was an open mic at Kenny's Castaways in Greenwich Village, a now-shuttered club whose purple neon sign once read, “Through these portals walk the famous.” The band then went on to play its way through the rest of the Village, cranking out cartoon theme song medleys between the sets as mostly white kids thrashed in the crowd.


	Hardcore band Murphy's Law often put Spyz on their bill at clubs like CBGB and NYU's Loeb Student Center. “People loved him. Peter had an energy onstage,” says Murphy's Law frontman Jimmy Drescher. “His aura that he carried, he was just a great entertainer. He was acrobatic and nuts — almost like the leader of a circus.


	“And he just had this energy. I feel bad for the other guys — for Jimi and the other guys in the band — [because] all attention was on him. It was hard not to focus on him; I don't think he'd let you focus on anybody else.” 


	That attention-grabbing quality would go on to become Forrest's downfall, but, at the time, Spyz was a phenomenon. “We did have the reputation as being, like, the band you have to go see,” Hazel says. “There were no cellphones, there was no social media, so if you weren't there, you missed something, and you need to make sure you see this when it happens again.” One local paper captured their performance aptly back in 1989: “They were showmen. And what a show it was. [Fluid] repeatedly dove into the arms of his screaming and head-banging fans, dropped his pants, and put the microphone in places a family newspaper can't report.”


	Still, there were early roadblocks to their success — mostly, racism and the misguided idea that a label could only sign one Black rock band at a time. “The music industry towards Black rock, we always used to refer to it kind of a Highlander syndrome: There can only be one,” says Earl Douglas Jr., executive director of the Black Rock Coalition. That group was formed in 1985 by Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, artist rep Konda Mason, and musician and late Village Voice and Rolling Stone writer Greg Tate, all of whom wanted a way to fight racism in the genre. “Still, [Spyz] could flip genres very quickly,” Douglas says. “One minute, they're the hardest band you heard. One minute they can do a straight-up funk cover. So they were very aware of that history, where the music came from, very aware of where the music was going.”

	











	Still, when Living Colour released their Top 10 debut, Vivid, in 1988, it felt like Spyz were facing off against Duncan MacLeod and his katana. No one would listen to their demo, Hazel says. After all, there could be only one. Labels didn't seem to get that just because both bands were Black and eclectic, they weren't the same act. Finally, though, the Spyz caught the ear of hardcore label In-Effect Records, brought on hotshot drummer Anthony Johnson, and dropped their 1989 debut, Harder Than You, a multi-genre pile-up that touched on politics and Forrest's military service (see the reggae-tinged banger “Ballots Not Bullets”), kicked off the mosh pit (“Spill My Guts”), and gave a fresh makeover to Kool and the Gang's “Jungle Boogie.” With the opening track, the thrasher “Grandma Dynamite,” they stated their intention: to get out of the Bronx — or at least the crime wave that was peaking there in the Eighties.


	“When I was a little boy growing up/In the South, South Bronx is where I played/And there were bullets flying everyday/And if I didn't duck, uh, I might've got caught,” Forrest spat. “Well, my grandmother said/Daddy's at work/Mommy's there too/And if you don't get your butt over to music class/You'll be through.” It's an eerie sentiment given what would happen decades later, but, at the time, the band had its golden ticket in hand; the Spyz went on their first tour in 1989. “The neighborhood watched us leave,” Hazel says. “We took an RV and a trailer that pulled up in front of our building. People came outside to wish us well and see us off, and then they watched us come back three months later in a tour bus. It was a beautiful, surreal thing to come out of our neighborhood and go around the world and then come back.”


	The video for “Jungle Boogie” — in which the guys thrashed in a tropical setting with a bunch of scantily-clad video vixens — managed to make it to MTV's 120 Minutes, Headbangers' Ball, and Yo! MTV Raps. But the cracks were starting to show. “When Peter got home from tour, he kind of realized he was alone, almost like he had no friends, so to speak,” Hazel says, claiming that Forrest called his bandmates incessantly and then blew up at them when they didn't always answer. “Whatever had scarred him as a child had kind of resurfaced with regards to getting close to us and us not being there when he wanted us to be there. He internalized that and turned it into a competition.”

	











	That competition spread, Hazel said, to the band's second album, 1990's Gumbo Millennium. Forrest told everyone to write their own songs — and then they'd pick the best. The reviews were a bit uneven at the time, though The New Yorker would go on to call it “a definitive document of the [Black rock] movement.” To hear Hazel tell it, Forrest was somewhat resentful of the album's success — and the new direction the band seemed to be going in. “The songs that I wrote wound up being the linchpin of the record, and that caused a rift with Peter,” Hazel says. 


	Friction emerged between Forrest and his bandmates. “Dude, you don't do that within your own unit,” Hazel says of Forrest's behavior. “Everything we wanted, everything we asked for, everything we've been working for, it's here. Why would you want to cause a problem within this beautiful thing?”


	That discord simmered as the Spyz toured with the likes of Primus and Alice Cooper. Around then, Nirvana opened for the Spyz in a shed in the middle of a cornfield in Kansas while the PA overloaded and Chad Channing — Dave Grohl's predecessor — watched his drums literally rattle apart. By the time the Spyz opened for Jane's Addiction in Virginia in November 1990, the dream was over. “Peter announces that he's quitting the band onstage,” Hazel says. “I got in the car with my lady and went back to New York and found a new singer.”


	Chiedza Makonnen, Forrest's one-time girlfriend, has a different take on what happened between P-Fluid and the Spyz. “He wanted to stick more to the political stuff, like ‘Ballots Not Bullets' — and say something with the music,” she says. “I think, at one point, Peter felt like it was him against Jimi and Rick. I think that's what led him to just say, ‘I'm out,' in a very harsh way.”


	What really hurt, she says, is how quickly his bandmates replaced him; they hired singer Jeff Brodnax not long after the fallout, signed to an Atlantic Records subsidiary, and released an EP cheekily titled This Is… 24-7 Spyz in 1991. “I think that just deepened his unhappiness with the way that things were going,” Makonnen says. “Peter felt that he worked really hard to get to where he was, and that's exactly where he wanted to be. He didn't want to be anywhere else except onstage, and so I think it really hurt him when he left the band and then they went on without him. He worked really hard to stay true to himself as a musician. And it cost him.”

	











	Hazel has a somewhat less romantic view of the split, claiming that Spyz are bigger than their former frontman, and has endured despite his departure 35 years ago. (The Soundtrack to the Innermost Galaxy was their most recent release, in 2019.) Not long after Forrest split, Hazel told the press, “Peter was a character, but he lost sight of what we're about. Jeff's more about the band than himself.… It's nice to have a singer that knows what he's doing.” After that first major-label EP, Spyz continued to grow; they even starred in a Budweiser commercial in 1992 (ripping onstage while fans participated in a polar plunge), an opportunity that Hazel still recalls today as a highlight. 


	Meanwhile, back in the city, Forrest didn't take long to lick his proverbial wounds. A workhorse, he threw himself into odd jobs and music. He was in the process of revamping his new R&B rock project, the Fluid Foundation, when he met guitarist Thomas Martin at a job interview at the Hard Rock Cafe in 1993. Martin, a metal kid with long, flowing hair, was already a fan of the Spyz, so he was a little stunned when Forrest gave him his card (mysteriously, it just read “wholesaler”; Martin didn't know why) and asked him to join the band. “I slipped out of my chair,” Martin says. Today he's bald but regal, his twisted gray chin beard a nod to his metal roots.


	Together, the two built out the Fluid Foundation, performing at clubs like CBGB and the Knitting Factory and recording a demo, but Forrest wasn't ready to let go of Spyz — he was envious of the fame and money, Hazel claims. The band split with its big-name label, and Forrest and drummer Anthony Johnson approached Hazel with a tall tale about a major label that would pay big for the original lineup to get back together. Hazel wasn't eager to get back in bed with the majors (he was not impressed the first time around and wanted to keep his masters), but he agreed to give it a go. Forrest yoinked a few songs from the demo he and Martin had been working on, and brought them to the band: the rocker “Fire & Water” (an apt metaphor for Forrest and Hazel) and the metal-tinged “Boots.” 


	The reunited lineup released Temporarily Disconnected in 1994 via a European label and embarked on a brief tour. That album failed to make the same impact as its predecessors, though, and it didn't take long for things to go sideways. “Midway through the tour, Peter starts making calls to the label and trying to tell them to sign him solo,” Hazel says. “When we finished the tour, I said, ‘This can't happen. I can't do this — and we shouldn't do this.' So I called a lawyer and drew up papers that told him his services were no longer needed, and that was how we parted company for the last time.”

	











	Martin was waiting when Forrest got home, and although he doesn't really remember Forrest's side of the story, he says his bandmate “wanted to do different projects. And I think in that situation, it was all or nothing, and he and Jimi just didn't see eye to eye on that.” He and Forrest revived the Fluid Foundation as P. Fluid. Eventually, though, that band fell apart, too, mostly because Forrest couldn't find enough serious players to keep it going, and he spent close to 10 years without a project. In the meantime, Forrest worked — delivering aluminium siding, toiling in warehouses, wherever he could make a living. “He always was able to find a job,” Martin says. “He was a hard worker.”


	When 2010 hit, so did a new spurt of creativity, and Forrest founded the gothy rock band BlkVampires. “He always had a vision, and he was always very determined to let music get him out of the life he was living — to that next level,” says old friend Ray Anderson, who played bass in that band. BlkVampires saw Forrest adopting a new moniker: Forrest Thinner. “Forrest Thinner was his real self,” says former drummer Ramsey Jones. (Jones' brother was the late Ol' Dirty Bastard, so he knows something about musicians adopting different personas to fulfill their artistic vision.)


	That project, which sounds something like Marilyn Manson gone R&B, featured a crew of top-tier musicians kitted out like the undead. Jones wore a black-and-white suit — with an assist from his mother's sewing skills — and corpse paint was in heavy demand. “I remember when we played SOBs in Manhattan, we had explosions onstage,” Jones says. “We had smoke and lights. A lot of Black people that went to that club, they looked at us like we were crazy. Their jaws dropped. It was like Kiss in the hood.”


	While his bandmates pranced around the stage with black dildos bobbing from their noses and top hats jauntily cocked, Forrest would open the show in a Joker-esque getup, holding a flaming Bible. “He was always into horror,” Jones says. “That was his thing. He was like Screamin' Jay Hawkins coming out of a coffin, scaring the whole front row of people out of the theater, like Alice Cooper being beheaded onstage, or like Jimi Hendrix burning his guitar.”


	Still, Forrest's controlling tendencies continued unabated, for better or worse. “He used to do this sort of an initiation process,” says BlkVampires bandmate Randy Blu Smith. “We were never playing the songs right until we went to his house and sat in his living room and played them. It was such an intimidating experience. Now, whenever I record, I always practice just like that, just quiet and very low-tech and real skills-focused.” 

	











	“I noticed he had a large turnover rate of musicians in his band, because he was a taskmaster,” Jones adds. “He wanted the best out of each musician. I never had that problem with him, because he always knew I was playing to my highest level.” Still, sometimes Forrest's demands seemed nitpicky, silly even. Martin, who also played in the band, recalls, “One show I came out, and I was wearing sneakers. I gave him a ride home, and the whole ride home, he's giving me the third degree: ‘Why did you wear sneakers? Vampires don't wear sneakers. Where's your boots?'”


	In the end, BlkVampires became BlkVampiresX in 2019. Forrest was alone again. He dropped two solo tracks in 2022, the sunny, tropical-sounding “La Flaca Negra” and the similarly lightweight “Bike Ride in Manhattan.” They were competent, to be sure, but a far cry from his whirling dervish days with the Spyz. Through it all, though, Forrest worked — always jobs that involved driving, Anderson says. 


	When he died in early 2025, Forrest had been working for an ambulette company during the day for about a year, and he spent nights driving a shipping truck to Boston and back. In his free time, he did puppet shows on FaceTime for his granddaughter, Valencia's child. “He made these puppets, Dr. Rag and Lamby-Lambie and a fox,” Valencia says. “He did anything he could to spark conversation.”


	Still, though, all who knew Forrest knew that he missed the stage. “I think, sometimes, that if [Spyz] never broke up, this would have never happened to him,” Makonnen says today. “Being on the road and being in that world took him out of that Bronx world. It's almost like when the circus comes to town and you want to leave and go with the circus. He was part of the circus. He needed to still be a part of that circus, and that would have protected him.”


	It didn't take long for the cops to make an arrest for Forrest's murder. After all, the alleged perp was wearing an ankle monitor. On Feb. 7, just a few weeks after Forrest was found beaten to death in his ambulette, Bronx District Attorney Clark announced that a 29-year-old borough resident named Sharief Bodden had been indicted on second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. And Bodden had a record. Freshly released from prison in 2019 for carjacking a livery cab two years earlier, he was arrested once more in 2020 for attempted robbery and sentenced to seven more years. He was released on parole in 2024, and he was still wearing the tracking device when he was nabbed for Forrest's death. 

	











	Not long after his indictment, Bodden's mother told the news, “I really don't believe the accusations. Everybody is innocent, you know, before proven guilty. That's not who he is.” He was looking for work, she said, and living with a girlfriend. Neither his mother nor any of Bodden's family or friends replied to a request for comment for this story.


	When photos hit the news of a sullen-looking Bodden shambling into court for the first time, Forrest's friends and family were enraged. Who was this man? And what did he have to do with the musician? “It's crazy to me how when my father was this guy's age he completed four years in the military, he fathered two girls, started his own band and they traveled the world together,” his daughter Nikki Richardson wrote on Facebook. (She also didn't reply to a request for comment.) “I could not help but contrast their lives at the same age and wonder what caused them to collide on Jan. 13th.”


	We won't find out much more about Bodden's alleged motive until the trial starts in earnest this summer, but according to court docs and social media posts, he was also a driven man. After waiving his Miranda rights back in 2017, he told cops he was innocent of the carjacking, explaining: “I got a career going for me. I'm a boxer. I make videos.… It's not money. You ever heard of the Bronx Fight Club? Yeah, I'm in that.… I don't play with guns at all. The only way I play with guns is Call of Duty.”


	Still, while his social media shows photos of him cuddling kittens and playing with his niece, along with a sad update about an ex's abortion and his dreams of fatherhood, there are also photos of him flashing what looks to be speed, weed, and a gun — despite his claims to cops. There are snaps of him at those Bronx Fight Club events, too, his opponent covered in blood, the caption reading, “I see ketchup!” And, in prison, he was dinged for violent conduct, creating a disturbance, and fighting in 2024; soliciting, contraband, and gang activity in 2023; and violent conduct, assault on an inmate, and having a weapon in 2022. 


	At a May 16 hearing at Bronx Supreme Court, Forrest's friends and family — including Jimi Hazel, Thomas Martin, and his last remaining brother — quietly seethed as Bodden's lawyer tried to make a case for his client to be released with electronic monitoring. “He could work at any number of barber stores upon his release,” his lawyer claimed, adding that Bodden has been cutting hair while incarcerated at Rikers. “Sharief, in general, he enjoys art. He designs tattoos and he enjoys reading and writing.” Hazel was not moved by Bodden's artistic prowess or sob story, though — especially when the lawyer mentioned the words “self-defense.”

	











	“Charges of murder and manslaughter are significant,” the lawyer said, the gravity of his words somewhat undermined by his outfit: mismatched socks, pink Converse, tangerine trousers, and a red shirt. “But the seriousness of the charges doesn't obviate Mr. Bodden's right to engage in self-defense.… He was presented with a threat. He acted with the amount of force appropriate to that threat.”


	Hazel was already steamed when he arrived at court earlier that day; he befriended a guard with whom he joked, “You're going to earn your money today, because it's going to take everything for me not to cross that line and kill that motherfucker.” So when the lawyer suggested Forrest had been the initial aggressor, his old bandmate was thoroughly pissed. “That's when I finally had enough,” Hazel recalls. “I said, ‘That's bullshit.' And the guard said, ‘Yo, chill.' And then he came over and stood by me for the rest of the fucking thing.” Regardless, Bodden was not granted release — due to the severity of his charges and his criminal history — and he's facing 25 years to life in prison. Court will resume in July; his lawyer declined to comment.


	Motives aside, Forrest's friends and family are crushed by the senselessness of the crime. “I never saw Peter battle, have a fight,” Makonnen says. “He could get mad, for sure. But I never saw Peter get into a fight with anybody. He was more of just a happy-go-lucky kind of person. He was intense, he was serious and all of that, but his nature around people in general was smiley.”


	“It's tragic to see his demise sitting in a fucking ambulance waiting to go to work to make ends meet when he should have been onstage and doing what he really loved to do,” Jimmy Drescher, from Murphy's Law, adds. “It always seems like we get attention from the industry when we're dead.” 


	Even if the music industry had forgotten him, Forrest's death was seismic to those who loved him. His daughter, Valencia Claiborne, recalls how he used to send trinkets and gifts twice a week to his granddaughter, whom he called ladybug; he even tattooed the bug on his arm to remind him of her. And Thomas Martin, his old bandmate, says they'd often spend hours chatting on the phone, most recently about their relationship with religion. One of Forrest's ambulette passengers had just told him that he could talk to God at any time — “like putting lotion on every day” — so he'd started talking with the man upstairs while he did his daily route. “We're living 100 miles apart, but we're kind of going through the same thing spiritually — two atheists who found God,” Martin says. 

	











	Meanwhile, his old friend Ray Anderson keeps looking at the last text he got from Forrest. “He had an emoji he would always use to close a conversation. It was a showman taking his final bow after a show,” he says. “When I saw the emoji, it really hurt. It's like he's taking his final bow.”


	Until the end, Forrest was still thinking about the Spyz, Anderson says. Just a month before he died, the singer told his friend he wanted to call up Hazel and get the band back together. They hadn't spoken in years, Hazel says — he last saw Forrest in 2012 sitting three rows behind him at Kenny's Castaways, where the band first performed, watching a hardcore band shred onstage. They ignored each other. “If he would have called, I would have taken a call simply because I love somebody,” Hazel says.

	On the day of Forrest's memorial, Claiborne gifted Hazel some band merch she'd found in her father's apartment. “At the bottom of the box was something that literally brought tears to my eyes when I saw it,” Hazel wrote in a Facebook post that day. It was the band's award for Best Hard Rock Band at the 1990 New York Music Awards. At the time, they decided to share the award — shuttle it between band members' apartments on a regular basis. In true Forrest style, though, he “bogarted” the prize, Hazel says. 


	When he finally got his hands on the award, Hazel's feelings were complicated. He finally got to share in the physical glory, but it also meant that Forrest was really gone. It was like when Hazel finally acquired a guitar owned by legendary player Jef Lee Johnson after his death in 2013. “When the guitar arrived at my house, I couldn't unbox it because … I would rather have him be alive and not have the guitar,” he wrote. “As I looked at the award, I had the same feeling about Peter.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","Wall Street Journal: Pentagon used UFO myths to hide weapons work","https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-856910","Sun, 08 Jun 2025 08:35:00 GMT","

A Pentagon report released in 2024 found no evidence of a cover-up regarding extraterrestrial life but omitted how the government had perpetuated UFO myths through deliberate disinformation. This omission led to accusations that the report itself was an attempt at a cover-up.

An investigation conducted by a unit of the United States Department of Defense uncovered that the ""UFO mythology"" in the US was fueled by the Pentagon's own disinformation. The inquiry revealed that these disinformation campaigns were aimed at hiding the testing of military technology, including stealth fighter jets. Investigators are still determining whether these campaigns were local initiatives or centralized programs within the military hierarchy.

Central to the investigation was the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established under the US Department of Defense in July 2022 based on legislation passed by Congress. The main mission of AARO was to investigate so-called Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) observed in all domains, including land, sea, air, and space. AARO investigators reviewed government documents dating back to 1945 and interrogated current and former military officers.

Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, a former chief scientist at the Missile and Space Intelligence Center, was recruited in 2022 to lead the investigation at the direction of Congress through AARO. He identified issues regarding the dissemination of disinformation and reported them to Department of Defense leadership. He resigned from his position as AARO director in December 2023. Four months after his resignation, a report was released that omitted these critical issues, leading to controversy over concealment.

""The craft was described as an antigravity maneuvering vehicle,"" stated the Wall Street Journal, noting the sensational nature of some of the misinformation disseminated. According to its investigations, military officials had disseminated misleading documents to create a ""smokescreen"" regarding real secret weapon programs, as in the case of Area 51.

Area 51, long a subject of conspiracy theories and associated with claims of extraterrestrial life, turned out to be a cover for secret military projects developed during the Cold War. These projects included the testing of classified stealth fighter jets and electromagnetic pulse generators. In a case from the 1980s, a US Air Force colonel visited a bar near Area 51 and gave the bar owner photographs allegedly showing flying saucers. These tampered photographs later adorned the walls of the bar, becoming one of the most talked-about topics of that period.

When these aircraft were seen by the public, there was concern about the military program being exposed. To prevent exposure, the Air Force allowed the local population to believe in UFO sightings rather than acknowledge the existence of their aircraft. In some cases, U.S. officials had allowed the spread of myths related to UFOs in line with ""national security interests."" One of the purposes of these efforts was to deter the Soviet Union from identifying weaknesses in nuclear facilities and equipment.

""For decades, certain new commanders of the Air Force's most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer,"" detailed the Wall Street Journal. Many of these commanders were informed they were joining ""Yankee Blue,"" a program aimed at reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology. This practice affected hundreds of officers who believed in its authenticity, signed non-disclosure agreements, and never told their spouses.

In the spring of 2023, an order was given to discontinue the briefings regarding the false UFO photographs. The Wall Street Journal reported that the defense secretary's office sent a memo ordering the practice to stop immediately, but the damage was already done. The unclear Pentagon bureaucracy regarding secret programs nested within other secret programs created fertile ground for the spread of myths.

The deliberate spread of UFO myths has led to a wide-ranging investigation at the Pentagon, tracing examinations back to the 1980s.

Ever since it was spotted in various gameplay reveals and trailers, the UFO in Mario Kart World has been a hot topic. Some players have been desperate to find out more about where to find it and what it does. With the game now officially out in the wild, all the details about the supernatural addition to Nintendo's kart racer have been revealed. Here's everything players need to know about where to find and how to get abducted by the UFO in Mario Kart World.

Smart steering is turned on in Mario Kart World by default but can detract from the experience. Here's what it does and how to turn it off.

The UFO can only be found in Mario Kart World's free roam mode, which allows players to explore the open world outside the typical racing action. Unfortunately, the UFO doesn't have a specific location that it spawns in or can always be found. Instead, it appears to spawn randomly around the map, hovering above roads. From my experience in the game so far, I've not come across a UFO off the beaten path in the middle of nowhere. As such, players' best bet is to stick to the roads and keep an eye out for the telltale tractor beam shining down on the road.

When I encountered a UFO, I saw it flying high up in the sky overhead before it started to lower itself and hover over the road. I stopped driving, sat and watched it so I could make sure it was going to land in front of me, and waited for its tractor beam to be turned on.

To get abducted by a UFO, players need to drive into its tractor beam, shining on the road directly below it. This will cause their kart to be sucked up into the bottom of the spaceship.

Once abducted, players can take control of it to fly around the map and generally explore the world a little bit faster. Steering the UFO is the same as driving a kart. The A button is used to accelerate, B is used to brake, and you'll use the left analog stick to steer. Players can also use the tractor beam to suck up cars, items, and other characters and players around the map by pressing the R button. With Peach Coins to collect and secrets hidden across the open world map, the UFO can be useful for exploring difficult-to-reach spaces, or even just getting a birds-eye view of the surrounding area to pinpoint collectibles or other points of interest.

It's worth noting that controlling the UFO is only available for a limited time after getting abducted. I've calculated this to be around 30 seconds from my experiences so far. I also haven't found a way to increase the amount of time you can fly the UFO. Once time's up, players will be dropped out of the UFO and can use their kart's glider to make it down to solid ground.

Actor Michelle Randolph is in early negotiations to lead Malibu, a subterranean horror thriller helmed by Paranormal Activity 2 director Tod Williams. The film, currently in pre-production, is set to begin shooting later this year and promises to deliver a genre-bending scarefest anchored by a strong female lead.

Produced under the Spooky Pictures banner—run by genre veterans Roy Lee (Barbarian, It) and Steven Schneider (Insidious, The Devil Inside)—Malibu is being pitched as a “thriller skulking around in the subterranean horror subgenre.” While specific plot details remain tightly under wraps, the film's tone and pedigree suggest a gritty psychological horror story with a claustrophobic edge.

Michelle, 27, has been steadily building her portfolio with a string of high-profile roles across television and streaming platforms. She recently starred in Taylor Sheridan's oil-rig drama Landman (2024) alongside Billy Bob Thornton, as well as the Yellowstone prequel 1923 (2022) and the mystery series The Resort (2021). Her film credits include the comedy The Throwback (2023), showcasing her range beyond dark drama.

If confirmed, Malibu would mark Michelle's first full-fledged foray into horror—a genre that continues to thrive both critically and commercially. It also aligns with her upcoming appearance in Scream 7, directed by franchise creator Kevin Williamson. Slated for release next year, the new Scream instalment is already generating buzz and could further cement Michelle's place in the horror circuit.

While no official announcement has been made about her role in Malibu, the industry chatter signals a promising next move. With Tod Williams behind the camera and the reliable horror pedigree of Spooky Pictures, the project is shaping up to be one to watch. As the horror renaissance continues, Michelle Randolph may just be its next scream queen-in-the-making.

The man who stripped down the espionage thriller earlier this year also revives the original atmosphere of the haunted house story

Ghosts have been a perpetual fixture of human artistry for generations, one of our oldest existential curiosities — we've used them as a tool to wrestle with mortality in books, live theatre, and, (since 1896's The Haunted Castle) movies as well. They're perhaps the original on-screen horror archetype, predating even Dracula. Their ubiquity speaks to the power that genre cinema has in helping us understand not just mortality, but trauma, and regret, and historical bloodshed as well.

For as long as they've haunted the collective cinematic consciousness, they've also undergone changes that reflect our increasingly cynical appetites. Gone are the hokey, spectral-white, mostly peaceful apparitions from the Golden Age of Hollywood, replaced by the overtly evil, often gruesome-looking ghouls made popular by Paranormal Activity and The Conjuring. Modern ghost stories resemble their classic Gothic origins increasingly little, which is why Steven Soderbergh's recent Presence feels so fresh: it marries a genuinely unique visual style with the atmosphere of a traditional haunting.

While the initial setup is quite simple (a relatively well-off, seemingly picture–perfect upper class family moves into a new house in the suburbs that turns out to be haunted), the film's divisive visual approach is anything but. Known for constantly playing around with different formats for the sake of convenience, or even to challenge how audiences approach a story (shooting Unsane and High Flying Bird on iPhones, for instance), Soderbergh shot Presence himself entirely from a 1st person POV, specifically that of the titular ghost. Some folks were naturally off-put by the uncanny, disorienting camera movement, but in the context of the genre it's an inspired decision. Never before has a movie committed so fully to immersing you in the experience of existing in a hypothetical afterlife, but there's also a profound sense of isolation evoked by the aesthetic style. Even before the movie reveals exactly who this presence is (or was), the visual storytelling conveys such a deep feeling of sorrow, and of being on the outside looking in — curious and wistful, and perhaps envious, of the life it observes in the Payne family.

Part of how the film resurrects the classical nature of a ghost story is truthfully in its focus on the (suburban) Gothic domestic drama unfolding inside the house. Like the emotionally and psychologically destructive tragedies of Poe's House of Usher and Shirley Jackson's original Hill House, the paranormal in Presence functions like a house of mirrors, turning familial trauma into a frightening, inexplicable abstraction. Grief becomes an unrecognizable and warped reflection of human yearning and sadness. But instead of reflecting the social anxieties of the 1830s, or even the 1950s, here the supernatural points a flashlight at the skeletons in the closets of perfectionist 21st century suburbanites, their socioeconomic appetites, and their fatalist imperfections.

A haunting might be worth it for this house in this economy.

Soderbergh's specter observes silently and tries to understand its reason for existing, a goal it ironically shares with the living. Just like it, audiences watch invisibly and scrutinize the immediate flaws in this idealistic fresh start and the hollow victory of “upward mobility.” Rebekah's (Lucy Liu) heavily implied white-collar financial fraud, the Oedipal undertones of her fawning relationship with her son Tyler (Eddy Maday), how that toxic dynamic nurtures the confidence with which he belittles his grieving sister Chloe (Callina Liang), and how the entire collapsing sandcastle is driving meek father/husband Chris (Chris Sullivan) maybe further and further away from them — all of it is passively witnessed by a force desperately trying to figure out how to make its influence active, not to terrorize, but perhaps for something else.

There's such a caustic bite to the way that these characters interact with each other, very specifically in regards to how they react to emotional or spiritual sincerity. Whether it's the stone-faced stubbornness with which Rebekah ignores Chris' obvious feelings of emotional neglect (watching Liu and Sullivan perform marital crisis here is some of the best acting of the year), or the conscience-less teenage cruelty Tyler deploys in the face of his sister's very real emotional turmoil and her vague clairvoyant sensitivity. But it's not as if the problem is exclusively their own, there's a lack of empathy to the world at large that bleeds into the house from other places as well. 

One of cinema's fastest inductees into the hall of Most Uncomfortable Boy Moms.

The financial and social circles that the family navigate (the relative privilege of the upper-middle class, competitive private schools and the wildly repressed and rebellious adolescent communities they inevitably cultivate, and the broad emotional disaffection experienced by many high school boys today) feel rotten, shredded by a culture where greed and consumerism and schadenfreude have consumed a reverence for life and mortality and the thought of experiencing either sincerely. But by the time their experience with their phantom is over, the Payne family's lives have been radically upended, acutely refocused on what truly matters by a harrowing and inexplicable experience that leaves them (and will leave you) emotionally shell-shocked. Presence works because at its best, its bold visual approach and its Gothic traditions reminds us that more than anything, a good ghost story should remind us about the fragility of life itself and how much every moment matters.","{'href': 'https://www.inverse.com', 'title': 'Inverse'}","other"

A number of 'smoke' rings have been spotted in oceans around the world and a new study suggests it could help us in our search for extra-terrestrial life.

These rings aren't actually made of smoke at all, actually being made of bubbles that are being blown by humpback whales.

In a behaviour that looks eerily similar to a human smoker blowing rings or 'Os' themselves, these rings are far larger and stick around for longer in the water.

It is suggested that the actions from the sea creatures could be a friendly interaction with humans, with those swimming or sailing past able to see the large circular shape.

They may represent a form of curiosity, and might even aid humans in their search for alien life.

Though these signs have only been seen in an ocean environment, researchers at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute and University of California believe them to be promising, publishing their findings in the journal Marine Mammal Science.

Bubbles are known to be used as tools by Humpback whales, whether it be in a method to herd fish, or making bubble trails to attract mates, but this new behaviour isn't related to their eating habits or reproduction, the study says.

It suggests that they are attempts to communicate with humans, as co-lead author Dr Fred Sharpe explained: “Humpback whales live in complex societies, are acoustically diverse, use bubble tools and assist other species being harassed by predators.

Advert

“Now, akin to a candidate signal, we show they are blowing bubble rings in our direction in an apparent attempt to playfully interact, observe our response, and/or engage in some form of communication,” the UC Davis Affiliate added.

Researchers looked at 12 instances where 11 individual whales across the world exhibited the behaviour, as every case saw the whales approach the on-looking humans to release a total of 39 bubble rings, in a study titled 'Humpback Whales Blow Poloidal Vortex Bubble Rings.'

This new study is part of the WhaleSETI project, focusing on non-human intelligence as a way to better understand potential signals in the future from alien life.

Scientists say that understanding how non-human, non-terrestrial beings display curiosity or other feels can help to better understand any future alien intelligence we may run into.

Advert

These findings could lead to a better understanding of communication from extra-terrestrial intelligence, says SETI Institute scientist and co-author Dr. Laurance Doyle.

“Because of current limitations on technology, an important assumption of the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is that extra-terrestrial intelligence and life will be interested in making contact and so target human receivers,” he added.

Dr. Doyle said that this assumption is 'supported' in the evolution of humpback whales' 'curious behaviour.'

Co-lead author Jodi Frediani pointed out the 'friendly behaviour' from humpback whales to humans, explaining: “We've now located a dozen whales from populations around the world, the majority of which have voluntarily approached boats and swimmers blowing bubble rings during these episodes of curious behaviour.”

Israeli psychic Uri Geller has threatened to stop activist Greta Thunberg as her Gaza aid flotilla continues its journey to Israel, telling The Jerusalem Post that he also is responsible for the navigation malfunctions on her ship, the Madleen.

""I stopped the navigation systems of the ship,"" explained Geller, who is also the owner of the Uri Geller Museum in Jaffa. He had warned on his X/Twitter account on Friday that he would use psychic powers to interfere with her ship. On Sunday, Israeli media reports showed that the navigation tools on the ship were malfunctioning, with the leader of the Freedom Flotilla ship accusing Israel of being behind it. 

Hey @GretaThunberg - you won't get to #Gaza on your fake protest. I will use my psychic powers to mess with your boat! 😵‍💫 For a climate activist, it's funny how you don't mind belching out shit into the sea and air with your motorised vessel when it comes to #Israel! 😂… pic.twitter.com/kXqDt9kAkh— Uri Geller (@theurigeller) June 6, 2025

Hey @GretaThunberg - you won't get to #Gaza on your fake protest. I will use my psychic powers to mess with your boat! 😵‍💫 For a climate activist, it's funny how you don't mind belching out shit into the sea and air with your motorised vessel when it comes to #Israel! 😂… pic.twitter.com/kXqDt9kAkh— Uri Geller (@theurigeller) June 6, 2025

Though Israel did not claim to have done so, Defense Minister Israel Katz did warn that the IDF would not allow the ship to reach Gaza.

""I have instructed the IDF to act so that the Madleen flotilla does not reach Gaza. To Greta the antisemite and her friends, I say clearly: you'd better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza,"" Katz said in a statement, with sources telling the Post previously that Israel is set to intercept the ship when it reaches Gaza in the next 48 hours or so.

Geller, however, takes full credit for the ship's navigation errors. When asked how he did it, he told the Post that he utilized a technique known as remote viewing. This alleged paranormal ability is supposed to allow the user to project their mind elsewhere to be able to see distant people or places.

""It's like a laser, like the IDF's new weapon, the Iron Beam. That's how powerful the mind is for some people.""

Geller, who the CIA said presented his paranormal abilities in ""a convincing and unambiguous manner"" while being studied by them in the 1970s, compared remote viewing to drone piloting, noting that it just requires being in a dark room, often with a computer, and with a joystick. 

""And in my case, I don't need a joystick. My joystick is my mind, and I can navigate my mind into whatever I want to.""

Geller said he would not reveal if he interfered with the Madleen's navigation systems of his own volition, or if it was on behalf of the IDF.

""Greta thinks she's heroic, but this is - in my opinion - just a publicity stunt. Everything she's doing is just a publicity stunt,"" he said. 

""She's supposed to be the greatest environmental activist, but she's using a motorized vessel. She's belching out tons of CO2 on this journey, and she doesn't care. In my opinion, she's a hypocrite.""

He further said, ""I will warn her through The Jerusalem Post. Greta, if you come to harm Israel, Uri Geller is going to stop you.""

Geller concluded the interview by adding, ""I congratulate The Jerusalem Post on the most amazing website I have ever seen"" in honor of the Post's new updated look.

The Jerusalem Post reached out to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition for comment.

States introduce chemtrail-coded legislation as conspiracy theories take root in some US chambers

Political leaders love an empty statement or proclamation, but when Louisiana's state house of representatives moved against “chemtrails” last week, they were literally seeking to combat something that does not exist.

It was an act of political symbolism that delved deep into the sort of anti-government conspiracy theories that have flourished under Donald Trump and are taking rooting in some US legislative chambers across the US.

Known to less conspiratorially minded as aircraft contrails, or the white vaporous lines streaming out of an airplane's engines at altitude, chemtrails are a longstanding conspiracy theory.

Believers in chemtrails hold that the aircraft vapor trails that criss-cross skies across the globe every day are deliberately laden with toxins that are using commercial aircraft to spray them on people below, perhaps to enslave them to big pharma, or exert mind control, or sterilize people or even control the weather for nefarious motives.

Despite the outlandishness of the belief and the complete absence of evidence, a 2016 study showed that the idea is held to be “completely true” by 10% of Americans and “somewhat true” by a further 20%-30% of Americans.

At least eight states, including Florida and Tennessee, have now introduced chemtrail-coded legislation to prohibit “geo-engineering” or “weather modification”. Louisiana's bill, which must pass through the senate before reaching Governor Jeff Landry's desk, orders the department of environmental quality to record reported chemtrail sightings and pass complaints on to the Louisiana air national guard.

While there are no penalties for violations, the bill calls for further investigation and documentation. Opponents fear it could be used to force airlines to re-route flights, challenge the location of airports and bring legal action against carriers.

The US Environmental Protection Agency states that the plumes of aircraft exhaust vapor are a natural result of flight and pose no risk to weather patterns, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) has publicly denied undertaking or planning any weather modification experiments.

But the theories abound, including that last year's Hurricane Helene stalled over and devastated parts of western North Carolina as a result of government weather interference that was designed to force North Carolinians off their land and then exploit it for rare earth mineral mining. Federal emergency managers set up a webpage to dispel false information.

But government weather programs have existed in the past.

For two decades, from 1962 to 1983, Project Stormfury conducted experiments to release a silver iodide compound into “the belt of maximum winds” to reduce the strongest winds. And cloud-seeding occurs in western states to induce rain or snow fall.

“It's increasingly clear that humanity isn't merely subjected to whatever weather a cloud portends – we also create and influence it through our everyday actions,” says Nevada's Desert Research Institute. “Scientists now regularly harness their moisture and pull it to Earth, bringing water to parched communities and landscapes around the world.”

Nor has the government always been entirely straightforward in its use of aerial-dispersed chemicals. The US military dropped 19m gallons of herbicide, including the cancer-linked Agent Orange, during the Korean and Vietnam wars, leading to potential long-term health problems related to exposure and spina bifida in children of veterans.

Efforts to stop geo-engineering are gaining support in the administration where conspiracy-minded politicians now hold office or wield powerful influence.

“We are going to stop this crime,” the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, posted on X in August. Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene said in a post before Hurricane Milton struck in October: “Yes they can control the weather. It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done.” Even Donald Trump has spread the conspiracy theory that Joe Biden is dead and has been replaced by a robotic clone.

A recently published book, The Ghosts of Iron Mountain, traces at least some responsibility for current conspiratorial thinking to 1960s radicals, including the 1967 anti-war satire Report from Iron Mountain by Leonard Lewin, written at the suggestion of future Nation editor Victor Navasky, which posed as a leaked government study about the necessity of continuous war for social stability.

In The Ghosts of Iron Mountain, author Phil Tinline traces how a leftwing hoax was adopted by the right, absorbing much of the former's anxieties about a military-industrial complex and elite control and repurposing it around “the deep state” with its attendant spin-offs in QAnon and militia thinking.

This mischief-making, Tinline writes, act as a “warning about the consequences that await if you don't keep an eye on the line between your deep story and how power works, and what the facts support”.

Timothy Tangherlini, a professor at the Berkeley School of Information who studies the circulation of folklore, says the chemtrails conspiracy theory has a potent history because, like all folktales, it begins with a kernel of history truth – programs like Agent Orange – and speaks to potent contemporary fears.

“There are certain things that were sprayed by airplanes that did have a massive impact on the environment and on people's health,” he says, pointing out that Vietnam veterans had fallen sick and the US was revealed as having exposed them to cancer-causing agents and then covering it up.

“Fast-forward 50 years, there's a deep suspicion of the government and things that fly,” he said.

Fear of things in the sky was evident in the hysteria late last year in the panic over drones that appeared over New Jersey, close to a nuclear power station and a military arsenal, which prompted a federal investigation that has yet to release its findings.

Tangherlini called the cross-fertilization of theories, whether around chemtrails, vaccination hesitancy or any number of other fringe beliefs that have made their way into the American mainstream via the internet and social media, “the wall of crazy”.

“Jets flying though the air and contrails of condensed water should not in any way be linked to disease, viruses, mind control, but you look at some of the extractions we get from our mining social media, and if it wasn't real you'd think your code wasn't working or in hysterics.”

But narratively, Tangherlini pointed out: “It's a very interesting thing to do – you can create this totalizing threat everywhere you look. What is the strategy for dealing with it? Call the FAA. No, the FAA is in on it. What can we do to protect our health? Well, the doctors and big pharma are in on it. So there is a siege mentality.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

Are some parts of an airplane safer than others?

As news reports broadcast images of planes flipping upside down, performing emergency landings or colliding into unforeseen obstacles, many people may be nervous about air travel. Some may wonder, is there a seat on the plane that will maximize my safety? What's the safest seat on a plane?

First, it's important to note that air travel is one of the safest modes of transportation. ""The fatality rate is way, way lower than driving a car,"" said Cheng-Lung Wu, an associate professor in the School of Aviation at the University of New South Wales in Australia. In the United States, your odds of dying in commercial air travel is 1 in 13.7 million for each flight, according to a 2024 study in the Journal of Air Transport Management. The vast majority of passenger plane crashes, around 94%, also have a 100% survival rate, according to data between 2001 and 2017 from the National Transportation Safety Board.

However, there have been no robust scientific studies investigating which seats on an airplane are the safest, Wu said. But based on past plane crashes and knowledge of airplane design, it's possible to infer the safest seat in the event of an accident.

""It all depends on the crash dynamics,"" said Daniel Kwasi Adjekum, an aviation safety researcher at the University of North Dakota. Of course, if the plane is completely obliterated, you're doomed no matter where you sit.

But say a crash happens with low energy and a low angle of impact, for instance if the plane loses control upon landing, and it goes off the runway. ""Then it really matters where you are seated to be able to survive structurally,"" Adjekum said.

In these instances, the plane may break into two sections upon hitting the ground, and much of the kinetic energy would be in the front section of the plane, making it barrel forward. In this case, the back of the plane would be safer. Indeed, a 2015 analysis of Federal Aviation Administration data by Time magazine found that the back third of the plane had the lowest fatality rate.

Wu also noted another spot that may offer more protection: seats next to or close to the plane's wings. This part of the plane has a lot of structural reinforcement, so it can withstand more force. These seats are close to the emergency exits, Wu said, which means you can evacuate more quickly (unless you are seated in the emergency exit row and need to help others evacuate the plane).

But a danger lurks underneath this middle part of the plane: the fuel tanks. Although planes are supposed to empty their fuel tanks before landing, these capsules may still emit smoke or catch fire in a crash. In these scenarios, it's even more important to evacuate the plane quickly, within 90 seconds, Adjekum said. That means leaving your luggage behind, and not panicking, filming the accident or performing other actions that could slow you down.

—What happens when a plane makes an emergency landing?

—Why do babies cry on airplanes?

—What do black boxes on planes actually record?

""You have to listen to the instruction from the cabin crew,"" Adjekum said. ""I think that's the most important thing."" Planes are generally well engineered to minimize risk, he added. Parts of the plane can break off to protect the main cabin, seats are very securely attached, and seat belts are designed to minimize crash forces for a sitting passenger.

Beyond wearing seat belts and following safety instructions, be aware of your surroundings. ""Know where you sit,"" Wu said. Locate the nearest emergency exit, and count the rows to the exit in case smoke obscures your view.

So, the next time you're on a plane, take note of your environment, listen closely to the safety video, and stay tuned for instructions in the event of an incident.

NASA's Parker Solar Probe has directly observed a powerful magnetic explosion in the sun's corona that could help us predict geomagnetic storms on Earth.

While making a death-defying dive through the sun's atmosphere, NASA's Parker Solar Probe has directly recorded a powerful plasma explosion heading toward our star's surface in unprecedented detail.

Parker's new measurements found protons with about 1000 times greater energy than expected and a plasma jet shooting toward the sun, not away from it. Parker was uniquely positioned between the sun and the particles' source, allowing scientists to easily figure out where they came from. These findings indicate that the complexity and strength of tangles in the sun's magnetic field can accelerate charged particles to much greater speeds than expected from the field's strength alone.

The sunward plasma jet was caused by ""magnetic reconnection"" in the sun's atmosphere — the explosive process in which magnetic fields fracture and reconnect. The powerful phenomenon transforms energy stored in the sun's magnetic field into energy that accelerates the solar wind — the constant stream of charged particles that the sun blasts across the solar system.

Understanding magnetic reconnection is critical for making better predictions about space weather, which is driven by the solar wind and other energetic outbursts from our star. Space weather is a primary suspect for what stripped away Mars' atmosphere, turning it from a habitable planet into an icy desert wasteland. On Earth, space weather can trigger geomagnetic storms that cause blackouts, damage satellites, interfere with radio and GPS signals, and even put astronauts at risk. On the bright side, it also gives Earth its signature glorious auroras.

The sun's magnetic field is extremely powerful, complex and dynamic. Space weather predictions require complicated computer simulations based on equations that describe how magnetic fields behave — but the sun is so large and convoluted that these equations will always be approximations. To improve the models' accuracy, scientists must collect extremely detailed measurements of the sun. This is where the Parker Solar Probe comes in.



The Parker Solar Probe is the first mission to fly into the sun's upper atmosphere, called the corona. It has been directly measuring magnetic fields and particles in and around the corona in unprecedented detail, providing scientific insight into the heliosphere (the sun's atmosphere, which encompasses the entire solar system in a massive, elongated bubble).

""These findings indicate that magnetic reconnection … is an important source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind,"" lead study author Mihir Desai, director of the Southwest Research Institute's Department of Space Research, said in a statement. ""Everywhere there are magnetic fields there will be magnetic reconnection. But the Sun's magnetic fields are much stronger near the star, so there's a lot more stored energy to be released.""

Understanding the workings of magnetic reconnection events could help scientists better predict harmful space weather, the researchers said.

""Reports from the American Meteorological Society indicated that the powerful solar events in May 2024 wreaked havoc with farmers when extreme geomagnetic storms disrupted the precise GPS-guided navigation systems used to plant, fertilize and harvest rows of seeds, causing an estimated loss of up to $500 million in earning potential,"" Desai said. ""Parker's access to this new data is critical, particularly as we remain in the midst of a very active solar cycle.""

The latest measurements of magnetic reconnection, reported in a paper published May 29 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, are one of many new discoveries Parker has made. In 2023, over 700 peer-reviewed scientific papers were published using data collected in the probe's first four years of operation, and there are still many more discoveries to be made. The spacecraft completed its second ultra-close flyby of the sun on March 22, zooming within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the sun's surface — matching its own record from December 2024.

Top Democrat adds he would support tech billionaire ‘sounding the alarm' to Americans on Trump bill amid feud

A leading elected Democrat rejected the idea of taking campaign donations from tech billionaire Elon Musk, whose spectacular fallout with former ally Donald Trump has roiled American politics.

Trump on Saturday said Musk will face “serious consequences” if he moves to support Democratic political candidates in any upcoming elections, following a public rift between the two men over Musk's staunch opposition to the cost of US president's planned piece of landmark domestic legislation.

But Cory Booker, a senator for New Jersey, scotched any idea he would take any Musk cash. “I would not accept money from Elon Musk for my campaign,” Booker told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday.

But Booker added, referring to the Republicans budget bill that Musk has criticized, “I would be supportive of anybody, including Elon Musk, putting resources forward right now to let more Americans know, sound the alarm, treat this like a Paul Revere moment.”

Booker added: “More Americans have to understand that if this bill passes, average Americans are going to see their costs skyrocket as this president again pushes legislation that is indicative of his chaos, corruption and cruelty towards Americans.”

The senator's comments come as Democrats wrestle with the how to turn the dramatic fallout between Musk and Trump into opportunity. Musk turned his back on the party in 2022 and contributed $270m to Trump's re-election campaign in 2024, providing crucial help in the Republican's eventual victory.

As the Trump-Musk feud intensified on Thursday, Musk posted on X: “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.,” clearly referring to any politician who supported Trump's budget bill.

Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman, reportedly talked with one of Musk's “senior confidants” on last week about whether Musk might now want to help the Democrats in the midterm elections next year.

“Having Elon speak out against the irrational tariff policy, against the deficit exploding Trump bill, and the anti-science and anti-immigrant agenda can help check Trump's unconstitutional administration,” Khanna told Semafor.

“I look forward to Elon turning his fire against Maga Republicans instead of Democrats in 2026,” Khanna, who has argued that his party was unwise to alienate Musk, told the outlet.

However, leftwing politicians, including Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have publicly pictured Musk as what voters should be against: powerful wealthy billionaires seeking influence through politics.

Sanders told CNN's State of the Union Sunday that Musk had “evolved” into an extremist since he voted for Obama in 2008.

“Over the years he has developed into a rightwing extremist. The issue and drama over what happened last week is that we are living, increasingly, in an oligarchic society. Musk said: ‘Hey listen, I spent $270m dollars to get you elected. I bought you the presidency …”

“This is a fight between oligarchs. It's a fight about power among the few, and it's really an embarrassment for those of us who believe in democracy and the rule of law,” Sanders added.

Musk said last month that he planned to spend “a lot less” on political campaigns as he scaled back and ultimately exited his time in government, where Trump had tasked him with massively slashing federal spending and jobs.

“In terms of political spending I'm going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk told a Bloomberg forum in Doha. Asked why, he responded: “I think I've done enough.”

But Musk's opposition to Trump's “One Big Beautiful” bill budget proposal, calling it an “disgusting abomination”, by definition puts him in relative proximity to Democratic positions on that issue.

Booker was asked if agreed with Musk about the planned legislation that Trump has made a centerpiece of his administration. “I agree that it's going to saddle this country with trillions of dollars of debt, endanger our entire economy … This is a morally wrong bill. And it's definitely, definitely an economically wrong bill as well.”

“This is not about right or left, it's about right or wrong,” he added. “And I welcome Elon Musk, not to my campaign. I welcome him right now, not to sit back and just fire off tweets, to get involved right now in a more substantive way and putting pressure on congresspeople and senators to not do this.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Thailand and Cambodia have reinforced their troops at a disputed border after a recent military skirmish. Tourists have been ordered not to use two border crossing points between the neighbors.

Thailand on Saturday shut two of its border crossings to tourists as a safety measure amid ongoing tensions with its neighbor, Cambodia.

The decision follows the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a brief military clash on May 28 in an area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of the two neighbors and Laos meet.

Thailand and Cambodia share an 817 kilometer (508 mile) border, first mapped by France in 1907 when Cambodia was its colony. For most of the following century, the neighbors have disputed various un-demarcated points along the frontier.

Authorities in the eastern province of Chanthaburi said in a statement that they had ""temporarily suspended"" crossings by Thai and Cambodian tourists at two permanent border checkpoints.

The Royal Thai Army cited a threat to Thailand's ""sovereignty and security"" as the reason for the move.

The army said trade would be unaffected and Cambodian workers could still enter Thailand.

Six other border checkpoints tightened their opening hours and issued bans on six-wheeled vehicles.

Thai Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said the army had reinforced its military presence at the border following an increase in troops on the other side.

""There has been a reinforcement of military presence [by Cambodia], which has exacerbated tensions along the border,"" Phumtham, who is also deputy prime minister, said in a statement. 

""Consequently, the Royal Thai Government has deemed it necessary to implement additional measures and to reinforce our military posture accordingly.""

The army said Friday it was ready to launch a ""high-level operation"" to counter any violation of Thailand's sovereignty.

Meanwhile, the Thai Foreign Ministry said Saturday that the country was committed to holding bilateral talks with Cambodia on June 14 to resolve the dispute.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet insisted in a speech Saturday that his country's stance was ""not to initiate conflict, but to defend ourselves.""

Hun said earlier this week that the kingdom would file a complaint with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the border dispute.

The two neighbors had agreed to ease tensions following last month's killing but Cambodia then said it would keep its troops in the area, in defiance of a request by Bangkok.

Fighting first broke out in 2008 over an 11th-century Hindu temple, leading to sporadic violence over several years.

At least 28 people have been killed.

The ICJ ruled in 2013 that the disputed area belonged to Cambodia, but Thailand says it does not accept the ICJ's jurisdiction and seeks a bilateral settlement.

The Southeast Asian regional bloc ASEAN and China have both made efforts to reduce tensions in recent days.

Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops onto the streets of Los Angeles after a second day of violent protests against his immigration policies.

It came after protesters on Saturday confronted federal immigration officers who had been carrying out raids on businesses in Paramount, on the outskirts of the city.

Border Patrol officers in riot gear and masks deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades to disperse demonstrators outside an industrial park, where some had vandalised federal vehicles.

Activists used cement blocks and shopping carts to block the road and jeered at officers, as they called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers (ICE) to get “out of Paramount”.

They also shouted: “We see you for what you are” and “you are not welcome here”.

One handheld sign read: “No human being is illegal”.

In a statement on Saturday, the White House said Mr Trump was deploying the National Guard – despite opposition from Gavin Newsom, California's governor – to “address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester”.

The US president also wrote on his Truth Social platform that if Mr Newsom and the Los Angeles mayor “can't do their jobs, which everyone knows they can't” then “the federal government will step in and solve the problem”.

Mr Newsom said the government was “moving to take over the California National Guard and deploy 2,000 soldiers” and warned it would only escalate tensions.

“This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust,” said Mr Newson, who on Friday branded the ICE arrests “cruel”.

The governor also insisted local authorities were “able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice,” adding: “There is currently no unmet need”.

Meanwhile, Pete Hegseth, the US secretary of defence, said he would consider deploying marines from nearby Camp Pendleton if the violence persisted.

Tom Homan, the White House's border czar, told Fox News: “This is about enforcing the law – and again, we're not going to apologise for doing it.”

It follows a protest outside a detention centre in downtown LA on Friday night during which dozens of people were arrested as they demonstrated against a series of ICE raids on workplaces earlier in the day.

Karen Bass, LA's Democrat mayor, provoked fury from Republicans after she claimed that ICE's activity had been intended to “sow terror” in the nation's second-largest city.

But Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, hit back as he criticised the city's response to the protests.

He said: “Mayor Bass took the side of chaos and lawlessness over law enforcement. Make no mistake, ICE will continue to enforce our nation's immigration laws and arrest criminal illegal aliens.”

ICE took 40 people into custody earlier on Friday after searching multiple locations, including a clothing warehouse in the city's fashion district.

But a tense scene then unfolded as a crowd tried to block agents from driving away.

Advocates for immigrants' rights said people had also been taken into detention after being stopped by ICE officers outside Home Depot stores and a doughnut shop.

The action came after a judge found probable cause that an employer was using fictitious documents for some of its workers, according to representatives for Homeland Security Investigations and the US Attorney's Office.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, posted a message on social media addressing “LA rioters” which warned that interference with immigration enforcement would not be tolerated.

“You will not stop us or slow us down,” Ms Noem said on X, adding that ICE would “enforce the law” and that “if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Dan Bongino, the FBI's deputy director, confirmed multiple arrests had been made on Friday.

He posted on X: “You bring chaos, and we'll bring handcuffs. Law and order will prevail.”

Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that recent ICE operations in LA resulted in the arrest of 118 immigrants.

Following the Friday arrests, protesters gathered in the evening outside a federal detention centre, chanting, “Set them free, let them stay!”

Some held signs with anti-ICE slogans, while others scrawled graffiti on the building.

Among those arrested was David Huerta, the regional president of the Service Employees International Union.

Ciaran McEvoy, a Justice Department spokesman, confirmed he was being detained ahead of a court appearance on Monday.

It was not clear whether Mr Huerta had legal representation.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, called for his immediate release.

In a social media post, Mr Schumer cited a “disturbing pattern of arresting and detaining American citizens for exercising their right to free speech.”

The immigration arrests come as Mr Trump and his administration push to fulfil promises of mass deportations across the country.
