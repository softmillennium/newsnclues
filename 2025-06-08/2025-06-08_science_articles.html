                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blood clots can form in both arteries and veins. A team of researchers from Lund University in Sweden has now discovered three gene variants that increase the risk of blood clots in the leg by up to 180 percent. There is a difference between arterial and venous blood clots. Blood clots in the arteries form when plaque in calcified vessels bursts and the body perceives it as an injury. This activates the platelets, which clump together and form a clot. In the worst case, it can lead to a stroke or heart attack. It is a common disease that has always been somewhat overshadowed by arterial blood clots," says Bengt Z√∂ller, a specialist in general medicine at Sk√•ne University Hospital and professor of general medicine at Lund University. In Sweden, more than 10,000 people suffer from venous thromboembolism each year and that number appears to be increasing. Ten per cent of 80-year-olds experience a blood clot at some point. The risk also increases if you are overweight or tall. Too much sedentary and inactive behaviour, then, is harmful. Therefore, tall people are more prone to blood clots, as their larger veins provide less blood flow, combined with the fact that blood must travel a greater distance back to the heart." High blood pressure, high levels of blood lipids and smoking are all risk factors for atherosclerosis of the arteries. Therefore, neither high blood pressure nor blood lipids are associated with venous clots and smoking is considered only a weak to moderate risk factor. Being overweight, on the other hand, is a very significant culprit. Obesity has a negative impact on venous circulation, especially when combined with the fact that overweight people are often less active. Some clotting factors are also affected by obesity. "In terms of diet, there are fewer studies, but ultra-processed foods have been associated with a slightly increased risk of blood clots, and plant-based, healthy foods with a reduced risk. In our studies, we have also seen that commercial fishermen have a lower risk, which may be due to a higher omega-3 content in their diet." There are also specific situations in which the risk of venous blood clots is particularly high. Particularly during pregnancy, blood clotting factors increase and levels of some protective proteins may decrease. "In these risk situations, prophylaxis in the form of blood thinners may be particularly important if other risk factors are also present." In Sweden, we have a high prevalence of APC (activated protein C) resistance due to an inherited mutation in the gene for coagulation factor V, called Factor V Leiden. "Evolutionarily, bleeding less has been an advantage, but in our modern, sedentary society, APC resistance is becoming a risk factor." Bengt Z√∂ller and his fellow researchers have now identified the strongest genetic risk factor since Factor V Leiden was discovered. By selecting 27 genes previously associated with clotting disorders, they found three variants that, when taken together, were as significant a risk factor for venous blood clots as Factor V Leiden: ABO, F8, and VWF each increased the risk of venous blood clots by 10 to 30 percent. Unlike Factor V Leiden, which is only found in Indo-Europeans, these three different mutations are found in between five and fifty per cent of various populations around the globe." As these genetic variants are present in all populations, the next step is to investigate how the number of risk genes affects the duration of treatment with anticoagulants after a blood clot. "I think tailoring treatment based on risk assessment will become increasingly important," concludes Bengt Z√∂ller. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Animals of all kinds have thrived in humanity's absence. As the world's greatest nuclear disaster approaches its 40th anniversary, biologists are now taking a closer look at the animals located inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), which is about the size of Yosemite National Park, and investigating how decades of radiation exposure may have altered animals' genomes‚Äîand even, possibly, sped up evolution. Their results were published in the journal Science Advances. ‚ÄúDo they have mutations that they've acquired that allow them to live and breed successfully in this region?‚Äù co-author Elaine Ostrander, a dog genomics expert at the National Human Genome Research Institute, told The New York Times. The idea of radiation speeding up natural evolution isn't a new one. Scientists have been analyzing certain animals living within the CEZ for years, including bacteria, rodents, and even birds. One study back in 2016 found that Eastern tree frogs (Hyla orientalis), which are usually a green color, were more commonly black within the CEZ. This made scientists ponder: could something similar be happening to Chernobyl's wild dogs? While this may seem to heavily imply that these dogs have undergone some type of rapid mutation or evolution due to radiation exposure, this study is only a first step in proving that hypothesis. One environmental scientist, speaking with Science News, says that these studies can be tricky business, largely due to the fact that sussing out radiation-induced mutations from other effects, like inbreeding, is incredibly difficult. However, this study provides a template for further investigation into the effects of radiation on larger mammals, as the DNA of dogs roaming the Chernobyl Power Plant and nearby Chernobyl City can be compared to dogs living in non-irradiated areas. Despite a current lack of firm conclusions, the study has shown once again that an area that‚Äîby all rights‚Äîshould be a wasteland has become an unparalleled scientific opportunity to understand radiation and its impact on natural evolution. üìß To always be in the know, sign up for our newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have developed a laboratory earthquake model that connects the microscopic real contact area between fault surfaces to the possibility of earthquake occurrences. Down the road, this could lead to new approaches for monitoring and predicting earthquake nucleation at early stages." For decades, scientists have relied on empirical "rate-and-state" friction laws to model earthquakes -- mathematical descriptions that work well but don't explain the underlying physical mechanisms. "Our model reveals what's actually happening at the fault interface during an earthquake cycle." Barbot says the discovery is a deceptively simple concept: "When two rough surfaces slide against each other, they only make contact at minuscule, isolated junctions covering a fraction of the total surface area." This "real area of contact" -- invisible to the eye but measurable through optical techniques -- turns out to be the key state variable that controls earthquake behavior. Using high-speed cameras and optical measurements, the team tracked how LED light transmission changed as contact junctions formed, grew and were destroyed during laboratory earthquakes. "We can literally watch the contact area evolve as ruptures propagate," Barbot said. "During fast ruptures, we see approximately 30% of the contact area disappear in milliseconds -- a dramatic weakening that drives the earthquake." As contact areas change during the earthquake cycle, they affect multiple measurable properties including electrical conductivity, hydraulic permeability and seismic wave transmission. The implications extend far beyond academic understanding and laboratory experiments. "If we can monitor these properties continuously on natural faults, we might detect the early stages of earthquake nucleation," Barbot explained. "This could lead to new approaches for monitoring earthquake nucleation at early stages, well before seismic waves are radiated." The researchers plan to scale up their findings outside controlled laboratory conditions. "Imagine a future where we can detect subtle changes in fault conditions before an earthquake strikes," Barbot said. In addition to Barbot, Baoning Wu, formerly at USC and now at the University of California, San Diego, authored the study. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the Mission: Impossible films, superspy Ethan Hunt -- played by Tom Cruise -- gets orders from his superiors on various devices that self-destruct in five seconds. "Transient electronics can be used for biomedical and environmental applications, but they must disintegrate in a biosafe manner," said Choi, a faculty member at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. "You don't want to have toxic residues inside your body. For transient or bioresorbable electronics, the key challenge is the power source -- but most power sources, like lithium-ion batteries, include toxic material." Choi and his student research team took lessons from their previous research into biobatteries and applied that knowledge to a new idea: In a paper recently published in the journal Small, they show the potential of using probiotics -- live microorganisms that offer health benefits when ingested but are otherwise harmless to the environment or humans. Maedeh Mohammadifar, PhD '20, a graduate of Choi's Bioelectronics and Microsystems Lab, developed the original dissolvable microbial fuel cell during her time as a Binghamton student. "We used well-known electricity-producing bacteria, which is within biosafety level 1, so it is safe -- but we were not sure what would happen if these bacteria were released into nature," Choi said. "But whenever I made presentations at conferences, people would ask: 'So, you are using bacteria? Current PhD student Maryam Rezaie led the latest research using a premade blend of 15 probiotics. Early results proved unpromising, he added, but "we didn't give up. We engineered in an electrode surface that might be preferable to the bacteria, using polymer and some nanoparticles to hypothetically improve the electrocatalytic behavior of probiotics and give them a boost." Although they produced only a small amount of power, Choi looks at the experiments as a proof of concept for him and future students to build on. "We used probiotic blends, but I want to study individually which ones have the extra electric genes, and how synergistic interactions can improve the power generation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, scientists Irene Chiolo and Chiara Merigliano at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences have discovered that a protein called Nup98, long known for helping traffic molecules in and out of the cell's nucleus, plays another surprising role: guiding the cell's most delicate repairs and reducing the risk of genetic mistakes that can lead to cancer. These "condensates" act as protective bubbles around broken strands of DNA in areas called heterochromatin -- zones where the genetic material is so tightly packed that making accurate repairs is especially challenging. Heterochromatin -- a major focus of Chiolo's research -- is filled with repeated DNA sequences, making it easy for the cell to confuse one stretch for another. Nup98's droplets help lift the damaged section out of that dense zone and create a safer space where it can be repaired accurately, reducing the chance of genetic mix-ups that could lead to cancer. Timing is everything when it comes to DNA repair, and one of Nup98's most important roles is knowing when to say, "Not yet." The protein's droplet-like condensates act as a temporary shield around damaged DNA, keeping out certain repair proteins that can cause trouble if they arrive too soon. One of those proteins, called Rad51, can accidentally stitch together the wrong pieces of DNA if it gets involved too early in the process. By coordinating this carefully staged process, Nup98 helps cells avoid dangerous genetic rearrangements -- a key part of maintaining genome stability and slowing processes responsible for cancer and aging. Many DNA repair mechanisms in fruit flies are shared across species, making them a powerful model for understanding genome stability. The Nup98 discovery could have real-world impact, especially for diseases like acute myeloid leukemia, where mutations in Nup98 are known to play a role. The team also sees long-term potential for therapies that could enhance or mimic Nup98's protective functions, reducing the risk of genome instability, which is a major factor not only in cancer, but also in aging and other genome instability disorders.
