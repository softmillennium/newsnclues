                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A disastrous 3–0 defeat to Norway on Friday ultimately signalled the end of Spalletti's reign two years after he was appointed. Spalletti is likely to make some changes from the side that were embarrassed in Oslo but he will surely persist with his 3-5-2 formation. Personnel shouldn't matter too much against Moldova, though. GK: Gianluigi Donnarumma—Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League hero was unable to deny the likes of Alexander Sørloth and Erling Haaland last time out. CB: Giovanni Di Lorenzo—Di Lorenzo's performance was far from flawless against Norway but Moldova are an entirely different and vastly simpler proposition. A clean sheet will likely come in his maiden outing. CB: Alessandro Bastoni—Bastoni has not enjoyed the past few weeks after Serie A and Champions League final disappointment with Inter was followed by humiliation in Oslo. RWB: Andrea Cambiaso—Davide Zappacosta left much to be desired last time out and Cambiaso should replace him down the right-hand side. He will have plenty of freedom to fly up and down the flank. CM: Nicolò Barella—Much like his Inter teammates in the Azzurri setup, it's been a challenging few weeks for Barella. CM: Davide Frattesi—Frattesi helped Italy find some stability in midfield after halftime in Norway and has done his chances of starting against Moldova no harm. CM: Sandro Tonali—Tonali will be given the licence to make forward runs against Moldova and will hope to break the box as effectively as he does in Newcastle United colours. LWB: Destiny Udogie—Udogie, perhaps still shaken by the news of Ange Postecoglou's dismissal, should see off competition from Federico Dimarco and start again on Monday. ST: Giacomo Raspadori—The recent Serie A champion was unable to provide any significant threat in Scandinavia but should have a much easier assignment against a Moldova defence that has conceded eight times in their last two games. ST: Mateo Retegui—Retegui has generally been sharp for the Azzurri but needs greater service moving forward. Moldova will not be excited by the prospect of facing the Atalanta forward after he scored 28 goals in his debut season with La Dea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CBA limits player prize money to $1m per team New proposal gives players 20% of total performance prize Major League Soccer has submitted a new proposal to its players concerning how bonuses for the Club World Cup will be paid, a source familiar with negotiations has told the Guardian. According to the source, the league's offer would see players earn 20% of a team's performance-based prize money at each stage of the tournament with no agreed-upon cap on maximum payout. This means each group of MLS players competing in the tournament would collectively receive $200,000 for a group stage win (from a total prize of $1m), $400,000 for a group stage win (from a total prize of $2m per team, per win), $1.5m for making the Round of 16 (from a total prize of $7.5m) and so on. The players' current bonus structure, outlined in the MLSPA's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the league, allows MLS players to receive half of any prize or participation money awarded to a team competing in an outside tournament, but with a hard cap of $1m. With the Club World Cup's $9.5m participation prize given to MLS teams, players had already maxed out their maximum payout and would have not been entitled to any more money for progress in the tournament. Alternatively, if an MLS team loses all of its games at the Club World Cup, the players will still only receive a $1m collective bonus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Major League Soccer made a proposal to the MLS Players Association that would increase performance-based bonuses in this summer's FIFA Club World Cup, but the two sides don't appear close to an agreement. The union responded forcefully to that offer in a statement on Sunday afternoon, calling the league's proposal “retaliatory” and saying the league had “ignored months of attempts by players to engage” until making its offer on Friday. According to the terms of the current collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified in February 2021, MLS players would be paid a maximum of $1 million in prize money from the highly lucrative tournament. MLS teams will be paid a minimum of $9.55 million for their participation in the Club World Cup. What it didn't account for at the time was a new FIFA-run tournament with unprecedented prize money. The new MLS proposal would give players the $1 million from the $9.55 million participation fee, as agreed in the CBA, but would add another 20 percent to any money earned beyond that — including for wins, draws and advancement to further rounds. In addition, MLS previously decided to pay LAFC players an additional $250,000 in bonuses for its win over Club America in the play-in game to the Club World Cup, which followed Club León's expulsion from the competition. The league also gave an option for owners to convert up to $750,000 of the $9.55 million participation fee into general allocation money, which effectively serves as cap space. “MLS spent most of last week making threats and promising retaliation against the MLSPA and players because Seattle players wore T-shirts that expressed frustration over the league's refusal to engage about Club World Cup compensation,” the statement read. “After ignoring months of attempts by players to engage, late Friday afternoon, less than 48 hours before LAFC and Seattle players were to take the field once again, the league finally provided the PA with their first proposal on this issue. As promised, this proposal was retaliatory in nature.” An update on Club World Cup Bonuses. MLS spent most of last week making threats and promising retaliation against the MLSPA and players because Seattle players wore t-shirts that expressed frustration over the league's refusal to engage about Club World Cup compensation. “The timing, substance, and retaliatory nature of the proposal sends a clear message: MLS does not respect or value players' efforts with regard to this tournament,” the MLSPA statement reads. “MLS's refusal to negotiate in good faith has created a major distraction for the players who should be focusing on preparing for a major international competition. However, players will not be silenced by threats from MLS. The players remain united in using their collective voice and demanding a fair share of the rewards earned from their hard work.” There have been few public details about what other teams are paying players for their participation in the tournament. A union spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question asking what the union was using as its “international standard.” That change would require player approval and changes to the CBA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -- It would've been easy for coach Mauricio Pochettino and the players on his U.S. men's national team to hang their heads in despair after squandering a first-minute lead and losing to Türkiye 2-1 in Saturday's friendly in front of more than 34,000 fans at the University of Connecticut's football stadium. And given its self-inflicted nature — the hosts never recovered from two first-half defensive miscues — the result was a maddening one for a program that desperately needed some good vibes after finishing last out of four teams in March's Concacaf Nations League finals. So many positives to take away from that game," U.S. midfielder Tyler Adams said afterward. [RELATED: Defensive miscues cost USMNT as losing streak reach three] They scored just once in each of the Nations League losses to Panama and Canada. So things were looking up when Jack McGlynn finished off a beautiful passing sequence with an even better shot to give the Americans a 1-0 lead just 58 seconds into Saturday's contest before two mistakes in a three-minute span at the opposite end of the field ultimately did them in. There are no moral victories in top-level international sports. Still, all things considered, this isn't a case of the Americans simply trying to spin another setback as something better. There are actually things to build on before Tuesday's second and final pre-Gold Cup warmup against another top European foe in Switzerland. "The team showed what it needed to show," Pochettino said. "For sure, playing in this way, we are going to win most of the games. The two March defeats would've been bad however they happened. That the Americans seemed strangely disinterested was damning. "After March, I think we really kind of had to look inside of ourselves and figure out what was the problem," said center back Chris Richards, who served as the U.S. captain in Saturday's match. And if you make a mistake in possession, then so be it. It's now three losses in a row for Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT, but Saturday's result did garner some positives. For a variety of reasons, 14 of the 25 players on the March squad aren't with the USMNT this month, including lock starters like AC Milan star Christian Pulisic and Premier League standout Antonee "Jedi" Robinson. Meantime, Türkiye's XI included players from European titans like Real Madrid and Juventus. "It's really important for us, especially going into a World Cup, to play this caliber of teams." "They're fearless, and that's the reason that they're here," Adams said of the MLS contingent, which included three international debutants in goalkeeper Matt Freese and second-half substitutes Nathan Harriel and Quinn Sullivan. "These young players just need to be playing games. It doesn't matter the league that they're playing in. MLS players have always been valuable for the national team." The experience was valuable even for U.S. established players like Johnny Cardoso and Malik Tillman. Usually used as reserves, both players are expected to log a huge number of minutes this summer at the Gold Cup with some of the regular starters unavailable. So while Cardoso's error led to Türkiye's equalizer, he'll have every chance to make up for it in the weeks ahead. "He's a top, top player," Adams said of Cardoso, who is coming off a career season with Real Betis in Spain's vaunted LaLiga and has been linked with a move to Atlético Madrid. [RELATED: Cardoso, Musah, Reyna among USMNT names who could use a transfer] And Pochettino raved about Tillman's performance, even though the German-American probably should've scored on a point-blank second-half header. "He was showing personality, character — not only with the ball at his feet [but also] in the way we need to go to press…knowing when we press high, never complain, and always try and try and try." After March, it was almost a secondary consideration.

The 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup will be held from September 5–27 next year in Poland. It was an end-to-end match with Canada's powerful striker Annabelle Chukwu, who plays at Notre Dame, providing most of the danger for her side. Canada did have a higher expected goals over the USA – 0.94 to 0.45 – but the USA had an edge in shots on goal at 5-2. That ignited a tremendous push for an equalizer in the last 20 minutes plus seven more of stoppage time, but the USA could not beat experienced Canadian goalkeeper Noelle Henning, who played a solid match while making five saves. An 87th-minute shot from midfielder Linda Ullmark tested Henning and she had to parry the bouncing ball away for a corner kick.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea are pushing hard to get business done early in this transfer window in order to have the best squad possible to compete for glory in the Club World Cup. It will be the first time the competition takes place in its new format, with Chelsea adding to their trophy cabinet when taking part in the old style back in 2022. They lost 1-0 in the final, however missed a heap of chances against the Brazilian side. Fernando Torres was unfortunately responsible for a number of these. The Spaniard was desperately trying to get his Chelsea career up and running following his £50m move from Liverpool, however struggled over in Japan to put an end to his goalscoring woes. Drogba had tipped Torres to be the next great striker at Stamford Bridge following his departure, however  this certainly didn't come off throughout his time in West London. After his time at Chelsea, the Spaniard would move to AC Milan and return for a spell at Atletico Madrid, before finishing his career in Japan. Since then, Torres has taken to coaching, becoming the manager of Atletico's Under 19 side after coming through the club's academy himself. He has worked his way up through the age groups, and is now in charge of the club's ‘B side', who currently play in the third tier of Spanish football. Torres will no doubt be looking for inspiration from former national team colleague Cesc Fabregas, who is currently making a great name for himself in charge of Como in Italy.</p>

The rest is distributed based on match results. Lumen Field (Seattle): The Sounders will play all three of their home matches there. Lionel Messi (Inter Miami): The Argentine legend will celebrate his 38th birthday during the Club World Cup and has shown that he hasn't lost his touch. It remains to be seen whether his team can compete with the world's elite clubs, but Messi surely is up to the task. Kylian Mbappé (Real Madrid): French star finished with 42 goals in all competitions in his first season with Madrid, broke Iván Zamorano's record for the most goals in a debut season and won European Golden Boot. Harry Kane (Bayern Munich): The 31-year-old England captain scored 37 goals across all competitions (26 in 31 Bundesliga appearances and 11 in 13 UEFA Champions League games). Omar Marmoush (Manchester City): Egyptian forward left Eintracht Frankfurt in January and made an immediate impact at Man City with eight goals in 22 games. Désiré Doué (PSG): French 20-year-old was Man of the Match (a pair of goals and an assist) in the Champions League final and was instrumental in PSG winning the quadruple (Ligue 1 title, Coupe de France, Trophée des Champions, Champions League). Franco Mastantuono (River Plate): This 17-year-old midfielder is already being anointed as the next great player out of Argentina after becoming the youngest player ever to appear in an official game for the senior national team. He is reportedly headed to Real Madrid for a $45 million transfer fee after being wooed by PSG and Manchester United. Cole Palmer (Chelsea): Left his childhood club Manchester City for Chelsea in 2023 and went on to score 40 goals across all competitions over the past two seasons. Estevao (Palmeiras): This 18-year-old Brazilian is Palmeiras' leading scorer this season, with eight goals in all competitions so far in 2025. He has made four appearances for the Brazilian national team and is headed to Chelsea for a reported $68 million transfer fee. Others to keep an eye on: Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Rodri (Manchester City), Ousmane Dembele (PSG), Julian Alvarez (Atletico Madrid), Karim Konate (Salzburg), Kenan Yildiz (Juventus), Fidel Ambriz (Monterrey), Jamie Gittens (Dortmund), Kaua Elias (Flumeninse), Amanallah Memmiche (Tunis) Each confederation was awarded a set number of places based upon its strength. There was also a spot reserved for the host country, which FIFA granted to Inter Miami as winner of the 2023 Leagues Cup and 2024 Supporters' Shield for best regular season record. It also didn't hurt that Messi is a world legend and big draw wherever he plays. Inter Miami's selection for the tournament was controversial because the team has not won an MLS Cup, but league commissioner Don Garber defended FIFA's decision. “This is FIFA's tournament, and they picked a host. I'm excited about putting Miami up in a showcase around the world to kick off the Club World Cup in our country, in our stadiums as a launch to the World Cup and I couldn't be more excited about it.” Twenty-four games will also be shown on TNT, TBS, TruTV in English.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid is focused on the signings they can make ahead of the Club World Cup this summer. Huijsen and Alexander Arnold were the first two reinforcements they officially announced. But things are getting more complicated than expected for the Madridists with Álvaro Carreras. Benfica has gotten serious and could cause a problem for the young full-back. If they haven't signed him by then, Carreras could miss out on the World Cup. This will happen if Benfica includes him in their squad list and officially registers him for the World Cup. If that happens and he later ends up signing for Real Madrid, it'll be a mess. He won't be able to play in the tournament this summer with the Madridists, but he also won't be able to do so with the Portuguese team. Xabi Alonso has insisted on signing Álvaro Carreras to have him already for the Club World Cup. It seemed there wouldn't be any problems, since the former Madridist youth player wants to return to Real Madrid. But that hasn't managed to unblock the negotiations so far. That way, Carreras will be at the World Cup and will do so under Xabi Alonso's orders. That's everyone's desire, but for now, it hasn't been confirmed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Real Madrid goalkeeper is expected to play in Ukraine's second game of the Canadian Soccer Shield tournament on June 10. In the aftermath of Ukraine's 4-2 defeat against Canada on Saturday, head coach Serhiy Rebrov answered Managing Madrid's question on the status of Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin at the post-match press conference in BMO Field, Toronto. Mehedi Hassan (Managing Madrid): Hi Serhiy, welcome to Canada first of all, tough game—hope you guys will bounce back against New Zealand. I just wanted to ask you about Andriy Lunin—how do you see his physical level ahead of the Club World Cup that's coming up with Real Madrid?Serhiy Rebrov (Head Coach, Ukraine): He is absolutely fine, we have three goalkeepers. Andriy is going to play in the second game. He's ready for the World Cup. I asked Ukraine head coach Serhiy Rebrov about Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin on how is Lunin's physical level before the Club World Cup. The coach replied he is doing fine, will be playing in Ukraine's next game and is ready for the World Cup. Lunin stayed on the bench for the entirety of the 90 minutes of Ukraine's difficult start in the four-team invitational competition among hosts Canada, Ukraine, Côte d'Ivoire and New Zealand. As per the head coach, Lunin is expected to play in their second game against New Zealand on June 10. These will be important minutes for him to get back into some sort of rhythm before reporting to Xabi Alonso for the preparations of the FIFA Club World Cup in the USA, starting just under a couple of weeks from now. Lunin is expected to remain as Thibaut Courtois's deputy in the global tournament but the team will obviously expect him to be in the best shape to appear at any moment if required.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From missing stars and top teams to concerns over player welfare, here are five key talking points before the 2025 Club World Cup. A new-look FIFA Club World Cup, featuring 32 teams, kicks off in the United States on June 14 and runs through to the final on July 13. FIFA's decision to expand the Club World Cup from a six- or eight-team tournament to a supersized 32-team edition has been criticised by FIFPRO, the global football players' union, and the World Leagues Forum (WLF). Legitimate questions have been raised about the extra workload on players due to the increased number of matches, and the corresponding reduction in rest and recovery time for players in a shortened off season. “The FIFA Council's decision to schedule the first edition of the 32-team FIFA Club World Cup between 15 June and 13 July 2025 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives,” FIFPRO said in a statement in December. A report released by FIFPRO and Football Benchmark in April found that several Club World Cup-bound players are among the most overworked for the 2024-25 season. The report's findings estimated that Real Madrid's Federico Valverde, who made 43 back-to-back appearances up until April 1 with fewer than five days of recovery time before these matches, could potentially reach 65 back-to-back appearances for club and country by the end of the season, racking up close to 7,000 minutes and 78 games. The WLF, an organisation representing 44 major professional leagues that is chaired by Premier League chief Richard Masters, said the organisation was unhappy that it had been overlooked in FIFA's decision-making process. With every group having at least two clubs from Europe or South America, teams from the other continental confederations, such as Asia or Africa, could find themselves having very little chance of glory against the heavyweights of the game. For example, in Group G, Moroccan side Wydad AC and UAE Pro League Al Ain are pitted against Manchester City and Juventus, who have been supremely successful on the domestic and continental stage. So, history suggests that the presence of European or South American sides could lead to lopsided matchups in this year's edition. While Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe will play at the tournament, fans will be denied an opportunity to watch many of the elite performers from the 2024-25 season, such as Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, the Premier League's Golden Boot winner, or teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal, who won three trophies this year with Barcelona. Inter Miami gained entry by topping Major League Soccer's regular season standings, despite losing in the first round of the playoffs – a decision critics say shows FIFA's desperation to have Inter's Argentina great Messi at their inaugural showpiece. Apart from the winners of each confederation's premier club competitions, teams qualified according to a ranking based on their performances over a four-year period. Barcelona, the current La Liga champions, missed out on a spot due to the four-year club coefficient rankings and two-team restrictions, as their archrivals Real Madrid qualified for the Club World Cup alongside Atletico Madrid. Prodigious talents like Romelu Lukaku and Scott McTominay, who ushered Napoli's stunning 2024-25 Serie A title charge in Italy, will also not play. FIFA's move has led to speculation that Cristiano Ronaldo could be one of those players to put pen to paper during the window on a short-term deal for one of the participating clubs. Spanish newspaper Marca reported in late May that a club in Brazil had submitted an offer to sign Ronaldo. Ronaldo, 40, has hinted he could leave Al Nassr after declaring that a “chapter is over” hours after the Saudi Pro League finished. Al Nassr have not qualified for the Club World Cup, unlike fellow Saudi side Al Hilal, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino recently said “there are discussions” over Ronaldo playing at the Club World Cup. The Portugal star confirmed on Saturday that he had received “quite a few” offers from participating clubs to play for them at the tournament, but had decided against accepting any. A club which has already benefitted from this special transfer window is Real Madrid, which was able to reach an agreement with Liverpool to sign defender Trent Alexander-Arnold early and make him available for the tournament. Fans in the US will get a glimpse of what the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil will look like when they attend the Club World Cup matches this year. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be co-hosted by the US alongside Canada and Mexico, running for more than a month with 100+ matches. Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, Seattle's Lumen Field and Miami's Hard Rock Stadium are the other venues which will be involved in both tournaments. The venues, though, might not be filled to their full capacity as organisers have struggled to sell tickets, with club fan tickets, general public tickets, and hospitality sections all still up for sale on the official FIFA site, nearly two weeks out from the start of the event.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Still wearing his Team USA gear, the tall 24-year-old moved slowly. He signed posters, balls, Team USA kits, even a Christian Pulisic jersey and whatever else the kids handed down to him after the United States Men's National Team's 2-1 loss to Türkiye on Saturday. He chatted and patiently posed for pictures, even handling strangers' phones to better frame the selfie for them. Just over 15 years ago, Agyemang was in those same bleacher seats. It didn't matter that USA lost 4-2. It's amazing,” said Agyemang, smiling at the memory. Agyemang's soccer career began a couple of good kicks from the spot where he's standing. He grew up across town in East Hartford and saw the excitement, not to mention the traffic, that came to town every time the Untied States men's and women's national teams hosted games at the region's best grass field. But reaching that level was more than a long shot. They invite them to enroll in their academies, which help cultivate talent and prepare players for professional careers. At East Hartford High School, he was ignored by all seven Division I schools in Connecticut and Agyemang ended up at Division III Eastern Connecticut State for two seasons before transferring to Rhode Island. Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang (33) plays against FC Cincinnati during an MLS soccer match in Charlotte, N.C., Saturday, March 15, 2025. After scoring 10 goals for Charlotte last year, Agyemang was named to the national team roster in January and had goals in his first two career matches against Costa Rica and Venezuela. On Saturday, he got the chance to play at home. He secured 25 tickets for friends and family, including his parents, who'd never seen him don red, white and blue before. This is my hometown, so to be back here it was amazing,” he said. The American roster that faced the Turks didn't feature many players who have locked up a spot on the Team USA roster for next year's World Cup, which is almost exactly a year away. Like Agyemang, most of the players were trying to improve their chances to crack the roster. It was an opportunity for the young striker to prove something against tougher competition. “It was maybe his first time playing against two center backs with their experience and their quality, they are playing in the top in Europe,” Mauricio Pochettino said. “Today I saw Patrick fight with two players who are some of the toughest center backs in the world.” United States forward Patrick Agyemang (24) leaps for the ball between Turkiye defenders during an international friendly Saturday, June 7, 2025, in East Hartford, Conn. (AP Photo/Mary Schwalm)AP While fighting against them is a good first step, Agyemang was focused on thriving. While he's not ignoring the tantalizing prospect of making Team USA's World Cup roster, he's more focused on improving than auditioning at this point. “I just want to continue getting better, I'm still relatively new to this environment and obviously the level of it is different. I struggled in each step,” he said. “I just want everyone to know if you're really committed, you can't worry about the noise because I heard it all. But at the end of the day, as long as you keep going anything can happen.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Romania came into the match in the Austrian capital of Vienna in fine form after winning seven of their last eight games (L1), and it didn't take Mircea Lucescu's side long to flex their attacking muscles. Only eight minutes had passed before two early appeals for penalties were turned down by referee Maurizio Mariani. An all-action beginning to the contest continued with Horatiu Moldovan producing a fine save to keep Sabitzer from opening the scoring. The deadlock then should have been broken nine minutes later. Austria authoritatively continued to search for the game's opening goal before half-time, but it appeared at first sight that Das Team would have to settle for a goalless game at the break as Moldovan twice denied Sabitzer in between acrobatically keeping out Romano Schmid's fierce strike. However, that all changed in the 42nd minute as Wober's header back into the danger zone was powerfully volleyed in by Michael Gregoritsch. Leading by example, Sabitzer finally got his name onto the scoresheet with a strike from just outside of the area that took a double deflection before it beat Moldovan at his near post. Despite being two goals to the good, Austria were left indebted to Patrick Pentz throughout the concluding stages, as he pulled off two stunning saves to prevent Nicolae Stanciu's set-piece and substitute Adrian Sut's ambitious long-range effort from setting up an intriguing finale. Denis Alibec headed home a late consolation for Romania with the last kick of the match, however, it was too late to spoil an opening day FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifying success for Austria that puts them in good stride for their match against Group H outsiders San Marino on Tuesday. Flashscore Man of the Match: Marcel Sabitzer (Austria)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They will be hoping to give a good account of themselves, having been buoyed by their recent triumph in the Conference League and securing a top-five finish in the Premier League. It has already been a productive window for the Blues, who signed Liam Delap from Ipswich Town earlier this week. The former Manchester City man penned a six-year deal at Stamford Bridge and will travel to the Club World Cup with his new team. They are said to be making rapid progress in their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens, who has emerged as a top target. Fabrizio Romano, meanwhile, reports that Chelsea have submitted an opening bid in the region of £29.5million. Gittens remains under contract until the summer of 2028, meaning Dortmund are under no pressure to sell if their demands are not met. Chelsea also remain in talks over a move for AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, with Enzo Maresca eager to recruit an established stopper. He has also reached an agreement on personal terms with the Blues, according to TEAMtalk. Don't miss...

Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike is another reported target for Chelsea, having piqued their interest with his prolific form in Germany. He scored 22 goals in the season just gone and has been touted for a big move to the Premier League this summer. Chelsea are firmly in the hunt to complete a deal before the Club World Cup but have reservations about Ekitike's asking price, according to Bild. Time is running out for Chelsea to sign all three players, with the first part of the summer transfer window set to end on Tuesday. But if they can get those deals over the line, they will be able to travel to the Club World Cup with a revamped squad.

Turkey ultimately prevailed by a 2-1 decision, but that didn't stop attendees from enjoying the experience of catching the national team locally. Fans like Ed Szymanski lined up and tailgated for hours before the game, eager to catch a rare live appearance by the national team in Connecticut. RELATED: New Haven United Football Club begins its inaugural season in the National Premier Soccer League You don't get to see the U.S. national team here too often, so when they are here, I make it a point to show my support,” Szymanski said. Saturday's match marked the team's first game in Hartford since 2023. The U.S. is gearing up for a busy summer, including the CONCACAF Gold Cup, which will be hosted by the United States and Canada from June 14 to July 6. Fans like Brendan McCabe were also looking ahead to 2026, when the U.S. will co-host the FIFA World Cup. “We're waiting for the World Cup, okay? We're gonna make a move for the World Cup, we're going hard this year,” McCabe said. Excitement was especially high for East Hartford native Patrick Agyemang, who made the national team. “A lot of us played soccer growing up, we love to support the boys. Local kid, it's a great thing that he's here playing with the team,” McCabe said. Fans Katie Tougas and Colleen Demko shared that sentiment. “It's so exciting to see someone from Connecticut here. “In a sport where there's so much hype from overseas, [seeing] someone local to Connecticut being this far along and doing so great is really awesome,” Demko said. With recent changes to the roster and a new head coach at the helm, many people are eager to see how the team performs heading into tournament season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team failed to end its current winless run on Saturday in Connecticut, but remains positive heading into its final pre-CONCACAF Gold Cup match. Mauricio Pochettino's squad suffered a 2-1 friendly loss to No. 27 ranked Turkey at Rentschler Field in the first match of a busy June schedule. Jack McGlynn's second international goal was cancelled out by a pair of quick goals from Arda Guler and Kerem Akturkoglu, handing the Americans their third three-match losing streak in consecutive years. Tyler Adams, Haji Wright, and Quinn Sullivan were among the second-half substitutions which came close to sparking a comeback in the match while Luca De La Torre and Malik Tillman delivered positive performances. Pochettino voiced his team's positives in the match and believed they deserved a better outcome overall. “The performance was good,” Pochettino told media postgame on Saturday. “We faced a team like Turkey, which is a very good team with the experienced players at the top. This group of players after playing together for the first time, I think we started the game so well. We played 20 minutes at a high level. “But if we go to only focus on the performance, I think we perform really well and now we can be focused on how we can improve on the situation and be focused only on game situations.” Pochettino doesn't have several of his star players this summer including Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, and Yunus Musah, opening the door to many fresh faces. Sullivan, Alex Freeman, and Matt Freese all earned their senior debuts in Saturday's match while McGlynn and Max Arfsten were among the young MLS contingent to earn important minutes in their development. Despite the USMNT now being winless in their last three matches, and next set to face off with No. 20 ranked Switzerland on Tuesday, Pochettino expected some growing pains heading into the Gold Cup. “We knew that the level of the players are at different levels, that is why these two weeks are important to prepare for the Gold Cup,” Pochettino said. “I think we want to win and compete really well in the Gold Cup. “I think what I cannot complain about is that every single player was very connected with the team,” he added. And that is why I think the impact of the whole team, I am so happy with that.” Should the USMNT suffer defeat in Nashville on Tuesday, it will mark their first four-match losing streak since 2007. we are tentative the end you should be aggressive; swashbuckling the end you should be low risk. At this rate Poch might be canned if we blunder the Gold Cup. A really crappy time for the USMNT and its supporters. Mcglynn has the tools to be a traditional 10. Passing and creative with an excellent left foot. But with that being said I think he could be a very useful sub in multiple positions. I liked what Quinn brought off of the bench. Agyemang has many tools which will be useful. I want to see Luna and Tillman combine a bit more. I like LDLT ability to break through the lines with his dribbling just needs to get a bit quicker in his decision making. Would like to see how Brendo looks on the right. however for the Hope Merchants, it was the subs who scored through a quick attack punctuated by mcglynn's direct go to goal effort. but they were dominated after 15′ and lost the contest. not dropped on a head but more played into space. on paper this should have been a tie with zero improvement, a win if the coach is adding anything. at some point this is supposed to actualize. Nobody looked sharp, dangerous or lethal in front of goal The shot attempts on goal look desperate rather than calculated or deliberate Haji Wright and Patrick Agyemang couldn't seem to get by anyone for a good strike on goal (Agyemang couldn't seem to use his size to hold off defenders at all) Johnny Cardoso made a dreadful mistake but the USMNT still dominated the midfield in the first half with him on the field Overall we looked more well organized, structured and composed (for the most part) than out last 2-3 games The real test will be THE SWITZERLAND GAME……as they were clinical and seemed to capitalized on every Mexico mistake ……..a Mexico with Santiago Giménez, Raúl Jiménez, Roberto Alvarado, Carlos Rodríguez, and Érik Lira. USMNT will need to tighten up defensively against Switzerland, as every error made by Mexico was almost converted into an opportunity and the Swiss came alive in the second half (were the US usually seem to die off) and Mexico just kind of lost focus and concentration. Overall, I think this team exceeded expectations……they looked good, with a few issues that need to be addressed / corrected Number of Passes for Turkiye is 441 not 44….lol i mean, we could barely find the strikers. and we proved for the umpteenth time that playing from the back costs us more pitifully easy punishment than it gets us clever long build goals. Though his replacement, Adams, was a noticeable upgrade. Agyemang had the touch of a young Jozy Altidore. that is not intended to be a compliment. johnny was basically on the hook both goals, are you kidding me. on the first goal, if you start to feel that noose tighten, that ball is either row Z or hit to midfield. we are being taught to not panic, to try and be clever, precisely when one should not. and there is zero upside to playing from the back. i struggle to remember 110 yard build goals. i thought we were more dangerous when we fed agyemang and wright but i thought wright was showing to the ball more. agyemang wants to sit back, pin the defender, then spin. Thought Tillman had his best game yet for us, I so wish he would have converted that header from the six, would have made it a statement game for him. If you could take away the Johnny mistake and the next five minutes it would have been our best performance under Poch. Certainly better than the last few games, and we looked good at times, but weaknesses are still apparent. passed quickly and were in the US third within not many seconds. We need to move the ball a lot quicker. Too often our passes weren't hit with enough speed, almost as if they didn't trust their teammates to be able to handle passes with pace. Every second lost gives the defense more time to adjust and get into place. The Turks didn't have that problem and their quickness put our defense under a lot of pressure. I can't stop from remarking about Cardoso's error. How do you kick the ball right into an opponent no more than 5 feet in front of you? I remember that Cardoso had a teammate wide open to his left with no one around. Why Cardoso even tried to pass up the middle is inexpolicable. While Austen missed one very good chance and another decent chance, I think Tillman's failure to convert was worse, considering how often he was scoring in Holland. it's not “inexplicable,” he forced the pass. you see it's a dumb idea but we're being taught to pass from the back and egg the opponent to come forward then try and cleverly work out of it. nor are we slick enough other end of the field to break down teams half court soccer. the goal was first 15 we're playing long outlets and even a little kickball, flick it wide, go to goal. speed or wall ball down the wing. get it in smaller number situations, more green space, and attack the net. last point, but we are way overcommitting near side. the weak side is open all day. that's part of what you were seeing. when they switched, the guy would have 20 yards. or even on some crosses i'd be like is anyone marking that far post runner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A third straight loss didn't prevent Mauricio Pochettino from thinking big. We need to compete like today and for sure we're going to have the possibility to win the World Cup,” the U.S. coach said after the Americans lost their third straight game, wasting an early lead in a 2-1 defeat to Turkey in a friendly on Saturday. Jack McGlynn scored 59 seconds in for the U.S., which was missing many regulars as Pochettino revamped his roster following a dismal performance at the CONCACAF Nations League final four in March. Turkey took advantage of a sloppy defense as Arda Güler and Kerem Aktürkoğlu scored in a 2-minute, 20-second span midway through the first half. They have lost three straight for the second time in a year. “Today, who is going to tell me, oh, we showed lack of, we showed lack of — lack of what today?” said Pochettino, a 53-year-old from Argentina who coached Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. … Playing in this way, they are going to win most of the games.” Coaching a nation that hasn't reached the World Cup semifinals since 1930 or the quarterfinals since 2022, Pochettino changed eight starters from the Nations League loss to Canada in March and kept only left back Max Arfsten, winger Diego Luna and forward Patrick Agyemang. “Some guys that are coming in — and they're not thinking twice about taking someone on. It's like, let's take risks and try to go after this thing,” said midfielder Tyler Adams, who entered at the start of the second half. Matt Freese, a starter at Major League Soccer's New York City, made his debut in goal. Matt Turner, the usual starter since 2022, didn't play for Crystal Palace after March 1. Midfielder Quinn Sullivan and defender Nathan Harriel made debuts as 65th-minute substitutes. McGlynn scored when he ran onto a pass from Malik Tilman, took several touches, cut inside and curled a left-footed shot from just outside the penalty area inside the far post for his second goal in five international appearances. Turkey tied it in the 24th minute when Freese tapped the ball to Johnny Cardoso, whose pass ricocheted off a leg and past Freese for Güler's fifth international goal. Then in the 27th, Miles Robinson tried to clear Oğuz Aydın's shot and the ball went to Aktürkoğlu, who one-timed a bouncing shot past Freese for his 12th international goal and sixth in eight games.</p>
