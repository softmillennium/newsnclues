                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday that he hopes President Donald Trump and Elon Musk can "reconcile" after their public fallout last week. "There's a lot of emotion involved in it, but it's in the interest of the country for everybody to work together," the Louisiana Republican said on ABC News' "This Week." Johnson said that he has not spoken with Musk about the GOP-led "big, beautiful bill" since last Monday. Musk last week went on a rant against the multitrillion-dollar spending package that narrowly passed the House, calling it a "disgusting abomination" that would lead to exploding federal deficits. "I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world, what we're trying to do is help hardworking Americans," he said. Musk's vocal opposition to the legislation was in part what triggered the public clash between Trump and the billionaire SpaceX founder, CNBC previously reported. The two men have not spoken since their feud, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Sunday on "Fox Sunday Morning Futures," adding that she doesn't think Trump "intends to." Trump also told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Saturday that he was not interested in repairing his relationship with Musk following their spat, signaling that their rift could be irreversible. Musk was the largest donor of the 2024 presidential campaign, and his super PAC spent roughly $200 million to propel Trump to the White House. But Trump warned Saturday that Musk would pay "very serious consequences" if he funds Democratic candidates challenging Republicans who support the bill. Johnson, a loyal Trump ally, echoed the president's remarks, saying it would be a "big mistake" if Musk were to back Democratic candidates. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel's government on Sunday vowed to prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip. Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel wouldn't allow anyone to break its naval blockade of the Palestinian territory, which he said was aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms. "To the antisemitic Greta and her fellow Hamas propagandists — I will say this clearly: You should turn back, because you will not make it to Gaza," he said in a statement. Thunberg, a climate campaigner, is among 12 activists aboard the Madleen, which is operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. Thiago Ávila, a Brazilian activist on board the boat, posted a video on social media Sunday afternoon saying someone appeared to be jamming their tracking and communication devices about 160 nautical miles from Gaza. Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, is among the others onboard. She has been barred from entering Israel because of her opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. After a 2 1/2-month total blockade aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel started allowing some basic aid into Gaza last month, but humanitarian workers have warned of famine unless the blockade is lifted and Israel ends its military offensive. An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after another of the group's vessels was attacked by two drones while sailing in international waters off Malta. Israel and Egypt have imposed varying degrees of blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. In early March, shortly before Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas, the country again blocked all imports, including food, fuel and medicine. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages, more than half of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas is still holding 55 hostages, more than half of them believed to be dead. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which has said women and children make up most of the dead. It doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants. The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of the territory's population, leaving people there almost completely dependent on international aid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Self-made millionaire, author and TV host Ramit Sethi knows a thing or two about money. But his own financial journey hasn't been perfect. He recently sat down with his wife, Cassandra, for a special episode of his Money for Couples podcast where they answered some of the same questions he asks couples every week in an interview with friend Julie Nguyen. The Sethis have been married since 2018, and Ramit has often shared tidbits about their relationship on his podcast and in his books, highlighting some of the strategies they've used to navigate combining finances, earning different incomes, creating shared goals and more. On the podcast, Ramit and Cassandra agreed on the most difficult money conversation they've ever had as a couple: negotiating their prenup before getting married. "I'm sweating thinking about it right now," Ramit said. Cassandra received the idea of a prenup well, he said, but things went south from there. Many money experts recommend getting a prenuptial agreement, even to those with modest finances. Without one, couples could wind up leaving those decisions — like who gets certain assets or who pays spousal support — up to a judge. Prenups are for everyone, money expert Suze Orman told CNBC Make It in 2020, and individuals should feel comfortable bringing it up with their partner. "If you cannot talk money to the person that you are about to marry, you are doomed for failure because money is going to run through your relationship more than anything else," she said. When Ramit brought up the idea of a prenup up to Cassandra, he had already started his business and written his first book on money. Cassandra didn't know much about them, but was willing to learn. And while they both agreed to get a prenup, their negotiations turned contentious due to differing expectations and understandings of money. Cassandra, on the other hand, was more tapped into the emotional considerations, which Ramit wasn't really thinking about. Ramit tried to make a "generous" offer in his prenup proposal, he said, but Cassandra was more concerned with their relationship and ensuring their feelings and emotions were aligned. Cassandra eventually suggested the couple sit down with a therapist and talk through their emotions to figure out where things weren't aligning. The therapist asked how they each view money. "That really opened up conversations that we hadn't been able to have because my answer was like, 'growth, of course, look at the compounding.' Despite the turmoil, the process helped the couple deepen their relationship by revealing not just how they each think about money, but also how they should be communicating those feelings with each other, they said. "I'll never forget something Ramit said to me during that time. While she worked on learning about prenups and managing money in general, Ramit acknowledged he needed to improve at talking about emotions so he could more clearly communicate where he was coming from and better understand Cassandra's perspective. "In retrospect, you were not asking me to pull out a f------ spreadsheet. Cassandra said Ramit's mindset around abundance and trusting your earning power "has been really eye-opening." And Ramit is grateful to have learned from Cassandra the importance of checking in on your feelings and talking about them. "It has really changed the way that I relate to people a lot," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Walt Disney Company and Universal, two of the biggest names in theme parks, are both undertaking historic expansions to their experiences businesses. Brian Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Universal parent company Comcast, called it the "single-largest investment Comcast NBCUniversal has made in its theme park business". "It's so different than anything else that we've ever built, but certainly I think it's different than anything anyone's ever built," said Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando President and COO. Epic's opening coincides with an expansion of Universal Orlando's resort portfolio, adding three Loews hotels to bring its total to 11 operated on the property. Universal is betting that the addition of Epic will turn the resort into a full-week destination, a distinction that is normally reserved for its crosstown neighbor, Walt Disney World. Not to be upstaged, Disney is working on a historic undertaking of its own. In 2023, Disney announced plans to invest $60 billion in its experiences segment, which includes theme parks, cruise ships and consumer products. Of that investment, $30 billion will go to its domestic theme parks, Disney World and Disneyland. "We've got a lion's share of that investment coming to us," said Michael Hundgen, portfolio executive creative producer with Walt Disney Imagineering. These investments come at a time when both Disney and Comcast are paring down or spinning off their linear TV segments, an arena that has seen volatility in recent years. However, the timing of these openings and expansions could prove challenging for both theme parks. Epic's opening summer coincides with fears of a travel slowdown due to economic volatility. "If you're uncertain how the economy is going to develop, then you're going to try to be more cautious in your spending," said Jorge Ridderstaat, associate professor at UCF's Rosen College of Hospitality Management. Will these massive investments pay off for Disney and Universal? Or could a tourism downturn upset Orlando's 'Epic' summer. Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>— President Donald Trump has said he wants to bolster manufacturing jobs and other technical employment in the United States. But in the aviation industry, finding skilled workers to make airplanes and engines — and maintaining those jobs for years to come — has been a struggle. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic in the U.S. is 54, and 40% of them are over the age of 60, according to a joint 2024 report from the Aviation Technician Education Council and consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which cites Federal Aviation Administration data. "A lot of them were hired on in the '80s and early '90s. You just start doing some math and you start saying at some point they're going to retire," said American Airlines Chief Operating Officer David Seymour, who oversees the carrier's more than 6,000 daily flights. To boost their ranks, airlines and big manufacturers of airplanes and their thousands of components are trying to get more younger people interested in the field. The industry was already facing a retirement wave when Covid hit, and companies cut or offered buyouts to experienced workers — from those who build aircraft to those who maintain them to keep flying. And then frankly, of course overnight we went from ramping to zero demand over time. And so we lost a lot of talent," said Christian Meisner, GE Aerospace's chief human resources officer. GE, along with its French joint venture partner Safran, makes the bestselling engines that power Boeing and Airbus top-selling jetliners, and has been ramping up hiring, though it is also dependent on a web of smaller suppliers that have also been getting back up to speed since the pandemic. Meisner said that the company has a strong retention rate and that some employees earn their FAA licenses to work on airplane engines or airframes on the job. At GE's engine plant in Lafayette, Indiana, about an hour outside of Indianapolis, base pay averages between $80,000 and $90,000 a year, based on qualifications and experience, the company said. Median pay for aircraft technicians or mechanics was $79,140 a year in the U.S. in 2024, compared with a nationwide median income of $49,500, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. American's Seymour said that with new pay raises, technicians could make $130,000 a year at the top of their pay scale in nine years at the carrier. But hiring can still be difficult in a sector that is seen as politically important and symbolic to the country's economic power. The impending worker shortages aren't just for those who repair aircraft and engines. A shortfall of air traffic controllers has also stifled airline growth and raised concerns about safety in recent years. The Trump administration has said it will raise wages and ramp up hiring to try to reverse yearslong shortfalls. Manufacturing is about 9% of U.S. employment but "we all have a bit of a fetish with manufacturing because we focus on it more and than other sectors," said Gordon Hanson, a professor of urban policy at Harvard University. The U.S. unemployment rate in May held steady at 4.2%. One problem with manufacturing jobs, Hanson said, is that workers aren't very geographically mobile, and if factories reopen or hiring ramps up, that could make it harder to attract employees from other places. "You're asking the local labor market to supply workers," Hanson added. Wages for technicians that repair aircraft at airlines, as well as big manufacturers like Boeing, have gone up in recent years, with skilled workers still in short supply and travel and airplane demand robust. "We need to increase wages," said Sarah MacLeod, executive director of the Aeronautical Repair Station Association. She warned that the "entire world is going to feel this workforce shortage. You already can't get your houses built. Some students are considering forgoing traditional four-year college degrees straight out of high school to get into the industry. "I'm thinking about going to college, but it's whichever really comes first. "I stay late after school every day to work on the planes and, probably a little bit too much ... but I still really enjoy it," Mucciardi said. The school, which has been teaching students how to maintain aircraft since the 1930s, is fielding more demand from airlines in recent years. "Lately, because of the huge technician need, there's been more students going directly into American, Delta, United, but you have the whole range." He said the school received about 5,000 applications this year from students. Seymour said American has teamed up with high schools before, but is now going even younger and working with some junior highs to raise awareness about the career path. "It is getting into the high schools and showing that a career in aerospace as an engineer or frankly, on a production floor, is not your grandparents' manufacturing. "You're talking about laser-guided machine, precision machining operations, exotic coatings and metals." Krystal Godinez, who has lived in the Lafayette area for about 14 years, graduated last summer from GE's first apprentice program class at the facility after about two years. It's like taking all those extra steps, make sure everything is correct," she said. American's Seymour was optimistic that younger people are changing their tune. "There was a period of time when people said 'I want a computer, I want tech,'" he said. "There are people who want to get their hands dirty."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Macro uncertainty is keeping the market volatile, but investors ought to keep their focus on stocks that can provide compelling long-term returns. Top Wall Street analysts' recommendations can help inform investors as they pick the right stocks that can weather short-term pressures with solid execution and generate impressive returns over the long term. With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is this week's first stock pick. Despite chip export restrictions, Nvidia remains confident about the demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Following the Q1 print, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reiterated a buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $170. However, NVDA's margins and EPS were hit by the $4.5 billion write-down related to H20 inventory write-downs. Excluding H20 shipments, Sur projects that the July quarter data center revenue is growing at about 16% quarter over quarter, driven by continued robust spending by customers on their AI/accelerated compute projects and persistent strength in production and deployment ramp of Nvidia's Blackwell platform. The analyst added that the demand for Nvidia's Blackwell platform is very strong and is expected to continue to surpass supply for many quarters. Sur believes that management has good visibility for solid growth through calendar year 2026, backed by recent mega data center deals (including those with UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan) and the end of the diffusion rule. Overall, Sur concluded that Nvidia is staying ahead of competitors with its silicon, hardware and software platforms and an impressive ecosystem, "further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time." 38 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. In reaction to the upbeat results, JPMorgan analyst Brian Essex reaffirmed a buy rating on Zscaler stock and boosted the price target to $292 from $275, saying, "We are encouraged by the strength in the quarter, particularly when off-calendar peers seemed to struggle with macro headwinds a bit more than expected." The analyst noted that Zscaler raised its full-year outlook for revenue, profitability and billings. He explained that the company's performance was backed by encouraging contributions from emerging products like Zero Trust Everywhere, Data Security Everywhere and Agentic Operations. Essex noted that large customer momentum continued to be solid in Q3 FY25, with the number of customers with over $1 million of ARR increasing 23% year over year, keeping Zscaler on track to exceed $3 billion of ARR in the fiscal fourth quarter. He emphasized that macro commentary was better than anticipated, as management stated that the company didn't witness a "softer April," though IT budgets remain tight. Commenting on Zscaler's Red Canary acquisition, Essex views this deal as encouraging, given that it is expected to enable the company to leverage the IP (intellectual property) and threat intel capabilities of Red Canary. 652 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See Zscaler Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks. Customer relationship management software provider Salesforce (CRM) recently reported better-than-projected revenue and earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and raised its full-year forecast. Following the results, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reiterated a buy rating on CRM stock with a price target of $375. Wood noted that the company's Q1 FY26 revenue and current remaining performance obligations surpassed expectations. "We think its renewed focus on accelerating sales capacity growth is a strong demand signal & should unlock higher growth next year," said Wood. The analyst highlighted that AI adoption is ramping for Salesforce, with Data Cloud and AI ARR rising more than 120% year over year and reflecting strong early traction for the company's Agentforce offering. Wood noted that 30% of net new Agentforce bookings came from existing customers expanding their usage. The analyst stated he is encouraged by the scale and velocity of Data Cloud, which he considers to be a leading indicator of Agentforce adoption as customers gear up to power agentic workflows. Wood contends that with margins now in the mid-30% range, Salesforce is focusing more on growth by re-deploying AI cost savings. Notably, the company is increasing its workforce more aggressively, following a flat sales headcount in the last two to three years. The analyst sees this as a signal of positive demand, with management indicating that pipelines are growing by the double-digits. 176 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

ByteDance Ltd., TikTok's parent company, has been replacing US-hired staff near Seattle with managers connected to China, aiming to replicate its e-commerce success in Asia after sales fell short in America.

TikTok Shop initially set a goal to increase its US e-commerce business tenfold last year to $17.5 billion in transaction volume, but had to drastically lower that objective, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twenty-five minutes of live TV, more than a dozen posts on X, and three posts on Truth Social over the period of five hours (and counting) — that's how the already fractured friendship of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly unraveled on Thursday. The first signs of trouble began when Musk showed opposition to Trump's spending bill, the "One Big Beautiful Bill," though he never explicitly targeted Trump. "Shame on those who voted for it," Musk tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress members who voted for Trump's tax cut bill. Trump, for his part, had stayed uncharacteristically mum about Musk's criticism of the bill. But that all changed on Thursday morning. Musk began digging up Trump's old posts on what was then Twitter about the deficit, including one from January of 2013. Musk unearthed another old X post by Trump from back in July 2012, presumably as a swipe at the new Republican tax bill that many economists and the congressional Budget Office said would increase the country's deficits. Trump responded to Musk's attacks for the first time when answering press questions during a White House event to welcome German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. "And you know Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles," said Trump. "And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Trump's comments about Musk continued at the press appearance. "He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn't said bad things about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. "I don't know what it is. The whole world is different, and they become hostile," he added. Musk began a whirlwind of tweets soon after, responding in near real time to what Trump said during the press appearance. "False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!" False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! Musk then began a series of tweets directed at the president beyond the bill, including saying that without him, Republicans would have lost. Musk polls his X followers about creating a new political party "that actually represents the 80% in the middle." Mark Cuban quoted the post with three checkmarks. Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle? Not even those in Congress who had to vote on the Big Ugly Spending Bill had time to read it! "Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do! "The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" Musk responds to Trump's posts on Truth Social, calling them "such an obvious lie." That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT! Trump posts on Truth Social again to defend his tax bill. "I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress," Trump wrote. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. Musk says SpaceX will decommission its Dragon spacecraft "immediately." Prior to partnering with SpaceX, the agency depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions. In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW Musk says that Trump's tariffs will "cause a recession in the second half of this year." Some economists have also predicted that Trump's tariffs would hurt the economy, and Trump himself declined to rule out the chances of a recession back in March. Musk retweeted what appears to be a video of Trump partying with Epstein from the 1990s, doubling down on his earlier statement about the Epstein files. "This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Business Insider in a statement. "The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again." Musk took a softer tone later on Thursday night. Some five hours after his post about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, he walked back the decision in a response to an X user. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon," Musk wrote at 9:20 p.m. In a separate exchange on X, billionaire investor Bill Ackman encouraged Musk and Trump to make up. We are much stronger together than apart," Ackman wrote. Trump spoke about the feud on Friday morning during a phone call with CNN's Dana Bash. "I'm not even thinking about Elon," Trump said. Bash said people in Musk and Trump's orbit are trying to mend the rift. On Truth Social, Trump posted a screenshot of an X post from David Schoen, Epstein's defense attorney. Schoen said in the post that Epstein "had no information to hurt President Trump." Trump reiterated that he wasn't thinking about Musk while traveling with reporters aboard Air Force One. He wished Musk the best of luck on his Tesla business. Musk said on X that he would apologize to Trump "profusely as soon as there is a full dump of the Epstein files." The CEO was responding to a post from James Fishback, an investor who proposed the idea of DOGE dividend checks, who posted on X that Musk should send Trump a "full-throated apology." "You can substantively disagree with the President on policy, but you should not have baselessly and personally attacked him," Fishback wrote. Trump and Musk appeared to extend each other an olive branch — at least for a brief moment. The White House rapid response account on X posted a clip of Trump's gaggle with the press on Air Force One, highlighting the president saying he wishes Musk well. Musk deleted some of the X posts he made on Thursday, including one in which he said Trump was named in the Epstein files. He also deleted a tweet announcing his intention to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. Trump told NBC News in a phone interview that he has no plans to amend his relationship with Musk and threatened that there would be "serious consequences" if the Tesla CEO funded Democratic candidates.</p>
