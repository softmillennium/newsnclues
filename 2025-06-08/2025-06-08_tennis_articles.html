                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz defended his French Open title with a stunning comeback as he saved three match points and fought from two sets down to beat Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2). Alcaraz was broken twice as the world No. 1 started in strong fashion on Court Philippe-Chatrier, and Alcaraz went two sets behind after being edged out of the second-set tiebreak. The 22-year-old, though, recovered to chalk up three breaks in the third set and avoid a clean sweep. After the Spaniard's early break in the fifth set was canceled out for 5-5, it was Alcaraz who sealed victory in the championship tiebreak, racking up a 7-0 advantage and eventually winning it 10-2. Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win French Open in tennis classic He added: “I just want to say thank you to my team, my family, I have the privilege to live great things with you. “I was lucky to have a lot of friends from home, from Murcia, to support. Amazing support you have given to me today, throughout the whole two weeks. “Thank you very much and this trophy is yours as well. This tournament is really special, I can't wait to come here year after year. Special thank you to (tournament director) Amelie (Mauresmo), congratulations as well, it's not easy to be with us. “To Paris, you have been really important support to me since the first practice for the first round. You were insane, unbelievable for me. I can't thank you enough. I wanted to start with Jannik. I know the hard work you put in every day. I know how hard you chase this tournament. It's a privilege to share the court with you. I'm just really happy to be able to make history with you in this tournament, in other tournaments. So thank you, and good luck for all that is coming in the future.” He lifts the magnificent Coupe des Mousquetaires, in his black and white top. He stares at his reflection and looks back at the man who put in one of the all-time great Grand Slam final performances. And Jannik Sinner continued: “Thank you so much to all the ball kids, you do an amazing job, you make our life so much easier. To our chair umpires, thank you so much. “It's an amazing trophy so I won't sleep very well tonight, but it's OK. Thank you to the organizers for making it such a special event. “Obviously the support has been amazing these couple of weeks. The runner-up holds up his silver award to applause. He says on Philippe-Chatrier: “Hello everyone. “It's easier to play than talking now. To my team, thank you so much for putting me in this position. A righteous roar of delight from Carlos Alcaraz. ...but it went by in the blink of an eye. What on earth have we just witnessed? It's hard to place these things in historical context straight away, but there will undoubtedly be comparisons made with Borg-McEnroe Wimbledon 1980, Federer-Nadal Wimbledon 2008 and Djokovic-Nadal Australian Open 2012. Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) in the French Open final at Roland Garros Sunday. 1 seed in an intense, fast-paced match that turned into a tennis psychodrama as it stretched into its sixth hour and evening fell across the Paris clay. It was ultimately decided by Sinner's dominance on short points, Alcaraz's new-found ability to impose his variety, and one of the greatest surges of the Spaniard's young career. It enshrines this young rivalry's place in global sport. It is Alcaraz's fifth Grand Slam title and his second at the French Open, while this win is his first comeback from two-sets-to-love down in his career. It takes Alcaraz and Sinner's head to head to 9-4 in the Spaniard's favor, and extends his winning streak over his nearest rival to five matches. Below, The Athletic's writers, Charlie Eccleshare and Matt Futterman, analyze the final and what it means for tennis. Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win French Open in tennis classic Carlos Alcaraz's magic, for me, is how he makes the impossible, possible. I will never forget this match. Carlos Alcaraz smashed a forehand winner down the line and past the advancing Sinner to win it in characteristic fashion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner came close to becoming only the third man to win three consecutive Grand Slam tournaments in the Open Era, but for now it remains a five-man club with all-time greats featuring on the list. But Alcaraz produced a miraculous recovery as he saved all three match points and went on to win 4-6, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (10-2) in five hours and 31 minutes in the second-longest Grand Slam final in history. It means only five men – including Rod Laver and Novak Djokovic – have won three majors in a row since tennis turned professional in 1968. It would take another 24 years before another man achieved that particular record with Sampras making it a two-man club during the height of his career. A two-man club turned into a three-man club in 2006 as Federer joined the list, but the Swiss then went on to go solo the following year as he became the first to win three Grand Slams in a row twice. Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer have achieved one feat that has eluded Novak Djokovic so far The 6 players to beat Novak Djokovic 3+ times in a row: ft. Jannik Sinner, Rafael Nadal Nadal followed in his great rival's footsteps three years later as he became the fourth man to win three majors in a row. Anything Federer and Nadal could, Djokovic did better as he achieved this particular feat four (4!) Djokovic then won four Grand Slams in a row, but it wasn't during a calendar year as he won Wimbledon and the US Open in 2014, and followed it up with the 2016 Australian Open to complete the hat-trick. For good measure, he won four consecutive majors as he lifted the French Open trophy as well. In 2019, he moved ahead of Federer as he became the first to win three Slams in a row three times as he won Wimbledon and the US Open in 2018 and then added the Australian Open at the start of 2019. Carlos Alcaraz is just the sixth man to win a French Open final from two sets down. Carlos Alcaraz has done the unthinkable at Roland Garros as he came from two sets down and saved three match points to win the title.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a classic final on the red clay of Roland Garros. Though things looked bleak early, Carlos Alcaraz successfully defended his French Open title, rallying to stun world No. Alcaraz, 22, claimed his sixth career Grand Slam, coming back from a two-set deficit to win for the first time in his pro career, 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in a match that lasted 5 hours and 29 minutes. It was the longest men's singles final in French Open history, surpassing the 4 hours and 42 minutes it took Mats Vilander to beat Guillermo Vilas in 1982. Alcaraz's improbable comeback ended Sinner's bid for a third consecutive Grand Slam title, after the Italian had previously won the 2025 Australian Open and 2024 U.S. Open. USA TODAY Sports will be providing updates for Sunday's men's final at Roland Garros: There was just no way the final set in this record-setting marathon would be easy. With a service break in the opening game of the decisive fifth set, Carlos Alcaraz was poised to complete his epic comeback from two sets down against Jannik Sinner. Alcaraz ended it quickly in the final set tiebreaker, winning 10-2. We'll be going to a fifth and deciding set in Paris. Carlos Alcaraz fought off three championship points in the fourth set before pulling off a clutch service break as Jannik Sinner was serving for the match. Despite losing the first two points of the tiebreaker, Alcaraz roared back with a pair of aces to win it 7-3. Alcaraz has rallied from down two sets to win two of his own – setting up a winner-take-all Grand Slam showdown between the world's two best players on the clay courts of Roland Garros. In his pro career, Carlos Alcaraz has never come back from two sets down to win a match. He's at least one step closer to that historic first after taking the third set from Jannik Sinner. But with the Spaniard serving for the set at 5-3, Sinner bounced back just in time with a break of his own. That snaps Sinner's streak of 31 consecutive sets won in Grand Slam events. Jannik Sinner is one set away from his third consecutive Grand Slam title. An unforced error by Alcaraz at 15-30 in the second game gave Sinner an early opening in the second set. After holding serve to make it 4-2, he began pumping his arms in an effort to get the crowd fired up. He's clearly the fan favorite here at Court Phillippe-Chatrier. That would be a portent of things to come in the opening set. Officially, it took one hour and two minutes to complete. There has been a slight delay in the proceedings, but we're now ready to go in the 2025 French Open men's final.

Subject to overcoming a qualifier, she could face current Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova in the second round at Queens, while she is set to pair up with British number one Katie Boulter in the doubles. “Playing a doubles match with Katie will hopefully give me a good feel for that surface and it will be positive,” the 22-year-old said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Spaniard was two sets down and staring down the barrel against world number one Jannik Sinner, but after saving three championship points in the fourth set, Alcaraz mounted a truly remarkable comeback to win in a final set tiebreak, 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 in a whopping five hours and 30 minutes. It is the second-longest Grand Slam final of all time. Sinner will be absolutely heartbroken after missing his huge chance in the fourth set, and he has now lost his first Slam final.

Before the tournament began, every tennis fan would have wanted to see world number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the showpiece event, and that is exactly what has happened. Sinner has had a near-flawless run to the final. Taking part in his second tournament since returning from a drugs ban, the Italian hasn't dropped a single set and saw off 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in a high-quality last-four clash. His relentless and suffocating brand of tennis has been too much for anyone, and he will be looking to produce that against an opponent who has beaten him in their last four meetings. Victory would see him win his first French Open and fourth Grand Slam, which would take him level with Alcaraz. It hasn't been as plain sailing for Alcaraz, who has dropped a set in four of his matches. However, Alcaraz tends to save his best for Sinner, and there is little doubt that the Spaniard is a better clay-court player than his rival. At one point, Alcaraz trailed the head-to-head 4-3, but now leads it 7-4. Neither player has lost in a Grand Slam final before, so something will have to give.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has revealed that she suffered another injury setback ahead of her Queen's campaign. 41 is starting her grass swing on home soil but hasn't been able to get as much time on the surface as she would have liked after a back issue resurfaced following the French Open. Raducanu had been dealing with back spasms in Strasbourg last month and said she wasn't feeling 100 per cent going into Roland Garros. She still reached the second round there, but after returning home, her grass preparations were interrupted. Ahead of the WTA 500 at Queen's, Raducanu explained: “I got back, like, end of last week, and then I had two days off after I finished in Paris and then got straight back on the court. So that kind of hindered my grass prep, but the last few days I've managed to get on the grass and kind of just begin to try and find my feet.” Raducanu still has a packed schedule for the grass swing and will also play in Berlin and Eastbourne before Wimbledon. For now, she is happy to manage the back issue. “I can't really predict the future, how it's going to be, I know I've been managing my back for the last few weeks now, and it's something that comes and goes,” she continued. It does take a few days out, but all I can do is kind of deal with what's in front of me.” This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Raducanu will open her singles campaign at Queen's against a qualifier. But she doesn't have high expectations after her back issue flared up again. She added: “My expectations, truthfully, are pretty low because as I said, I played points for the first time today. “I've had maybe like, two, three days on the grass court, so it's not been much.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu are to play doubles together for the first time in a British dream team at Queen's this week. British No 1 Boulter has confirmed that the pair plan to team up as women return to Queen's for the first time in more than 50 years. “I think myself and Emma, we've been wanting to play for a while now,” Boulter said on Sunday. I think [for the] first week on grass, to get a couple more matches is super important. Obviously, she's a great player, and I'm looking forward to having the first of many more.” Their campaigns at Queen's therefore will be hugely influential in their attempts to secure a ranked seeding for Wimbledon next month, which will go to the top 32 seeds. Raducanu faces a tough ask at Queen's though, having been drawn in the same half as top seed Zheng Qinwen, the reigning Olympic champion and world No 7. Boulter will also face a qualifier in the first round with a potential meeting in the second round against fifth seed Diana Shnaider. Cavaday oversaw Raducanu's training session on Sunday at Queen's and the 2021 US Open champion confirmed that he will team up with her current coach, Mark Petchey, having filled in this week while the latter remains in Paris on television commentary duty. “I'm happy to see him healthy, first of all,” said Raducanu, who split from Cavaday in January to leave her looking for a seventh full-time coach in three-and-a-half years as a professional. “I mean, it's been such a long time since we were last on court together in Australia, and Mark is in Paris commentating, so Nick was around and it was nice to just have a few days with him.” “They'll both be helping me throughout the grass,” she added. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to this upcoming season and see how it goes.” Other British players to have secured wildcards are Kartal, Burrage and Francesca Jones, who will all feature in the first women's championship at Queen's Club since 1973.</p>

Obviously there's a lot going on in our country right now," Gauff responded, via The Tennis Letter. "Just to be a representation of that and a representation of people that look like me in America, who maybe don't feel as supported during this time period. Being that reflection of hope and light for those people." Coco Gauff poses with the trophy after winning the women's singles final against Aryna Sabalenka at Roland Garros Stadium. Gauff continued by bringing up this past year's presidential election, and the response by the country after President Donald Trump was elected for his second term. She referred to it as a "down period" in the States. That's what I was thinking about today," Gauff said. Despite the "down period" comment, Gauff said she is "definitely patriotic." "Some people may feel some type of way about being patriotic and things like that, but I'm definitely patriotic. I'm proud to represent Americans that look like me and people who kind of support the things that I support," Gauff added.

A three-time Grand Slam champion, Sinner is turning glory-hunter in a positive sense at Roland Garros 2025. There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes which fans are occasionally unaware of. Born in South Tyrol, he started playing tennis at the age of 7 since his father liked the sport. But did you know that Jannik Sinner also has a brother?

He reportedly said in a 2023 interview, “The relationship with Jannik is normal, like that of most brothers. For a few years, I managed to keep up with him. Then he took off and it was impossible to exchange shots.” Jannik Sinner after losing to Carlos Alcaraz in Rome final:“Special thank you  to my brother who rather than being here is in Imola watching Formula 1.” 😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/8nPvHGZ7Vd For me, he is an important person.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz came back from two sets down to beat Jannik Sinner in a fifth-set tiebreak, retaining his title in one of the greatest finals ever played, in any sport What an absolute joy and honour it's been to experience one of the greatest finals ever, in any sport; what an absolute joy and honour it's been to bring it to you. As I type, Sinner signs autographs, which tells us everything about what this is: a triumph of the human spirit. I'll level with you, I'm quite keen to stop typing now, but at the same time, the last thing I want to do is stop typing now – how can it be over? Except it'll never be over: it'll be part of us all, enshrined in the annals of humanity for eternity. Thanks so much for sharing it with us we'll be back three weeks tomorrow for Wimbledon, with a bit of Queen's Club between now and then. But otherwise, it's been epochal; peace and love, mates. He then praises his opponent for his hard work, assuring him he'll win this tournament many times and it's a privilege to share the court and make history with him. He then thanks him for being a “great inspiration” as Sinner looks into the middle distance, trying to hold it down, the moves on to his family and team. He's lucky to have a lot of people who've come from Murcia to support him, along with those at home, telling them the trophy is theirs too. This tournament is very special for him and he can't wait to come back year after year, thanking Amelie Mauresmo, the tournament director and acknowledging it's not easy to deal with the players. Now it's Alcaraz to receive the trophy, which he holds aloft, businesslike look on his coupon. What a human being – and he's only 22! “Hello everyone,” he begins in typically understated fashion; I'm absolutely gone. “I'm very happy for you,” he says. “It's easier to play than talking … now,” he continues, before thanking his team for putting him in this position. He then thanks the ball kids on an amazing job – the look in their eyes as they gaze up at him is beautiful. I think my eyeballs might be sweating. What an honour for both of them. There's another decade-odd of this to come, assuming the world doesn't end in a minute, now humanity has justified its purpose on this planet. Alcaraz sits alone, watching the screen as it replays his miraculous deeds, then begins laughing. I hope that, in the fullness of time, Sinner can feel pride in this match – he contributed just as much to it as Alcaraz and it'll be part of both of them for evermore. Lots of great teams and players lost the match for which they're best remembered – Australia's men's cricket team of 2005; the Hungary football team at the 1954 World Cup; Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2008. The players embrace, but Sinner doesn't really want any of it – his head is spinning, you can see it in his eyes, and Alcaraz races up to his box, joining a huddle of contagious, inspiring ecstasy. I am in awe of both of these players, we'll all be talking about this match for as long as talking is a thing. One last astounding forehand winner, and Alcaraz is the champion again! Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-6 Alcaraz (2-9) Sinner goes down the line with a backhand but he's long, just; a service-winner follows, and Alcaraz has seven championship points, 90-odd minutes after Sinner's three. Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-6 Alcaraz (2-7) Oh man, imagine how poor Jannik feels right now. All that work, all that pain, all that suffering, and a backhand down the line makes 7-0; this is the second-longest grand slam final in the open era, behind Djokovic v Nadal in 2012. Sinner takes two service points and clenches fist, trying to convince himself he's still in it. Again, he raises an arm, the crowd responding to the consummate showman, and when Sinner wafts long, it's a third break! But in a race to 10, 5-0isn't quite as definitive as in a race to seven; there are the straws, and the Italian must clutch at them. But instead, he nets a forehand, and this is almost over! Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-6 Alcaraz* we've never had a French Open final settled on a tiebreaker, but when Alcaraz plays two volleys, both to balls annihilated at his heart, we're a point closer; 15-0. A netted backhand, though, gives him 15-all, then another glorious backhand return – the shot of the match in a way – allows him to come in and, when a disgusting response lands near his ankle, he flicks a touch half-volley back over and Alcaraz can't direct his riposte in court. Here we go … and Sinner forces a backhand return on to the line! At deuce, he's two points away and how good has that shot been for him today? Another great return then puts him ahead in the next rally only for Alcaraz to immediately reverse the situation and claim advantage before, sent to towards the backhand corner and in trouble, he only flips a winner flat and cross-court! We've got ourselves a 10-point breaker, and this is one of the greatest finals ever, in any sport. *Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-5 Alcaraz A serve out wide to which Alcaraz offers a token arm, unable to move feet, and that's an ace; another follows for 30-15, then a return falls long and now the crowd chant “Yannik! We wind up at deuce, a winner apiece returning us to it after Sinner makes advantage. And from there, he closes out, skidding into the kind of forehand winner that looked beyond him 20 minutes ago. We've been going 5 hours 12 minutes, and there's more to come. Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 5-5 Alcaraz* The man who earlier on saved three championship points will now serve for that championship. And oh my days, one of those backhand returns down the line makes 0-30! Sinner's mum is all over the show as we all are, how proud must she be of her boy? What a show of love and character this is regardless of how things end; Alcaraz closes to 15-30. Another Alcaraz drop, this time Sinner must try chasing it down … he gets there … and has the stillness and skill to caress a beauty back over the net! Two break-back points are his, and he raises an arm to the crowd, Alcaraz-style … THEN ALCARAZ NETS A FOREHAND! JANNIK SINNER HAS BROKEN, AND I AM HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE WITH THIS MATCH! WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO BE LIVING IN ITS TIME! Alcaraz, though, conjures a forehand winner of his own … but can do nothing about a service winner, and when he wafts a forehand long, he ensures that he'll have to serve the match out. Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 3-5 Alcaraz* Sinner nets a backhand but Alcaraz then does likewise with a drop, doing his best to affect composure but looking peaky; an ace follows. And though a loopy return falls long for 40-15, a forehand winner to the corner gives the Italian a chance … but this time, his backhand return is off, and the champ is a game away from retaining his title. Should he lose, Sinner will take this feeling to his grave; it'll haunt the nightmares of his unborn grandchildren. *Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 3-4 Alcaraz Sinner's rejuvenated over the last 10 minutes or so and he crouches to mash another backhand winner down the lie for 15-0; a wide return gives him the blessed relief of a short point. I'd love to hear the internal monologues these two have going on here, but in the meantime another winner gives Sinner love hold, and pressure switches to Alcaraz. How can he, or anyone, possibly cope? Gosh, but behind it there's a double, his seventh to Sinner's none, then a beautiful backhands down the line makes 15-30! And another drop then makes 40-30, though Sinner's unhappy the serve wasn't called out – it looks so and was by a distance, but he didn't back himself – then a flapped return means Alcaraz leads 4-2 in the fifth! Sinner then makes 30-15, but a backhand winner, spirited cross, restores parity in the game … before a backhand return drops long. Up 40-30, Sinner then takes a little while longer bouncing the ball, trying to slow himself down, and his second serve is sent back into the net. This match is now the longest French Open final ever, nudging above the 1982 edition between Mats Wilander and Guillermo Villas at 4 hours 43 minutes. Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 1-3 Alcaraz* This now the best match I've seen since Alcaraz beat Djokovic in the 2023 Wimbledon final – at least. A drop makes him 15-0, and that's smart play – he knows his opponent is flagging, and a disgusting forehand from corner to corner facilitates another. Again, Sinner doesn't chase, and that's 30-0 … but a clean-up forehand then hits the net, so he's in the game. Alcaraz massively overhits a forehand, creating tension where previously there was … ever so slightly less, but Sinner then wafts a forehand long and reasons with his box. He can feel it slipping away – for someone as reticent as him, that intimates desperation … except he then punishes a backhand return down the line to make deuce! Alcaraz plants a forehand wide and, out of nowhere, finds himself down advantage! so naturally he responds with a short second serve, out of Sinner's hit-zone, then puts away at the net; deuce, AND THERE HE GOES AGAIN! No matter, a devastating forehand restores deuce, and this is some of the maddest behaviour I've seen in my life; how is this even possible? And this time, the champ closes out, that middle to corner forehand that's served him so well securing the hold. *Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 1-2 Alcaraz Earlier in the match we talked about the differences between these two and I wonder how much of the difference between them is made up, not by tennis but by Alcaraz's unstoppable life-force. Sinner makes 30-15, the champ sends two forehands long, and that is a crucial hold. Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 0-2 Alcaraz* At 15-0, Sinner bends double, looking to conserve all the energy he has left; Alcaraz is bouncing about like a new-born puppy. Alcaraz might get nervous as victory draws nearer, but at this point, a comeback looks beyond the Italian. Sinner does close to 15-30, but then nets an overhand forehand and here come two break points! Alcaraz's first return is wide, after which follows a rally of frankly evil nature, sinner eventually finding himself unable to reach a drop and steer his response into court! The champ leads with a break, Sinner now seems to be limping, and Carlos Alcaraz has some of the most compelling, affirming competitive charisma I've ever seen. “Remember when Federer and Nadal retired and we thought we'd never see matches like that again?” wonders Nath Jones. Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 Alcaraz This is some of the very best stuff this world has to offer us; drink it in, friends. Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 6-6 Alcaraz (3-6) I'm trying so hard to stay in the moment, but can't stop my ADHD brain kvelling at how many more of these outrageous contests await us. Facing a second serve, Sinner slams a forehand long – that, mes amis, is pressure – then another error means the man who, 20 minutes ago held three championship points, is now three set points down! Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 6-6 Alcaraz (2-4) And another ace follows that! Alcaraz leads 3-2 and it's now him playing the biggest points better, which is to say there's almost nothing between them. He's so unbelievably brilliant at doing whatever a situation demands of him. Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 6-6 Alcaraz (2-2) Immediate mini-break to Sinner when Alcaraz nets, then at 2-0 and out of naewhere, the champ invents a forehand that breaks the sideline to erase the advantage. What it takes to get to here, then embrace the moment, is mind-boggling; we reach the four-hour mark as the Italian reaches 40-15, then Alcaraz lashes a flat forehand winner from centre to corner that leaves no less a legend than Andre Agassi shaking his head in mystification. I'm not sure I've ever seen tennis balls hit harder, and Sinner secures the holds that gives him – and us! Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 5-6 Alcaraz* Sinner was so close to the title and has never won a match of this length. He'll know the situation got big on him there, a lot to process in the maelstrom of the moment, and a love hold further amps up the pressure, Chatrier a rabid agglomeration of confused, bemused, elated humanity. He could easily have shrunk down 0-40, but these two are of different ilk to the likes of us …. which is why, down 0-15, Sinner is able to hammer down an overhead then, when it comes back, find the steadiness of hand to feather a drop for 15-all. An overhit forehand, though, nudges Alcaraz back in front in the game, the crowd cavorting with every point he wins, and another gorgeously-played rally allows him to finish at the net, two break-back points in his pocket. He's never been under pressure like this in a major final, and when his first serve lands out, the champ stays back then astonishes a forehand down the line that the world no 1 can't get back! Chatrier is now hovering above the planet, and are we all still breathing? Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 5-4 Alcaraz* Sinner's returning today has been wondrous, more of the same again forcing Alcaraz to play around himself from the line; he gets the ball back, but a forehand makes 0-15 and a double follows! Sinner's mum is tearful, looking ready to explode with every emotion known to mankind, but she'll need to wait at least one more rally, a forehand on the run falling long. Oh, and another does likewise then, having been sent to the corner, Alcaraz responds with a brave forehand that lands close to the line, and sinner nets! Alcaraz makes advantage then, directed to the forehand corner, he smooooookes a forehand winner down the line to secure his hold! *Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 5-3 Alcaraz Sinner nets for 0-15 but plays like nothing happened, whacking from the back till Alcaraz goes long. Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 4-3 Alcaraz* At 0-15, Sinner dematerialising a backhand to the corner in order to caress a gorgeous drop across the face of the net; that is delightful, and when another vicious forehand enables 0-40, we're at a juncture-point. Ohhh, and Alcaraz flaps a backhand wide! As Alex Ferguson once said, when it goes, it goes quickly, and might that be the match? Sinner is two games away from a third major on the spin! *Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 3-3 Alcaraz Will fatigue become a factor as the match goes deeper? I nip for a comfort break, Sinner holds to love, and I could watch this for days.</p>

Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max. The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8. In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max). If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus. While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV. Don't live in either of those places? A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Winning a grand slam title is something most tennis players dream of from the day they start swinging their racquet. The past two decades, in particular, have seen certain players cement their place in history by winning a record number of grand slam titles. | Who is the current women's world No. In running order, the four grand slam events held each year are: Novak Djokovic and Margaret Court currently hold the record for most grand slam singles titles. Nadal had taken sole ownership of the men's singles record after edging past Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic with his 2022 Australian Open triumph. He then extended his lead at that year's French Open before Djokovic pulled back within one at Wimbledon. Djokovic's victory in the 2023 Australian Open final, where he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas, saw him draw level with Nadal at the top of the men's standings and, after losing a five-set thriller to Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final that year, he beat Daniil Medvedev in straight sets at the US Open. That meant a third grand slam in 2023 and a victory that drew him level with Court's iconic haul of 24 major tournament triumphs. Swiss great Federer won't add to his grand slam haul after announcing his retirement following the Laver Cup in September 2022, while Nadal's chances of catching Djokovic again are also over after retiring following the Davis Cup in November 2024. Court, meanwhile, looked set to be caught by Serena Williams, but the American failed to win any of her last four grand slam finals and has also since stepped away from the sport. Maureen Connolly was the first woman to pull it off in women's singles when she did so in 1953. If a Grand Slam wasn't rare enough, a Golden Slam requires players to also win Olympic gold on top of the four grand slam events in the same year. Steffi Graf was the first to complete a Golden Slam in 1988, with only wheelchair players Diede de Groot and Dylan Alcott managing to replicate the feat since. Joshua Mayne is a content producer for The Sporting News currently based in Sydney, Australia. Joshua specialises in rugby league, motorsport and tennis. He is still waiting for Arsenal to win the Premier League again.</p>
