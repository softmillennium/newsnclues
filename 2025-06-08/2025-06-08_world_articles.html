                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Terry Moran to be evaluated after now deleted post said Stephen Miller is ‘richly endowed with capacity for hatred' ABC News has suspended its senior national correspondent after he described top White House aide Stephen Miller as “richly endowed with the capacity for hatred” on social media. In a now deleted post, Terry Moran, who recently conducted an interview with Donald Trump, said that the president and his deputy chief of staff, Miller, were both “world-class” haters. An ABC News spokesperson said that Moran “has been suspended pending further evaluation”, adding: “ABC News stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others. According to a screenshot of the post, Moran said that Miller was not the brains behind Trumpism and his ability to translate the movement's “impulses” into policy was “not brains. Miller shot back, saying: “The most important fact about Terry's full public meltdown is what it shows about the corporate press in America. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, described Moran's rhetoric as “unacceptable and unhinged” on Fox News. JD Vance, the vice-president, described Moran's post as a “vile smear”. ABC News' suspension of Moran comes nearly six months after the organisation agreed to pay $15m to a Trump presidential foundation or museum after he filed a defamation case following anchor George Stephanopoulos repeating an assertion on ABC's This Week that Trump had been found “liable for rape” in a lawsuit filed by the columnist E Jean Carroll. In its statement, ABC News maintained a position of neutrality, saying: “ABC News stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel vowed on Sunday to stop an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists on board from reaching Gaza. The “Madleen” is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel's blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat. “We know that it's a very risky mission and we know that previous experiences with flotillas like this have resulted in attacks, violence and even cases of death,” Thunberg told CNN on Saturday. “But of course none of those risks are even remotely as high as the risk that Palestinians are facing everyday just by trying to survive.” Katz warned the ship that “you'd better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza.” Thunberg and the Madleen expect to reach Gaza within the next day, organizer Yasemin Acar told CNN on Saturday. “We are still on our way to Gaza. There's no turning back, and we're hoping to make it into Gaza within two days,” Acar said. After an 11-week blockade that prevented any humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, Israel has begun allowing a trickle of aid in once again. But it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war, with humanitarian organizations warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of widespread famine. For all of us,” she said. Among those joining the crew are Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament, and “Game of Thrones” actor Liam Cunningham. “From both a legal and moral standpoint, Israel has no right to intercept this vessel,” the group said in a statement. Last month, another vessel from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition came under what its organizers said was an Israeli drone attack off the coast of Malta in international waters. The ship, the “Conscience,” was heading to Malta, where a large contingent of activists were due to board before it departed for Gaza, more than 1,000 miles away, but had not made it into port, the group said. The coalition told CNN that Thunberg was among those who were expected to board the vessel in Malta.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top Democrat adds he would support tech billionaire ‘sounding the alarm' to Americans on Trump bill amid feud A leading elected Democrat rejected the idea of taking campaign donations from tech billionaire Elon Musk, whose spectacular fallout with former ally Donald Trump has roiled American politics. Trump on Saturday said Musk will face “serious consequences” if he moves to support Democratic political candidates in any upcoming elections, following a public rift between the two men over Musk's staunch opposition to the cost of US president's planned piece of landmark domestic legislation. “I would not accept money from Elon Musk for my campaign,” Booker told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. But Booker added, referring to the Republicans budget bill that Musk has criticized, “I would be supportive of anybody, including Elon Musk, putting resources forward right now to let more Americans know, sound the alarm, treat this like a Paul Revere moment.” As the Trump-Musk feud intensified on Thursday, Musk posted on X: “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.,” clearly referring to any politician who supported Trump's budget bill. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman, reportedly talked with one of Musk's “senior confidants” on last week about whether Musk might now want to help the Democrats in the midterm elections next year. “I look forward to Elon turning his fire against Maga Republicans instead of Democrats in 2026,” Khanna, who has argued that his party was unwise to alienate Musk, told the outlet. However, leftwing politicians, including Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have publicly pictured Musk as what voters should be against: powerful wealthy billionaires seeking influence through politics. Sanders told CNN's State of the Union Sunday that Musk had “evolved” into an extremist since he voted for Obama in 2008. The issue and drama over what happened last week is that we are living, increasingly, in an oligarchic society. It's a fight about power among the few, and it's really an embarrassment for those of us who believe in democracy and the rule of law,” Sanders added. Musk said last month that he planned to spend “a lot less” on political campaigns as he scaled back and ultimately exited his time in government, where Trump had tasked him with massively slashing federal spending and jobs. But Musk's opposition to Trump's “One Big Beautiful” bill budget proposal, calling it an “disgusting abomination”, by definition puts him in relative proximity to Democratic positions on that issue. Booker was asked if agreed with Musk about the planned legislation that Trump has made a centerpiece of his administration.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Veteran ABC News correspondent Terry Moran was suspended Sunday after he posted a highly critical assessment of President Donald Trump and Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on the social media platform X. In the missive, which was posted shortly after midnight, Moran said both Trump and Miller are “world-class haters.” For Trump, he said, hatred is “only a means to an end, and that end is his own glorification. For Miller, on the other hand, “hatreds are his spiritual nourishment,” Moran charged. Moran — who landed a rare Oval Office interview with Trump in April — later deleted the tweet and didn't post anything further. On Sunday morning, Trump administration officials condemned Moran and said the post reflected poorly on ABC News as an institution. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly pushed ABC to discipline Moran. “Hopefully this journalist will either be suspended or terminated,” Leavitt said in an interview on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News. About one hour later, the news division said Moran, its senior national correspondent and former “Nightline” anchor, had been suspended. “ABC News stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others,” a spokesperson said in response to CNN's inquiry about Moran. “The post does not reflect the views of ABC News and violated our standards — as a result, Terry Moran has been suspended pending further evaluation.” A 2020 book called “Hatemonger” documented Miller's longstanding ties to far-right groups that demonize immigrants. But it is highly unusual for a network correspondent like Moran to publish such a politically charged piece of commentary, particularly in the middle of the night on a free-for-all social media site. Miller reacted to Moran's post by saying that “the most important fact about Terry's full public meltdown is what it shows about the corporate press in America.” Terry pulled off his mask,” Miller wrote on X. Vice President JD Vance also posted a defense of Miller on X, stating that Miller is “motivated by love of country” and that ABC “should apologize.” CNN's Kit Maher and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration diverted 20,000 anti-drone missiles originally intended for Ukraine to American forces in the Middle East, in an interview with ABC News published on June 8. Zelensky said Ukraine had counted on the missiles to help counter relentless Russian drone attacks, which include swarms of Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones. "We have big problems with Shaheds… we will find all the tools to destroy them," Zelensky said. Zelensky said the plan had been agreed upon with then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and was launched under President Joe Biden's administration. A Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent on June 4 that Russia is preparing to launch more than 500 long-range drones per night in future attacks, as Moscow rapidly scales up drone production and constructs new launch sites. Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about continued assistance to Kyiv and temporarily suspended military shipments earlier this year, only resuming them after Ukraine agreed to a ceasefire framework during peace talks in Jeddah on March 11. Ukraine has urgently called on Western partners to expand investments in domestic arms production and deliver more air defense systems, including U.S.-made Patriots, to counter intensifying Russian airstrikes. Despite growing international appeals and Kyiv's offer of a 30-day ceasefire as the basis for peace talks, Moscow continues to reject the proposal. Trump, who spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 4, has refused to impose new sanctions on Russia, saying he is focused on pursuing a negotiated ceasefire. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. More than 20,000 people chose to stand behind us. We're deeply grateful and overwhelmed with your support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A KFF Health Tracking Poll shows anxiety is high about looming Medicaid cuts among voters across the political spectrum. New survey data out Friday shows that Republicans are wrong if they remain unconcerned about public sentiment as it relates to the evisceration of Medicaid or healthcare support systems that would result from passage of their colossal legislation now making its way through Congress — a bill that, if passed, would see coverage stripped from an estimated 11-16 million people in the coming years. “Partisanship drives these attitudes to a certain extent, but about two-thirds or more of Republicans enrolled in Medicaid and those with lower incomes are worried that Medicaid spending reductions would hurt their families and their communities.” CBO estimates that the House-passed budget bill would decrease federal spending by $793B and result in more than 10 million people losing Medicaid coverage. Our latest poll explores the views of those who could be most directly impacted: https://t.co/uZhxbQqVcb pic.twitter.com/aWT69z4Yjf At the same time, nearly half of likely ACA marketplace enrollees identify as Republican. 16 million Americans losing health coverage.The biggest cut to Medicaid in history.Higher health, energy, and housing costs.Tax cuts for billionaires, tax hikes for working people.$3 trillion added to the national debt.The Republican bill is a “disgusting abomination.” As they face pressure to slash spending to finance President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and immigration legislation, they risk alienating their own supporters who depend on the program. “Medicaid is really a popular program, and a large majority of Americans do not want to see decreases in spending,” Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at KFF, told the Post. “These findings reflect that many people, whether or not they rely on Medicaid, see it as vital to their communities.” Tony Carrk, executive director of the progressive watchdog group Accountable.US, said Friday that Republicans in the Senate would be wise to stick to their public promises that Medicaid would not be cut or harmed, specifically referencing Sens. “Now is the time for these Senators to practice what they preach,” said Caark. Last week, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) sparked fury when she said at a town hall, in response to a constituent warning that “people will die” if Medicaid cuts went through, that “we all are going to die.” “By the way,” the group later posted, “Iowans are PISSED about sacrificing their Medicaid for a billionaire tax handout” and pointed to a local protest in Ernst's home state where community members rallied against cuts. Citing a new study showing that more than 50,000 people a year will die prematurely if the Medicaid cuts proposed by Republicans goes through, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), said, “In the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires. As the Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I will be doing everything that I can to see that this disastrous bill is defeated.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ship is carrying necessities including rice, flour, medical supplies, and baby formula to Gaza. Any interception or attack on this crew is a violation of international law. In 2010, for example, Israeli commandos killed nine activists onboard the Mavi Marmara during a raid, including one U.S. citizen. A 10th crew member, who was injured, later died as well. Crew members aboard the Madleen issued a distress signal on June 4 as drones circled overhead. “We must be clear: Any attack on the Madleen or its civilian crew is a clear and blatant violation of international law,” the U.S. lawmakers wrote. The ship is carrying necessities including rice, flour, medical supplies, and baby formula to Gaza, which has endured more than 600 days of Israeli bombardment and whose 2 million people face starvation following a two-month total aid blockade imposed by Israel that was only lifted in May after international pressure. However, the amount of aid allowed to enter is still severely curtailed. Several human rights experts and organizations agree that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza with its deadly assault, which has killed at least 61,709 people since October 2023. Crew members on the Madleen include French- Palestinian Member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan and Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, whose presence has sparked threats from right-wing figures, including U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who wrote on social media, “Hope Greta and her friends can swim!” Tlaib and the other lawmakers criticized those threats, writing, “This is a serious matter, and we are deeply disturbed by U.S. elected officials making threatening ‘jokes' about violence against the civilians onboard.” They urged Rubio “to monitor the Madleen's journey and deter any such hostile actions.” In addition to Tlaib, the letter was signed by Reps. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), Jesús G. “Chuy” García (D-Ill.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Greg Casar (D-Texas), Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), Al Green (D-Texas), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass. “If those seeking aid are targets, then so too are those seeking to bring that aid, so all eyes must be firmly on the Freedom Flotilla; their lives depend on it.” “This is an opportunity to demonstrate respect for humanitarian law and human rights.” “We are now sailing off the Egyptian coast,” crew member and German human rights activist Yasemin Acar told Agence France-Presse.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. The report comes amid a high-profile public conflict between Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest businessman, and his former ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. In May, Musk announced he would step down as an advisor to Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Since then, he has emerged as a major critic of the president. It would be foolish not to ask their opinion on all sorts of issues," Errol Musk was quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency TASS. According to Kommersant, scheduled speakers include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, and prominent state TV anchor Ekaterina Andreeva. Errol Musk, a former South African businessman and politician, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him "a strong leader" and saying that "it would be foolish not to admire Putin" in an April interview with BBC Russia. SpaceX holds billions in Pentagon and NASA contracts, including a $1.8-billion agreement with the U.S. intelligence community to build a classified spy satellite system. Despite initially aiding Ukraine by providing Starlink terminals to stabilize battlefield communications, Elon Musk has increasingly echoed Kremlin-aligned narratives. He has suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks public support in Ukraine and has repeatedly called U.S. aid a driver of a "never-ending draft meat grinder." Those statements have been warmly received by Russian officials, military bloggers, and state media outlets, which have praised Musk as a voice of reason and a critic of Western involvement in the war. Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's international affairs committee, said on June 6 that Moscow is ready to grant political asylum to Musk following his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tear gas canisters and flash-bang grenades fired after activists clash with agents carrying out deportation raids Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops onto the streets of Los Angeles after a second day of violent protests against his immigration policies. Border Patrol officers in riot gear and masks deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades to disperse demonstrators outside an industrial park, where some had vandalised federal vehicles. Mr Newsom said the government was “moving to take over the California National Guard and deploy 2,000 soldiers” and warned it would only escalate tensions. The governor also insisted local authorities were “able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice,” adding: “There is currently no unmet need”. Tom Homan, the White House's border czar, told Fox News: “This is about enforcing the law – and again, we're not going to apologise for doing it.” Karen Bass, LA's Democrat mayor, provoked fury from Republicans after she claimed that ICE's activity had been intended to “sow terror” in the nation's second-largest city. He said: “Mayor Bass took the side of chaos and lawlessness over law enforcement. Make no mistake, ICE will continue to enforce our nation's immigration laws and arrest criminal illegal aliens.” ICE took 40 people into custody earlier on Friday after searching multiple locations, including a clothing warehouse in the city's fashion district. Advocates for immigrants' rights said people had also been taken into detention after being stopped by ICE officers outside Home Depot stores and a doughnut shop. The action came after a judge found probable cause that an employer was using fictitious documents for some of its workers, according to representatives for Homeland Security Investigations and the US Attorney's Office. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, posted a message on social media addressing “LA rioters” which warned that interference with immigration enforcement would not be tolerated. “You will not stop us or slow us down,” Ms Noem said on X, adding that ICE would “enforce the law” and that “if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Dan Bongino, the FBI's deputy director, confirmed multiple arrests had been made on Friday. Some held signs with anti-ICE slogans, while others scrawled graffiti on the building. It was not clear whether Mr Huerta had legal representation. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, called for his immediate release. In a social media post, Mr Schumer cited a “disturbing pattern of arresting and detaining American citizens for exercising their right to free speech.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I find it's getting worse now with so many people on e-bikes – especially people around my age (I'm in my 60s). My guess is some of them haven't cycled in years and think like entitled drivers. Despite what some cyclists think, ringing a bell doesn't mean “Scram, pedestrians!” “You may want to move if you can to stay safe, but it's not a legal requirement,” said Sean Shapiro, a traffic safety consultant and former Toronto traffic cop. In Ontario, the Highway Traffic Act (HTA) requires cyclists, like drivers, to have “a bell, gong or horn” and use it “whenever is reasonably necessary to notify pedestrians” or face a $110 fine. That bell is just supposed to let you know that a cyclist is there, but you still generally have the right of way, Shapiro said. But cyclists should, generally, be yielding to pedestrians on trails even when it's not specifically required by local laws, said Patrick Brown, a Toronto-based personal injury lawyer who handles cycling-related cases. “Cyclists have an added responsibility to pedestrians because they are heavier, faster and (can) cause serious injury to a pedestrian if struck.” Damages, including pain and suffering, loss of income and care costs awarded by a court could be “a very substantial amount,” he said. “But if you didn't have home insurance, and a lot of people don't, especially in the city, that's a problem because you would be responsible for paying it,” he said, adding that if the collision is fatal and the cyclist is at fault, the amount of money could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. While incidents of pedestrians being seriously injured and killed by cyclists are relatively rare – especially compared to the number of cyclists and pedestrians seriously injured and killed by cars – they do happen, Brown said. “If you [try to avoid them] but peel off the trail into a ditch and fracture your neck, that pedestrian could be civilly responsible for what happened to you” as a cyclist, Brown said. But if cyclists are coming up on somebody already on the trail, they should be slowing down and be ready to either stop or to go off the trail, if possible, to pass slowly, he said. You're riding through trails in park areas [with] families having picnics. So you should be going at a very low speed [so]… when the unexpected happens, you'll be able to brake and avoid it.” That's especially true for e-bikes, which are heavier and need more distance to stop, he said. Generally, then, it's smartest for walkers and runners to keep calm and carry on when they hear that bell, Brown said. “Just keep going at your same pace and be conscious that there's a bike coming up from behind.” While it's not a bad idea for pedestrians to stick to the right side of a trail, they don't have to unless there's a local bylaw requiring it (Toronto's doesn't), he said. That's true even when there's a painted centre line on the trail. “If there's a family taking up a whole path, then the expectation is for the cyclist to slow down and stop until there's an opportunity to go around them or until they move,” he said.

MOSCOW, June 8. /TASS/. Paratroopers from Novorossiysk destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot and manpower by drones in the Zaporozhye Region, Russia's Defense Ministry reported on Sunday.

"Operators of attack unmanned aerial vehicles of Novorossiysk paratroopers destroyed an ammunition depot and up to a squad of the Ukrainian infantry in the Zaporozhye Region. After flying over several kilometers, the operators spotted a camouflaged ammunition depot in a forest belt where the Ukrainian infantry periodically arrived for replenishing the ammunition load," the ministry said in a statement.

Following the target acquisition of a reconnaissance UAV, quadcopter drones dropped explosives and destroyed the field depot, triggering stored ammunition detonation. Subsequently, the operators detected the movement of enemy infantry in a stronghold. Up to a squad of the Ukrainian army tried to hide in a dugout but were eliminated by three accurate hits of FPV drones, the ministry said.

Novorossiysk paratroopers daily accomplish combat objectives using UAVs to destroy enemy manpower, armored combat vehicles, artillery and mortar crews and field ammunition depots camouflaged in forest belts. Reconnaissance and attack UAV teams operate jointly round the clock thanks to night vision cameras mounted on drones, it said.</p>

LUGANSK, June 8. /TASS/. Russian troops are encircling the Ukrainian combat group in the settlement of Radkovka in the Kharkov Region, military expert Andrey Marochko told TASS on Sunday.

"Our fighters are encircling the entire enemy combat group entrenched in Radkovka and its outskirts," the military expert said.

The Ukrainian forces have assumed an all-round defense in Radkovka. As of now, the enemy has retained "a small terrain sector" southwest of the community, through which the Kiev regime can still deploy forces and capabilities and replenish losses, he specified.

"The enemy has quite serious fortifications in that community and terrain is rather complex but your guys are dealing with that," Marochko stressed.

The military expert told TASS on June 4 that Russian troops had begun to create a fire pocket for the Ukrainian combat group in Radkovka.</p>
