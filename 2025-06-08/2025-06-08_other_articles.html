                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural already has at least one easy way to return for another season without retconning the original ending. Centering on brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester as they travel the country hunting monsters, Supernatural developed a passionate fan base who continue to support the show and its cast. Supernatural ran for an impressive fifteen seasons, finally coming to an end in 2020 with a definitive, if divisive, conclusion. Almost immediately after Supernatural's controversial series finale, fans began speculating about whether the show could ever return. But there's another option for a potential Supernatural return that wouldn't involve rewriting the original ending. After Sam and Dean defeated God (Rob Benedict) himself in season 15's penultimate episode, the series finale saw them go on one final hunt. While some viewers felt Dean was always destined to die on a hunt, others felt it was an abrupt, lackluster, and even cruel ending for a character who had already suffered so much. While this opens the door for Dean to return as an angel of sorts, the Supernatural season 15 finale makes season 16 more complicated. To truly bring the Winchesters back together for more hunting adventures, season 16 would have to retcon the show's original ending. While there are ways to undo Dean's death that could work, a future Supernatural project could also take a different route. Despite Dean Winchester's death, there are other ways Supernatural could return without undoing the original series finale. A future Supernatural season or seasons could adapt some of the seventeen non-canonical novels that have been written about the Winchester brothers. Beginning with Nevermore by Keith R.A. DeCandido, these novels are standalone adventures depicting monster hunts that take place throughout the show's run. Supernatural has inspired countless works of fan fiction over the years, but there are also seventeen official Supernatural tie-in novels. From serial killers to ghosts to demons, the Supernatural novels feature an array of monsters and villains that would be perfect for an adaptation. Some of the novels also feature other characters from Sam and Dean's life, including Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver), Castiel (Misha Collins), Lucifer (Mark Pellegrino), and Garth (DJ Qualls), and it would be great to see some of these characters return onscreen. By the time Supernatural came to a close, Sam and Dean had faced off against Lucifer, God, and everything in between. An anthology-type Supernatural season inspired by the novels would allow other beloved characters to return, even if they had been killed off during the show's run. While the intense season-long story arcs were always entertaining (and often heartbreaking), Supernatural developed a near-perfect formula for its standalone episodes. The main complication with adapting the Supernatural novels is that Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles have, of course, continued to age. While they have certainly aged well, they can no longer pass for the Sam and Dean Winchester of Supernatural's earliest seasons. As the actors continue to noticeably age, it becomes more difficult to set a series during the original show's run. Supernatural could always come back for season 16, but there is another way that the popular show could continue with far fewer difficulties. It's impossible to imagine any future Supernatural stories with anyone other than Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles portraying Sam and Dean. If another Supernatural season or mini-series ever does happen, the creative minds behind it will have to find a way to make it work with Jared and Jensen, and potentially Misha Collins, as well. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Not everyone likes the fantasy genre, but if you have even an inkling of an interest, these six TV shows are worth watching for more than one reason. One of Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning's biggest criticisms surrounding its exposition is addressed by director Christopher McQuarrie. EXCLUSIVE: Criminal Minds: Evolution star Zach Gilford has discussed his feelings about directing his second episode of the hit crime procedural. Matthew Lillard explains why Mike Flanagan is remaking Stephen King's first novel and details how the changes make sense for modern times. Ncuti Gatwa's Doctor Who exit brought back a familiar face to the TARDIS, but didn't explain how and why Billie Piper returned to the show. Supernatural followed Mary and John Winchester in its prequel, The Winchesters, but this beloved character would have been a better spinoff lead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some of the most prevalent UFO conspiracy theories — including about aliens being housed a Area 51 in Nevada — were fueled by the Pentagon in an attempt to provide cover for secret weapons programs, according to a bombshell report. The incident is just one of several where government agencies allegedly played up America's UFO mythology for the purpose of protecting its military assets, according to the 2024 report. Other military attempts to obscure secret projects with conspiracy theories were not made public. As his office probed decades of documents, memos and messages across the Defense Department, he found several conspiracy theories that circled back to the Pentagon itself. In one instance, Kirkpatrick's team found that the Air Force hazed members with briefings introducing them to a fake “Yankee Blue” unit that purported investigated alien aircraft. The briefings came with a direct order never to mention the details to anyone, with many of the targets of the prank never learning it was all a ruse, according to interviews with Kirkpatrick's team. It remains unclear why officials presented subordinates with the fake briefings, with rumors speculating it could have been used as a loyalty test or to spread misinformation. Robert Salas, a former Air Force captain, was one of those people. Salas claims he witnessed a UFO descend over a nuclear missile testing site in Montana in 1967. During the event, a flashing light was able to disable all 10 nuclear missiles at the bunker, along with all electrical systems. Kirkpatrick's team, however, discovered that Salas was never told that what he actually saw was a test of a fledging electromagnetic pulse test to see if American silos could withstand the radiation of atomic weapons and retaliate if the Soviet Union ever attacked first. The DOD has acknowledged that not everything has been made public about the AARO's discoveries, but the military claims it will be more transparent in its follow up report scheduled for later this year. “The department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO's findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,” the DOD said in a statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli psychic Uri Geller has threatened to stop activist Greta Thunberg as her Gaza aid flotilla continues its journey to Israel, telling The Jerusalem Post that he also is responsible for the navigation malfunctions on her ship, the Madleen. He had warned on his X/Twitter account on Friday that he would use psychic powers to interfere with her ship. Hey @GretaThunberg - you won't get to #Gaza on your fake protest. I will use my psychic powers to mess with your boat! 😵‍💫 For a climate activist, it's funny how you don't mind belching out shit into the sea and air with your motorised vessel when it comes to #Israel! Hey @GretaThunberg - you won't get to #Gaza on your fake protest. I will use my psychic powers to mess with your boat! 😵‍💫 For a climate activist, it's funny how you don't mind belching out shit into the sea and air with your motorised vessel when it comes to #Israel! Though Israel did not claim to have done so, Defense Minister Israel Katz did warn that the IDF would not allow the ship to reach Gaza. "I have instructed the IDF to act so that the Madleen flotilla does not reach Gaza. To Greta the antisemite and her friends, I say clearly: you'd better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza," Katz said in a statement, with sources telling the Post previously that Israel is set to intercept the ship when it reaches Gaza in the next 48 hours or so. Geller, however, takes full credit for the ship's navigation errors. That's how powerful the mind is for some people." Geller, who the CIA said presented his paranormal abilities in "a convincing and unambiguous manner" while being studied by them in the 1970s, compared remote viewing to drone piloting, noting that it just requires being in a dark room, often with a computer, and with a joystick. "And in my case, I don't need a joystick. Geller said he would not reveal if he interfered with the Madleen's navigation systems of his own volition, or if it was on behalf of the IDF. "Greta thinks she's heroic, but this is - in my opinion - just a publicity stunt. Everything she's doing is just a publicity stunt," he said. He further said, "I will warn her through The Jerusalem Post.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA's Parker Solar Probe has directly observed a powerful magnetic explosion in the sun's corona that could help us predict geomagnetic storms on Earth. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. While making a death-defying dive through the sun's atmosphere, NASA's Parker Solar Probe has directly recorded a powerful plasma explosion heading toward our star's surface in unprecedented detail. Parker's new measurements found protons with about 1000 times greater energy than expected and a plasma jet shooting toward the sun, not away from it. Understanding magnetic reconnection is critical for making better predictions about space weather, which is driven by the solar wind and other energetic outbursts from our star. Space weather is a primary suspect for what stripped away Mars' atmosphere, turning it from a habitable planet into an icy desert wasteland. On Earth, space weather can trigger geomagnetic storms that cause blackouts, damage satellites, interfere with radio and GPS signals, and even put astronauts at risk. On the bright side, it also gives Earth its signature glorious auroras. The sun's magnetic field is extremely powerful, complex and dynamic. Space weather predictions require complicated computer simulations based on equations that describe how magnetic fields behave — but the sun is so large and convoluted that these equations will always be approximations. This is where the Parker Solar Probe comes in.

"These findings indicate that magnetic reconnection … is an important source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind," lead study author Mihir Desai, director of the Southwest Research Institute's Department of Space Research, said in a statement. —Powerful Mother's Day geomagnetic storm created radio-disrupting bubbles in Earth's upper atmosphere "Reports from the American Meteorological Society indicated that the powerful solar events in May 2024 wreaked havoc with farmers when extreme geomagnetic storms disrupted the precise GPS-guided navigation systems used to plant, fertilize and harvest rows of seeds, causing an estimated loss of up to $500 million in earning potential," Desai said. "Parker's access to this new data is critical, particularly as we remain in the midst of a very active solar cycle." The latest measurements of magnetic reconnection, reported in a paper published May 29 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, are one of many new discoveries Parker has made. In 2023, over 700 peer-reviewed scientific papers were published using data collected in the probe's first four years of operation, and there are still many more discoveries to be made.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A number of 'smoke' rings have been spotted in oceans around the world and a new study suggests it could help us in our search for extra-terrestrial life. These rings aren't actually made of smoke at all, actually being made of bubbles that are being blown by humpback whales. In a behaviour that looks eerily similar to a human smoker blowing rings or 'Os' themselves, these rings are far larger and stick around for longer in the water. They may represent a form of curiosity, and might even aid humans in their search for alien life. Though these signs have only been seen in an ocean environment, researchers at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute and University of California believe them to be promising, publishing their findings in the journal Marine Mammal Science. It suggests that they are attempts to communicate with humans, as co-lead author Dr Fred Sharpe explained: “Humpback whales live in complex societies, are acoustically diverse, use bubble tools and assist other species being harassed by predators. This new study is part of the WhaleSETI project, focusing on non-human intelligence as a way to better understand potential signals in the future from alien life. Scientists say that understanding how non-human, non-terrestrial beings display curiosity or other feels can help to better understand any future alien intelligence we may run into. These findings could lead to a better understanding of communication from extra-terrestrial intelligence, says SETI Institute scientist and co-author Dr. Laurance Doyle. “Because of current limitations on technology, an important assumption of the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is that extra-terrestrial intelligence and life will be interested in making contact and so target human receivers,” he added. Dr. Doyle said that this assumption is 'supported' in the evolution of humpback whales' 'curious behaviour.' Co-lead author Jodi Frediani pointed out the 'friendly behaviour' from humpback whales to humans, explaining: “We've now located a dozen whales from populations around the world, the majority of which have voluntarily approached boats and swimmers blowing bubble rings during these episodes of curious behaviour.” Unfortunately, he's unhealthily obsessed with Manchester United, which takes its toll on his mental and physical health.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ghosts have been a perpetual fixture of human artistry for generations, one of our oldest existential curiosities — we've used them as a tool to wrestle with mortality in books, live theatre, and, (since 1896's The Haunted Castle) movies as well. They're perhaps the original on-screen horror archetype, predating even Dracula. Their ubiquity speaks to the power that genre cinema has in helping us understand not just mortality, but trauma, and regret, and historical bloodshed as well. For as long as they've haunted the collective cinematic consciousness, they've also undergone changes that reflect our increasingly cynical appetites. Modern ghost stories resemble their classic Gothic origins increasingly little, which is why Steven Soderbergh's recent Presence feels so fresh: it marries a genuinely unique visual style with the atmosphere of a traditional haunting. While the initial setup is quite simple (a relatively well-off, seemingly picture–perfect upper class family moves into a new house in the suburbs that turns out to be haunted), the film's divisive visual approach is anything but. Known for constantly playing around with different formats for the sake of convenience, or even to challenge how audiences approach a story (shooting Unsane and High Flying Bird on iPhones, for instance), Soderbergh shot Presence himself entirely from a 1st person POV, specifically that of the titular ghost. Never before has a movie committed so fully to immersing you in the experience of existing in a hypothetical afterlife, but there's also a profound sense of isolation evoked by the aesthetic style. Like the emotionally and psychologically destructive tragedies of Poe's House of Usher and Shirley Jackson's original Hill House, the paranormal in Presence functions like a house of mirrors, turning familial trauma into a frightening, inexplicable abstraction. Soderbergh's specter observes silently and tries to understand its reason for existing, a goal it ironically shares with the living. Just like it, audiences watch invisibly and scrutinize the immediate flaws in this idealistic fresh start and the hollow victory of “upward mobility.” Rebekah's (Lucy Liu) heavily implied white-collar financial fraud, the Oedipal undertones of her fawning relationship with her son Tyler (Eddy Maday), how that toxic dynamic nurtures the confidence with which he belittles his grieving sister Chloe (Callina Liang), and how the entire collapsing sandcastle is driving meek father/husband Chris (Chris Sullivan) maybe further and further away from them — all of it is passively witnessed by a force desperately trying to figure out how to make its influence active, not to terrorize, but perhaps for something else. Whether it's the stone-faced stubbornness with which Rebekah ignores Chris' obvious feelings of emotional neglect (watching Liu and Sullivan perform marital crisis here is some of the best acting of the year), or the conscience-less teenage cruelty Tyler deploys in the face of his sister's very real emotional turmoil and her vague clairvoyant sensitivity. But it's not as if the problem is exclusively their own, there's a lack of empathy to the world at large that bleeds into the house from other places as well. But by the time their experience with their phantom is over, the Payne family's lives have been radically upended, acutely refocused on what truly matters by a harrowing and inexplicable experience that leaves them (and will leave you) emotionally shell-shocked. Presence works because at its best, its bold visual approach and its Gothic traditions reminds us that more than anything, a good ghost story should remind us about the fragility of life itself and how much every moment matters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Pentagon report released in 2024 found no evidence of a cover-up regarding extraterrestrial life but omitted how the government had perpetuated UFO myths through deliberate disinformation. This omission led to accusations that the report itself was an attempt at a cover-up. The inquiry revealed that these disinformation campaigns were aimed at hiding the testing of military technology, including stealth fighter jets. Investigators are still determining whether these campaigns were local initiatives or centralized programs within the military hierarchy. The main mission of AARO was to investigate so-called Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) observed in all domains, including land, sea, air, and space. Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, a former chief scientist at the Missile and Space Intelligence Center, was recruited in 2022 to lead the investigation at the direction of Congress through AARO. He resigned from his position as AARO director in December 2023. Four months after his resignation, a report was released that omitted these critical issues, leading to controversy over concealment. According to its investigations, military officials had disseminated misleading documents to create a "smokescreen" regarding real secret weapon programs, as in the case of Area 51. Area 51, long a subject of conspiracy theories and associated with claims of extraterrestrial life, turned out to be a cover for secret military projects developed during the Cold War. These projects included the testing of classified stealth fighter jets and electromagnetic pulse generators. When these aircraft were seen by the public, there was concern about the military program being exposed. In some cases, U.S. officials had allowed the spread of myths related to UFOs in line with "national security interests." One of the purposes of these efforts was to deter the Soviet Union from identifying weaknesses in nuclear facilities and equipment. "For decades, certain new commanders of the Air Force's most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer," detailed the Wall Street Journal. Many of these commanders were informed they were joining "Yankee Blue," a program aimed at reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology. This practice affected hundreds of officers who believed in its authenticity, signed non-disclosure agreements, and never told their spouses. The unclear Pentagon bureaucracy regarding secret programs nested within other secret programs created fertile ground for the spread of myths.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor Michelle Randolph is in early negotiations to lead Malibu, a subterranean horror thriller helmed by Paranormal Activity 2 director Tod Williams. The film, currently in pre-production, is set to begin shooting later this year and promises to deliver a genre-bending scarefest anchored by a strong female lead. Produced under the Spooky Pictures banner—run by genre veterans Roy Lee (Barbarian, It) and Steven Schneider (Insidious, The Devil Inside)—Malibu is being pitched as a “thriller skulking around in the subterranean horror subgenre.” While specific plot details remain tightly under wraps, the film's tone and pedigree suggest a gritty psychological horror story with a claustrophobic edge. Michelle, 27, has been steadily building her portfolio with a string of high-profile roles across television and streaming platforms. She recently starred in Taylor Sheridan's oil-rig drama Landman (2024) alongside Billy Bob Thornton, as well as the Yellowstone prequel 1923 (2022) and the mystery series The Resort (2021). If confirmed, Malibu would mark Michelle's first full-fledged foray into horror—a genre that continues to thrive both critically and commercially. It also aligns with her upcoming appearance in Scream 7, directed by franchise creator Kevin Williamson. Slated for release next year, the new Scream instalment is already generating buzz and could further cement Michelle's place in the horror circuit. While no official announcement has been made about her role in Malibu, the industry chatter signals a promising next move. As the horror renaissance continues, Michelle Randolph may just be its next scream queen-in-the-making.</p>
