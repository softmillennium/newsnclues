Terry Moran to be evaluated after now deleted post said Stephen Miller is ‘richly endowed with capacity for hatred'

ABC News has suspended its senior national correspondent after he described top White House aide Stephen Miller as “richly endowed with the capacity for hatred” on social media.

In a now deleted post, Terry Moran, who recently conducted an interview with Donald Trump, said that the president and his deputy chief of staff, Miller, were both “world-class” haters.

An ABC News spokesperson said that Moran “has been suspended pending further evaluation”, adding: “ABC News stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others. The post does not reflect the views of ABC News and violated our standards.”

According to a screenshot of the post, Moran said that Miller was not the brains behind Trumpism and his ability to translate the movement's “impulses” into policy was “not brains. It's bile.”

“You can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment,” Moran added. “He eats his hate.”

He added of Trump: “Trump is a world-class hater. But his hatred only a means to an end, and that end [is] his own glorification.”

Miller shot back, saying: “The most important fact about Terry's full public meltdown is what it shows about the corporate press in America. For decades, the privileged anchors and reporters narrating and gatekeeping our society have been radicals adopting a journalist's pose. Terry pulled off his mask.”

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, described Moran's rhetoric as “unacceptable and unhinged” on Fox News. “I think this speaks to the distrust that the American public have in the legacy media,” she added. JD Vance, the vice-president, described Moran's post as a “vile smear”.

ABC News' suspension of Moran comes nearly six months after the organisation agreed to pay $15m to a Trump presidential foundation or museum after he filed a defamation case following anchor George Stephanopoulos repeating an assertion on ABC's This Week that Trump had been found “liable for rape” in a lawsuit filed by the columnist E Jean Carroll. He had not.

The latest incident will probably deepen suspicion on the right that US mainstream media outlets are fundamentally biased against the administration.

In its statement, ABC News maintained a position of neutrality, saying: “ABC News stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others.”

            Israel vowed on Sunday to stop an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists on board from reaching Gaza.
    


            As of Sunday evening, the UK-flagged civilian vessel was north of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea, slowly approaching the coast of Gaza. The “Madleen” is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel's blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat.
    


            “We know that it's a very risky mission and we know that previous experiences with flotillas like this have resulted in attacks, violence and even cases of death,” Thunberg told CNN on Saturday.
    


            “But of course none of those risks are even remotely as high as the risk that Palestinians are facing everyday just by trying to survive.”
    


            Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated that the Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, would not make it to the besieged enclave.
    


            “I have instructed the IDF to ensure that the ‘Madleen' flotilla does not reach Gaza,” said Katz in a statement, referring to the name of the ship.
    


            Katz warned the ship that “you'd better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza.”
    


            Thunberg and the Madleen expect to reach Gaza within the next day, organizer Yasemin Acar told CNN on Saturday.
    


            “We are still on our way to Gaza. There's no turning back, and we're hoping to make it into Gaza within two days,” Acar said.
    


            The coalition campaigns to end Israel's blockade of Gaza and has tried to reach the enclave several times in the past

            After an 11-week blockade that prevented any humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, Israel has begun allowing a trickle of aid in once again.
    


            But it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war, with humanitarian organizations warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of widespread famine.
    


            Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, said on social media that the flotilla carries more than food.
    


            “It is not only the aid, it is the HUMANITY THEY CARRY. For all of us,” she said.
    


            The crew, which has publicized the location of the ship with an online tracker, began preparing for the possibility of interception by the Israeli military.
    


            Among those joining the crew are Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament, and “Game of Thrones” actor Liam Cunningham.
    


            “From both a legal and moral standpoint, Israel has no right to intercept this vessel,” the group said in a statement.
    


            “The people of Gaza, under siege, starving, and facing the threat of annihilation, have the legal right to decide who enters their territories.”
    


            Last month, another vessel from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition came under what its organizers said was an Israeli drone attack off the coast of Malta in international waters. The group did not provide evidence that the drone was Israeli, while the Israeli military has declined to comment on the alleged attack.
    


            The ship, the “Conscience,” was heading to Malta, where a large contingent of activists were due to board before it departed for Gaza, more than 1,000 miles away, but had not made it into port, the group said.
    


            The coalition told CNN that Thunberg was among those who were expected to board the vessel in Malta.

Top Democrat adds he would support tech billionaire ‘sounding the alarm' to Americans on Trump bill amid feud

A leading elected Democrat rejected the idea of taking campaign donations from tech billionaire Elon Musk, whose spectacular fallout with former ally Donald Trump has roiled American politics.

Trump on Saturday said Musk will face “serious consequences” if he moves to support Democratic political candidates in any upcoming elections, following a public rift between the two men over Musk's staunch opposition to the cost of US president's planned piece of landmark domestic legislation.

But Cory Booker, a senator for New Jersey, scotched any idea he would take any Musk cash. “I would not accept money from Elon Musk for my campaign,” Booker told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday.

But Booker added, referring to the Republicans budget bill that Musk has criticized, “I would be supportive of anybody, including Elon Musk, putting resources forward right now to let more Americans know, sound the alarm, treat this like a Paul Revere moment.”

Booker added: “More Americans have to understand that if this bill passes, average Americans are going to see their costs skyrocket as this president again pushes legislation that is indicative of his chaos, corruption and cruelty towards Americans.”

The senator's comments come as Democrats wrestle with the how to turn the dramatic fallout between Musk and Trump into opportunity. Musk turned his back on the party in 2022 and contributed $270m to Trump's re-election campaign in 2024, providing crucial help in the Republican's eventual victory.

As the Trump-Musk feud intensified on Thursday, Musk posted on X: “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.,” clearly referring to any politician who supported Trump's budget bill.

Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman, reportedly talked with one of Musk's “senior confidants” on last week about whether Musk might now want to help the Democrats in the midterm elections next year.

“Having Elon speak out against the irrational tariff policy, against the deficit exploding Trump bill, and the anti-science and anti-immigrant agenda can help check Trump's unconstitutional administration,” Khanna told Semafor.

“I look forward to Elon turning his fire against Maga Republicans instead of Democrats in 2026,” Khanna, who has argued that his party was unwise to alienate Musk, told the outlet.

However, leftwing politicians, including Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have publicly pictured Musk as what voters should be against: powerful wealthy billionaires seeking influence through politics.

Sanders told CNN's State of the Union Sunday that Musk had “evolved” into an extremist since he voted for Obama in 2008.

“Over the years he has developed into a rightwing extremist. The issue and drama over what happened last week is that we are living, increasingly, in an oligarchic society. Musk said: ‘Hey listen, I spent $270m dollars to get you elected. I bought you the presidency …”

“This is a fight between oligarchs. It's a fight about power among the few, and it's really an embarrassment for those of us who believe in democracy and the rule of law,” Sanders added.

Musk said last month that he planned to spend “a lot less” on political campaigns as he scaled back and ultimately exited his time in government, where Trump had tasked him with massively slashing federal spending and jobs.

“In terms of political spending I'm going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk told a Bloomberg forum in Doha. Asked why, he responded: “I think I've done enough.”

But Musk's opposition to Trump's “One Big Beautiful” bill budget proposal, calling it an “disgusting abomination”, by definition puts him in relative proximity to Democratic positions on that issue.

Booker was asked if agreed with Musk about the planned legislation that Trump has made a centerpiece of his administration. “I agree that it's going to saddle this country with trillions of dollars of debt, endanger our entire economy … This is a morally wrong bill. And it's definitely, definitely an economically wrong bill as well.”

“This is not about right or left, it's about right or wrong,” he added. “And I welcome Elon Musk, not to my campaign. I welcome him right now, not to sit back and just fire off tweets, to get involved right now in a more substantive way and putting pressure on congresspeople and senators to not do this.”

            Veteran ABC News correspondent Terry Moran was suspended Sunday after he posted a highly critical assessment of President Donald Trump and Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on the social media platform X.
    


            In the missive, which was posted shortly after midnight, Moran said both Trump and Miller are “world-class haters.” For Trump, he said, hatred is “only a means to an end, and that end is his own glorification. That's his spiritual nourishment.”
    


            For Miller, on the other hand, “hatreds are his spiritual nourishment,” Moran charged. “He eats his hate.”
    


            Moran — who landed a rare Oval Office interview with Trump in April — later deleted the tweet and didn't post anything further.
    


            On Sunday morning, Trump administration officials condemned Moran and said the post reflected poorly on ABC News as an institution. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly pushed ABC to discipline Moran.
    


            “We have reached out to ABC to inquire about how they plan to hold Terry accountable,” she wrote on X.
    


            “Hopefully this journalist will either be suspended or terminated,” Leavitt said in an interview on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News.
    


            As for ABC, “they have said they will be taking action,” she added, apparently referring to a private conversation.
    


            About one hour later, the news division said Moran, its senior national correspondent and former “Nightline” anchor, had been suspended.
    


            “ABC News stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others,” a spokesperson said in response to CNN's inquiry about Moran. “The post does not reflect the views of ABC News and violated our standards — as a result, Terry Moran has been suspended pending further evaluation.”
    


            Miller, often described as the architect behind Trump's immigration policies, is the subject of frequent and ferocious criticism, including the “hater” label that Moran applied. A 2020 book called “Hatemonger” documented Miller's longstanding ties to far-right groups that demonize immigrants.
    


            But it is highly unusual for a network correspondent like Moran to publish such a politically charged piece of commentary, particularly in the middle of the night on a free-for-all social media site.
    


            Miller reacted to Moran's post by saying that “the most important fact about Terry's full public meltdown is what it shows about the corporate press in America.”
    


            “For decades, the privileged anchors and reporters narrating and gatekeeping our society have been radicals adopting a journalist's pose. Terry pulled off his mask,” Miller wrote on X.
    


            Vice President JD Vance also posted a defense of Miller on X, stating that Miller is “motivated by love of country” and that ABC “should apologize.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration diverted 20,000 anti-drone missiles originally intended for Ukraine to American forces in the Middle East, in an interview with ABC News published on June 8.

Zelensky said Ukraine had counted on the missiles to help counter relentless Russian drone attacks, which include swarms of Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones. On June 1, Russia launched a record 472 drones in a single night.

"We have big problems with Shaheds… we will find all the tools to destroy them," Zelensky said. "We counted on this project — 20,000 missiles. Anti-Shahed missiles. It was not expensive, but it's a special technology."

Zelensky said the plan had been agreed upon with then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and was launched under President Joe Biden's administration. 

The Wall Street Journal reported on June 4 that the Trump administration had redirected the munitions, which include special fuzes used in advanced rocket systems to intercept drones, toward U.S. forces stationed in the Middle East.

The Pentagon reportedly informed Congress in a classified message that the reallocation of the fuzes for the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System was deemed an "urgent issue" by current Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

A Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent on June 4 that Russia is preparing to launch more than 500 long-range drones per night in future attacks, as Moscow rapidly scales up drone production and constructs new launch sites.

The Trump administration has halted the approval of new military aid packages to Ukraine since the start of his second term in January. 

Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about continued assistance to Kyiv and temporarily suspended military shipments earlier this year, only resuming them after Ukraine agreed to a ceasefire framework during peace talks in Jeddah on March 11.

Hegseth, who ordered the temporary halt, did not attend the most recent Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on June 4 — the first such absence by a U.S. defense chief since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.

Ukraine has urgently called on Western partners to expand investments in domestic arms production and deliver more air defense systems, including U.S.-made Patriots, to counter intensifying Russian airstrikes. 

Despite growing international appeals and Kyiv's offer of a 30-day ceasefire as the basis for peace talks, Moscow continues to reject the proposal.

Trump, who spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 4, has refused to impose new sanctions on Russia, saying he is focused on pursuing a negotiated ceasefire.

A KFF Health Tracking Poll shows anxiety is high about looming Medicaid cuts among voters across the political spectrum.

New survey data out Friday shows that Republicans are wrong if they remain unconcerned about public sentiment as it relates to the evisceration of Medicaid or healthcare support systems that would result from passage of their colossal legislation now making its way through Congress — a bill that, if passed, would see coverage stripped from an estimated 11-16 million people in the coming years.

According to new KFF Health Tracking Poll released Friday, anxiety is high among voters, across the political spectrum, about the negative impacts resulting from cuts to Medicaid or reductions in support for marketplace insurance plans supported by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

“Most of the public is worried about the consequences of significant reductions in federal Medicaid spending, including among many groups that would be directly impacted by the cuts,” KFF noted in its release of the new survey data. “Partisanship drives these attitudes to a certain extent, but about two-thirds or more of Republicans enrolled in Medicaid and those with lower incomes are worried that Medicaid spending reductions would hurt their families and their communities.”

KFF added that most adults in the country, based on the poll's findings, “are worried significant reductions in federal Medicaid spending will lead to more uninsured people and will strain healthcare providers in their communities. About 7 in 10 adults (72%) are worried that a significant reduction in federal funding for Medicaid would lead to an increase in the share of uninsured children and adults in the U.S., including nearly half (46%) who are ‘very worried' and 1 in 4 (25%) who are ‘somewhat worried.'”

CBO estimates that the House-passed budget bill would decrease federal spending by $793B and result in more than 10 million people losing Medicaid coverage.  Our latest poll explores the views of those who could be most directly impacted: https://t.co/uZhxbQqVcb pic.twitter.com/aWT69z4Yjf

KFF notes that more than a quarter of Medicaid enrollees in the country are Republican, including 1 in 5 who identify with President Donald Trump's far-right MAGA movement. At the same time, nearly half of likely ACA marketplace enrollees identify as Republican.

16 million Americans losing health coverage.The biggest cut to Medicaid in history.Higher health, energy, and housing costs.Tax cuts for billionaires, tax hikes for working people.$3 trillion added to the national debt.The Republican bill is a “disgusting abomination.”

The new poll results, as The Washington Post notes:

The findings illustrate the political perils of upending the public health insurance program as Senate Republicans feud over Medicaid cuts. As they face pressure to slash spending to finance President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and immigration legislation, they risk alienating their own supporters who depend on the program.

“Medicaid is really a popular program, and a large majority of Americans do not want to see decreases in spending,” Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at KFF, told the Post. “These findings reflect that many people, whether or not they rely on Medicaid, see it as vital to their communities.”

Tony Carrk, executive director of the progressive watchdog group Accountable.US, said Friday that Republicans in the Senate would be wise to stick to their public promises that Medicaid would not be cut or harmed, specifically referencing Sens. Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt of Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

“Now is the time for these Senators to practice what they preach,” said Caark. “A vote for the current bill is a vote to take away their constituents' healthcare—full stop.”

“If these senators do the right thing, they will save the healthcare of millions of people from Alaska to Maine,” he added. “But if they throw their support behind this bill, not only will they have lied to the American people, they will be ripping healthcare from those who need it the most, while the richest Americans — including many of them — could financially benefit.”

Last week, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) sparked fury when she said at a town hall, in response to a constituent warning that “people will die” if Medicaid cuts went through, that “we all are going to die.”

On Capitol Hill this week, the advocacy group Social Security Works tried to catch up with Ernst about the comments, but she would not respond to questions.

We asked Republican @SenJoniErnst from Iowa what her response was to 51,000 more Americans dying every year due to the GOP plan to cut Medicaid in the big, beautiful betrayal.She ran away from us– with a smile on her face.Who thinks she should lose her job? pic.twitter.com/Q8cBEk3XXL

“By the way,” the group later posted, “Iowans are PISSED about sacrificing their Medicaid for a billionaire tax handout” and pointed to a local protest in Ernst's home state where community members rallied against cuts.

Citing a new study showing that more than 50,000 people a year will die prematurely if the Medicaid cuts proposed by Republicans goes through, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), said, “In the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires. As the Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I will be doing everything that I can to see that this disastrous bill is defeated.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

The ship is carrying necessities including rice, flour, medical supplies, and baby formula to Gaza.

As the Madleen drew closer to Gaza on its mission to deliver desperately needed humanitarian aid to the besieged enclave, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib led a letter on Friday calling on the Trump administration to protect the Gaza Freedom Flotilla vessel and its 12 crew members.

“We write to urge you to do everything in your power to ensure the safety of the ship and its unarmed, civilian passengers and the success of their peaceful, humanitarian mission to deliver lifesaving aid,” Tlaib (D-Mich.) and 10 other progressive lawmakers wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

The lawmakers explained that their concern for the Madleen crew-members' safety stemmed “from the Israeli government's history of using lethal military force to prevent similar aid ships from arriving in Gaza.”

In 2010, for example, Israeli commandos killed nine activists onboard the Mavi Marmara during a raid, including one U.S. citizen. A 10th crew member, who was injured, later died as well. And as recently as May, another flotilla vessel, the Conscience, was attacked by drones off of Malta.

Crew members aboard the Madleen issued a distress signal on June 4 as drones circled overhead. Responding to the current voyage, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Brig.-Gen. Effie Defrin told reporters that the “IDF is prepared to operate on all fronts, including in the maritime arena,” and said, “We will act accordingly,” as The Jerusalem Post reported.

“We must be clear: Any attack on the Madleen or its civilian crew is a clear and blatant violation of international law,” the U.S. lawmakers wrote.

The ship is carrying necessities including rice, flour, medical supplies, and baby formula to Gaza, which has endured more than 600 days of Israeli bombardment and whose 2 million people face starvation following a two-month total aid blockade imposed by Israel that was only lifted in May after international pressure. However, the amount of aid allowed to enter is still severely curtailed.

Several human rights experts and organizations agree that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza with its deadly assault, which has killed at least 61,709 people since October 2023.

Crew members on the Madleen include French- Palestinian Member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan and Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, whose presence has sparked threats from right-wing figures, including U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who wrote on social media, “Hope Greta and her friends can swim!”

Tlaib and the other lawmakers criticized those threats, writing, “This is a serious matter, and we are deeply disturbed by U.S. elected officials making threatening ‘jokes' about violence against the civilians onboard.”

They urged Rubio “to monitor the Madleen's journey and deter any such hostile actions.”

The legislators concluded the letter by drawing attention to the reason the Madleen set sail in the first place:

Above all else, we urge you to address the issue at the root of this voyage: the brutal Israeli blockade and mass starvation of the Palestinian population of Gaza. We demand an immediate end to the blockade, an immediate resumption of unfettered humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, and an immediate and lasting cease-fire. While the Trump administration and the international community fail to use their immense leverage to end this blockade, the activists on board the Madleen are an example of humanitarianism and solidarity. They deserve safety, as does the besieged population of Gaza.

In addition to Tlaib, the letter was signed by Reps. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), Jesús G. “Chuy” García (D-Ill.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Greg Casar (D-Texas), Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), Al Green (D-Texas), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.)

Other political leaders have argued that international attention is the best way to protect the Madleen and its crew.

“The activists of the Madleen are risking their own lives to highlight the horrific cruelty of the Israeli government against the Palestinians in Gaza,” wrote Irish senator Lynn Ruane. “If those seeking aid are targets, then so too are those seeking to bring that aid, so all eyes must be firmly on the Freedom Flotilla; their lives depend on it.”

On Saturday, more than 200 members of parliament from Europe signed a letter to Israel urging it to guarantee the safety of all Madleen crew members, allow the ship to enter Gaza freely and safely, allow it to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, and lift its blockade on Gaza entirely.

“The world is watching,” the European politicians wrote. “This is an opportunity to demonstrate respect for humanitarian law and human rights.”

As of Saturday, the Madleen had reached the coast of Egypt.

“We are now sailing off the Egyptian coast,” crew member and German human rights activist Yasemin Acar told Agence France-Presse. “We are all good.”

Hassan, meanwhile, called on global governments to “guarantee safe passage for the Freedom Flotilla.”

A proposed rule from the Biden administration would protect 36 million workers from the hazards of extreme heat.

In July 2024, the Biden administration proposed a rule to address heat-related illness that it claimed would protect 36 million workers.

The directive would have required companies to monitor workers for heat stress, provide them with cool-down breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas, and ensure that they were given ample water.

“The purpose of this rule is simple,” a White House official told reporters at the time. “It is to significantly reduce the number of worker-related deaths, injuries, and illnesses suffered by workers exposed to excessive heat … while simply doing their jobs.”

The rule would have represented the first federal standard aimed at regulating the increasing dangers of climate change, but it was never finalized. And now, with Donald Trump in the White House, there is very little hope that it will be implemented.

In February, Trump nominated David Keeling to head the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Keeling has yet to be confirmed, but seeing as he is a former executive for Amazon and UPS, most assume that he won't be embracing the proposed heat rule.

Keeling oversaw health and safety protocols at those companies, and, according to an investigation by The Lever's Sam Pollak, they collectively received over 300 workplace safety citations while he was in charge, which added up to $2 million in OSHA fines. The citations included multiple heat-related incidents.

Republicans aren't waiting until Keeling takes power to challenge the Biden administration's proposed regulations. On March 19, Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Michigan), chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, sent a letter to newly confirmed Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer calling for the Department of Labor (DOL) to withdraw from the rule and rescind several additional OSHA directives.

“The committee recognizes that many burdensome regulations were developed at DOL during the Biden-Harris administration,” Walberg wrote.

When the GOP-controlled committee held a hearing on May 15, the subject was OSHA's alleged “overreach” on heat regulations. The Republicans showcased testimony from a number of pro-business witnesses including Felicia Watson, senior counsel at Littler Mendelson, which backs employers and has a history of defending union-busting.

“I've talked to people in New Mexico who say 80 degrees is a great day to build — it's perfect weather and you might have something completely different in Florida,” claimed Watson.

These sentiments were echoed by another Republican witness, Jake Parson, an executive at a building materials company who testified on behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers. Parson told the Congress members that, “When it comes to heat, what makes sense for Maine will not make sense for Texas.”

“OSHA standards are the bare minimum when it comes to workplace safety. Any lawmaker who wants to undo them just wants their billionaire backers to make another cent.”

Both witnesses were challenged by Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), a committee member who went on a thirst strike in 2023 to highlight the need for a federal workplace heat standard.

“It sounds like what you're saying is we have different conditions in Maine than in Texas,” said Casar. “But what I'm confused about is if it's 90 degrees in Austin or 90 degrees in Maine, 90 degrees is still 90 degrees.”

Without strong guidelines at the federal level, workers have to rely on the rules of their state.

California, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington have all adopted workplace heat protections of some kind and similar efforts are being pushed Arizona, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island.

“Policymakers don't have to start from scratch,” notes a recent report from the Center on American Progress. “Current state policies and the Biden administration's draft heat standard provide guidance for adopting or adapting occupational heat standards and can strengthen protections for outdoor and indoor workers.”

This fight has proved to be an uphill battle in states run by anti-regulation Republicans.

In April 2024, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation barring Florida localities from requiring companies to provide outdoor workers with rest, shade, and water. The move effectively killed a Miami-Dade effort to establish such protections in the county.

At a press conference, DeSantis admitted that the GOP plan was developed to invalidate the Miami victory.

“There was a lot of concern out of one county, Miami-Dade. And I don't think it was an issue in any other part of the state,” the governor explained. “I think they were pursuing something that was going to cause a lot of problems down there.”

Labor advocates in Austin faced a similar setback in 2024, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott passed the “Death Star” law, killing a rest-break ordinance passed by the city.

Texas AFL-CIO Organizing and Advocacy Director Ana Gonzalez told Truthout that such developments highlight the need to build bargaining power in the workplace.

“OSHA standards are the bare minimum when it comes to workplace safety. Any lawmaker who wants to undo them just wants their billionaire backers to make another cent,” said Gonzalez. “Texans have weathered worse storms, but with hotter summers, we must unionize every workplace to demand better safety standards. Otherwise, our state will keep leading the nation in workplace fatalities and injuries.”

The Trump administration's war on workplace safety, is certainly not limited to heat regulations.

President Trump has effectively shut down the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, closed multiple local OSHA offices, allowed Elon Musk's “Department of Government Efficiency” initiative to access sensitive OSHA files, and paused a rule on silica exposure, which can lead to severe health problems such as lung cancer.

A recent report from the Economic Policy Institute points out that between 5.2 million to 7.8 million workers already suffer work-related injuries and illnesses each year, a number that is likely to rise under the Trump administration.

The consumer rights group Public Citizen estimates that heat exposure results in 600 to 2,000 worker fatalities every year.

The report also notes out that weakened workplace regulations disproportionately impact workers of color, immigrant workers, and older workers. Over 33 percent of 2023's workplace fatalities occurred among workers 55 and older, while 67 percent of those killed were immigrant workers. Black and Latino workers are more likely to die while working than white workers.

“The bad news is we are facing a national workers' rights crisis, fueled by Trump administration attacks on long-standing worker health and safety protections and OSHA enforcement capacity, all while climate change is intensifying risks of deadly exposures to extreme heat in indoor and outdoor workplaces across the country,” the report's coauthor, Jennifer Sherer, told Truthout.

“The good news is that states don't need to wait to act, and can craft strong, effective heat standard policies that draw on decades of research and evidence-based best practices for preventing workplace deaths and boosting productivity,” she added.

The consumer rights group Public Citizen estimates that heat exposure results in 600 to 2,000 worker fatalities every year, and about 170,000 work injuries. The situation threatens to get much worse as temperatures rise as a result of climate change — 2024 was the warmest year on record. According to the World Meteorological Organization, there's an 80 percent chance that at least one of the next five years will exceed that mark.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Errol Musk, the father of U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, has arrived in Moscow to attend the Forum of the Future 2050, a pro-Kremlin event scheduled for June 9-10,  the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on June 8. 

The report comes amid a high-profile public conflict between Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest businessman, and his former ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. In May, Musk announced he would step down as an advisor to Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Since then, he has emerged as a major critic of the president.

The pro-Kremlin event will be hosted by the Tsargrad Institute and led by far-right Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin. 

"I am eager to meet everyone. As far as I know, Russians are among the most intelligent people on the planet. It would be foolish not to ask their opinion on all sorts of issues," Errol Musk was quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency TASS.

Among the forum's panels are sessions titled "Russian Space: The Race for Mars" and "The Battle for Hearts and Minds: The Ideology of Sovereign Russia." 

According to Kommersant, scheduled speakers include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, and prominent state TV anchor Ekaterina Andreeva.

Errol Musk, a former South African businessman and politician, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him "a strong leader" and saying that "it would be foolish not to admire Putin" in an April interview with BBC Russia.  

Errol's attendance at the far-right event comes amid growing scrutiny of his son, Elon Musk, whose role as the head of SpaceX and the Starlink satellite network places him at the center of both U.S. defense operations and Ukraine's battlefield communications.

SpaceX holds billions in Pentagon and NASA contracts, including a $1.8-billion agreement with the U.S. intelligence community to build a classified spy satellite system.

Despite initially aiding Ukraine by providing Starlink terminals to stabilize battlefield communications, Elon Musk has increasingly echoed Kremlin-aligned narratives. 

He has suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks public support in Ukraine and has repeatedly called U.S. aid a driver of a "never-ending draft meat grinder."

Those statements have been warmly received by Russian officials, military bloggers, and state media outlets, which have praised Musk as a voice of reason and a critic of Western involvement in the war.

Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's international affairs committee, said on June 6 that Moscow is ready to grant political asylum to Musk following his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump.


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

            Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh smashed the 400m freestyle world record in some style on Saturday, recording a time of 3:54.18 at the Canadian Swimming Trials.
    


            That time trimmed more than a second off the previous mark held by her longtime rival Ariarne Titmus, who beat the 18-year-old to the Olympic gold medal in this event at the 2024 Paris Games.
    


            Despite her age, McIntosh is already well accustomed to breaking records and winning the biggest titles in the sport – in Paris, she became Canada's first ever triple champion at a single Olympic Games.

            Still, breaking this world record provoked an emotional outburst rarely seen from McIntosh as she smashed the water and clenched her fist in celebration after noticing her time.
    


            “Touching the wall, you can kind of see my outburst of emotions because I was really not expecting that time. But overall I'm super, super happy,” she told reporters afterward.
    


            “I think just seeing the time after two years of really pushing my hardest every day and training in this event and not seeing the results…
    


            “So just kind of all that energy and anger and blood, sweat and tears built up and then finally having an amazing swim in it is just really, really satisfying.”
    


            McIntosh previously held the world record in this event before Titmus snaffled it, the Canadian recording a time of 3:56.08 in March 2023, almost two seconds slower than the mark she set on Saturday.
    


            This time around, she set off slower but recorded a blistering second half of the race to improve on her time.

Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops onto the streets of Los Angeles after a second day of violent protests against his immigration policies.

It came after protesters on Saturday confronted federal immigration officers who had been carrying out raids on businesses in Paramount, on the outskirts of the city.

Border Patrol officers in riot gear and masks deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades to disperse demonstrators outside an industrial park, where some had vandalised federal vehicles.

Activists used cement blocks and shopping carts to block the road and jeered at officers, as they called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers (ICE) to get “out of Paramount”.

They also shouted: “We see you for what you are” and “you are not welcome here”.

One handheld sign read: “No human being is illegal”.

In a statement on Saturday, the White House said Mr Trump was deploying the National Guard – despite opposition from Gavin Newsom, California's governor – to “address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester”.

The US president also wrote on his Truth Social platform that if Mr Newsom and the Los Angeles mayor “can't do their jobs, which everyone knows they can't” then “the federal government will step in and solve the problem”.

Mr Newsom said the government was “moving to take over the California National Guard and deploy 2,000 soldiers” and warned it would only escalate tensions.

“This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust,” said Mr Newson, who on Friday branded the ICE arrests “cruel”.

The governor also insisted local authorities were “able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice,” adding: “There is currently no unmet need”.

Meanwhile, Pete Hegseth, the US secretary of defence, said he would consider deploying marines from nearby Camp Pendleton if the violence persisted.

Tom Homan, the White House's border czar, told Fox News: “This is about enforcing the law – and again, we're not going to apologise for doing it.”

It follows a protest outside a detention centre in downtown LA on Friday night during which dozens of people were arrested as they demonstrated against a series of ICE raids on workplaces earlier in the day.

Karen Bass, LA's Democrat mayor, provoked fury from Republicans after she claimed that ICE's activity had been intended to “sow terror” in the nation's second-largest city.

But Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, hit back as he criticised the city's response to the protests.

He said: “Mayor Bass took the side of chaos and lawlessness over law enforcement. Make no mistake, ICE will continue to enforce our nation's immigration laws and arrest criminal illegal aliens.”

ICE took 40 people into custody earlier on Friday after searching multiple locations, including a clothing warehouse in the city's fashion district.

But a tense scene then unfolded as a crowd tried to block agents from driving away.

Advocates for immigrants' rights said people had also been taken into detention after being stopped by ICE officers outside Home Depot stores and a doughnut shop.

The action came after a judge found probable cause that an employer was using fictitious documents for some of its workers, according to representatives for Homeland Security Investigations and the US Attorney's Office.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, posted a message on social media addressing “LA rioters” which warned that interference with immigration enforcement would not be tolerated.

“You will not stop us or slow us down,” Ms Noem said on X, adding that ICE would “enforce the law” and that “if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Dan Bongino, the FBI's deputy director, confirmed multiple arrests had been made on Friday.

He posted on X: “You bring chaos, and we'll bring handcuffs. Law and order will prevail.”

Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that recent ICE operations in LA resulted in the arrest of 118 immigrants.

Following the Friday arrests, protesters gathered in the evening outside a federal detention centre, chanting, “Set them free, let them stay!”

Some held signs with anti-ICE slogans, while others scrawled graffiti on the building.

Among those arrested was David Huerta, the regional president of the Service Employees International Union.

Ciaran McEvoy, a Justice Department spokesman, confirmed he was being detained ahead of a court appearance on Monday.

It was not clear whether Mr Huerta had legal representation.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, called for his immediate release.

In a social media post, Mr Schumer cited a “disturbing pattern of arresting and detaining American citizens for exercising their right to free speech.”

The immigration arrests come as Mr Trump and his administration push to fulfil promises of mass deportations across the country.

People cycle and walk on the lakeshore path along Lake Ontario in Toronto in 2020.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press

If I'm walking on a multi-use path and I hear a bell from a cyclist approaching from behind, what am I supposed to do? Usually, the bikes are coming really fast. Often, it will be two bikes riding side by side. It seems like they expect me to leap out of the way (especially when they ring the bell incessantly) even if I'm on the rightmost side of the trail. 

I find it's getting worse now with so many people on e-bikes – especially people around my age (I'm in my 60s). My guess is some of them haven't cycled in years and think like entitled drivers. – Erin, Ontario

Despite what some cyclists think, ringing a bell doesn't mean “Scram, pedestrians!” 

If you're walking or running on a trail, cyclists should warn you that they're coming, but you don't have to get out of their way, experts said. 

“You may want to move if you can to stay safe, but it's not a legal requirement,” said Sean Shapiro, a traffic safety consultant and former Toronto traffic cop. “If I'm walking with my kids and I hear a bell, I'm going to look but I'm not going to leap, because I could leap into the cyclist's path and cause a collision.”

In Ontario, the Highway Traffic Act (HTA) requires cyclists, like drivers, to have “a bell, gong or horn” and use it “whenever is reasonably necessary to notify pedestrians” or face a $110 fine. 

That bell is just supposed to let you know that a cyclist is there, but you still generally have the right of way, Shapiro said. 

“You're a pedestrian – it's a pedestrian path or sidewalk," he said. “Everyone else is visiting.”

While the HTA generally doesn't apply on paths and trails, municipalities have their own bylaws around multi-use paths. Toronto's, for instance, includes a 20-kilometre-an-hour speed limit and a requirement to yield to pedestrians.

While the law varies by province and city, pedestrians usually have the right of way.

But cyclists should, generally, be yielding to pedestrians on trails even when it's not specifically required by local laws, said Patrick Brown, a Toronto-based personal injury lawyer who handles cycling-related cases.

“Shared respect should be maintained on all shared trails,” he said. “Cyclists have an added responsibility to pedestrians because they are heavier, faster and (can) cause serious injury to a pedestrian if struck.”

Civil discourse?

If you're seriously injured by a cyclist while you were walking or running, you could sue them for damages, Brown said. 

“[The court] would look at whether or not the cyclist's actions were reasonable in the circumstance,” he said. 

Damages, including pain and suffering, loss of income and care costs awarded by a court could be “a very substantial amount,” he said.

If the cyclist has home insurance, which includes personal liability insurance, it will cover the damages. 

“But if you didn't have home insurance, and a lot of people don't, especially in the city, that's a problem because you would be responsible for paying it,” he said, adding that if the collision is fatal and the cyclist is at fault, the amount of money could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

While incidents of pedestrians being seriously injured and killed by cyclists are relatively rare – especially compared to the number of cyclists and pedestrians seriously injured and killed by cars – they do happen, Brown said. 

But a pedestrian could also be found at fault, civilly, in a collision if, for instance, they ran out onto a trail in front of a bike without looking first and the bike had no way to stop in time, he said. 

“If you [try to avoid them] but peel off the trail into a ditch and fracture your neck, that pedestrian could be civilly responsible for what happened to you” as a cyclist, Brown said. “And that has happened, too.”

But if cyclists are coming up on somebody already on the trail, they should be slowing down and be ready to either stop or to go off the trail, if possible, to pass slowly, he said. 

That's because pedestrians may not hear you, they may not be able to move out of your way or, especially if they're with small kids, they could move unpredictably.

“If you're driving a car in a school zone, you better slow down and you better be wary that kids could run out in front of your car and you better drive accordingly,” he said. “It's the exact same thing with cyclists. You're riding through trails in park areas [with] families having picnics. So you should be going at a very low speed [so]… when the unexpected happens, you'll be able to brake and avoid it.”

That's especially true for e-bikes, which are heavier and need more distance to stop, he said. 

Generally, then, it's smartest for walkers and runners to keep calm and carry on when they hear that bell, Brown said.

“If you step out to the left or you step out to the right, how do you know what the bike will do?” he said. “Just keep going at your same pace and be conscious that there's a bike coming up from behind.”

While it's not a bad idea for pedestrians to stick to the right side of a trail, they don't have to unless there's a local bylaw requiring it (Toronto's doesn't), he said. That's true even when there's a painted centre line on the trail.

“If there's a family taking up a whole path, then the expectation is for the cyclist to slow down and stop until there's an opportunity to go around them or until they move,” he said. “There's no right at all to barrel through that, even if you think you have the right of way.”

MOSCOW, June 8. /TASS/. Paratroopers from Novorossiysk destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot and manpower by drones in the Zaporozhye Region, Russia's Defense Ministry reported on Sunday.

"Operators of attack unmanned aerial vehicles of Novorossiysk paratroopers destroyed an ammunition depot and up to a squad of the Ukrainian infantry in the Zaporozhye Region. After flying over several kilometers, the operators spotted a camouflaged ammunition depot in a forest belt where the Ukrainian infantry periodically arrived for replenishing the ammunition load," the ministry said in a statement.

Following the target acquisition of a reconnaissance UAV, quadcopter drones dropped explosives and destroyed the field depot, triggering stored ammunition detonation. Subsequently, the operators detected the movement of enemy infantry in a stronghold. Up to a squad of the Ukrainian army tried to hide in a dugout but were eliminated by three accurate hits of FPV drones, the ministry said.

Novorossiysk paratroopers daily accomplish combat objectives using UAVs to destroy enemy manpower, armored combat vehicles, artillery and mortar crews and field ammunition depots camouflaged in forest belts. Reconnaissance and attack UAV teams operate jointly round the clock thanks to night vision cameras mounted on drones, it said.

LUGANSK, June 8. /TASS/. Russian troops are encircling the Ukrainian combat group in the settlement of Radkovka in the Kharkov Region, military expert Andrey Marochko told TASS on Sunday.

"Our fighters are encircling the entire enemy combat group entrenched in Radkovka and its outskirts," the military expert said.

The Ukrainian forces have assumed an all-round defense in Radkovka. As of now, the enemy has retained "a small terrain sector" southwest of the community, through which the Kiev regime can still deploy forces and capabilities and replenish losses, he specified.

"The enemy has quite serious fortifications in that community and terrain is rather complex but your guys are dealing with that," Marochko stressed.

The military expert told TASS on June 4 that Russian troops had begun to create a fire pocket for the Ukrainian combat group in Radkovka.

The Trump administration has ordered National Guard troops to deploy to Los Angeles following violent confrontations between Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and protesters.

Demonstrators clashed with federal authorities and attempted to force their way into the Roybal Federal Building on June 6, as ICE agents carried out multiple immigration sweeps throughout Los Angeles County.

Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter discusses the protesters clashing with ICE agents in Los Angeles and New York City on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.'

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's suggestion that he could send U.S. Marines to quell anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement riots in Los Angeles would not be a heavy-handed approach. 

In an appearance on ABC's "This Week," Johnson was asked to respond to President Donald Trump sending in National Guard troops to Los Angeles. 

Trump said he would pursue the federal government taking control of the California National Guard if Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass "can't do their jobs" to protect Los Angeles against rioting and looting. 

"I have no concern about that at all," Johnson told ABC host Jonathan Karl. "I think the president did exactly what he needed to do. These are federal laws and we have to maintain the rule of law, and that is not what is happening. Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or an unwillingness to do what is necessary there, so the president stepped in. That's real leadership, and he has the authority and the responsibility to do it."

Karl also asked about a message posted by Hegseth, who wrote on X Saturday that the Department of Defense was mobilizing the National Guard "IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angles," and "if the violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized – they are on high alert."

"One of our core principles is maintaining peace through strength," Johnson said in response Sunday. "We do that on foreign affairs and domestic affairs as well. I don't think that's heavy-handed. I think that's an important signal…." 

"You don't think sending the Marines into the streets of an American city is heavy-handed?" Karl interjected. 

"We have to be prepared to do what is necessary, and I think the notice that that might happen might have the deterring effect," Johnson said. 

Newsom responded to Hegseth's threat on X, writing: "The Secretary of Defense is now threatening to deploy active-duty Marines on American soil against its own citizens. This is deranged behavior." 

"Deranged = allowing your city to burn & law enforcement to be attacked," Hegseth hit back Sunday morning. "There is plenty of room for peaceful protest, but ZERO tolerance for attacking federal agents who are doing their job."

"The National Guard, and Marines if need be, stand with ICE," the defense secretary added.

In his initial message Saturday, Hegseth said, "The violent mob assaults on ICE and Federal Law Enforcement are designed to prevent the removal of Criminal Illegal Aliens from our soil; a dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels (aka Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and a huge NATIONAL SECURITY RISK. Under President Trump, violence & destruction against federal agents & federal facilities will NOT be tolerated. It's COMMON SENSE." 

Generally, the U.S. military is not allowed to carry out civilian law enforcement duties against U.S. citizens except in times of emergency.

SOCIAL MEDIA, TRUMP ADMIN ERUPTS OVER LA MAYOR'S REACTION TO ICE RAIDS: 'YOU'RE A CRIMINAL TOO'

An 18th-century wartime law called the Insurrection Act is the main legal mechanism that a president can use to activate the military or National Guard during times of rebellion or unrest. But Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act on Saturday.

Instead, the president's memorandum called "into Federal service members and units of the National Guard under 10 U.S.C. 12406 to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations." 

The federal law cited in the memo allows the president to federalize National Guard troops under three circumstances: When the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion; when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the U.S. government, or when the president is unable to "execute the laws of the United States," with regular forces. But the law also says that orders for those purposes "shall be issued through the governors of the States."

The National Guard is a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. 

It's not immediately clear if the president can activate National Guard troops without the order of that state's governor. 

It's also not clear if military personnel can be deployed. 

Under the Posse Comitatus Act, troops under federal orders cannot be used for domestic law enforcement, but units under state control can. Enacted in the late 1800s during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War, the federal law limits the powers of the federal government to deploy the U.S. military for domestic law enforcement reasons "except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress."

Trump threatened to use the Insurrection Act during the height of 2020 rioting in the wake of George Floyd's death, but ultimately did not do so. He did deploy federal agents to several U.S. cities, including Portland, where rioters attempted to breach a federal courthouse, clashing with law enforcement officers and targeting the building with Molotov cocktails and other projectiles for over 100 consecutive nights.

            • LA deployment: About 300 National Guardsmen are deployed at three locations around Los Angeles, the California governor's office said this morning. It follows a presidential memorandum signed by President Donald Trump Saturday, sending 2,000 National Guardsmen to disperse protests sparked by immigration raids.
    


• Immigration crackdown: Immigration authorities and demonstrators have clashed for two days in the Los Angeles area, with unrest beginning Friday after dozens of people were detained by federal immigration agents across different locations.
    


            • Top officials gather: Trump is expected to meet with senior members of his administration today at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to two sources.
    


            The Los Angeles Police Department denied an allegation made by the ACLU that its officers had “assisted federal agents in terrorizing L.A. neighborhoods,” describing the claim as “both inflammatory and demonstrably false.”
    


            Andres Kwon, attorney and senior policy counsel at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, had said in a statement that “city leaders broke their promise” and LAPD officers had assisted federal agents, “impeding people from going to work, making their immigration court appearances, or attending their children's graduations.”
    


            In response, the police department told CNN today:
    


                    “To be clear, the LAPD does not participate in immigration enforcement operations and was not made aware in advance of the federal activity referenced. When a request for assistance was made by federal authorities, the LAPD responded to ensure the safety of all individuals involved—residents, demonstrators, and law enforcement alike.“Our Department's role was limited, measured, and guided by our responsibility to ensure public safety and restore order—not to support immigration enforcement. At no time did the LAPD impede anyone from accessing work, court, or public events.“The LAPD will always respond immediately to all requests for assistance from other law enforcement agencies whether they be local, state or Federal. The LAPD has, and will continue, to support our law enforcement partners immediately upon request.”
                





            Members of the Northern Command of the National Guard are on the ground in Los Angeles after President Donald Trump deployed them in response to immigration enforcement action protests that broke out Friday.
    


Here's what to know this morning:



CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas, Kaitlin Collins, Michelle Watson, Gregory Clary, Antoinette Radford and Kit Maher contributed reporting.  



            The Fair Immigration Reform Movement condemned what it characterized as “the Trump administration's increasingly authoritarian and violent campaign against immigrant communities and the people of the United States” in a news release this morning.
    


                    “We are workers, neighbors, students, parents — people who contribute to and sustain California's economy and future,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights. “The real crisis is the deliberate escalation by federal immigration authorities — and the effort to shift blame onto communities who are responding to fear, grief, and injustice.”
                





            The Fair Immigration Reform Movement's co-chair and president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition Murad Awawdeh also condemned the law enforcement response to the California protests.
    


            “Donald Trump is waging an all-out war against our communities and our democracy,” said Awawdeh in the release. “The coordinated assault on immigrants — raiding homes, stalking people in courthouses, and targeting children at school — now expands into a terrifying threat to use military force against lawful protestors. This action does nothing but incite fear and chaos, while exerting control through the threat of violence.”
    


            The US Northern Command said members of the California 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team are now on the ground in Los Angeles.
    


            President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum last night deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to disperse protests that began in response to immigration raids on Friday.
    


            “Additional information will be provided as units are identified and deployed,” NORTHCOM said in a social media post.



            Separately, the California governor's office said in a statement that 300 National Guardsmen were “deployed between 0200-0400 Sunday at three sites around Los Angeles.”
    


            President Trump's federalization of National Guard troops to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles on Saturday marks the first time a US chief executive has used such power since the 1992 LA riots in reaction to the acquittal of four White police officers in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King.
    


            Dozens of people were killed, thousands injured and thousands arrested during several days of rioting in Los Angeles at the time. Damage to property was estimated at more than $1 billion, in one of the worst civil disturbances in US history.
    


            Other federal mobilizations of the National Guard since World War II were made to support enforcement of the expansion of civil rights and ensure public order during the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957; the University of Mississippi in 1962; the University of Alabama and Alabama public schools in 1963, according to the National Guard's website.
    


            Guard units also came under federal control to restore public order during the Detroit riots in 1967, in response to the assassination of civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 and the New York postal strike in 1970, according to the Guard's website.
    


            Presidential mobilization of state militias was first authorized by Congress in 1792, in that case to help repel foreign invasions and suppress domestic insurrections, the website says.
    


            The biggest ever federalization of state militias was made by President Abraham Lincoln, when he called up 75,000 troops to fight the Confederacy and later support Reconstruction.
    


            After that, no president federalized state militias until the Detroit riots, according to the website.
    


Key difference: Unlike Trump's federalization of National Guard troops this weekend, the 1992 mobilization was requested by then-California Gov. Pete Wilson. Now, Gov. Gavin Newsom has called the deployment of National Guard troops to the LA immigration protests “purposefully inflammatory.”
    


George Floyd protests: The National Guard was also deployed in Los Angeles in 2020, but at the request of Newsom, not the president. According to The Associated Press, 5,500 National Guard soldiers were mobilized in Los Angeles County in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom called President Donald Trump on Friday and they spoke for approximately 40 minutes, according to the governor's office.
    


            The call took place after the widescale immigration enforcement began in Los Angeles, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN.
    


            Trump has signed a presidential memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to disperse protests that began in response to the immigration raids. California Gov. Gavin Newsom in a post on X Saturday night called the deployment “purposefully inflammatory” and warned it would only escalate tensions.
    


            About 300 members of the California National Guard are currently at three locations in the Los Angeles area, according to a statement from the governor's office.
    


            The US Secretary of Homeland Security said National Guard soldiers are in Los Angeles to maintain peace amid ongoing tensions between immigration authorities and demonstrators this weekend.
    


            “These 2,000 National Guard soldiers that are being engaged today are ones that are specifically trained for this type of crowd situation,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on CBS's “Face the Nation” Sunday.
    


            Noem said the soldiers are there to “provide security for operations and to make sure that we have peaceful protests,” but did not provide specifics about their activities on the ground.
    


            Noem criticized Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and the LAPD for their response to this weekend's protests against immigration operations in the area.
    


            “We're not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen,” she said, referencing the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in Minneapolis during the summer of 2020.
    


            When asked about claims that migrants are being held in makeshift facilities with limited access to food and water, Noem did not directly address the question.
    


            “What I would say is getting individuals in and out of those facilities was extremely challenging when the violence broke out, and when things were being thrown at vehicles and people were rocking vehicles and shaking them, trying to break into them,” she said.
    


            Multiple people have been arrested in Los Angeles and New York as authorities crack down on people obstructing immigration enforcement activities, Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino said today.
    


Posting to social media, Bongino said those arrested face federal, local and state charges.
    


             “It will not end well for you if you choose violence. Choose wisely.”
    


            His comments come after President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum last night deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to disperse protests that began in response to immigration raids.
    


            About 300 members of the California National Guard are currently in Los Angeles following two consecutive days of protests over immigration enforcement action, Izzy Gardon, Director of Communications for Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN in an email Sunday.
    


                    “There are approximately 300 California National Guard in Los Angeles currently. They were deployed between 0200-0400 Sunday at three sites around Los Angeles,” Gardon said.
                





            As President Donald Trump and his administration make the push to advance his domestic agenda, tensions with Elon Musk continue to make headlines.
    


Here's the latest from the Sunday morning political shows:



            Americans largely approve of President Donald Trump's program to find and deport immigrants who are in the US illegally but they are not sold on the way he's carrying it out, according to a new poll from CBS News and YouGov.
    


            The poll was completed just before protests over deportations in Los Angeles. Some other key findings include:
    


            Overall, Trump's approval rating has held steady in CBS's trends since the 100-day mark of his presidency – 45% approve and 55% disapprove. CBS/YouGov has typically found approval ratings for the president that are a few points higher than other high-quality polls. On average across polls that meet CNN's standards for reporting since early May, 43% approve of Trump's handling of the presidency.
    


            The CBS News/YouGov poll was conducted online from June 4 through 6 among a random national sample of 2,428 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.
    


            Protests in response to immigration raids escalated Saturday in and around Los Angeles. In Paramount, California, tear gas and flash bangs were used to disperse demonstrations.
    


            Democratic Rep. Nanette Barragán said she has been told to prepare for a large presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in California.
    


            “We've been told to get ready for 30 days of enforcement. Thirty days of ICE enforcement,” she told CNN's Dana Bash today, adding that the presence of National Guardmen is “going to escalate the situation.”
    


            President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum last night deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to disperse protests that began in response to immigration raids, including in the city of Paramount, which is in Barragán's constituency.
    


                    “We haven't asked for the help. We don't need the help. This is him escalating it, causing tensions to rise. It's only going to make things worse in a situation where people are already angry over immigration enforcement,” she said.
                





            When asked about the LA County Sheriff's office describing protesters as “exhibiting violent behaviour towards federal agents and deputy sheriffs” the congresswoman had a clear message: “Don't get violent.”
    


            But, she said the violence was not coming from anti-immigration protesters.
    


            “Last night, when I talked to the sheriff, he had told me the situation in Paramount was under control, the people that were peacefully protest have left. The situation was now across the street into the Compton area and this was the unruly folks — that Saturday night crowd — the people that were there to actually protest immigration were gone.
    


            “We agree that if you're being violent, you should be arrested, you should be prosecuted,” she said.
    


            The Los Angeles Police Department said protests in the city last night were peaceful.
    


                    “While today's events concluded without incident, the Los Angeles Police Department remains fully prepared to respond swiftly and appropriately to any potential acts of civil unrest,” the LAPD said in a statement.
                





            President Donald Trump has signed off on the deployment of 2,000 National Guardsman to Los Angeles, though Mayor Karen Bass said there was no evidence of the National Guard on the ground yet.
    


            “We will maintain a heightened readiness posture and remain ready to ensure the continued safety of our communities,” the LAPD said.
    


Reminder: The LAPD does not have jurisdiction over Paramount, a city in Los Angeles County, where protesters exhibited “violent behavior towards federal agents and deputy sheriffs,” the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said in an advisory late Saturday.
    


            Protests have gripped Los Angeles this weekend, sparked in response to immigration raids carried out on Friday.
    


Here's what to know about the demonstrations:



Why did they start? Protests in and around Los Angeles erupted on Friday after at least 44 people were arrested by federal immigration agents earlier in the day. The arrests come amid Trump's crackdown on immigration, which has involved waves of raids and deportations across the country. Late into Saturday, some protesters gathered near an immigration holding center in Alameda.



What happened on Saturday? Law enforcement used tear gas and flash bangs in an effort to disperse the crowd in Paramount, California, and some protesters were detained. But the situation escalated when President Donald Trump said he was deploying 2,000 members of the National Guard to control protesters in the evening. Trump claimed local officials had failed to deal with the unrest, and the federal government would “solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!”
    


How are people responding to the National Guard? California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the deployment of troops “purposefully inflammatory” and said it would only escalate tensions. The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, said there was no evidence of the National Guard on the ground, despite Trump praising their efforts. And the League of United Latin American Citizens also condemned Trump's order, saying that the move “marks a deeply troubling escalation in the administration's approach to immigration and civilian reaction to the use of military-style tactics.”
    


The latest from the ground: Small groups of protesters continued to gather and disrupt traffic near the Metropolitan Detention Center in Alameda late Saturday, despite repeated warnings from police to disperse. At midnight, the LAPD announced several people who re-entered areas of “unlawful assembly” have been detained and some will be “arrested and booked.” It is unclear how many people were detained.
    


            The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department told CNN some remaining protesters threw fireworks at law enforcement, while officers formed a skirmish line to push people away from the area.
    


            President Donald Trump said early today he would ban the use of masks by protesters, after two days of unrest in Los Angeles.
    


            “MASKS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED to be worn at protests. What do these people have to hide, and why???” the president posted on Truth Social.
    


            ICE officers are allowed to wear masks, however, with the agency's acting director Todd Lyons saying recently the agents cover up to protect their families.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to meet with senior members of his administration today at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to two sources.
    


            “The White House has organized what will become a regular off campus retreat of principals attended by the President and Vice President,” a White House official said.
    


            They'll meet on a number of issues and topics, the official said.
    


            Attendees are expected to include Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, according to another person familiar with the meeting.
    


            Trump is expected to stay at Camp David tonight and return to the White House tomorrow, according to the White House official.

President Donald Trump is deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom after a second day of clashes between hundreds of protesters and federal immigration authorities in riot gear.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — National Guard troops began arriving in Los Angeles early Sunday on orders from President Donald Trump in response to clashes in recent days between federal immigration authorities and protesters seeking to block them from carrying out deportations.

Members of California's National Guard were seen staging at the federal complex in downtown Los Angeles that includes the Metropolitan Detention Center, one of several sites that have drawn confrontations involving hundreds of people in the last two days.

Trump has said he is deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell the protests, which he called “a form of rebellion.”

The move came over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom, marking the first time in decades that a state's national guard was activated without a request from its governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

Early Sunday, the deployment was limited to a small area in downtown Los Angeles, with the rest of the city of 4 million people largely unaffected. 

Their arrival follows two days of relatively small protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.

As federal agents staged near a Home Depot in Paramount, demonstrators sought to block Border Patrol vehicles, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, federal agents in riot gear unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls.




Tensions were high after a series of sweeps by immigration authorities the previous day, as the weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the city climbed past 100. A prominent union leader was arrested while protesting and accused of impeding law enforcement.

Newsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor's office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday.

On Sunday morning, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the National Guard would “keep peace and allow people to be able to protest but also to keep law and order.” 

The troops included members of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to a social media post from the Department of Defense that showed dozens of National Guard members with long guns and an armored vehicle. 

In a signal of the administration's aggressive approach, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened to deploy active-duty Marines “if violence continues” in the region.

Newsom, a Democrat, described Trump's decision to call in the National Guard as a “provocative show of force” that would only escalate tensions, adding that Hegseth's threat to deploy Marines on American soil was “deranged behavior.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said the order by Trump reflected “a president moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism” and “usurping the powers of the United States Congress.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, endorsed the president's move, doubling down on Republicans' criticisms of California Democrats.

“Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or an unwillingness to do what is necessary, so the president stepped in,” Johnson said on ABC “This Week.”

This week on ‘Fox News Sunday,' Shannon Bream speaks with Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., about what it would take for him to support President Donald Trump's spending bill.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other politicians from the U.S. and Latin America condemned the shooting of Colombian presidential candidate Miguel Uribe on Sunday.

Rubio blamed the assassination attempt on "violent leftist rhetoric" originating from the Colombian government. Uribe, a Colombian senator, is currently fighting for his life after sustaining three gunshot wounds, one of which was to the head.

"The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the attempted assassination of Senator Miguel Uribe. This is a direct threat to democracy and the result of the violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government," Rubio wrote.

"Having seen firsthand Colombia's progress over the past few decades to consolidate security and democracy, it can't afford to go back to dark days of political violence. President Petro needs to dial back the inflammatory rhetoric and protect Colombian officials," he added.

Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno also condemned the attack in a statement on social media.

"The assassination attempt on leading presidential candidate Miguel Uribe is a vile attack on democracy. This evil act must be investigated and anyone responsible, directly or indirectly, must face swift punishment," Moreno wrote.

Chilean President Gabriel Boric also reacted to Uribe's shooting.

"My strongest condemnation of the attack against Miguel Uribe Turbay, pre-presidential candidate in Colombia. In a democracy, violence has no place or justification," Boric wrote.

Authorities say Uribe was shot by a boy less than 15 years old, and they are investigating who was behind the attack. Police recovered a 9mm "Glock-type" pistol from the suspect.

"Miguel is fighting for his life at this moment. Let us ask God to guide the hands of the doctors who are attending to him," Maria Claudia Tarazona, Miguel's wife, wrote on her husband's X account. "I ask everyone to join together in a prayer chain for Miguel's life."

Tarazona later announced that Uribe's initial surgery at the hospital "went well," though he remains in intensive care.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Uribe's chief opponent in the presidential race, said the attack crossed a "red line" and ordered an investigation. He also canceled a planned trip to France this week, citing the "seriousness of the events."

The National Guard was deployed to Los Angeles County as anti-ICE protests continued to escalate Saturday afternoon and into the evening. The unrest is centered in the city of Paramount, California, where protesters clashed with federal authorities, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who were allegedly trying to conduct a raid at a local business.

incoming update…





U.S. Northern Command on Sunday confirmed that National Guard troops have begun to deploy to the Los Angeles area, where confrontations between anti-ICE rioters and law enforcement have happened over the weekend.

The command said that some elements of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team from the California National Guard were already on the ground, while others were still deploying.

The command did not immediately provide the exact locations or assignments for the National Guard troops.


Two federal sources told Fox News on Sunday morning that the National Guard is actively protecting federal assets in Los Angeles County.

The Trump administration earlier said it took over the California National Guard and deployed 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles.





Riots against the Trump administration's immigration raids in Southern California are rocking Los Angeles this weekend and California Republicans are pinning blame for the violence on Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass.  


"Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass have a real habit of letting Los Angeles burn," Republican California Rep. Darell Issa posted to X on Saturday evening.  "If only Karen Bass fought against the Los Angeles fires like she fights for illegal aliens," Issa added in another post, referring to the Palisades fire that tore through Southern California in January.  

Other California Republicans and conservatives have also directed their ire at Democratic leaders for the violence, Fox Digital found.  

"Gavin Newsom seems to think that California can not only defy federal immigration law, but now federal tax law. The doctrine of nullification died with the Confederacy. What's next: firing on Fort Ord?" Republican California Rep. Tom McClintock posted to X, referring to Newsom floating withholding federal taxes in response to reports of the Trump administration cutting funding to the state.  


This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News Digital's Emma Colton. To read more, click here.





More than 20 anti-ICE rioters were arrested in New York City on Saturday during a confrontation with immigration authorities. 

A mob of nearly 150 people tried to block federal officials from conducting immigration raids in Lower Manhattan, with some screaming and cursing at authorities. 

Demonstrators, some of whom were masked, threw rocks at an unmarked white van with tinted windows as it tried to pull away from the plaza where U.S. Immigration Court is located, the New York Post reported. Others reportedly tried to block the van with their bodies.





A car was set on fire in the middle of an intersection in Los Angeles on Saturday as tensions flared between anti-ICE demonstrators and immigration authorities.

Aerial video shows the tense scene as it unfolded in Los Angeles.


Two individuals are seen circling the burning car on motorbikes, with one waving a Mexican flag. Dozens of others stood on the outskirts of the intersection.

The video shows law enforcement in riot gear arriving at the scene alongside fire trucks before they begin to walk toward the car burning in the intersection.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was acting “deranged” over his threat to deploy active-duty Marines to the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles.

“The Secretary of Defense is now threatening to deploy active-duty Marines on American soil against its own citizens,” Newsom wrote on X. “This is deranged behavior.”





Newsom was responding to Hegseth's post on Saturday, in which the defense secretary wrote that the Pentagon is mobilizing the National Guard to respond to anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles and warned that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton may also be deployed "if violence continues."

“Under President Trump, violence & destruction against federal agents & federal facilities will NOT be tolerated. It's COMMON SENSE,” Hegseth wrote. “The @DeptofDefense is mobilizing the National Guard IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles. And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert.”





U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said President Donald Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles to respond to anti-ICE protests was "completely inappropriate and misguided."


"Using the National Guard this way is a completely inappropriate and misguided mission," Padilla wrote on X.

"The Trump Administration is just sowing more chaos and division in our communities," he continued.

This comes after the Trump administration took over the California National Guard and deployed 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles.

President Donald Trump on Sunday morning thanked the National Guard "for a job well done" in responding to anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, California, and said masks will not be allowed at protests.

Trump took jabs at California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats, as he gave high praise to the National Guard.

"Great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence, clashes and unrest. We have an incompetent Governor (Newscum) and Mayor (Bass) who were, as usual (just look at how they handled the fires, and now their VERY SLOW PERMITTING disaster. Federal permitting is complete!), unable to to handle the task," Trump wrote on Truth Social.


"These Radical Left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will NOT BE TOLERATED," he continued. "Also, from now on, MASKS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED to be worn at protests. What do these people have to hide, and why??? Again, thank you to the National Guard for a job well done!"

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department arrested two individuals for alleged assault on law enforcement officers Saturday night.

The sheriff's department told CBS News Los Angeles that the two suspects were arrested for alleged assault on peace officers.

One of the individuals allegedly threw a molotov cocktail, which struck three deputies, the outlet reported.





Multiple people were detained during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, California, on Saturday, according to police.

The Los Angeles Police Department
 said officers detained the individuals for failing to disperse after multiple warnings were issued.

"Remaining people in the area of the UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY will be subject to arrest," LAPD wrote on X.

"Leave the area," the agency added.





California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said Saturday that the Trump administration is taking over the state's National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles because it wants a "spectacle," leading the White House to shoot back that the governor has done "nothing" to stop the violence at the anti-ICE protests.

"The federal government is taking over the California National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles — not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle," Newsom wrote on X. "Don't give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully."


White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded that Newsom has "done nothing to stop this violence" and "should be thanking President Trump for bringing law and order to California."

"Illegal criminal aliens and violent mobs have been committing arson, throwing rocks at vehicles, and attacking federal law enforcement for days," she wrote. "Gavin Newsom has done nothing to stop this violence."

"He should be thanking President Trump for bringing law and order to California — a basic value that Newsom and his fellow Democrats have failed to uphold," she added.



Fox News Digital/ Louis Casiano Jr.



Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday that the Pentagon is mobilizing the National Guard to respond to anti-ICE protests in California and warned that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton may be deployed as well "if violence continues."

"The violent mob assaults on ICE and Federal Law Enforcement are designed to prevent the removal of Criminal Illegal Aliens from our soil; a dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels (aka Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and a huge NATIONAL SECURITY RISK," Hegseth wrote on X.

The secretary said that under the Trump administration, violence and destruction against federal agents and federal facilities "will NOT be tolerated," adding: "It's COMMON SENSE."


"The @DeptofDefense is mobilizing the National Guard IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles," he wrote. "And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert."



Fox News Digital/ Louis Casiano Jr.



Following violent anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles on Saturday night, FBI Director Kash Patel warned "if you assault a law enforcement officer, you're going to jail—period."

"It doesn't matter where you came from, how you got here, or what cause you claim to represent," Patel told Fox News Digital. "If local jurisdictions won't stand behind the men and women who wear the badge, the FBI will."


President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Paramount, California after immigration authorities driving in the area were pelted with rocks, stones, and concrete — shattering government vehicle windshields.

"Doesn't matter where you came from, how you got here, or what movement speaks to you. If the local police force won't back our men and women on the thin blue line, we @FBI will," Patel wrote on X.



Fox News Digital/ Louis Casiano Jr.



Los Angeles
 mayor Karen Bass said Saturday that violence and destruction are "unacceptable" and that anyone responsible will be held accountable, as protests continue against immigration authorities conducting raids at businesses in Southern California.

"This is a difficult time for our city," Bass wrote on X. "As we recover from an unprecedented natural disaster, many in our community are feeling fear following recent federal immigration enforcement actions across Los Angeles County."

"Reports of unrest outside the city, including in Paramount, are deeply concerning," she continued. "We've been in direct contact with officials in Washington, D.C., and are working closely with law enforcement to find the best path forward."

"Everyone has the right to peacefully protest, but let me be clear: violence and destruction are unacceptable, and those responsible will be held accountable," the mayor added.



Fox News Digital/Louis Casiano Jr.



The National Guard will be deployed to Los Angeles County after anti-ICE protests continued to escalate Saturday afternoon, Trump administration border czar Tom Homan told Fox News Saturday.

On Saturday, tear gas was deployed near Home Depot in Paramount, California, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were allegedly conducting a raid.


Following the raid, a violent protest broke out and several arrests were made for assault on a federal agent, according to U.S. Border Patrol Chief Michael W. Banks.

President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to call out state and local leadership's inaction.

"If Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can't do their jobs, which everyone knows they can't, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!" Trump wrote.

Newsom responded on X, claiming the federal government "is moving to take over the California National Guard" and deploy 2,000 soldiers.


"That move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions," Newsom wrote. "LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice. We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need. The Guard has been admirably serving LA throughout recovery. This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust."

CNN national security analyst and former DHS official Juliette Kayyem warns that Trump's National Guard deployment is "quite extreme" and could escalate tensions rather than ease unrest.

The parade on June 14 will feature dozens of M1-A1 Abrams tanks and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles rolling through the streets of DC, as well as Howitzers and other artillery pieces, officials said.

            The last time Whitney Decker saw her three daughters, she gave them each a hug and kiss goodbye, not realizing it would be the last time she saw them alive.
    


            The sisters, 5-year-old Olivia, 8-year-old Evelyn and 9-year-old Paityn Decker, were found suffocated to death at an abandoned campsite in Washington state on Monday, police said, sparking an intense manhunt for their father, Travis Decker.



            Whitney had handed the girls over to Decker, 32, for their regularly scheduled custody visit on May 30, the Friday before the devastating discovery. Though the couple had been divorced for several years, they maintained communication as co-parents and friends, her attorney Arianna Cozart told CNN.
    


            “We'll see you at eight,” he last told Whitney, Cozart said. Whitney noticed he was quieter than usual, but the exchange took place without any problems, and she didn't think much of it – until the sun slipped behind the hills, dusk spilling across the sky, and the girls still weren't home.
    


            Decker wasn't supposed to keep his daughters out after 8 p.m. and their custody plan specified no overnight visits, Whitney told the Wenatchee police when she reported the girls missing.
    


            His phone was going straight to voicemail, she told police.
    


            The mother appeared to have been crying when she arrived at the police station, police said, telling them Decker “has never failed to return the kids” and typically lets her know when he is running late, according to a police affidavit filed in the Chelan County Superior Court.
    


            Whitney told police that while he had a “good relationship” with his daughters and they enjoyed their time together, she believed he was experiencing mental health issues, according to the affidavit.
    


            “But he never displayed any sort of ‘red flags' to Whitney,” Cozart said.
    


            After speaking with Whitney, police checked the hotels and motels in Wenatchee as well as the camping roster at the state park, and then the wider area. Decker's name was not listed anywhere.
    


            The Wenatchee Police Department requested the Washington State Patrol issue an Amber Alert the day the girls went missing, but because “there was no current evidence” the girls were at risk of serious injury or death, an alert was not issued, according to the police affidavit.
    


            The following day, when Decker and the girls did not show up to a running event scheduled at the park, police provided more information to the Washington State Patrol, which then issued an Endangered Missing Person Alert, seeking the community's help in locating Olivia, Evelyn and Paityn.
    


            Their disappearance kicked off an intensive search that grew as friends, family and volunteers came out to look for the girls. Then, on Monday the father's pickup truck was found unoccupied at a Chelan County campground with two bloody handprints on the tailgate, according to the affidavit.
    


            The girls' bodies were about 75 yards away, down a small embankment.
    


            Authorities are now searching by land and air for Travis Decker – wanted for three counts each of murder and kidnapping – across the county, sweeping through local forests and wilderness areas, according to the Chelan County Sheriff's office.
    


            Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Saturday announced he's tapping emergency funds and ordering Washington National Guard resources to support the multi-agency search for Travis Decker, warning area residents to keep their doors and windows locked and to avoid restricted areas.
    


            Meanwhile, a portrait of Travis Decker is emerging: an Army veteran and National Guardsman experiencing homelessness, skilled in wilderness survival, an involved father and, according to his ex-wife, a man struggling with mental health issues.
    


            Nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Range, Wenatchee lies between Seattle and Spokane, where rugged peaks give way to rolling orchards and breathtaking views of the Columbia River as it winds through the valley – a scenic view now punctured by tragedy.
    


            The sisters were found about 30 minutes northwest, in the Wenatchee River Ranger district, a remote, mountainous region of Washington that encompasses approximately 696,000 acres. The girls had plastic bags over their heads, and their wrists were zip-tied, according to police.
    


            The discovery of their bodies triggered a closure of the Enchantments, an area popular for backcountry hiking and camping, as law enforcement combs the forest for any signs of the tattooed Army veteran. Authorities have released photos and a video clip of Travis Decker from the days before his custody visit with the girls. He was last seen wearing a light-colored shirt and dark shorts and had his dark hair pulled back into a ponytail.
    


            Decker is “well versed in wilderness survival and capable of spending days or even weeks in the wilderness on his own and with very little equipment” which will likely make the search more difficult, the sheriff's office said in a news release on Wednesday.
    


            The former military member also has “extensive tactical training,” according to the US Marshals, which is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to Decker's arrest.

            Travis Decker is a former US Army infantryman and staff sergeant with eight years of service, including five months in Afghanistan, according to a US Army spokesperson. He is currently a member of the Washington National Guard but is in the midst of a disciplinary process of being discharged because of missed drills, the National Guard confirmed to CNN.
    


            As the manhunt continues, the sheriff's office has advised residents in neighboring counties to lock their doors, including on outbuildings and sheds, and leave their outdoor lights on and their blinds open.
    


            Travis Decker was experiencing homelessness, living in his car, motels or camping locally, his ex-wife told police. His dog and daughters “are the two big positives in his life,” she said, according to the affidavit.
    


            “He was very active with their extracurricular activities, their dance, their soccer games, all of those things. He was very involved,” Cozart said.
    


            But there were concerns. Whitney told police that near the end of their marriage, her ex-husband was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and she did not think he was taking his medication, according to the police affidavit.
    


            In September 2024, a judge granted Whitney and Decker a parenting plan with limitations after an incident in which Decker kept the girls overnight at a homeless shelter and allowed them to go to a corner store unsupervised, according to Cozart.
    


            The new parenting plan included a psychiatric evaluation for Travis Decker, mandatory mental health counseling, and a domestic violence evaluation, according to court documents. He was permitted to see the children every other weekend.
    


            Travis Decker had “displayed some volatile behaviors that seemed concerning towards Whitney, never towards the girls,” Cozart said.
    


            His ex-wife believes the tragedy may have been prevented if Travis Decker had better access to mental health support as a veteran, Cozart said, pointing to well-documented barriers to accessing adequate resources for veterans struggling with issues including post-traumatic disorder.
    


            Central WA Veterans Counseling, a local agency serving veterans, believes that if Travis Decker had sought their help, he would have been redirected elsewhere or placed on a waitlist due to a lack of funding and a shortage of alternative resources to adequately support veterans in the region.
    


            “This isn't a hidden crisis—we've been vocal about it in the media and with local, state, and federal officials,” the group said in a statement.
    


            It's unclear whether Travis Decker was seeking help for the mental health issues outlined in the police report. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Veterans Affairs for information.
    


            The flag at the Chelan County Courthouse now flies at half-staff in memory of Olivia, Evelyn and Paityn.
    


            The killings of the three sisters – remembered by loved ones and in their community as beacons of light and joy – have deeply impacted Wenatchee and touched the hearts of parents across the country.
    


            “Whitney is living every mother's worst nightmare. The hole in her heart is immeasurable. There are no words that can capture the weight of this loss. Right now, she is surrounded by friends, family, and neighbors doing everything they can to hold her up,” Amy Edwards, a friend of Whitney's, said in part in a statement released through Cozart.
    


            She remembered Olivia, Paityn and Evelyn as performers and dancers and said, “their laughter, curiosity, and spirit left a mark on all of us.”
    


            “They were the kind of children everyone rooted for, looked forward to seeing, and held close in their hearts. They are cherished - not just by their family, but by an entire community who watched them grow, perform, learn, and love. We ache with the love we still carry for them - and always will.”
    


            A GoFundMe launched by Edwards has raised more than $1.1 million as of Sunday to support Whitney through the loss.
    


            “We are heartbroken by the loss of three of our shining stars from the Short Shakespeareans family,” the Music Theatre of Wenatchee said in a statement.
    


            “Their joy, creativity, and spirit lit up our stage and our hearts. Though their time with us was far too short, their impact will forever be part of our story. May their light continue to shine in every performance we give. We carry them with us—always.”
    


            The three sisters attended Lincoln Elementary School in the Wenatchee School District.

            “My heart, and the hearts of the entire Wenatchee School District leadership, remain with the Decker family, the Lincoln Elementary community, and all who knew and loved these precious girls,” district superintendent Kory Kalahar said in a statement. “Every school, every classroom, and every family within our district may be touched by this tragedy in some way.
    


            As the community grieves, no sorrow runs deeper than Whitney's – a mother devastated by unimaginable loss yet determined to ensure that her daughters are known for the light, laughter, and love they brought into the world.
    


            “The girls were amazing little humans,” Cozart said. “I know Whitney wants the world to remember them that way.”

President Trump announces a proclamation banning travel to the US from 12 countries, restrictions on other countries. (Credit: The White House)

President Donald Trump's restrictions on travel from 10 African countries are being praised by analysts for improving U.S. security internationally and domestically.

The president said on X the travel ban was being introduced after a terror attack against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, last weekend, allegedly by an Egyptian man who had overstayed his visa.

In a White House fact sheet, Trump said, "We will restore the travel ban, some people call it the Trump travel ban, and keep the radical Islamic terrorists out of our country."

This point was backed by the State Department's principal deputy spokesperson, Tommy Pigott. In a briefing Thursday, Pigott said, "This is a national security imperative".

But observers believe there is an external, international reason. 

"Most, if not all, of the African countries were added to this list either because of extreme instability and thus terrorist havens or because relations between them and the U.S. is either extremely poor or non-existent," Bill Roggio, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and editor of FDD's Long War Journal, told Fox News Digital. 

"For instance, the U.S. has been historically hard on Eritrea for its human rights abuses and also alleged support for terrorism. While in Chad, its military regime kicked the U.S. military out of its territory last year, further hurting the U.S. military posture in Africa."

TRUMP BANS TRAVEL TO US FROM SEVERAL COUNTRIES TO BLOCK ‘DANGEROUS FOREIGN ACTORS'

The world's two principal Islamist terror groups, ISIS and al Qaeda, represented here by Al-Shabaab, both operate openly in Somalia. The White House described it this week as "a terrorist safe haven." 

A briefing note accompanying the travel ban declared, "A persistent terrorist threat emanates from Somalia's territory. Somalia also remains a destination for individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the national security of the United States."  

The U.S. Africa Command mounted five air attacks against operators from both groups in just the 12 days up to June 2. 

Fighting and subsequent piles of bodies in the streets have been reported in the past month in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. The U.N.'s Support Mission in Libya recently posted on X that the situation could "spiral out of control."

"The historical terrorist presence within Libya's territory amplifies the risks posed by the entry into the United States of its nationals," the White House note states, adding U.S. border officials can't properly vet Libyans because "there is no competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents in Libya."

The U.S. has already imposed sanctions against the leaders of both parties involved in a two-year civil war that has reportedly killed 150,000 and displaced 12 million. The U.S. claims up to 28% of Sudanese overstay their visas.

The criminal records of Eritreans are not available for inspection by U.S. officials. With an overstay rate of up to 55%, the White House also reported that "Eritrea has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals."   

CRITICS HAVE MELTDOWN AND ACCUSE TRUMP OF IMPOSING RENEWED 'MUSLIM BAN' THROUGH 'DISGUSTING' TRAVEL ORDER

The West African country is causing concern in Washington as it deepens relations with Russia. Chad President Idriss Deby went to Moscow last year for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Kremlin Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was then warmly welcomed in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, for a reciprocal visit. Russia's shadowy Wagner private mercenary group's importance in the country is being questioned after three of its members were arrested in September and sent back to Moscow.

Banning nationals this week, the U.S. said Chad has had a visa overstay rate of up to 55%. In Chad, President Deby responded by saying, "I have instructed the government to act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity and suspend the issuance of visas to U.S. citizens."

People from this West African country have reportedly overstayed their F, M and J visas by up to 70%.

Depending on the visa category, up to 35% of citizens in the U.S. are reported to have overstayed their visas.

Togo suffers from poor governance, nepotism and widespread corruption, which reportedly goes all the way to the president's office. Over 50% of the population lives below what's regarded as the international poverty line. Togo's nationals have an overstay rate of up to 35% in the U.S.

Burundi vies with South Sudan for the dubious title of poorest country in the world. Yet soaring inflation has caused a devastating rise in food prices. A former rebel group has led the country for two decades in a climate of political unrest and alleged repression. Burundi's citizens have an overstay rate of up to 17% in the U.S.

Michelino Sunseri, an experienced runner, is facing prison time for running on a mountain trail. 

Picture this: you lace up your shoes, take a breath of fresh mountain air, and hit the trail in the Grand Tetons National Park. You complete a legendary speed record in the world of ultra-running, and fellow runners are celebrating you. Then, you're slapped with a federal crime.

Sounds like a joke, right? Sadly, it's real—and it's happening now to Michelino Sunseri, a 32-year-old bartender and record-setting mountain runner.

Sunseri ran a trail that hundreds if not thousands before him had done: he took a well-worn trail, one that's been used for decades by hikers, climbers, and runners alike. There was no gate. No park ranger stopping people. Just a tiny sign about "erosion" half-hidden in the sagebrush. But that was enough for the National Park Service to charge him with a federal crime.

‘BIG BLOW TO BIG GOVERNMENT': MAJOR SCOTUS DECISION STRIPS POWER OF ‘FACELESS LEVIATHAN' OF FEDERAL AGENCIES

Now, Sunseri is looking at up to $5,000 in fines, a possible six months in federal prison, and worst of all—a permanent criminal record. To add insult to injury, he could also be banned from the Grand Tetons National Park, the mountains he loves, for the next five years.

This isn't justice. This is overcriminalization.

Sunseri should not be a criminal. He didn't vandalize or hurt anyone. He ran a trail. He did not damage the trail, and he was open about it. He posted his record-breaking run on a digital app, and that's when government bureaucrats decided to make an example of him.

When federal bureaucrats act as lawmaker, judge, and jury, there's little any of us can do. As a former federal prosecutor, I can tell you that the Department of Justice wins 90% of its cases. And too often, there is no common sense, no grace, no understanding. Just raw, unchecked power.

And here's the truth: it can happen to you.

When the government creates a maze of vague rules and hidden signs and then prosecutes people who violate them without knowing and without intent, it's not justice. It's about power and control.

Sunseri's case is a warning to all of us. It shows what happens when Americans are expected to follow rules they can't even see. No one in the entire federal government keeps track of them all, but we estimate there are more than 300,000 federal statutes and regulations that carry federal criminal penalties.

And remember, once convicted of a federal crime there is no expungement of your record. Even if you're pardoned, your criminal record follows you for a lifetime and prevents opportunities for housing, education and employment.

Sunseri's case isn't about a trail. It's about the growing divide between everyday citizens and an out-of-touch bureaucracy that thinks it knows best. It's about the erosion of liberty in the name of government authority.

We cannot sit back and let this continue. Government overreach is real, and this case is Exhibit A. We need laws written by elected lawmakers—not unaccountable federal agencies. We need clarity, not hidden signs and gotcha rules. And above all, we need a justice system that remembers the difference between a criminal—and a man who just loves to run in the mountains where he lives.

Democrats are desperately trying to lay the groundwork to recapture voting blocs in 2028 that shifted toward President Donald Trump last November. But one important nominating state, Iowa, is seemingly being left behind as the party sets its sights elsewhere.

Over the last two years, Democrats have been chipping away at Iowa's first-in-the-nation status, something it's held since 1972. In 2023, the party dismantled Iowa's position as the first state in the presidential nominating process, with allies of then-President Joe Biden elevating South Carolina to the coveted role.

DEMOCRATS NEED TO COME TO GRIPS WITH 2030 CENSUS REALITY

This week, the Hawkeye State lost its single seat on the powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee that oversees setting the presidential nominating calendar. New Hampshire, which defied the Democratic National Committee by holding an unsanctioned primary last cycle, gained a second seat. The other states that make up the early voting process, Nevada and South Carolina, also received a second representative.

Iowa is a unique Midwestern state. While surrounding states like Illinois and Minnesota have moved to the left, and Wisconsin leans blue, despite swinging for Trump in 2024, Iowa has largely been written off as a red state. However, it has a purple history and elected former President Barack Obama over Republican John McCain in 2008.

But with both parties becoming increasingly polarized over the last several cycles, the Hawkeye State appears to be a conservative stronghold for the time being. All six members of the U.S. congressional delegation from Iowa are Republicans, and State Auditor Rob Sand, now running for governor, is the only Democrat holding statewide office.

“National Democrats are pulling away from Iowa,” Democratic state Sen. Tony Bisignano told the Washington Examiner. “Rightfully so, looking back at our turn to the far right as a politically voting state. Iowa peaked with Obama, and it's been a disaster ever since.”

Bisignano said attracting national Democrats back to the state will depend heavily on the party's success in the 2026 midterm elections, but he's not optimistic about that.

“Politics is what have you done lately,” the state legislator said. “We have tanked!”

Iowa congressional Republicans have even expressed disappointment with the DNC's decision — particularly as the issue of preserving the caucuses and Iowa's first-in-the-nation status has been a bipartisan one for so long, Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA) said.

“But I think what this speaks to is the level of how the national Democrats are so out of touch,” Hinson told the Washington Examiner. “Iowa Democrats are so out of touch, and I think this is just a consequence of that.”

“I think that's unfortunate,” Hinson added.

Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA) echoed Hinson, stating it was “truly disappointing” to hear about the DNC's decision and the overall “lack of engagement” from Democrats in the state.

“They're getting more liberal, and Iowa is a state of normal people,” Feenstra, who is also running for governor of Iowa, told the Washington Examiner. “It's just unfortunate where the Democrat Party is headed.”

The decision to pull Iowa's seat at the Rules and Bylaws Committee comes as Chairman Ken Martin finds his footing within the DNC, signaling that Iowa's influence within the party is waning as Democrats already are preparing for a competitive and consequential presidential primary in 2028. 

Iowa Democratic Party Chairwoman Rita Hart said in a statement that while her focus is winning both statewide and national races in 2026, she does expect “tough and direct conversations with the DNC” regarding the caucuses and the “serious concerns surrounding the Biden 2024 calendar.”

Iowa still has representation on the DNC's Resolutions Committee with Gregory Christensen. But the absence of an Iowan on the nominating calendar committee could be indicative that Democrats are giving up on the state, which could be detrimental for rallying ground support ahead of the midterm elections.

“National Democrats let Trump get a headstart in the 2024 campaign by excluding Iowa,” Hart said. “We simply can't afford to be ignored again.”

Reps. Zach Nunn (R-IA) and Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA) are among the 29 vulnerable House Republican seats the GOP needs to defend, and Democrats only need a net gain of three seats to take back the lower chamber. On the Senate side, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) is up for reelection, and given recent controversies and policy stances, it could open the door for a Democratic victory.

The removal from the DNC also comes after Iowa Democrats flipped a red state Senate seat earlier this year — a trend developing across several states, such as Nebraska and Wisconsin, where Democrats are defeating Republican candidates or incumbents in the wake of the 2024 election.

“The DNC is committed to running a fair, transparent, and rigorous process for the 2028 primary calendar,” said Abhi Rahman, deputy communications director for the DNC. “All states will have an opportunity to participate.” 

Rahman praised Iowa's DNC members and Hart as “fierce advocates” of the state and assured that “they will have their voices heard.”

One Democratic communications strategist, who has worked with the DNC and was granted anonymity to discuss committee conversations, told the Washington Examiner that Iowa doesn't seem to be on “anybody's minds” at meetings discussing how to move forward in the aftermath of former Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign. 

But the strategist said the intention perhaps is not to “punish Iowa” by removing it from the Rules and Bylaws Committee. Instead, they think Martin's choice reflects that he has “good relationships with the folks that he picked,” who he thinks can best get the DNC on track across the board, not just state by state.

Democrats face an uphill battle to bring blue-collar workers and minority blocs such as black, Latino, Asian American, and Pacific Islander voters back to their side of the aisle. But Iowa, the strategist said, is a predominantly white early state compared to other early nominating states. Of the early primary states, South Carolina boasts the largest population of black voters.

Meanwhile, population shifts to the South and away from blue states such as California and New York have forced Democrats to figure out how to win elsewhere to keep up electorally.

Democrats have kept an eye on the South and Sun Belt, such as Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina. Through Martin's “Organize Everywhere, Win Anywhere” plan, the DNC will allot $17,500 to state officials in blue states and $22,500 to state parties in red states to continue outreach.

“I think there is some intentionality by the DNC and some of the folks who are from Southern states who are like, ‘If we're gonna win the presidency, or win back the House and the Senate … we need to figure out ways to win back these voters,'” the strategist said.

“So then, when you're trying to make a defense that Iowa and New Hampshire should be states that are early states, you're like, ‘Wait, white people ruin everything. What? Democrats are supposed to be diverse. What?' And so, that's a lot of the back and forth.” 

JONI ERNST CHALLENGER JD SCHOLTEN MOTIVATED TO RUN FOLLOWING TOWN HALL COMMENTS

Hinson said the Iowa-is-too-white argument “falls flat” when compared to the demographics of early voting states such as New Hampshire, Nevada, and Michigan.

“They're listening to a few in their most progressive wing of their party, and it's exactly why they've lost ground in Iowa,” Hinson said. “Iowa Democrats are continuing to make it harder for Iowa to keep its status as well, within the DNC. I really think they're doing this to themselves.”

FERRIDAY, La. (AP) — Even at a glance, the differences are obvious. The walls of Ferriday High School are old and worn, surrounded by barbed wire. Just a few miles away, Vidalia High School is clean and bright, with a new library and a crisp blue “V” painted on orange brick.

Ferriday High is 90% Black. Vidalia High is 62% white.

For Black families, the contrast between the schools suggests “we're not supposed to have the finer things,” said Brian Davis, a father in Ferriday. “It's almost like our kids don't deserve it,” he said.

The schools are part of Concordia Parish, which was ordered to desegregate 60 years ago and remains under a court-ordered plan to this day. Yet there's growing momentum to release the district — and dozens of others — from decades-old orders that some call obsolete.

In a remarkable reversal, the Justice Department said it plans to start unwinding court-ordered desegregation plans dating to the Civil Rights Movement. Officials started in April, when they lifted a 1960s order in Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish. Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the department's civil rights division, has said others will “bite the dust.”

It comes amid pressure from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and his attorney general, who have called for all the state's remaining orders to be lifted. They describe the orders as burdens on districts and relics of a time when Black students were still forbidden from some schools.

The orders were always meant to be temporary — school systems can be released if they demonstrate they fully eradicated segregation. Decades later, that goal remains elusive, with stark racial imbalances persisting in many districts.




Civil rights groups say the orders are important to keep as tools to address the legacy of forced segregation — including disparities in student discipline, academic programs and teacher hiring. They point to cases like Concordia, where the decades-old order was used to stop a charter school from favoring white students in admissions.

“Concordia is one where it's old, but a lot is happening there,” said Deuel Ross, deputy director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “That's true for a lot of these cases. They're not just sitting silently.”

Last year, before President Donald Trump took office, Concordia Parish rejected a Justice Department plan that would have ended its case if the district combined several majority white and majority Blac k elementary and middle schools.

At a town hall meeting, Vidalia residents vigorously opposed the plan, saying it would disrupt students' lives and expose their children to drugs and violence. An official from the Louisiana attorney general's office spoke against the proposal and said the Trump administration likely would change course on older orders.

Accepting the plan would have been a “death sentence” for the district, said Paul Nelson, a former Concordia superintendent. White families would have fled to private schools or other districts, said Nelson, who wants the court order removed.

“It's time to move on,” said Nelson, who left the district in 2016. “Let's start looking to build for the future, not looking back to what our grandparents may have gone through.”

At Ferriday High, athletic coach Derrick Davis supported combining schools in Ferriday and Vidalia. He said the district's disparities come into focus whenever his teams visit schools with newer sports facilities.

“It seems to me, if we'd all combine, we can all get what we need,” he said.

Others oppose merging schools if it's done solely for the sake of achieving racial balance. “Redistricting and going to different places they're not used to ... it would be a culture shock to some people,” said Ferriday's school resource officer, Marcus Martin, who, like Derrick Davis, is Black.

The district's current superintendent and school board did not respond to requests for comment.

Concordia is among more than 120 districts across the South that remain under desegregation orders from the 1960s and '70s, including about a dozen in Louisiana.

Calling the orders historical relics is “unequivocally false,” said Shaheena Simons, who until April led the Justice Department section that oversees school desegregation cases.

“Segregation and inequality persist in our schools, and they persist in districts that are still under desegregation orders,” she said.

With court orders in place, families facing discrimination can reach out directly to the Justice Department or seek relief from the court. Otherwise, the only recourse is a lawsuit, which many families can't afford, Simons said.

In Concordia, the order played into a battle over a charter school that opened in 2013 on the former campus of an all-white private school. To protect the area's progress on racial integration, a judge ordered Delta Charter School to build a student body that reflected the district's racial demographics. But in its first year, the school was just 15% Black.

After a court challenge, Delta was ordered to give priority to Black students. Today, about 40% of its students are Black.

Desegregation orders have been invoked recently in other cases around the state. One led to an order to address disproportionately high rates of discipline for Black students, and in another a predominantly Black elementary school was relocated from a site close to a chemical plant.

The Trump administration was able to close the Plaquemines case with little resistance because the original plaintiffs were no longer involved — the Justice Department was litigating the case alone. Concordia and an unknown number of other districts are in the same situation, making them vulnerable to quick dismissals.

Concordia's case dates to 1965, when the area was strictly segregated and home to a violent offshoot of the Ku Klux Klan. When Black families in Ferriday sued for access to all-white schools, the federal government intervened.

As the district integrated its schools, white families fled Ferriday. The district's schools came to reflect the demographics of their surrounding areas. Ferriday is mostly Black and low-income, while Vidalia is mostly white and takes in tax revenue from a hydroelectric plant. A third town in the district, Monterey, has a high school that's 95% white.

At the December town hall, Vidalia resident Ronnie Blackwell said the area “feels like a Mayberry, which is great,” referring to the fictional Southern town from “The Andy Griffith Show.” The federal government, he said, has “probably destroyed more communities and school systems than it ever helped.”

Under its court order, Concordia must allow students in majority Black schools to transfer to majority white schools. It also files reports on teacher demographics and student discipline.

After failing to negotiate a resolution with the Justice Department, Concordia is scheduled to make its case that the judge should dismiss the order, according to court documents. Meanwhile, amid a wave of resignations in the federal government, all but two of the Justice Department lawyers assigned to the case have left.

Without court supervision, Brian Davis sees little hope for improvement.

“A lot of parents over here in Ferriday, they're stuck here because here they don't have the resources to move their kids from A to B,” he said. “You'll find schools like Ferriday — the term is, to me, slipping into darkness.”

President Donald Trump says he's deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to immigration protests, over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. 

It's not the first time Trump has activated the National Guard to quell protests. In 2020, he asked governors of several states to send troops to Washington, D.C. to respond to demonstrations that arose after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers. Many of the governors he asked agreed, sending troops to the federal district. The governors that refused the request were allowed to do so, keeping their troops on home soil.

This time, however, Trump is acting in opposition to Newsom, who under normal circumstances would retain control and command of California's National Guard. While Trump said that federalizing the troops was necessary to “address the lawlessness” in California, the Democratic governor said the move was “purposely inflammatory and will only escalate tensions.” 

Here are some things to know about when and how the president can deploy troops on U.S. soil. 




Generally, federal military forces are not allowed to carry out civilian law enforcement duties against U.S. citizens except in times of emergency. 

An 18th-century wartime law called the Insurrection Act is the main legal mechanism that a president can use to activate the military or National Guard during times of rebellion or unrest. But Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act on Saturday. 

Instead, he relied on a similar federal law that allows the president to federalize National Guard troops under certain circumstances. 

The National Guard is a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. Often it operates under state command and control, using state funding. Sometimes National Guard troops will be assigned by their state to serve federal missions, remaining under state command but using federal funding. 

The law cited by Trump's proclamation places National Guard troops under federal command. The law says that can be done under three circumstances: When the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion; when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the U.S. government, or when the President is unable to “execute the laws of the United States,” with regular forces.

But the law also says that orders for those purposes “shall be issued through the governors of the States.” It's not immediately clear if the president can activate National Guard troops without the order of that state's governor. 

Notably, Trump's proclamation says the National Guard troops will play a supporting role by protecting ICE officers as they enforce the law, rather than having the troops perform law enforcement work.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in military justice and national security law, says that's because the National Guard troops can't legally engage in ordinary law enforcement activities unless Trump first invokes the Insurrection Act.

Vladeck said the move raises the risk that the troops could end up using force while filling that “protection” role. The move could also be a precursor to other, more aggressive troop deployments down the road, he wrote on his website.

“There's nothing these troops will be allowed to do that, for example, the ICE officers against whom these protests have been directed could not do themselves,” Vladeck wrote.

The Insurrection Act and related laws were used during the Civil Rights era to protect activists and students desegregating schools. President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black students integrating Central High School after that state's governor activated the National Guard to keep the students out.

George H.W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to respond to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King.

National Guard troops have been deployed for a variety of emergencies, including the COVID pandemic, hurricanes and other natural disasters. But generally, those deployments are carried out with the agreements of the governors of the responding states. 

In 2020, Trump asked governors of several states to deploy their National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to quell protests that arose after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers. Many of the governors agreed, sending troops to the federal district.

At the time, Trump also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd's death in Minneapolis – an intervention rarely seen in modern American history. But then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper pushed back, saying the law should be invoked “only in the most urgent and dire of situations.”

Trump never did invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term.

But while campaigning for his second term, he suggested that would change. Trump told an audience in Iowa in 2023 that he was prevented from using the military to suppress violence in cities and states during his first term, and said if the issue came up again in his next term, “I'm not waiting.”

Trump also promised to deploy the National Guard to help carry out his immigration enforcement goals, and his top adviser Stephen Miller explained how that would be carried out: Troops under sympathetic Republican governors would send troops to nearby states that refuse to participate, Miller said on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” in 2023.

After Trump announced he was federalizing the National Guard troops on Saturday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said other measures could follow.

Hegseth wrote on the social media platform X that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert and would also be mobilized “if violence continues.”

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Sky coach Tyler Marsh recalled working the 2020 NBA All-Star game at the United Center when he was an assistant with the Toronto Raptors. 

He mentioned that his first experience at a WNBA All-Star game was also in Chicago — two years later at Wintrust Arena. 

“It's been cool moments,” Marsh said.

There was another big one on Saturday night. Though the Sky got blown out by Indiana 79-52, it was the first WNBA game at the United Center. 

“It's an incredible moment for this league,” said Marsh, in his first season coaching the Sky. “It's an incredible moment for our team and our staff and our city, really. I think that's the cool part about it is we get to represent our city in this building on a historic night. It's not lost among us how important and significant it is — and for myself to be part of that and to represent the W in that capacity, to represent the Sky in that capacity, is something that I don't take for granted.”

A matchup that got moved from the smaller Wintrust Arena and was supposed to feature two of the league's brightest young stars in Chicago's Angel Reese and Indiana's Caitlin Clark didn't play out as envisioned.

The Fever rolled over the Sky for the second time this season. And they did it without the injured Clark.

The 2024 Rookie of the Year missed her fourth straight game because of a quad issue and watched the primetime, nationally televised game from the sideline. That had to be a bummer for the fans who showed up wearing Clark jerseys. 




The enthusiastic crowd of 19,496 surpassed Chicago's previous high of 16,444 in 2016 at Allstate Arena in suburban Rosemont, though tickets weren't hard to find. They were listed on StubHub for as little as $9 a few hours before tipoff.

By comparison, when Clark and Reese played their first game in Chicago last season, courtside seats at Wintrust Arena were going for $5,000 on Ticketmaster an hour before tipoff. That game drew the celebrities, with Chicago native Chance The Rapper, comedian Jason Sudeikis and New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson in the sellout crowd along with Pro Basketball Hall of Famer Cheryl Swoopes.

Even so, this was a big night. And the significance of playing at the United Center wasn't lost on the players and coaches. The Sky and Fever will meet again at the home of the NBA's Bulls and NHL's Blackhawks on July 27.

“We just continue to make milestones for women,” Reese said. “Women belong here. I think this is gonna be the first of many. Obviously, we have two here this year. But we could continue to see this — and all our games at NBA arenas.”

Reese and Clark have helped carry the league to new heights in popularity after taking their rivalry from LSU and Iowa to the pros. They brought the style and swagger that captivated the nation when they were going at it in college and spurring debates about sport and society.

But the night wasn't just about them.

“It just shows how much women's basketball is growing, and it's amazing to see it,” said Sky center Kamilla Cardoso, another young star.

For Fever assistant Austin Kelly, who was filling in with coach Stephanie White missing the game for personal reasons, playing at the United Center brought back memories of watching the Bulls during the Michael Jordan-Scottie Pippen dynasty.

“I was born in ‘89,” he said. “I played AAU basketball. We were on the road, me and my teammates were crammed into hotels — the Days Inn or whatever it was — watching them in June. A lot of memories of watching Jordan, watching the Bulls growing up. I think they were everyone's favorite team, especially youngsters like us growing up in the ‘90s.”

Marsh said Sky player-development coach Aaron Johnson, who's from Chicago, had this game circled on his proverbial calendar.

“Since it got announced that we would be playing this game, it was something that he really got emotional about. Not to put him on Front Street, but this is a building that he grew up idolizing and sitting in the nosebleeds, and going from that to being able to step on the floor, those are the types of moments that you can't really put a price on,” Marsh said. You take those experiences for what it is and it comes with the moment, but also, you're extremely excited for our players to be a part of that as well.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday that he hopes President Donald Trump and Elon Musk can "reconcile" after their public fallout last week.

"There's a lot of emotion involved in it, but it's in the interest of the country for everybody to work together," the Louisiana Republican said on ABC News' "This Week."

Johnson said that he has not spoken with Musk about the GOP-led "big, beautiful bill" since last Monday.

Musk last week went on a rant against the multitrillion-dollar spending package that narrowly passed the House, calling it a "disgusting abomination" that would lead to exploding federal deficits.

On Sunday, Johnson brushed aside the Tesla's CEO's criticisms of the bill.

"I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world, what we're trying to do is help hardworking Americans," he said.

The spending bill is now with the Senate.

Musk's vocal opposition to the legislation was in part what triggered the public clash between Trump and the billionaire SpaceX founder, CNBC previously reported.

The two men have not spoken since their feud, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Sunday on "Fox Sunday Morning Futures," adding that she doesn't think Trump "intends to."

Trump also told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Saturday that he was not interested in repairing his relationship with Musk following their spat, signaling that their rift could be irreversible.

Musk was the largest donor of the 2024 presidential campaign, and his super PAC spent roughly $200 million to propel Trump to the White House.

In the midst of Musk's criticisms against the bill, he threatened to "fire all politicians who betrayed the American people."

But Trump warned Saturday that Musk would pay "very serious consequences" if he funds Democratic candidates challenging Republicans who support the bill.

Johnson, a loyal Trump ally, echoed the president's remarks, saying it would be a "big mistake" if Musk were to back Democratic candidates.

Israel's government on Sunday vowed to prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip.

Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel wouldn't allow anyone to break its naval blockade of the Palestinian territory, which he said was aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms.

"To the antisemitic Greta and her fellow Hamas propagandists — I will say this clearly: You should turn back, because you will not make it to Gaza," he said in a statement.

Thunberg, a climate campaigner, is among 12 activists aboard the Madleen, which is operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. The vessel departed Sicily last Sunday on a mission that aims to break the sea blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid, while raising awareness over the growing humanitarian crisis 20 months into the Israel-Hamas war.

The activists had said they planned to reach Gaza's territorial waters as early as Sunday.

Thiago Ávila, a Brazilian activist on board the boat, posted a video on social media Sunday afternoon saying someone appeared to be jamming their tracking and communication devices about 160 nautical miles from Gaza.

Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, is among the others onboard. She has been barred from entering Israel because of her opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians.

After a 2 1/2-month total blockade aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel started allowing some basic aid into Gaza last month, but humanitarian workers have warned of famine unless the blockade is lifted and Israel ends its military offensive.

An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after another of the group's vessels was attacked by two drones while sailing in international waters off Malta. The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship.

Israel and Egypt have imposed varying degrees of blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Critics of the blockade say it amounts to collective punishment of Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.

Israel sealed Gaza off from all aid in the early days of the war ignited by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but later relented under U.S. pressure. In early March, shortly before Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas, the country again blocked all imports, including food, fuel and medicine.

Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages, more than half of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas is still holding 55 hostages, more than half of them believed to be dead.

Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which has said women and children make up most of the dead. It doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants.

The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of the territory's population, leaving people there almost completely dependent on international aid.

Self-made millionaire, author and TV host Ramit Sethi knows a thing or two about money. He's even published books on how to get rich and how couples can manage their finances together.

But his own financial journey hasn't been perfect. He recently sat down with his wife, Cassandra, for a special episode of his Money for Couples podcast where they answered some of the same questions he asks couples every week in an interview with friend Julie Nguyen.

The Sethis have been married since 2018, and Ramit has often shared tidbits about their relationship on his podcast and in his books, highlighting some of the strategies they've used to navigate combining finances, earning different incomes, creating shared goals and more.

On the podcast, Ramit and Cassandra agreed on the most difficult money conversation they've ever had as a couple: negotiating their prenup before getting married.

"I'm sweating thinking about it right now," Ramit said. "[The] first time I brought it up, I remember I had talked to so many people, gotten advice, planned what I was gonna say and I was very nervous about it."

Cassandra received the idea of a prenup well, he said, but things went south from there. 

Many money experts recommend getting a prenuptial agreement, even to those with modest finances. A prenup is a legal contract outlining how a couple wants their finances handled in the event of a divorce. Without one, couples could wind up leaving those decisions — like who gets certain assets or who pays spousal support — up to a judge.

Prenups are for everyone, money expert Suze Orman told CNBC Make It in 2020, and individuals should feel comfortable bringing it up with their partner.

"If you cannot talk money to the person that you are about to marry, you are doomed for failure because money is going to run through your relationship more than anything else," she said.

When Ramit brought up the idea of a prenup up to Cassandra, he had already started his business and written his first book on money. Cassandra didn't know much about them, but was willing to learn. And while they both agreed to get a prenup, their negotiations turned contentious due to differing expectations and understandings of money.

Ramit saw the negotiations as strictly financial and tried to let the numbers speak for themselves. Cassandra, on the other hand, was more tapped into the emotional considerations, which Ramit wasn't really thinking about. 

Ramit tried to make a "generous" offer in his prenup proposal, he said, but Cassandra was more concerned with their relationship and ensuring their feelings and emotions were aligned.

"We started going back and forth and I was very confused, very hurt because I'm like, 'I'm not trying to trick anybody here,'" Ramit said.

Cassandra eventually suggested the couple sit down with a therapist and talk through their emotions to figure out where things weren't aligning. The therapist asked how they each view money.

"That really opened up conversations that we hadn't been able to have because my answer was like, 'growth, of course, look at the compounding.' And her answer was, 'safety,'" Ramit said.

Despite the turmoil, the process helped the couple deepen their relationship by revealing not just how they each think about money, but also how they should be communicating those feelings with each other, they said.

While Ramit was more focused on the actual numbers, Cassandra didn't have the financial knowledge to get a sense of security from the amounts in their savings and investment accounts.

"I'll never forget something Ramit said to me during that time. You were like, 'I really need you to get better at money,'" she said. "I took that very seriously because deep down inside I was like, 'I know I'm not that great at money. I could get better.'"

While she worked on learning about prenups and managing money in general, Ramit acknowledged he needed to improve at talking about emotions so he could more clearly communicate where he was coming from and better understand Cassandra's perspective.

"In retrospect, you were not asking me to pull out a f------ spreadsheet. You were feeling this," he said. "Looking back, I needed to listen to what you were saying. I should have been asking more questions."

Now seven years into their marriage, they still consider what they learned from their prenup negotiations the most valuable lessons they've learned from each other, they said.

Cassandra said Ramit's mindset around abundance and trusting your earning power "has been really eye-opening." And Ramit is grateful to have learned from Cassandra the importance of checking in on your feelings and talking about them.

"It has really changed the way that I relate to people a lot," he said.

The Walt Disney Company and Universal, two of the biggest names in theme parks, are both undertaking historic expansions to their experiences businesses.

Universal Orlando Resort in May opened the gates to Epic Universe, its fourth theme park at its flagship resort. Epic cost an estimated $7 billion to build, according to numbers provided by the University of Central Florida. Brian Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Universal parent company Comcast, called it the "single-largest investment Comcast NBCUniversal has made in its theme park business".

"It's so different than anything else that we've ever built, but certainly I think it's different than anything anyone's ever built," said Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando President and COO.

Epic's opening coincides with an expansion of Universal Orlando's resort portfolio, adding three Loews hotels to bring its total to 11 operated on the property. Universal is betting that the addition of Epic will turn the resort into a full-week destination, a distinction that is normally reserved for its crosstown neighbor, Walt Disney World.

Not to be upstaged, Disney is working on a historic undertaking of its own. 

In 2023, Disney announced plans to invest $60 billion in its experiences segment, which includes theme parks, cruise ships and consumer products. Of that investment, $30 billion will go to its domestic theme parks, Disney World and Disneyland.

"We've got a lion's share of that investment coming to us," said Michael Hundgen, portfolio executive creative producer with Walt Disney Imagineering. "It's about finding what strikes the best creative intent in the most value oriented way possible."

These investments come at a time when both Disney and Comcast are paring down or spinning off their linear TV segments, an arena that has seen volatility in recent years. By comparison, theme parks have been consistent revenue drivers for the companies in the post-COVID tourism bounce.

However, the timing of these openings and expansions could prove challenging for both theme parks. Epic's opening summer coincides with fears of a travel slowdown due to economic volatility.

"If you're uncertain how the economy is going to develop, then you're going to try to be more cautious in your spending," said Jorge Ridderstaat, associate professor at UCF's Rosen College of Hospitality Management.

Will these massive investments pay off for Disney and Universal? Or could a tourism downturn upset Orlando's 'Epic' summer. Watch the video above to learn more.

LAFAYETTE, Ind. — President Donald Trump has said he wants to bolster manufacturing jobs and other technical employment in the United States. But in the aviation industry, finding skilled workers to make airplanes and engines — and maintaining those jobs for years to come — has been a struggle.

The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic in the U.S. is 54, and 40% of them are over the age of 60, according to a joint 2024 report from the Aviation Technician Education Council and consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which cites Federal Aviation Administration data. The U.S. will be short 25,000 aircraft technicians by 2028, according to the report.

"A lot of them were hired on in the '80s and early '90s. You just start doing some math and you start saying at some point they're going to retire," said American Airlines Chief Operating Officer David Seymour, who oversees the carrier's more than 6,000 daily flights.

To boost their ranks, airlines and big manufacturers of airplanes and their thousands of components are trying to get more younger people interested in the field.

The industry was already facing a retirement wave when Covid hit, and companies cut or offered buyouts to experienced workers — from those who build aircraft to those who maintain them to keep flying.

"People forget that the aerospace industry was in a pretty serious ramp at the time pre-Covid. And then frankly, of course overnight we went from ramping to zero demand over time. And so we lost a lot of talent," said Christian Meisner, GE Aerospace's chief human resources officer.

GE, along with its French joint venture partner Safran, makes the bestselling engines that power Boeing and Airbus top-selling jetliners, and has been ramping up hiring, though it is also dependent on a web of smaller suppliers that have also been getting back up to speed since the pandemic.

Meisner said that the company has a strong retention rate and that some employees earn their FAA licenses to work on airplane engines or airframes on the job. At GE's engine plant in Lafayette, Indiana, about an hour outside of Indianapolis, base pay averages between $80,000 and $90,000 a year, based on qualifications and experience, the company said.

Median pay for aircraft technicians or mechanics was $79,140 a year in the U.S. in 2024, compared with a nationwide median income of $49,500, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The agency projects 13,400 job openings in the field each year over the next decade.

American's Seymour said that with new pay raises, technicians could make $130,000 a year at the top of their pay scale in nine years at the carrier.

While many experts don't expect jobs that have been shipped abroad like clothing manufacturing to come back to the U.S., high-value sectors tend to pay much more and are more likely to stick around. But hiring can still be difficult in a sector that is seen as politically important and symbolic to the country's economic power.

The impending worker shortages aren't just for those who repair aircraft and engines. A shortfall of air traffic controllers has also stifled airline growth and raised concerns about safety in recent years. The Trump administration has said it will raise wages and ramp up hiring to try to reverse yearslong shortfalls.

Manufacturing is about 9% of U.S. employment but "we all have a bit of a fetish with manufacturing because we focus on it more and than other sectors," said Gordon Hanson, a professor of urban policy at Harvard University.

The U.S. unemployment rate in May held steady at 4.2%.

One problem with manufacturing jobs, Hanson said, is that workers aren't very geographically mobile, and if factories reopen or hiring ramps up, that could make it harder to attract employees from other places.

"You're asking the local labor market to supply workers," Hanson added.

Wages for technicians that repair aircraft at airlines, as well as big manufacturers like Boeing, have gone up in recent years, with skilled workers still in short supply and travel and airplane demand robust. But some workers said that's not enough.

"We need to increase wages," said Sarah MacLeod, executive director of the Aeronautical Repair Station Association. Most of the companies the association works with are small businesses. 

She warned that the "entire world is going to feel this workforce shortage. You already can't get your houses built. You already can't do XYZ. I think and pray that aerospace can actually lead the recovery of that."

Getting FAA licenses can take years, but the reward can be high. Some students are considering forgoing traditional four-year college degrees straight out of high school to get into the industry.

"I'm thinking about going to college, but it's whichever really comes first. If they give me an opportunity to go to the airlines, I'd like to do that," said Sam Mucciardi, a senior at Aviation High School in Queens, New York.

The public school offers its roughly 2,000 students the option to stay on for a fifth year to earn their FAA licenses with training at the school. 

"I stay late after school every day to work on the planes and, probably a little bit too much ... but I still really enjoy it," Mucciardi said. "That's what I put my all my heart into."

The school, which has been teaching students how to maintain aircraft since the 1930s, is fielding more demand from airlines in recent years.

"After a program like ours, typically you'd go to the regional airlines first, like the Endeavors, the Envoys," said Aviation High School Principal Steven Jackson. "Lately, because of the huge technician need, there's been more students going directly into American, Delta, United, but you have the whole range." He said the school received about 5,000 applications this year from students.

Students at the school learn at the campus in the Sunnyside section of Queens but also at other facilities at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Seymour said American has teamed up with high schools before, but is now going even younger and working with some junior highs to raise awareness about the career path.

"It is getting into the high schools and showing that a career in aerospace as an engineer or frankly, on a production floor, is not your grandparents' manufacturing. It is high tech," GE's Meisner said. "You're talking about laser-guided machine, precision machining operations, exotic coatings and metals."

Krystal Godinez, who has lived in the Lafayette area for about 14 years, graduated last summer from GE's first apprentice program class at the facility after about two years. She said she previously worked in the automotive industry.

"I feel like what I do here … definitely does matter. It's like taking all those extra steps, make sure everything is correct," she said. "We're there to kind of keep people safe out there and make them feel safe."

American's Seymour was optimistic that younger people are changing their tune.

"There was a period of time when people said 'I want a computer, I want tech,'" he said. "There are people who want to get their hands dirty."

Macro uncertainty is keeping the market volatile, but investors ought to keep their focus on stocks that can provide compelling long-term returns.

Top Wall Street analysts' recommendations can help inform investors as they pick the right stocks that can weather short-term pressures with solid execution and generate impressive returns over the long term.

With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is this week's first stock pick. The company reported market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Despite chip export restrictions, Nvidia remains confident about the demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Following the Q1 print, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reiterated a buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $170. The analyst noted that the company delivered solid revenue despite lost sales related to the H20 chip export restrictions on shipments to China. However, NVDA's margins and EPS were hit by the $4.5 billion write-down related to H20 inventory write-downs.

Excluding H20 shipments, Sur projects that the July quarter data center revenue is growing at about 16% quarter over quarter, driven by continued robust spending by customers on their AI/accelerated compute projects and persistent strength in production and deployment ramp of Nvidia's Blackwell platform. 

The analyst added that the demand for Nvidia's Blackwell platform is very strong and is expected to continue to surpass supply for many quarters. Sur believes that management has good visibility for solid growth through calendar year 2026, backed by recent mega data center deals (including those with UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan) and the end of the diffusion rule.  

Overall, Sur concluded that Nvidia is staying ahead of competitors with its silicon, hardware and software platforms and an impressive ecosystem, "further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time." 

Sur ranks No. 38 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 23.4%. See Nvidia Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

We move to cybersecurity company Zscaler (ZS). The company's results for the fiscal third quarter surpassed expectations, fueled by the demand for its Zero Trust Exchange platform and the growing need for AI security.

In reaction to the upbeat results, JPMorgan analyst Brian Essex reaffirmed a buy rating on Zscaler stock and boosted the price target to $292 from $275, saying, "We are encouraged by the strength in the quarter, particularly when off-calendar peers seemed to struggle with macro headwinds a bit more than expected."

The analyst noted that Zscaler raised its full-year outlook for revenue, profitability and billings. He explained that the company's performance was backed by encouraging contributions from emerging products like Zero Trust Everywhere, Data Security Everywhere and Agentic Operations. In fact, these emerging products are approaching $1 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR).

Essex noted that large customer momentum continued to be solid in Q3 FY25, with the number of customers with over $1 million of ARR increasing 23% year over year, keeping Zscaler on track to exceed $3 billion of ARR in the fiscal fourth quarter. He emphasized that macro commentary was better than anticipated, as management stated that the company didn't witness a "softer April," though IT budgets remain tight.

Commenting on Zscaler's Red Canary acquisition, Essex views this deal as encouraging, given that it is expected to enable the company to leverage the IP (intellectual property) and threat intel capabilities of Red Canary.

Essex ranks No. 652 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.6%. See Zscaler Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Customer relationship management software provider Salesforce (CRM) recently reported better-than-projected revenue and earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and raised its full-year forecast. The company also announced the acquisition of data management company Informatica for $8 billion.

Following the results, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reiterated a buy rating on CRM stock with a price target of $375. Wood noted that the company's Q1 FY26 revenue and current remaining performance obligations surpassed expectations.

"We think its renewed focus on accelerating sales capacity growth is a strong demand signal & should unlock higher growth next year," said Wood.

The analyst highlighted that AI adoption is ramping for Salesforce, with Data Cloud and AI ARR rising more than 120% year over year and reflecting strong early traction for the company's Agentforce offering. Wood noted that 30% of net new Agentforce bookings came from existing customers expanding their usage. The analyst stated he is encouraged by the scale and velocity of Data Cloud, which he considers to be a leading indicator of Agentforce adoption as customers gear up to power agentic workflows.

Wood contends that with margins now in the mid-30% range, Salesforce is focusing more on growth by re-deploying AI cost savings. Notably, the company is increasing its workforce more aggressively, following a flat sales headcount in the last two to three years. The analyst sees this as a signal of positive demand, with management indicating that pipelines are growing by the double-digits.

Wood ranks No. 176 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.8%. See Salesforce Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

President Donald Trump says he's deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to immigration protests, over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

It's not the first time Trump has activated the National Guard to quell protests. In 2020, he asked governors of several states to send troops to Washington, D.C. to respond to demonstrations that arose after Minneapolis police officers killed George Floyd. Many of the governors he asked agreed, sending troops to the federal district. The governors who refused the request were allowed to do so, keeping their troops on home soil.

This time, however, Trump is acting in opposition to Newsom, who, under normal circumstances, would retain control and command of California's National Guard. While Trump said that federalizing the troops was necessary to "address the lawlessness" in California, the Democratic governor said the move was "purposely inflammatory and will only escalate tensions."

Here are some things to know about when and how the president can deploy troops on U.S. soil.

Generally, federal military forces are not allowed to carry out civilian law enforcement duties against U.S. citizens except in times of emergency.

An 18th-century wartime law called the Insurrection Act is the main legal mechanism that a president can use to activate the military or National Guard during times of rebellion or unrest. But Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act on Saturday.

Instead, he relied on a similar federal law that allows the president to federalize National Guard troops under certain circumstances.

The National Guard is a hybrid entity serving state and federal interests. Often it operates under state command and control, using state funding. Sometimes National Guard troops will be assigned by their state to serve federal missions, remaining under state command but using federal funding.

The law cited by Trump's proclamation places National Guard troops under federal command. The law says that can be done under three circumstances: When the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion; when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the U.S. government, or when the President is unable to "execute the laws of the United States," with regular forces.

But the law also says that orders for those purposes "shall be issued through the governors of the States." It's not immediately clear if the president can activate National Guard troops without the order of that state's governor.

Notably, Trump's proclamation says the National Guard troops will play a supporting role by protecting ICE officers as they enforce the law, rather than having the troops perform law enforcement work.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in military justice and national security law, says that's because the National Guard troops can't legally engage in ordinary law enforcement activities unless Trump first invokes the Insurrection Act.

Vladeck said the move raises the risk that the troops could use force while filling that "protection" role. The move could also be a precursor to other, more aggressive troop deployments down the road, he wrote on his website.

"There's nothing these troops will be allowed to do that, for example, the ICE officers against whom these protests have been directed could not do themselves," Vladeck wrote.

The Insurrection Act and related laws were used during the Civil Rights era to protect activists and students desegregating schools. President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black students integrating Central High School after that state's governor activated the National Guard to keep the students out.

George H.W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to respond to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King.

National Guard troops have been deployed for various emergencies, including the COVID pandemic, hurricanes and other natural disasters. But generally, those deployments are carried out with the agreement of the governors of the responding states.

In 2020, Trump asked governors of several states to deploy their National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to quell protests that arose after Minneapolis police officers killed George Floyd. Many of the governors agreed to send troops to the federal district.

At the time, Trump also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd's death in Minneapolis — an intervention rarely seen in modern American history. But then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper pushed back, saying the law should be invoked "only in the most urgent and dire of situations."

Trump never did invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term.

But while campaigning for his second term, he suggested that would change. Trump told an audience in Iowa in 2023 that he was prevented from using the military to suppress violence in cities and states during his first term, and said if the issue came up again in his next term, "I'm not waiting."

Trump also promised to deploy the National Guard to help carry out his immigration enforcement goals, and his top adviser Stephen Miller explained how that would be carried out: Troops under sympathetic Republican governors would send troops to nearby states that refuse to participate, Miller said on "The Charlie Kirk Show," in 2023.

After Trump announced he was federalizing the National Guard troops on Saturday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said other measures could follow.

Hegseth wrote on the social media platform X that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert and would also be mobilized "if violence continues."

ByteDance Ltd., TikTok's parent company, has been replacing US-hired staff near Seattle with managers connected to China, aiming to replicate its e-commerce success in Asia after sales fell short in America.

TikTok Shop initially set a goal to increase its US e-commerce business tenfold last year to $17.5 billion in transaction volume, but had to drastically lower that objective, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly.

Russia said on Sunday its forces had advanced to the edge of the east-central Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk amid a public row between Moscow and Kyiv over peace negotiations and the return of thousands of bodies of soldiers who fell in the war.

Amid talk of peace, the war is stepping up with Russian forces grabbing more territory in Ukraine and Kyiv unfurling high-profile drone and sabotage attacks on Russia's nuclear-capable bomber fleet and, according to Moscow, on railways.

Russia, which controls a little under one-fifth of Ukrainian territory, has taken more than 190 square km (73 square miles) of the Sumy region of eastern Ukraine in less than a month, according to pro-Ukrainian open source maps.

Now, according to the Russian defense ministry, units of the 90th Tank Division of the Central Grouping of Russian forces have reached the western frontier of Ukraine's Donetsk region and are attacking the adjacent Dnipropetrovsk region.

"The enemy does not abandon its intentions to enter the Dnipropetrovsk region," Ukraine's Southern Defence Forces said on Telegram. "Our soldiers are courageously and professionally holding their section of the front, disrupting the occupier's plans. This work does not stop for a minute."

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said the Dnipropetrovsk offensive showed that if Ukraine did not want to accept the reality of Russia's territorial gains in peace talks then Moscow's forces would advance further.

The pro-Ukrainian Deep State map showed Russian forces very close to the Dnipropetrovsk region, which had a population of more than 3 million before the war, and advancing on the city of Kostyantynivka in the Donetsk region from several directions.

A Ukrainian military spokesman, Dmytro Zaporozhets, said that Russian forces were trying to "build a bridgehead for an attack" on Kostyantynivka, an important logistical hub for the Ukrainian army.

Russia on Saturday accused Ukraine of delaying the swap of prisoners of war and return of the bodies of 12,000 dead soldiers, though Ukraine denied those claims.

Russia said on Sunday it was moving bodies towards the border and television showed refrigerated trucks containing the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers on the road in the Bryansk region.

Ukraine accused Russia of playing propaganda games and said that the exchange of prisoners of war and the bodies of fallen soldiers was scheduled for next week. Russia said Ukraine was playing politics with the dead.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he wants an end to the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two, on Thursday likened it to a fight between young children and indicated that he might have to simply let the conflict play out.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that he did not think Ukraine's leaders wanted peace, after accusing them of ordering a bombing in Bryansk, western Russia, that killed seven people and injured 115 a day before talks in Turkey.

Ukraine, which has not commented on the attack on a Bryansk bridge, has similarly accused Moscow of not seriously seeking peace, citing as evidence Russian resistance to an immediate ceasefire.

Russia is demanding international recognition of Crimea, a peninsula annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014, and four other regions of Ukraine that Moscow has claimed as its own territory. Ukraine would have to withdraw its forces from all of them.

Russia controlled 113,273 square km, or 18.8%, of Ukrainian territory as of June 7, according to the Deep State map. That is an area bigger than the U.S. state of Virginia.

The areas under Russian control include Crimea, more than 99% of the Luhansk region, over 70% of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, all in the east or southeast, and fragments of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions in the northeast.

Putin told Trump on Wednesday that he would have to respond to Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia's bomber fleet and the bombings of the railways.

The United States believes that Putin's threatened retaliation against Ukraine over its attacks has not happened yet in earnest and is likely to be a significant, multi-pronged strike, U.S. officials told Reuters.

Russia also hit the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Friday evening and overnight with drones, missiles and guided bombs, killing at least four people and injuring more than 60, including a baby, local officials said on Saturday.

Russia also said it had downed 61 Ukrainian drones overnight on Sunday in the Moscow region. Two major airports serving Moscow were closed temporarily.

Taiwan's coast guard held drills with the military on Sunday to better practice joint operations in the face of what the government in Taipei says is a growing "grey zone" threat from China, which claims the island as its own territory.

Democratically governed Taiwan has repeatedly complained about activities such as undersea cable cutting and sand dredging by China around the island, designed to pressure it without direct confrontation.

It is often Taiwan's coast guard that scrambles first to respond.

The drills in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, overseen by President Lai Ching-te, simulated the seizing of a ferry by "international terrorists". The coast guard worked with an interior ministry rescue helicopter and army medevac helicopter to board and take back control of the boat and evacuate casualties.

A navy anti-submarine helicopter flew over the scene as the drill ended, along with the medevac and rescue helicopters, the first time they have flown together in such a scenario, the coast guard said.

"Taiwan has been facing constant grey intrusion from China, but our coast guard colleagues have always been on the front line to enforce the law and protect the lives and safety of the people of Taiwan," Lai told the audience for the drills, which included the top U.S. diplomat in Kaohsiung, Neil Gibson.

"The government will continue to consolidate the strength of all departments and strengthen the resilience of the entire society to defend national security and safeguard Taiwan's democracy and freedom," Lai said.

Taiwan's coast guard, which would be pressed into military service in the event of war with China, is also routinely sent out to shadow Chinese ships during Beijing's war games around the island.

The coast guard, like the navy, is in the midst of an expansion and modernisation programme.

Its new Anping-class corvettes, which began being commissioned in 2020, are based on the navy's Tuo Chiang-class warships. They are state-of-the-art, highly manoeuvrable stealth vessels meant to take out larger warships while operating close to Taiwan's shores.

The Anping-class ships, one of which took part in the drill, have space for launchers for the Taiwan-made Hsiung Feng anti-ship and sea-to-land missiles, as well as added equipment for rescue operations.

Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.

Colombian Senator Miguel Uribe, a potential presidential contender, survived an initial operation for his injuries after being shot in Bogota on Saturday, according to his wife and the hospital treating him, although he remains in intensive care.

Uribe, 39, is a member of the opposition right-wing Democratic Center party and was shot in the head during a campaign event in a public park in the Fontibon neighborhood.

A boy under 15 years of age was arrested after the shooting, the attorney general's office said in a statement on Saturday, adding he was carrying a 9-millimeter Glock-type pistol.

The government said it is investigating if there were other potential perpetrators. Leftist President Gustavo Petro urged an investigation into who had ordered the attack in remarks late on Saturday.

Campaigning is just beginning for the country's 2026 presidential election and Uribe, who is from a prominent political family, does not have a well-known platform so far.

It was unclear why he was targeted in the attack. Though he has talked about the need to improve security and about having personally suffered in the country's conflict, many other potential candidates, including others from his party, have also said steps must be taken to tackle crime.

Uribe's grandfather was president from 1978 to 1982, while his mother, journalist Diana Turbay, was kidnapped in 1990 by an armed group under the command of the late cartel leader Pablo Escobar. She was killed during a rescue operation in 1991.

"Miguel came out of surgery, he made it. Every hour is a critical hour. He fought his first battle, and it went well," his wife Maria Claudia Tarazona told local media on Sunday. "This will take time."

The couple are parents to a young son.

In a statement, the Santa Fe Foundation hospital where Uribe was treated said he had procedures on his head and his left thigh, and remained in intensive care as doctors seek to stabilize his condition.

Uribe's party said in a statement that armed subjects shot him from behind. Videos on social media showed a man, identified as Uribe, being tended to after the shooting. He appeared to be bleeding from his head.

Bogota's mayor, Carlos Galan, whose own presidential candidate father was assassinated in 1989, addressed journalists outside the hospital overnight, saying he had asked for increased protection for all candidates in Bogota and for Uribe's family.

The Colombian government is offering some $730,000 as a reward for information in the case.

"For now there is nothing more than hypothesis," Petro said, adding that failures in security protocols would also be looked into. Uribe had the bodyguard protection provided for senators and other officials.

Petro sympathized with Uribe's family in a message on X, saying: "I don't know how to ease your pain. It is the pain of a mother lost, and of a homeland."

People gathered outside the hospital in northern Bogota, staging candlelight vigils and praying, while others carried Colombian flags. A march of support was planned for Sunday.

Several nations on Sunday including Brazil, Italy, Spain, Uruguay and Paraguay condemned the attack, as did the Venezuelan government and opposition.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that the U.S. "condemns in the strongest possible terms the attempted assassination" of Uribe, blaming Petro's "inflammatory rhetoric" for the violence.

Petro was an outspoken critic of U.S. President Donald Trump's deportation policies earlier this year, but has been less vocal since Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on the Andean country.

Colombia has for decades been embroiled in a conflict between leftist rebels, criminal groups descended from right-wing paramilitaries, and the government.

California National Guard troops started arriving in Los Angeles on Sunday morning, hours after President Donald Trump signed an order to deploy 2,000 service members in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles.

"Elements of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team from the California National Guard have begun deploying to the Los Angeles area, with some already on the ground," U.S. Northern Command wrote on X.

Trump's order, announced by the White House Saturday night, comes amid continued clashes between demonstrators and federal agents executing immigration enforcement actions in L.A., which have led to more than 100 arrests. 

"In recent days, violent mobs have attacked ICE Officers and Federal Law Enforcement Agents carrying out basic deportation operations in Los Angeles, California," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

Leavitt told NBC News that Trump is federalizing part of California's National Guard that would otherwise report to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Presidents have the authority to do so under limited circumstances.

Newsom slammed Trump's move, calling it "purposefully inflammatory" and said it "will only escalate tensions."

"LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice," Newsom wrote on X. "We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need."

"This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust," he said.

Trump and Newsom spoke on Friday for approximately 40 minutes, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC.

The White House on Saturday showed no signs that it was preparing to de-escalate the situation.

On the contrary, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to deploy U.S. Marines in addition to the members of the National Guard.

"If violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert," he posted on X.

Trump on Truth Social early Sunday morning wrote, "great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence, clashes and unrest."

His post came before the troops he ordered officially arrived in the area.

Trump spent Saturday night attending an Ultimate Fighting Championship match at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J.

The White House also released a formal memo from the president to the secretary of Defense, the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security.

"To the extent that protests or acts of violence directly inhibit the execution of the laws, they constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States," the memo stated.

"In light of these incidents and credible threats of continued violence, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby call into Federal service members and units of the National Guard."

Vice President JD Vance called the protestors "insurrectionists" in a post on X.

"Insurrectionists carrying foreign flags are attacking immigration enforcement officers, while one half of America's political leadership has decided that border enforcement is evil," Vance wrote.

Labor leader David Huerta, president of the SEIU California, was injured Friday when he was arrested while observing the protests. The Homeland Security Department alleged that Huerta was "obstructing" federal officers.

Twenty-five minutes of live TV, more than a dozen posts on X, and three posts on Truth Social over the period of five hours (and counting) — that's how the already fractured friendship of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly unraveled on Thursday.

The first signs of trouble began when Musk showed opposition to Trump's spending bill, the "One Big Beautiful Bill," though he never explicitly targeted Trump.

"Shame on those who voted for it," Musk tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress members who voted for Trump's tax cut bill.

Trump, for his part, had stayed uncharacteristically mum about Musk's criticism of the bill.

But that all changed on Thursday morning.

Here is a minute-by-minute breakdown of how the relationship between two of the most powerful men on the planet devolved.

Musk began digging up Trump's old posts on what was then Twitter about the deficit, including one from January of 2013.

Wise words https://t.co/6juH1jEjtc

Musk unearthed another old X post by Trump from back in July 2012, presumably as a swipe at the new Republican tax bill that many economists and the congressional Budget Office said would increase the country's deficits.

I couldn't agree more! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/sZ6xgisZEA

Trump responded to Musk's attacks for the first time when answering press questions during a White House event to welcome German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

"And you know Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles," said Trump. "And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning; he knew it from a long time ago."

Trump's comments about Musk continued at the press appearance.

"He knew every aspect of this bill — better than almost anybody —and he never had a problem until right after he left," said Trump. "He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn't said bad things about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot."

"People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile," Trump continued.

"I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it, but we have it with others, too. They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour's gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile," he added.

Musk began a whirlwind of tweets soon after, responding in near real time to what Trump said during the press appearance.

"False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!" Musk posed on X.

False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! https://t.co/V4ztekqd4g

Musk then began a series of tweets directed at the president beyond the bill, including saying that without him, Republicans would have lost.

Such ingratitude

Musk polls his X followers about creating a new political party "that actually represents the 80% in the middle." Mark Cuban quoted the post with three checkmarks.

Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?

Musk gives Trump's bill — known on paper as the "One Big Beautiful Bill" — a new name: "Big Ugly Spending Bill."

Not even those in Congress who had to vote on the Big Ugly Spending Bill had time to read it! https://t.co/mBOQyhQYwX

Trump responds to Musk with two consecutive posts on his own social media platform, Truth Social.

"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!" Trump wrote.

"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" the president continued.

Musk responds to Trump's posts on Truth Social, calling them "such an obvious lie."

Such an obvious lie. So sad. https://t.co/sOu9vqMVfX

A minute later, Musk appeared to dare Trump to cancel government contracts with his companies.

This just gets better and better 🤣🤣Go ahead, make my day … https://t.co/APmy7cV8iL

Musk makes another accusation.

Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT!

Trump posts on Truth Social again to defend his tax bill.

"I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress," Trump wrote.

"It's a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn't create this mess, I'm just here to FIX IT," Trump added.

Musk says SpaceX will decommission its Dragon spacecraft "immediately."

SpaceX's Dragon spaceships transport NASA astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. Prior to partnering with SpaceX, the agency depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions.

Musk says that Trump's tariffs will "cause a recession in the second half of this year."

Some economists have also predicted that Trump's tariffs would hurt the economy, and Trump himself declined to rule out the chances of a recession back in March.

JPMorgan had predicted a 60% chance of a US recession after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on April 2. The bank adjusted the possibility down to below 50% recently after Trump paused most of his highest tariffs.

Musk retweeted what appears to be a video of Trump partying with Epstein from the 1990s, doubling down on his earlier statement about the Epstein files.

🤨 https://t.co/DTdfJWydLS

"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Business Insider in a statement. "The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again."

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Musk took a softer tone later on Thursday night.

Some five hours after his post about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, he walked back the decision in a response to an X user.

"This is a shame this back and forth. You are both better than this. Cool off and take a step back for a couple days," X user Fab25june wrote on the platform.

"Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon," Musk wrote at 9:20 p.m.

In a separate exchange on X, billionaire investor Bill Ackman encouraged Musk and Trump to make up.

"I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart," Ackman wrote.

"You're not wrong," Musk responded at 9:27 p.m.

Trump spoke about the feud on Friday morning during a phone call with CNN's Dana Bash.

"I'm not even thinking about Elon," Trump said. "He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem."

Trump doesn't intend to speak to Musk "for a while" and wishes Musk well, according to Bash.

Bash said people in Musk and Trump's orbit are trying to mend the rift.

The President appears to respond to Musk's allegation that he's in the so-called "Epstein files."

On Truth Social, Trump posted a screenshot of an X post from David Schoen, Epstein's defense attorney. Schoen said in the post that Epstein "had no information to hurt President Trump."

"I specifically asked him!" Schoen wrote.

Trump reiterated that he wasn't thinking about Musk while traveling with reporters aboard Air Force One.

He wished Musk the best of luck on his Tesla business.

"I mean, I hope he does well with Tesla," he said.

Musk found a name for his new political party proposal: "The America Party."

The America Party https://t.co/hO5S8Kjb5O

In a separate post on X, Musk said the "people have spoken" as the polling results showed that 80% of the 5.6 million participants voted "Yes" to creating a party that represents "the middle."

Musk said on X that he would apologize to Trump "profusely as soon as there is a full dump of the Epstein files."

The CEO was responding to a post from James Fishback, an investor who proposed the idea of DOGE dividend checks, who posted on X that Musk should send Trump a "full-throated apology."

"You can substantively disagree with the President on policy, but you should not have baselessly and personally attacked him," Fishback wrote.

Trump and Musk appeared to extend each other an olive branch — at least for a brief moment.

Likewise

The White House rapid response account on X posted a clip of Trump's gaggle with the press on Air Force One, highlighting the president saying he wishes Musk well.

"Likewise," Musk said in response at 10:46 p.m.

Musk deleted some of the X posts he made on Thursday, including one in which he said Trump was named in the Epstein files. He also deleted a tweet announcing his intention to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.

However, other the X posts Musk made, including criticism of the tax bill, remain on his account.

Trump told NBC News in a phone interview that he has no plans to amend his relationship with Musk and threatened that there would be "serious consequences" if the Tesla CEO funded Democratic candidates.

The European startup scene was recently shaken by a LinkedIn debate with some venture capitalists applying pressure on founders to embrace a culture of overwork to compete on a global stage.

The "996" work culture reigns supreme in China and has been adopted by various tech giants including Jack Ma's Alibaba and Bytedance's TikTok, but the system has also been the subject of much protest in recent years. Tech workers in Europe told CNBC in 2021 that they're turning down job offers, rejecting interviews, or even quitting their roles, upon learning of TikTok's 996 work culture.

Sebastian Becker, general partner at Switzerland-based VC company Redalpine added to the debate on LinkedIn by addressing the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has called for removal of the legal work limit of eight hours per day in Germany in a bid to increase efficiency, while keeping the 40-hour week.

Becker said Merz' proposal doesn't go far enough, as "40 hours a week won't cut it."

"In Silicon Valley, 60-70 hour weeks aren't the exception — they even have a term for it: 996 — 9am to 9pm, six days a week... we can have the same amount of smart, ambitious people, but if we're consistently being outworked, we won't win," Becker said.

Index Ventures Partner Martin Mignot in London explained on LinkedIn that 996 originated in China and has "quietly become the norm" at startups internationally.

Part of the reason behind this most recent push is that there's a persistent view that Europe's tech and startup scene is lagging behind the U.S. and China, both of which have produced tech giants and are known for intense work cultures.

However, Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, told CNBC Make It that these views are outdated as Europe has produced deca-corns in recent years— companies worth more than $10 billion including Klarna, Revolut, Wise, and Checkout.com. The continent has yet to produce a trillion-dollar tech firm like Nvidia.

"The European tech market and ecosystem is keeping up today with the U.S. and Asia... back in the 1980s the European tech scene was behind the tech scene on the West Coast of the US, but that's not the case now," Chandratillake said in an interview.

The calls for Europe to adopt the 996 work culture sparked a wave of backlash. CNBC spoke with seven European startup founders and VCs on why they disagree.

The obsession with China's 996 or Silicon Valley's 24/7 work culture emerges from a glorification of hustle culture in the startup landscape, founders and VCs said.  

"It's about a fetishization of overwork rather than smart work…it's a myth," Chandratillake said. "California is very good at telling stories and there's a lot of mythmaking around the concept of what startups look like…. there is hard work involved but if you really spend time in that ecosystem, you will discover that lots of people work really hard, but there are also periods where they don't work."

Nina Mohanty, a Silicon Valley native and founder of London-based Bloom Money, said there are actually "lasting effects and unintended consequences" to adopting an aggressive overwork culture,

"You only have to think about Revolut and the culture that they have is probably the closest that we've seen in Europe to the 996 culture, and they struggled," Mohanty told CNBC. "Their churn rate was incredibly high within their team, and they even struggled to get their banking license, and their culture was actually cited as one of those reasons."

For its part, Revolut told CNBC it operates in a "high-growth, high-performance environment."

"In line with this, we've evolved how we support our people: through value-based behaviours, structured development, and a culture that's collaborative, challenging, and built for scale," a spokesperson from Revolut said.

Noa Khamallah, general partner at Don't Quit Ventures, pointed out that there's "no need for 996" and that these values are often at odds with both the European mindset and regulation.

"Europe's most successful companies — from Spotify to SAP to ASML — didn't achieve dominance through overwork but through sustainable innovation cultures," Khamallah said.

He offered the examples of Silicon Valley's Uber and Meta, both companies that expanded into Europe and faced massive regulatory pushback.

"These examples reveal how Silicon Valley's 'move fast and break things' ethos often breaks against European values around worker rights, privacy, and sustainable business practices," Khamallah said.

An always-on culture decreases retention and creates a revolving door of talent, Sarah Wernér, co-founder of Husmus, told CNBC.

"Overwork today is a productivity crisis tomorrow," Wernér said. "Personally, I hope my competitors are doing 996. It makes poaching great people a lot easier when they decide they've had enough."

Dama Sathianathan, a senior partner at Bethnal Green Ventures said it's unhelpful to "prescribe" working hours, especially if it means putting workers' wellbeing at risk.

"Optimizing labor doesn't always lead to better productivity, or help with differentiating from other companies long-term, if you've made work devoid of meaning," Sathianathan explained.

Meanwhile, the youngest generation at work are less likely to put up with overworking and tend to prioritize work-life balance.

Jas Schembri-Stothart, founder of Luna, a health and wellness app for teen girls, said 996 will drive young talent away from European startups.

"People may tolerate overwork for a while, but eventually it leads to churn and even resentment, especially with Gen Z and younger millennials, there's much less tolerance for toxic hustle cultures," Schembri-Stothart said.

Founders insist that instead of increasing working hours, startups need more funding and resources to position themselves as key players in the global startup scene.

"What Europe really needs isn't more hustle-porn it's more aggressive funding," Wernér said. "With the right level of capital, our startups can hire enough talent to work intensely without breaking themselves. If a team of 10 is burning out to keep up with a 50-person U.S. VC or Chinese government-backed startup, the problem isn't their stamina, it's their cap table."

In fact, since 2015 Europe's tech startups have missed out on nearly $375 billion in growth-stage funding, with founders losing out on a potential $300 billion in European investments, according to Atomico's State of European Tech report published in 2024. Additionally, one in two companies raising funding turn to the U.S. for capital rather than Europe.

"What European startups really need is access to the right resources — funding, talent, and support — to grow, innovate quickly, and scale effectively," Schembri-Stothart said. "The venture landscape in the U.S. is a different ballgame altogether, and it's tough to compete with that without a stronger ecosystem here.

Founders acknowledged that the startup life requires intense hustle and grind, but it's a more nuanced picture than just adopting 996.

Timothy Armoo, co-founder and former CEO of Fanbytes, an influencer marketing firm that he sold for eight figures in 2022, told CNBC that he's a "huge supporter" of this new 996 push, but admitted that timing is key.

"I think there are seasons but I also think that if you are a first-time founder or if your primary goal is basically wealth creation, I'll be very candid, if this is your season, and you're stepping back, then you're not serious about it," he said.

Armoo said there are no excuses because AI allows entrepreneurs to be maximally efficient as it can reduce certain time-consuming manual tasks.

Meanwhile, Bloom Money's Mohanty, said that when she's not sleeping, she's working. "I think early stage teams tend to almost unknowingly or without actually saying it, work the 996 life, because when you are early stage, you just have to hustle harder with less, and especially if you're the founder, you're always on and always working, and it can be very, very difficult to turn off."

Schembri-Stothart draws the line at exploiting her team to produce more work. "It's my choice to work at the weekend, but I'd never expect that on my team, it's definitely not glorified to push your teams to breaking point.

Silicon Valley tech exec Dion McKenzie warned that expectations of a 996 culture could make VC funding even more out of reach for early-stage startups.

"My fear is that as these new norms and trends become the status quo and benchmarks for getting funded, it excludes so many brilliant founders that value their mental health and/or can't commit to a 996 due to caregiving responsibilities or being a parent," Mckenzie said.

Crypto, a paradise for freelancers? Maybe. But it also attracts vultures. Today, holding Bitcoin or Ether is a bit like living with a target on your back. Large virtual wallets trigger very real nightmares. Kidnappings, kidnappings, violence: the hunt for digital loot is on. And while some store their passwords in a safe, others bury them at the end of the world. Waiting for justice to get its hands on the predators… if they really do one day.

Fear doesn't always knock at the door. Sometimes it shows up armed to the teeth. This happened to the wife of a Brazilian entrepreneur. Kidnapped. Ransom demanded: 40 million dollars… in crypto, of course. Eventually released, the transaction was settled at 2 million. In Monero, obviously, to cover their tracks.

Crypto is not the enemy. It is human greed that tarnishes its image. In response, some strengthen security: armored doors, cameras, biometric safes. But Didi Taihuttu went further.

He scattered his bitcoins across four continents. Cold wallets hidden like treasures. Far, very far from eyes and hands. A radical choice, born of paranoia? Rather cold lucidity.

I prefer to live in a decentralized world where I have the responsibility to protect my capital. 

No superfluous words. Everything is said.

That's the question. Is a fortune in crypto worth the price of constant insecurity? Many admit it half-quietly: they are afraid. The danger is no longer virtual. It is tangible, real, brutal.

Holding crypto is carrying an invisible burden. Every poorly guarded password becomes a ticking time bomb. But the attraction remains immense. Rapid gains, promise of independence, desire to break from the traditional banking system.

The paradox is here. The more you earn, the more you tremble. The new bitcoin rich do not drive Lamborghinis. They flee, hide, live between VPNs and suitcases.

Is it viable long term? Maybe. But it requires iron discipline. A war strategy. And above all, acceptance to live in the shadow of the loot. Crypto can make you free… or a slave to your own fortune.

The Bitcoin Family fascinates as much as it confuses. In 2017, they sold everything: house, car, furniture. To buy bitcoin at 900 dollars. A leap into the void that propelled them into the spotlight.

But instead of flaunting their wealth, they fragmented it. Six cold wallets. Four continents. A strategy worthy of the greatest security organizations.

What they did, in numbers:

It is a philosophy as much as an escape plan. No fixed home. A nomadic life. Meticulous management of every Bitcoin. And above all, a message: 

It is time to think about money differently. 

Even if it means living in a state of constant alert.

Morocco has just arrested the man suspected to be the mastermind behind crypto-related kidnappings in France. A police operation that reassures… a little. But is it really enough? As long as digital money circulates unchecked, vultures will prowl. And some will continue burying their keys, far, very far from prying eyes.

Bitcoin (BTC) BTC$106,359.36 maintained a steady climb Saturday as U.S. domestic tensions intensified. 

Markets remained focused on crypto resilience despite unsettling headlines, including an immigration-related standoff in Los Angeles. 

According to a report by CNBC, over 100 arrests have been reported as clashes continued between protesters and federal agents, prompting President Trump to authorize the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. By Sunday morning, elements of the 79th Infantry Brigade had arrived on-site, according to Northern Command.

Further escalation came with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warning that U.S. Marines at Camp Pendleton could also be mobilized if violence persists. Still, Bitcoin's stability at $106,332 suggests crypto investors remain unfazed, treating the unrest as a regional event rather than a market-moving crisis.

Bitcoin traded within a narrow $1,057 range, from $105,043 to $106,101, and is currently hovering at $106,332. The price action showed a strong rebound after briefly dipping below $105,100, as buying interest re-emerged around the $105,400 support level,  according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. 

An early breakout attempt above $106,100 ran into selling pressure, creating a high-volume resistance zone. That move was short-lived as profit-taking set in, though the coin held onto its gains. The consolidation structure remains bullish, with the pattern of higher lows hinting at a potential push toward $107,000 if resistance breaks cleanly.

Despite broader macro headwinds, BTC continues to attract buyers during dips, underscoring its role as a perceived hedge amid rising uncertainty.Technical Analysis Highlights

Based on reports, a long-dormant Bitcoin whale made a surprise move this week, snapping up 250 BTC for about $26.37 million. It's the first time this wallet has shown activity in two years.

The purchase has stirred talk among traders and on-chain analysts alike. Some see it as a sign that big players are getting ready for more action in the weeks ahead.

Whale Returns After Two Years

According to Lookonchain data, the same whale pulled 500 BTC out of Gemini back in 2022 when Bitcoin was trading near $27,400, a move worth nearly $14 million at the time. Now, with BTC hovering around $105,000, the whale's holdings sit on an unrealized gain of over $39 million.

That kind of profit margin grabs attention. Other large holders often watch these moves closely. They wonder if this is the start of a wider trend or just one wallet's play.

A whale that had been dormant for 2 years bought another 250 $BTC($26.37M) 9 hours ago.

2 years ago, this whale withdrew 500 $BTC($13.7M) from Gemini at $27,401, now sitting on an unrealized profit of $39M.https://t.co/c0U92isSfc pic.twitter.com/vcb4V3M0Uz

Big Gains On Early Bet

Early adopters have seen massive upside in Bitcoin over the years. This whale's 2022 withdrawal came just before a multi-year price boom. Since then, Bitcoin has climbed nearly 300%.

Not everyone can make moves like that. Small investors often feel left behind when a wallet this size shifts coins. Still, some traders say it can create a ripple of optimism. When big holders buy, retail traders sometimes pile in, chasing the same gains.Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals

On the charts, BTC seems to be shaping an inverse cup-and-handle pattern with a significant neckline at $100,800 serving as major support. The price has fallen into the handle stage, and a dip below $100,800 could propel Bitcoin to $91,000, which coincides with its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA).

Bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) is 52, indicating the bullish momentum is fading. A fall below 50 could introduce additional selling pressure. For the bulls to regain control, BTC must recapture the 20-day EMA resistance, which is just above $105,000.Market Volatility And Liquidations

There were some wild price movements last week fueled in part by social media battles between US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk. The price of bitcoin fell below $101,000 for a moment, causing close to $1 billion in liquidations across futures markets, before recovering to above $105,000 within hours.

The miner capitulation signal was also detected by CryptoQuant's Hash Ribbons indicator, pointing to near-term pain for worse-off miners, but some potential rallies ahead once they pulled through.

Jonathan Mann, a non-fungible token (NFT) artist, has spun his taxing experience with cryptocurrency into a song. This follows a $3 million loss he suffered due to a market crash.

What Happened: Mann, who is recognized for his “Song A Day” project, recently released a track that narrates his financial misfortune. In a post on X, Mann shared that he made a whopping $3 million by selling his entire song catalog as NFTs. However, he lost it all during the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.

According to his post, on Jan. 1, 2022, Mann embarked on his crypto journey, selling 3,700 songs at $800 each. This earned him approximately $3 million in Ether (ETH). However, the value of ETH plummeted, leaving Mann and his wife uncertain about the right time to sell or the amount to sell. Adding to their woes, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came knocking.

Mann clarified that the earnings from his NFT sales are taxed as income, based on the ETH value at the time of receipt. This holds true even if the crypto asset's value crashes later.

Consequently, despite the decrease in their $3 million worth of ETH, their tax bill remained unchanged.

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

In an attempt to avoid selling their crypto at a loss, Mann took out a loan through the Aave lending protocol, using some of the ETH as collateral. However, the market crash triggered a series of liquidations across the ecosystem, which included Mann's loan, erasing 300 ETH.

After months of collaboration with his accountant, Mann found out that they owed $1,095,171.79 in taxes. To pay off the IRS bill, Mann sold a rare Autoglyph NFT for $1.1 million. Despite this financial blow, Mann continues his daily songwriting and selling them as NFTs.

Why It Matters: Mann's experience underscores the volatility of the crypto market and the potential tax implications of trading in digital assets. 

It also highlights the risks associated with crypto-backed loans, particularly during market downturns. 

Despite his financial setback, Mann's continued commitment to his craft and the NFT space demonstrates the resilience and adaptability of artists in the face of adversity.

Jonathan Mann, the creator behind the long-running “Song A Day” project, has turned his crypto misfortune into a musical cautionary tale.

After earning $3 million by selling thousands of his songs as NFTs in early 2022, Mann found himself facing a massive tax bill and a portfolio in freefall.

Hoping for further gains, Mann and his wife chose to hold onto their earnings in Ethereum. But when the market turned and ETH began to slide, they were unprepared. Despite the shrinking value of their assets, U.S. tax law still treated the income at its original value—leaving them owing over $1 million to the IRS.

In an attempt to delay selling at a loss, the couple used ETH as collateral for a loan on Aave. But when the Terra ecosystem collapsed, it triggered a wave of liquidations, including Mann's. In an instant, 300 ETH vanished—effectively erasing years of creative work.

Faced with the threat of losing their home and retirement savings, Mann dug into his digital vault and sold a rare Autoglyph NFT for $1.1 million—just enough to settle the tax debt. Fortunately, the previous losses meant he didn't owe capital gains on the sale.

Despite the ordeal, Mann continues his daily song project, still minting NFTs and hoping for a second act—this time with a clearer financial strategy.







Elon Musk's financial standing has taken a major hit, with his net worth shrinking by $70 billion since his public fallout with Donald Trump.

UBS analyst Brian Meredith has revised his outlook on Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares, trimming the price target from $606 to $591, while maintaining a “buy” rating.

In a move not seen in decades, the U.S. Treasury Department has initiated a historic $10 billion bond buyback—its largest ever—targeting securities set to mature between mid-2025 and mid-2027.

In a bold move to reshape the future of ApeCoin, Yuga Labs has introduced a proposal that would dissolve the existing ApeCoin DAO and replace it with a streamlined management body called ApeCo.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are likely going to reshape personal finance over the next decade.

Consider This: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You

For You: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025

Even if you never buy bitcoin, ethereum or any other digital currency, the impact could affect how you save, spend and manage your money. Here are three ways crypto could transform your financial life by 2035.

Trending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?

The most immediate change will be in how people send and receive money.

Pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar, stablecoins brought the stability that cryptocurrencies lacked, making them practical for everyday transactions. A decade from now, sending money across borders will likely be faster and cheaper.

“We believe in the potential of stablecoins to streamline payments and commerce across the value chain,” said Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard.

This means your future paychecks, bill payments and international transfers could all flow through blockchain-based systems that operate 24/7 without traditional banking intermediaries.

Stablecoins are already gaining traction for everyday use because of their speed and low fees.

“We've seen some interest where banks and other companies will want to create their own stablecoin,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.

In fact, companies like Circle and JPMorgan have already developed their own stablecoins to facilitate faster payments at lower fees than traditional banks.

As stablecoins become more integrated into finance, they could power everyday spending, from paying bills to shopping online and transferring money, providing more flexibility and efficiency.

The most revolutionary change may come from decentralized finance (DeFi), which could entirely remove traditional banking middlemen.

Currently, some DeFi platforms allow users to lend, borrow and earn interest directly through smart contracts. These platforms offer better returns than traditional savings accounts.

A decade from now, people may bypass banks completely when it comes to saving money, borrowing and even lending.

The latest Ethereum price prediction has injected the much-needed confidence that was lacking in the previous months. Meanwhile, analysts predict that the Circle IPO could help reverse the poor market form of Polygon Coin and Pi Network.

However, a new smart money project, Unilabs Finance, has attracted massive attention within market circles. With its AI-powered investment and income strategies, crypto fans are already betting on the project to have the largest liquidity pull in this cycle.

The Ethereum price prediction has shifted to bullish over the past month as a new wave of optimism sweeps through the cryptosphere. For the first time in months, technical indicators are suggesting a northbound movement for ETH.

Changelly's Ethereum price prediction model aligns with this current outlook. As per data, ETH's potential maximum price level for September stands at $2,875, a 13% increase from its current value of $2,508.

Other technical indicators, such as the 200-day SMA, suggest that the bulls have taken over the Ethereum price prediction sentiment.

Meanwhile, assets like Polygon Coin and Pi Network could witness a market recovery from the possible liquidity flow from the Circle IPO.

But Unilabs is poised to be the biggest beneficiary of this potential liquidity influx, with more investors flocking to AI-driven investment products.

Unilabs Finance is becoming a big topic in crypto forums, as its presale phase has surpassed market expectations. Although the Ethereum price prediction remains optimistic, this next-gen DeFi project is already charting remarkable courses.

The project is outpacing Polygon Coin and Pi Network as buyers invest over $2.5 million to purchase about 516 million tokens. What is powering this run? The answer is simple: AI-based investment strategies and passive income systems.

With its AI Market Pulse, users could access well-scouted investment opportunities powered by artificial intelligence. This tool tracks multiple data points, key token movements, and other on-chain data to deliver an actionable overview.

Through its multi-fund model, Unilabs exposes users to four investment funds: AI, RWA, mining and Bitcoin.

This way, traders could benefit from emerging opportunities within these sectors while the platform handles research and exposure.

But that's not all. With Unilabs, investors could earn by just holding their tokens on the network.

The platform distributes 30% of the fees generated within the ecosystem to UNIL holders across tiers. Even more, investors could earn a 122% APY for staking their tokens.

Experts predict that the potential liquidity flow from the Circle IPO could further add to its over $30 million in assets under management (AUM). If this happens, the UNIL could surge exponentially post-launch.

While the Ethereum price prediction is already reversing its weak trend, Polygon Coin is still battling bearish conditions. At the time of writing, Polygon Coin is changing hands at $ 0.21 after losing over half its value year-to-date.

Crypto fans are currently bearish on the coin, as shown by CoinCodex's sentiment tracker. While a climb back to the top seems far-fetched, experts are predicting the Circle IPO to add a much-needed boost.

USDC is available on the Polygon network. As such, analysts expect the Polygon coin, as well as Pi Network to benefit from a portion of the $1.05 billion Circle IPO, which could move within the networks.

Like Polygon Coin, Pi Network is another asset that could benefit from the recent developments around the world's second-largest stablecoin issuer. Pi briefly surged to $2.98 post-launch but has since declined by 79% and currently trades at $0.62.

Unlike the Ethereum price prediction, which has utility-based drivers, Pi Network was launched without a clear use case. However, the network has stepped up its utility game, partnering with a new decentralized app, Boostr, to enable utility payments.

Pi Network is also gaining greater market reach, with exchanges like CEX.io and Binance offering a PI/USDC trading pair. As USDC liquidity spreads across these platforms, Pi could attract fresh inflows through greater exposure.

But market commentators are betting big on Unilabs Finance due to its user-investment-driven approach. Priced at just $0.0062, UNIL offers investors the chance to profit from the crypto market without breaking the bank. For savvy investors, the time to join this rare trend is now.

A new report by cybersecurity firm CRIL warns of 20 malicious apps on the Google Play Store posing serious threats to smartphone users.

Massive phishing threat targets mobile users
If you're using an Android smartphone, beware! A major phishing threat is currently endangering crores of users across India. According to a recent report by Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL), more than 20 dangerous apps have been found on the Google Play Store that can compromise your personal and financial data.

These Crypto Wallet apps are a trap
These fake cryptocurrency wallet apps are designed to steal wallet recovery phrases—an essential key to accessing users' DeFi wallets. Apps like SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Raydium, Hyperliquid, and Suiet Wallet are part of this scam. Once a user downloads the app, it prompts them to enter their 12-word recovery phrase, which is then harvested by cybercriminals to gain access to the user's wallet.
How are these malicious apps spreading?
Cybercriminals are uploading these harmful apps using developer accounts originally linked to gaming and video editing tools. The apps hide phishing URLs within their privacy policies, tricking users into entering sensitive information. The scam becomes even more convincing because these apps imitate the design and functionality of genuine crypto wallet applications.
Immediate action: Delete these apps from your phone
The identified apps include:
Suiet Wallet
BullX Crypto
SushiSwap
Raydium
Hyperliquid
OpenOcean Exchange
Pancake Swap
Meteora Exchange
Harvest Finance Blog
If you have any of these apps installed on your device, delete them immediately to prevent your crypto funds and personal data from being compromised.Read Also

The crypto world is bustling with momentum.

Japan just revamped its Payment Services Act to be ‘crypto-friendly,' opening the door for more institutional and mainstream adoption across Asia.

In Dubai, tokenized real estate pushed sales past $18B in May – proof that on‑chain ownership of physical assets is no longer science fiction.

Let's look at the three of the best altcoins in presale right now – each uniquely positioned to benefit from crypto-friendly regulation in Asia and real-world tokenization trends.

Crypto is having a global moment – and it's not just about price charts anymore.

In Asia, Japan just revised its Payment Services Act, tightening oversight while making space for crypto firms to register and operate more easily.

Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Dubai is setting records. The city saw over $18B in real estate sales in May alone, fueled in part by the rapid rise of tokenized property.

Instead of paperwork and middlemen, buyers can now invest using blockchain-based tokens – secure, traceable, and fast.

These two trends, regulatory clarity and real-world use cases, are no longer hypothetical. They're happening now. And they're fueling demand for presale projects that don't just promise innovation – they're built for it.

With the world turning to scalable crypto infrastructure, Solaxy ($SOLX) is stepping up as the first-ever Layer‑2 built on Solana, aiming to lead the next phase of blockchain evolution.

Designed to neutralize Solana's most pressing issues like network congestion, failed transactions, and scaling headaches, Solaxy also amplifies everything Solana does best. Including lightning speed and rock-bottom fees.

But Solaxy doesn't stop at Solana. With its native token $SOLX set to go multichain on both Ethereum and Solana, it bridges two of the biggest blockchain ecosystems.

That means access to Ethereum's deep DeFi liquidity and Solana's meme-coin explosion – all from one token.

It's no wonder the presale has already raised over $45.4M. But right now, you can still buy $SOLX for just $0.001748 per token.



Solaxy also democratizes high-frequency meme coin trading, giving regular users tools once reserved for sniper bots.

With only 8 days left in the presale, this is the final boarding call for what could be one of the best altcoins of the year.

As real-world tokenization gains ground, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is stepping into the spotlight as the first AI agent for content creation and premium Web3 platform.

At the time of writing, $SUBBD is in presale at $0.0556 and has already raised over $625K.

Here's how it works: creators can use AI tools to automate chats, upsell premium content, and even delegate video editing.

Fans can buy tokens to unlock gated content, tip creators, or even interact with AI-generated avatars approved by the original influencers themselves.



With over 250M followers across the platform and its affiliated brands, $SUBBD already has the reach to take off fast.

Price forecasts suggest $SUBBD could reach between $0.08 and $0.30 in 2025 – making it a standout among the new crypto projects with real-world use and upside.

Qubetics ($TICS) enters the scene as a full-fledged Layer‑1 blockchain built around real-world asset tokenization.

The platform connects Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana ecosystems, offering cross-chain access, transparency, and global reach – all while complying with local regulations.

The crypto presale is already turning heads: $TICS is currently trading at $0.33709673, and over $17.8M has been raised so far – proof there's serious institutional and retail interest.



With 38.5 % of the total supply allocated for presale, the launch is both well-funded and structured.

Qubetics stands out by reducing friction in real-world asset trading: instant settlements, low fees, and regulatory compliance make it easy to fractionalize expensive assets.

In a world where tokenization is moving from theory to practice, Qubetics offers a bridge between traditional assets and decentralized finance.

From Japan's crypto-friendly reforms to Dubai's tokenized real estate surge, adoption is accelerating.

Projects like Solaxy, SUBBD Token, and Qubetics are built for this moment – bridging regulation, utility, and innovation. Whether you're into utility or opportunity, these could be your best altcoins yet.

 Bitcoin traders eye key levels to hold and reclaim into the weekly close, but the chances of a major liquidity grab are growing. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is working on completing a “successful” support retest as trader bets increase prior to the weekly candle close.

BTC price volatility is expected as liquidity analysis shows that conditions favor a significant short squeeze.

$100,000 still remains a likely target in the event of a fresh price dip.

Bitcoin (BTC) held $105,500 toward the June 8 weekly close amid hopes that the BTC price correction was over.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD cementing its rebound after a trip to $100,500 on June 5.

Now almost back at its weekly open level, Bitcoin again inspired traders to bet on upside continuation and resumption of the bull run.

“On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support earlier today,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital told X followers while uploading a chart with key levels.

BTC price action had already achieved a daily close above its 10-day simple moving average (SMA) — something that fellow trader SuperBro had said was a prerequisite to “invalidate the bear case.”

$BTC still needs to reclaim the 10 MA and H&S neckline on a closing basis to invalidate the bear caseuntil then, this is not the place to get aggressive with longs, the time for that was the retest of the FVG and 50 MA, when you were so sure it was all over 😂 pic.twitter.com/TAEG3wZgOM

Trader Cas Abbe meanwhile looked to order book liquidity for cues over price direction. 

This was building both above and below spot price, leading Abbe to predict a magnet-style move to “grab” it.

“BTC liquidation cluster is now signalling an upside move,” he summarized on X. 

Abbe noted that negative funding rates pointed to “big short positions” appearing over the weekend.

“I think BTC big move is coming next week, possibly pushing it above $109K-$110K,” he concluded.

Some saw the potential for further support retests first.

Updating X followers on his market forecast, popular trader CrypNuevo saw the logical place to build long BTC positions at $100,000.

“100k is the strongest psychological support so, as explained on Sunday, it's the area where I'm building some longs with easy invalidation below it,” he wrote, referring to his previous aim of tagging the $100,000 mark.

Rekt Capital meanwhile described the support retest after May's all-time highs on weekly timeframes as “successful.”

“Can Bitcoin successfully confirm this retest with a Weekly Close above $104400 for what would be a 4th week in a row?” he queried.

Ethereum's recent price action on the 4-hour chart has led to the formation of a classic Head and Shoulders pattern that opens up the possibility of a deeper correction. After a relatively stable period around the $2,500 zone, Ethereum broke below a neckline support level as last week drew to a close. This raises the question of whether a bearish continuation is already in motion for the Ethereum price or if bulls still have a shot at regaining momentum in the new week.

Head & Shoulders Pattern Confirmed After Breakdown Below $2,480

The Head and Shoulders pattern, one of the most recognizable reversal formations in technical analysis, is now clearly visible on Ethereum's 4-hour candlestick chart. This chart and the technical outlook were first shared on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MelikaTrader94. The structure includes a left shoulder, a prominent head peaking above $2,700, and a right shoulder that topped near $2,650. The neckline, drawn around $2,480, was breached during Ethereum's recent pullback to $2,380. This, in turn, shifted the short-term outlook toward the bearish side.

After the break, Ethereum attempted to reclaim lost ground and is currently retesting the neckline area. This retest around $2,500 is significant, as a failure to push back above this level significantly would likely validate the bearish setup and cause the Ethereum price to reverse downwards toward the next support zone. 

According to the outlook from analyst MelikaTrader94, the price target from this Head and Shoulders breakdown before any notable rebound upward can occur lies between $2,200 and $2,250.

Bulls Must Reclaim $2,650 To Invalidate Bearish Setup

A confluence of factors supports the $2,200 region as a likely landing zone. Not only is this level consistent with the measured move of the Head and Shoulders pattern, but it also aligns with an order block on May 9 during Ethereum's rally above $2,000 at the time. This adds further technical relevance to the $2,200 to $2,250 range acting as a support zone.

However, the situation is not fully bearish yet. The path forward is clear but narrow for Ethereum bulls. The first step to invalidate the bearish setup is to reclaim the neckline around $2,500 decisively. Beyond that, breaking back above the right shoulder level around $2,650 would invalidate the Head and Shoulders pattern, and another pattern will most likely come into play. 

A successful bullish reclaim would not only nullify the bearish pattern but could also revive sentiment for another retest of the $2,700 to $2,800 zone, which corresponds to the peak of the head in the recently formed pattern. Until such a recovery occurs, the Ethereum price can quickly reverse downwards at any time.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,510.

The former chief executive of the software firm Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is doubling down on his massive price prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) as it continues to trade above the six-figure level.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitcoin firebrand Michael Saylor says that as institutions enter the top crypto asset by market cap, BTC should experience a supply shock and a surge in price.

“There's been a surge of Bitcoin treasury companies. There's like 100 public companies or more. They're holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet. And every single week, there's another announcement. I think that it used to be that we're focused on the halvings. 

But at this point, the entire natural supply of Bitcoin is only 450 Bitcoin available for sale every day. That's sort of about $45 – $50 million a day at this level. That is all being consumed by the Bitcoin treasury companies. And the Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are coming on strong. So I'm very bullish.” 

Saylor goes on to slightly upgrade his price prediction for the flagship digital asset, noting that he believes it will outpace other key asset classes, such as real estate and the S&P 500.

“My forecast in July of last year in Nashville was Bitcoin's going to appreciate 29% a year on average for the next 21 years. And that moves it from it was about mid $60s, $65,000 to $13 million a coin in the year 2045. I'm getting more bullish on that forecast, but I'm certainly comfortable forecasting 30% a year ARR (annual recurring revenue) on average for the next 20 years.

 I think Bitcoin's up 57% a year for the past four and a half years. Again, that's double the Mag seven. That's quadruple the S&P. That's eight times real estate and bonds are down 4%. So Bitcoin is smashing everything.”

Strategy is currently the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, coming in at 580,955 BTC worth just over $61.3 billion, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.

Bitcoin is trading for $105,431 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

Key Points

Ethereum's native token could bounce back after a challenging year.

Ether (ETH 0.62%), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, lost more than 30% of its value over the past 12 months. Its first spot-price ETFs were approved last July, but those funds didn't attract as much attention as Bitcoin's (BTC 0.72%) earlier ETFs.

Instead, Ether seemed to be held back by concerns about competition from newer and faster blockchains, its slowing network activity, and the Trump Administration's unpredictable tariffs. Nevertheless, some investors remain fiercely bullish on Ether's future. One of those bulls is ARK Invest's Cathie Wood, who believes Ether's price could reach $166,000 by 2032.

That would represent a gain of nearly 6,220% and boost its market cap to more than $20 trillion. Bitcoin, which Wood is also bullish on, currently has a market cap of $2 trillion. Could Ether skyrocket to those levels, or should investors maintain more realistic expectations?

Ethereum originally ran on a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism like Bitcoin. This meant it needed to be mined by GPUs or other chips.

But in 2022, Ethereum transitioned to the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, which was roughly 99% more power efficient than the PoW mechanism. So instead of being mined, Ether is now staked (or locked up for rewards) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethereum's transformation into a PoS blockchain also enabled it to support smart contracts, which are used to develop decentralized apps (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other crypto assets. Bitcoin's PoW blockchain doesn't support smart contracts.

Therefore, Ether's value is often linked to Ethereum's popularity as a development platform. Bitcoin is still valued by its scarcity and limited supply -- since 19.6 million of its maximum supply of 21 million tokens have already been mined.

Ether doesn't have a fixed maximum supply, but its overall supply declines when its network activity rises. That's because a portion of every transaction fee in Ether is burned. But when Ethereum's network activity slows down, its supply rises as more Ether tokens are created than burned.

So while Bitcoin is always deflationary, Ether can be both inflationary and deflationary. But to remain a popular platform for developers and investors, it needs to keep providing fast transaction times with low fees.

That's becoming increasingly difficult as faster and cheaper PoS blockchains like Solana and Cardano challenge Ethereum. Solana processes transactions much faster than Ethereum, while Cardano usually offers lower fees.

Ether's next big upgrade -- The Verge -- aims to upgrade its security features and lower its hardware requirements so it can run on smaller devices like smartphones, wearables, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It also aims to reduce its off-chain Layer 2 (L2) fees with a series of upgrades for its network to clear more space for fresh data. Those upgrades could help it indirectly reduce its congestion issues by absorbing some of its core Layer 1 (L1) network traffic.

Assuming those upgrades bring in more developers and investors, its network activity will increase, reduce its supply, and stabilize Ether's price. Another potential catalyst would be the approval of new spot-price ETFs with staking features.

The first batch of Ether's spot-price ETFs only held Ether in cold storage and didn't pass on any of its interest-like staking rewards. The next batch could pass on those rewards (about 3% to 5% annually) and make them more appealing.

However, Ether could still be held back by competition from other PoS blockchains, a lack of approvals for new ETFs with staking rewards, or the messy macro environment that is curbing the market's appetite for cryptocurrencies and other speculative investments.

Wood believes Ether's value will rise as Ethereum becomes a foundational layer of a new digital financial ecosystem that challenges traditional banks with decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, NFTs, and tokenized versions of real-world assets.

She also expects Ether's staking yield to become more appealing than the yields of U.S. Treasuries as interest rates decline, and for the approvals of new staking ETFs to bring in even more institutional investors. Just as with Bitcoin, Wood expects the growing institutional adoption of Ether over the next few years to drive its price a lot higher.

That thesis sounds reasonable, but claiming it could reach a $20 trillion market cap within the next seven years -- compared to gold's current market cap of $3.4 trillion -- seems too bullish.

So while it might be smart to accumulate Ether as it rolls out new networking upgrades, attracts more developers, burns more tokens, and gains more attention with new ETFs, we should take Cathie Wood's forecasts with a grain of salt. It will probably stabilize and rise higher, but its long-term value isn't that easy to gauge.

Crypto World News

June 8, 2025 by Paul Adedoyin 

The number of Ethereum staked has reached an impressive level of 32.8 million. This is the biggest quantity ever for it and it means that more than $100 billion worth of ETH is not circulating anymore.

Crypto expert Merlijn The Trader pointed this development out on June 7, 2025. He said that while many people are still focused on meme coins and risky bets, big investors, often called “smart money”, are quietly buying and locking up Ethereum.

He believes this rise in staking is being missed by most of the crypto world and warned people not to ignore.

A chart shared with his post shows a steady and strong increase in staked ETH. Many people believe in Ethereum's progress and are therefore opting to invest rather than simply trade, which explains why the price has kept increasing.

Also, CryptoQuant reported a big drop in the amount of Ethereum being moved to exchanges between June 6 and June 7.

On June 6, over 900,000 ETH were sent to exchanges. But by June 7, that number had dropped sharply to about 173,200 ETH. Usually, when more ETH is sent to exchanges, it means people might be getting ready to sell.

This sudden drop suggests fewer people are looking to sell, which fits with the trend of more ETH being staked for the long term. Interestingly, fewer people are sending Ethereum to exchanges at the same time its price has gone up to about $2,490. 

Many factors can affect price, but when less ETH is available on exchanges and more is being staked, it usually means investors are choosing to hold instead of selling. This often helps support higher prices in the future.

 The Bitcoin community is divided after core developers released a joint statement on transaction relay policy and use cases amid the ongoing OP_RETURN debate. 

A collective statement from 31 Bitcoin core developers has sparked a global debate among Bitcoiners after suggesting a hands-off approach to how the Bitcoin network is used, amid ongoing controversy over non-monetary use cases.

“This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on,” the June 6 statement published on the Bitcoin Core website said.

The letter argued that Bitcoin (BTC) is a network “defined by its users” and that its core contributors are “not in a position” to mandate what software or policies they desire. It comes amid the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network.

“Being free to run any software is the network's primary safeguard against coercion,” it added.

While many Bitcoiners supported the letter with an “ACK” comment, others objected.

JAN3 CEO Samson Mow criticized the tone of the letter on the same day. He said, “It's disingenuous to just say “it is what it is now, too bad.”

“Bitcoin Core devs have been changing the network gradually to enable spam and now seem focused on also removing barriers for spammers,” Mow said. “This statement itself is also inappropriate,” he added.

On May 8, Bitcoin Core developers decided to remove a long-standing limit on transaction data in a network upgrade to allow for larger data segments, which some Bitcoiners saw as opening the door to non-financial use cases.

However, Casa founder Jameson Lopp defended the letter. Lopp said, “Core Devs are a group saying we can't force anyone to run code they don't like; here is our thinking on relay policy and network health.”

“When there was no cohesive message, and it was just a bunch of independent developers making individual statements, Bitcoin Core was accused of having “poor public relations,” Lopp said, adding:

The developers argued in the letter that it is better for the Bitcoin node software “to aim to have a realistic idea of what will end up in the next block, rather than attempting to intervene between consenting transaction creators and miners to discourage activity that is largely harmless at a technical level.” It added:

Bitcoiner Carl Horton said, “It's Bit “Coin” not Bit “Bucket” or Bit “Store” or whatever general purpose data store you have in mind. It's a “peer to peer electronic cash system.”  

Meanwhile, Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr criticized the goals of the transaction relay policy outlined in the statement. “The goals of transaction relay listed are basically all wrong,” Dashjr said. 

“Predicting what will be mined is a centralizing goal. Expecting spam to be mined is defeatism. Helping spam propagate is harmful,” Dashjr said.

The developers said the main goals of transaction relay are predicting what Bitcoin transactions will be mined, “speeding up block propagation” for the transactions expected to be mined, and helping Bitcoin miners learn about fee-paying transactions.

Blood clots can form in both arteries and veins. However, the reasons behind them differ, as do the consequences and the chances of preventing blood clots. In Sweden, almost half of all cases of venous thrombosis have a genetic explanation. A team of researchers from Lund University in Sweden has now discovered three gene variants that increase the risk of blood clots in the leg by up to 180 percent.

There is a difference between arterial and venous blood clots. Blood clots in the arteries form when plaque in calcified vessels bursts and the body perceives it as an injury. This activates the platelets, which clump together and form a clot. In the worst case, it can lead to a stroke or heart attack. A venous thrombus, on the other hand, usually forms in the leg when the blood stagnates for too long. This can activate the body's coagulation system, allowing the clotting system to be activated and the blood to clot, blocking blood flow. If the clot breaks loose and travels with the blood to the lungs, it can lead to pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition.

"Venous thrombosis is in fact one of the most common causes of death in the world. It is a common disease that has always been somewhat overshadowed by arterial blood clots," says Bengt Zöller, a specialist in general medicine at Skåne University Hospital and professor of general medicine at Lund University.

In Sweden, more than 10,000 people suffer from venous thromboembolism each year and that number appears to be increasing. Several factors are contributing to this increase. One of the strongest risk factors is age, and as the number of older people in Sweden grows, the number of clots is also increasing. Ten per cent of 80-year-olds experience a blood clot at some point. The risk also increases if you are overweight or tall.

"The muscles control the blood flow in the veins and the legs become like columns of fluid where the force of gravity is strong. Too much sedentary and inactive behaviour, then, is harmful. Only the valves of the veins prevent backflow and if these are damaged, the risk of blood clots can increase. Therefore, tall people are more prone to blood clots, as their larger veins provide less blood flow, combined with the fact that blood must travel a greater distance back to the heart."

Because the heart pumps blood out into the arteries, there is much higher blood pressure in the arteries than in the veins, which can contribute to atherosclerosis. High blood pressure, high levels of blood lipids and smoking are all risk factors for atherosclerosis of the arteries. But because the veins are a low-pressure system, the vessels do not become atherosclerotic. Therefore, neither high blood pressure nor blood lipids are associated with venous clots and smoking is considered only a weak to moderate risk factor. Being overweight, on the other hand, is a very significant culprit. Obesity has a negative impact on venous circulation, especially when combined with the fact that overweight people are often less active. Some clotting factors are also affected by obesity.

"In terms of diet, there are fewer studies, but ultra-processed foods have been associated with a slightly increased risk of blood clots, and plant-based, healthy foods with a reduced risk. In our studies, we have also seen that commercial fishermen have a lower risk, which may be due to a higher omega-3 content in their diet."

There are also specific situations in which the risk of venous blood clots is particularly high. The risk of blood clots increases when blood flow is reduced, such as when travelling by air for long periods of time or when lying in bed for several days. Surgery or inflammation that damages the vessel wall can also lead to an increased tendency to clot. Particularly during pregnancy, blood clotting factors increase and levels of some protective proteins may decrease.

"In these risk situations, prophylaxis in the form of blood thinners may be particularly important if other risk factors are also present."

Other risk factors are the genetic variants that affect different parts of the blood's clotting ability. In Sweden, we have a high prevalence of APC (activated protein C) resistance due to an inherited mutation in the gene for coagulation factor V, called Factor V Leiden. About 10 per cent of Swedes have this mutation, which is considered the most common coagulation mutation among Indo-Europeans.

"Evolutionarily, bleeding less has been an advantage, but in our modern, sedentary society, APC resistance is becoming a risk factor."

Bengt Zöller and his fellow researchers have now identified the strongest genetic risk factor since Factor V Leiden was discovered. They used data from the population-based Malmö Kost Cancer study, involving 30,000 Malmö residents. By selecting 27 genes previously associated with clotting disorders, they found three variants that, when taken together, were as significant a risk factor for venous blood clots as Factor V Leiden: ABO, F8, and VWF each increased the risk of venous blood clots by 10 to 30 percent.

"And the more of these variants a person has - the higher the risk. An individual with five of these gene variants has a 180 per cent higher risk of venous thrombosis. Unlike Factor V Leiden, which is only found in Indo-Europeans, these three different mutations are found in between five and fifty per cent of various populations around the globe."

As these genetic variants are present in all populations, the next step is to investigate how the number of risk genes affects the duration of treatment with anticoagulants after a blood clot.

"I think tailoring treatment based on risk assessment will become increasingly important," concludes Bengt Zöller.

What you can do to prevent blood clots: 

Blood clot 

A blood clot consists of coagulated blood that has become lodged in a blood vessel. Clots can form either in the oxygen-rich blood in the body's arteries as it is pumped out of the heart, or in the low-oxygen blood in the veins (usually in the legs) as it is returned to the lungs and heart.

Have the canines acquired strange mutations living near the power plant?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor in northern Ukraine—then part of the Soviet Union—exploded, sending a massive plume of radiation into the sky. Nearly four decades later, the Chernobyl Power Plant and many parts of the surrounding area remain uninhabited—by humans, at least.

Animals of all kinds have thrived in humanity's absence. Living among radiation-resistant fauna are thousands of feral dogs, many of whom are descendants of pets left behind in the speedy evacuation of the area so many years ago. As the world's greatest nuclear disaster approaches its 40th anniversary, biologists are now taking a closer look at the animals located inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), which is about the size of Yosemite National Park, and investigating how decades of radiation exposure may have altered animals' genomes—and even, possibly, sped up evolution.

Scientists from the University of South Carolina and the National Human Genome Research Institute have begun examining the DNA of 302 feral dogs found in or around the CEZ to better understand how radiation may have altered their genomes. Their results were published in the journal Science Advances.

“Do they have mutations that they've acquired that allow them to live and breed successfully in this region?” co-author Elaine Ostrander, a dog genomics expert at the National Human Genome Research Institute, told The New York Times. “What challenges do they face and how have they coped genetically?”

The idea of radiation speeding up natural evolution isn't a new one. The practice of purposefully irradiating seeds in outer space to induce advantageous mutations, for example, is now a well-worn method for developing crops that are well-suited for a warming world.

Scientists have been analyzing certain animals living within the CEZ for years, including bacteria, rodents, and even birds. One study back in 2016 found that Eastern tree frogs (Hyla orientalis), which are usually a green color, were more commonly black within the CEZ. The biologists theorize that the frogs experienced a beneficial mutation in melanin—pigments responsible for skin color—that helped dissipate and neutralize some of the surrounding radiation.

This made scientists ponder: could something similar be happening to Chernobyl's wild dogs?

The study uncovered that the feral dogs living near the Chernobyl Power Plant showed distinct genetic differences from dogs living only some 10 miles away in nearby Chernobyl City. While this may seem to heavily imply that these dogs have undergone some type of rapid mutation or evolution due to radiation exposure, this study is only a first step in proving that hypothesis. 

One environmental scientist, speaking with Science News, says that these studies can be tricky business, largely due to the fact that sussing out radiation-induced mutations from other effects, like inbreeding, is incredibly difficult.

However, this study provides a template for further investigation into the effects of radiation on larger mammals, as the DNA of dogs roaming the Chernobyl Power Plant and nearby Chernobyl City can be compared to dogs living in non-irradiated areas. Despite a current lack of firm conclusions, the study has shown once again that an area that—by all rights—should be a wasteland has become an unparalleled scientific opportunity to understand radiation and its impact on natural evolution.

Researchers have developed a laboratory earthquake model that connects the microscopic real contact area between fault surfaces to the possibility of earthquake occurrences. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, this breakthrough demonstrates the connection between microscopic friction and earthquakes, offering new insights into earthquake mechanics and potential prediction.

"We've essentially opened a window into the heart of earthquake mechanics," said Sylvain Barbot, associate professor of earth sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and principal investigator of the study. "By watching how the real contact area between fault surfaces evolves during the earthquake cycle, we can now explain both the slow buildup of stress in faults and the rapid rupture that follows. Down the road, this could lead to new approaches for monitoring and predicting earthquake nucleation at early stages."

For decades, scientists have relied on empirical "rate-and-state" friction laws to model earthquakes -- mathematical descriptions that work well but don't explain the underlying physical mechanisms. "Our model reveals what's actually happening at the fault interface during an earthquake cycle."

Barbot says the discovery is a deceptively simple concept: "When two rough surfaces slide against each other, they only make contact at minuscule, isolated junctions covering a fraction of the total surface area." This "real area of contact" -- invisible to the eye but measurable through optical techniques -- turns out to be the key state variable that controls earthquake behavior.

Laboratory earthquakes: Lighting earthquakes in real time

The study utilizes transparent acrylic materials that allowed the researchers to literally watch earthquake ruptures unfold in real time. Using high-speed cameras and optical measurements, the team tracked how LED light transmission changed as contact junctions formed, grew and were destroyed during laboratory earthquakes.

"We can literally watch the contact area evolve as ruptures propagate," Barbot said. "During fast ruptures, we see approximately 30% of the contact area disappear in milliseconds -- a dramatic weakening that drives the earthquake."

The laboratory results revealed a previously hidden relationship: The empirical "state variable" used in standard earthquake models for decades represents the real area of contact between fault surfaces. This discovery provides the first physical interpretation of a mathematical concept that has been central to earthquake science since the 1970s.

From simulation to prediction

The researchers analyzed 26 different simulated earthquake scenarios and found that the relationship between rupture speed and fracture energy follows the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The team's computer simulations successfully reproduced both slow and fast laboratory earthquakes, matching not only the rupture speeds and stress drops but also the amount of light transmitted across the fault interface during ruptures.

As contact areas change during the earthquake cycle, they affect multiple measurable properties including electrical conductivity, hydraulic permeability and seismic wave transmission. Since the real area of contact affects multiple physical properties of fault zones, continuous monitoring of these proxies during earthquake cycles could provide new insights into fault behavior.

The implications extend far beyond academic understanding and laboratory experiments. The research suggests that monitoring the physical state of fault contacts could provide new tools for earthquake short-term systems and potentially for reliable earthquake prediction using the electric conductivity of the fault.

"If we can monitor these properties continuously on natural faults, we might detect the early stages of earthquake nucleation," Barbot explained. "This could lead to new approaches for monitoring earthquake nucleation at early stages, well before seismic waves are radiated."

Looking ahead

The researchers plan to scale up their findings outside controlled laboratory conditions. Barbot explained: The study's model provides the physical foundation for understanding how fault properties evolve during seismic cycles.

"Imagine a future where we can detect subtle changes in fault conditions before an earthquake strikes," Barbot said. "That's the long-term potential of this work."

About the study

In addition to Barbot, Baoning Wu, formerly at USC and now at the University of California, San Diego, authored the study.

The study was supported by National Science Foundation award number EAR-1848192 and the Statewide California Earthquake Center proposal number 22105.

In the Mission: Impossible films, superspy Ethan Hunt -- played by Tom Cruise -- gets orders from his superiors on various devices that self-destruct in five seconds.

Could electronics disintegrate into nothing in real life? Binghamton University Professor Seokheun "Sean" Choi has researched disposable "papertronics" over the past 20 years, but the hardest part about making so-called transient electronics is the battery.

"Transient electronics can be used for biomedical and environmental applications, but they must disintegrate in a biosafe manner," said Choi, a faculty member at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

"You don't want to have toxic residues inside your body. That type of device is called bioresorbable electronics. For transient or bioresorbable electronics, the key challenge is the power source -- but most power sources, like lithium-ion batteries, include toxic material."

Choi and his student research team took lessons from their previous research into biobatteries and applied that knowledge to a new idea: In a paper recently published in the journal Small, they show the potential of using probiotics -- live microorganisms that offer health benefits when ingested but are otherwise harmless to the environment or humans.

Maedeh Mohammadifar, PhD '20, a graduate of Choi's Bioelectronics and Microsystems Lab, developed the original dissolvable microbial fuel cell during her time as a Binghamton student.

"We used well-known electricity-producing bacteria, which is within biosafety level 1, so it is safe -- but we were not sure what would happen if these bacteria were released into nature," Choi said. "But whenever I made presentations at conferences, people would ask: 'So, you are using bacteria? Can we safely use that?'"

Current PhD student Maryam Rezaie led the latest research using a premade blend of 15 probiotics.

"It's well documented that probiotics are safe and biocompatible, but we were not sure if those probiotics have electricity-producing capability," Choi said. "There was a question, so she did a lot of experiments on that."

Early results proved unpromising, he added, but "we didn't give up. We engineered in an electrode surface that might be preferable to the bacteria, using polymer and some nanoparticles to hypothetically improve the electrocatalytic behavior of probiotics and give them a boost."

The modified electrode was porous and rough, which offered excellent conditions for bacteria to attach and grow, and that improved the microorganisms' electrogenic capability. Coating the dissolvable paper with a low pH-sensitive polymer -- meaning that it will work only in an acidic environment like a polluted area or the human digestive system -- increased the voltage output and the duration that the battery operated.

Although they produced only a small amount of power, Choi looks at the experiments as a proof of concept for him and future students to build on.

"Other research must be done," he said. "We used probiotic blends, but I want to study individually which ones have the extra electric genes, and how synergistic interactions can improve the power generation. Also, in this research we developed in a single unit of a biobattery. I want to contact them in series or parallel to improve the power."

When DNA breaks inside the cell, it can spell disaster, especially if the damage occurs in areas of the genome that are difficult to repair. Now, scientists Irene Chiolo and Chiara Merigliano at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences have discovered that a protein called Nup98, long known for helping traffic molecules in and out of the cell's nucleus, plays another surprising role: guiding the cell's most delicate repairs and reducing the risk of genetic mistakes that can lead to cancer. Their findings were published in Molecular Cell.

With support from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the American Cancer Society, the researchers revealed that Nup98 forms droplet-like structures deep inside the nucleus. These "condensates" act as protective bubbles around broken strands of DNA in areas called heterochromatin -- zones where the genetic material is so tightly packed that making accurate repairs is especially challenging.

Heterochromatin -- a major focus of Chiolo's research -- is filled with repeated DNA sequences, making it easy for the cell to confuse one stretch for another. Nup98's droplets help lift the damaged section out of that dense zone and create a safer space where it can be repaired accurately, reducing the chance of genetic mix-ups that could lead to cancer.

The researchers also found that Nup98 helps mobilize the damaged site in tightly packed heterochromatin, so it can reach a different part of the nucleus where repair is safer.

Coordinating the repair crew

Timing is everything when it comes to DNA repair, and one of Nup98's most important roles is knowing when to say, "Not yet."

The protein's droplet-like condensates act as a temporary shield around damaged DNA, keeping out certain repair proteins that can cause trouble if they arrive too soon. One of those proteins, called Rad51, can accidentally stitch together the wrong pieces of DNA if it gets involved too early in the process.

"The Nup98 droplets keep Rad51 away until other mechanisms have done their work to line up the correct pieces," Chiolo said. "Only once the damaged heterochromatin moves into a different nuclear space, Rad51 can safely finish the repair."

By coordinating this carefully staged process, Nup98 helps cells avoid dangerous genetic rearrangements -- a key part of maintaining genome stability and slowing processes responsible for cancer and aging.

Implications for cancer and therapy

Although the researchers studied cells of fruit flies, the insights gained can help explain how similar DNA repair mechanisms work in humans. Many DNA repair mechanisms in fruit flies are shared across species, making them a powerful model for understanding genome stability.

The Nup98 discovery could have real-world impact, especially for diseases like acute myeloid leukemia, where mutations in Nup98 are known to play a role. By elucidating how Nup98 guides DNA repair, scientists hope to uncover why its mutations are so dangerous -- and how to harness the mutations to disrupt cancer cells in targeted treatments.

"Eventually, we may also be able to turn Nup98 mutations that lead to cancer, especially acute myeloid leukemia, into treatment targets -- either by specifically disrupting the cells carrying the mutation or by inactivating the harmful functions of the mutated proteins," Merigliano said.

The team also sees long-term potential for therapies that could enhance or mimic Nup98's protective functions, reducing the risk of genome instability, which is a major factor not only in cancer, but also in aging and other genome instability disorders.

The feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump seems to have gone from a full boil to a simmer over the weekend, but don't rule out the possibility of the heat getting turned up again. In a conversation with NBC News, Trump said he has no interest in making nice with Musk right now, but did make it clear that if the billionaire decides to switch parties and back Democratic candidates, “he'll have to pay consequences for that.”

Trump being Trump, he didn't explain what those potential retaliatory actions might be, just told NBC they will be “very serious consequences.” Of course, it's not terribly hard to imagine the levers Trump might pull. He has already threatened to cancel the billions of dollars worth of government contracts that Musk's companies currently count on, and his close ally and former advisor, Steve Bannon, has encouraged Trump to investigate Musk as an “illegal alien,” deport him, and seize control of his companies under the Defense Production Act. So, he's got some ideas to work with.

Trump's threat of action against Musk certainly feels like a line drawn in the sand, but the President has otherwise not really escalated the beef since Musk threw the kitchen sink at him. In a series of now-deleted posts, Musk claimed that Trump appears in the Epstein files and has been withholding information in order to protect himself and supported the idea of impeaching the president whom he spent nearly $300 million trying to get into office. Musk took those posts down, but has continued to be critical of Trump.

Trump rebuked the attacks in his conversation with NBC, calling the Epstein angle “old news” and that he had “nothing to do with” Epstein. “That's called ‘old news,' that's been old news, that has been talked about for years,” he said.

Other than that, Trump has basically just decided to wash his hands of Musk—at least for the time being. When asked if his relationship with the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is over, Trump told NBC, “I would assume so, yeah.” He also reiterated that he has no intention of speaking with Musk directly and said, “I'm too busy doing other things” and “I have no intention of speaking to him.”

That remains pretty mild for a guy who is certainly capable of being a bomb thrower, but Trump might have a sense that he will come off better by easing off after Musk flew off the handle. A YouGov poll found that among Republicans, 71% would take his side compared to just 6% who said they would throw their backing behind Musk. Even if you expand the survey sample to include Democrats and Independents, Trump comes out ahead with 28% of support compared to just 8% for Musk (though notably, 52% said “Neither,” so the “a pox on both your houses” demographic is strong).

Politico reported Sunday that aides representing both sides have spoken, and there is something of a mutual truce at the moment to stop the bomb-throwing—though it noted that neither Musk nor Trump wanted to stop. Seems like they are locked in a battle of restraint at the moment, which is not exactly a skill either of them is known to possess. We'll see who breaks the truce first.

Retro tech tuber Perifractic has released an intriguing video dubbed Can We Save Commodore? My Biggest Project Yet! During the video, we hear that the reason for the channel host's recent absence is rather dramatic – he is attempting to buy Commodore, and thus bring it back into the hands of its fans. Ultimately, this will mean a whole host of new Commodore branded and ‘chicken head' logo-bearing products that the community believes pass muster to be worthy of the official marque.

The above video at Retro Recipes is just part 1 of a series, and ends with a very big tease. Nevertheless, it is pretty interesting for retro fans to hear about the chance of a beloved brand of old being rejuvenated – and not just for a cash grab (fingers crossed).

After an intro, a brief history of Commodore, and talk about the achievements of the retro community up to this point, Perifractic starts to outline his plan. The blockbuster success with his earlier passion project, the Commodore 64x PC, inspired the retro tech tuber to believe that “the love is definitely still there for the brand and for new Commodore computers.”

Starting to outline the plan, Perifractic explains that to begin, efforts should be made to “negotiate an exclusive license with Commodore.” This would honor the company legacy, deliver fairer pricing for the community, and provide QC-tested branded Commodore machines, official upgrades, and official replacement parts.

Next, the video broached the potentially thorny issue of funding in situations like this where crowdfunding isn't possible. The current owners of Commodore Corporation B.V. aren't going to give away licenses or the brand for peanuts. Thus, Perifractic directs viewers of the video to an outreach form, and asks angel investors to get in touch. Don't worry about checking out the form, all it does is give Retro Recipes a way to get in touch about updates. However, you can also use parts of the form to indicate if you are interested in any investments, partnerships, licensing, or other business matters.

‘The Plan' video chapter suggests that the goal was to negotiate a great community licensing program, where the community pays a modest flat 6.4% to use the brand for products that pass QC.



Right at the end of the video, there is a twist that may raise the graying eyebrows of Commodore fans around the globe. Perifractic reveals that he received a message direct from Commodore Corporation B.V. that states “yes we can grant you an exclusive license, but your team seems to know Commodore better than we do, we might like to sell you the whole company.”

Roborock has established itself as a premium brand within the robot vacuum space with most of its newer models now being offered at more than $1,000 and even some of its best-selling models being above $2,000. Despite this move towards luxury pricing, there are still fantastic deals to be found on units that are feature-rich and incredibly competent—products that were new two years ago and that are still leading the pack in home automation.

Roborock Qrevo S is a great case in point, and it offers performance and ease of use equal to far more expensive options. Now, Amazon is offering the Qrevo S for an all-time low of only $459 which is a whopping 43% off its standard $799 list price. It's a bargain that's hard to resist if you're seeking premium cleaning power on a budget.

See at Amazon

The multi-functional docking station excels with a very hands-off experience for users: the dock automatically washes and dries the mop pads with hot air but it also cleans the robot's dustbin without assistance and refills its water tank as well with the capability to constantly mop areas measuring up to 4,305 square feet. That's seven weeks of hassle-free cleaning with the only upkeep required being the occasional draining of the dock's larger water and dust reservoirs.

Its heavy-duty 7,000 Pa suction power is one of the strongest available on the market, and it is capable of pulling hair, dirt and dust out from deeply embedded carpets and hardwood and tile crevices. Its multi-directional floating brush minimizes hair tangling for continuous cleaning effectiveness even in pet- or long-haired-resident households. The vacuum comes with a cutting-edge 10mm auto mop raise mechanism which allows it to seamlessly transition between vacuuming carpets and mopping hard floors without leaving wet marks or dirty streaks.

The performance in terms of mopping is equally impressive courtesy of dynamic dual spinning mops that work at a rate of 200 RPM. Combined with 30 adjustable levels of water flow, these mops allow you to customize cleaning intensity for different floor types remotely from the app. You enjoy spotless and streak-free floors that gleam like a pro after every pass. The Qrevo S comes equipped with advanced obstacle avoidance technology powered by PreciSense LiDAR navigation and 3D mapping.

At its all-time low price on Amazon, the Qrevo S offers an incredible value proposition.

At the core of the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses lies the ability to shoot life from your perspective: The newly designed ultra-wide 12 MP camera enables you to shoot high-quality photos and videos with the voice command or the discreet button tap. The five-mic array delivers clear audio whether recording a video, taking a hands-free call, or communicating with Meta AI. You can even livestream directly to Facebook and Instagram, and take your friends and followers along in the moment.

Most impressive is the addition of Meta AI which makes these spectacles a wearable personal assistant: Activated, Meta AI can scan your surroundings and make contextually appropriate suggestions to help you stay on top of things and in the loop during the day. Of special mention is the live translation feature supporting real-time translations between French, Italian, Spanish, and English without relying on Wi-Fi.

Style and comfort are not overlooked: Both the Skyler and Wayfarer models bear the traditional Ray-Ban style so you'll be looking good when you wear them. The frames are light for wearing all day, and the lenses are available in a variety of options to correct your eyesight.

There was palpable excitement around Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) last year. The company was about to unveil its AI capabilities, with the tech world expecting the company to unveil an AI platform capable of competing with Google and OpenAI. The demos Apple showed off at the time were compelling, but the follow-through has been underwhelming, leaving both developers and consumers wanting more.

Apple's broader struggles with AI have become clearer over the past year. Its ambitions around personalized intelligence have faced delays, and its rollout of new tools has been inconsistent. The vision that Apple sold in 2024 — a seamless blend of on-device AI, revamped Siri interactions, and powerful new developer capabilities — has yet to materialize in full.

Apple Intelligence features saw a staggered rollout that came with several hiccups. The personalized version of Siri that was showcased last year has been delayed, which matters because Apple framed the new Siri as a cornerstone of its AI strategy — a context-aware assistant that could understand user behavior across apps. Without it, the company's AI value proposition looks surprisingly thin.

This also meant that developers couldn't take full advantage of the new AI-powered Siri, and users couldn't rely on the assistant to perform in-app actions as promised. For developers, that's a lost opportunity to build more interactive, intelligent app experiences. For consumers, it's another promise unfulfilled. And for Apple, it raises concerns about how competitive its AI stack really is compared to its increasingly powerful rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft.

With WWDC 2025 now just around the corner, expectations for consumer-facing Apple Intelligence features are more cautious than last year. Most developers and analysts are now hoping for incremental improvements: smoother integration of AI into native apps, and tools that empower developers to actually use the AI that Apple is building. (No one is expecting much on the Siri front.)

One of Apple's best opportunities lies in enabling AI-assisted app development. The rise of tools like Cursor, Replit, and Bolt.new has made code generation a whole lot easier, helping developers, and even non-developers, bring products to life faster. 

AI-powered apps have found the web an effective distribution platform. ChatGPT, for instance, gained massive traction on the web before launching native apps for iOS and Android. At the same time, tools like WordPress, Hostinger, Canva, and Figma now let non-technical users create simple apps using natural language prompts. Apple needs to modernize here, too.

Ideally, new AI tooling should allow more developers to create apps and post them on the App Store. That would enrich the iOS app ecosystem and open up new revenue opportunities for Apple, which is even more critical now that some of its App Store income is under threat.

Apple has made some announcements, but many have yet to materialize. Swift Assist, a coding assistant for Xcode, was shown off last year but hasn't seen wide release. Apple is also reportedly working on an Anthropic-powered AI coding tool and plans to open access to its own AI models for developers. The goal is to lower the barrier for building iOS apps, both for pros and newcomers.

However, there are two things to consider: the web's dominance as an application distribution platform and new regulations that bar Apple from charging fees in the U.S. for payments outside the app.

The second part is a particularly big deal. In April, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers asked Apple to remove restrictions around linking to outside payment methods for digital purchases in apps for the U.S. App Store. More importantly, the ruling also barred Apple from charging any fees for these kinds of payments. On Wednesday, a U.S. court rejected Apple's appeal to put a stay on the ruling.

This means developers will encourage customers to purchase subscriptions and add-ons outside the App Store, also possibly at a discounted rate compared with their App Store prices. 

This ruling could also spur other regulators to put similar pressure on Apple and cull App Store fees for third-party payments. Earlier this week, Apple reported that it generated $1.3 trillion in billings and sales in 2024, with 90% of that value generation happening without paying Apple a commission. But even some percentage of the remaining $130 billion means many billions in revenue for the company.

Amid all this, Apple needs to reassert the value of its ecosystem. It's not clear if Apple will cut its commissions, but it will be interesting to see what kind of App Store features the company launches to make native iOS apps a more lucrative avenue for developers.

As WWDC 2025 approaches, Apple is in the unusual position of having to share a better story. Its AI ambitions are being challenged not only by faster-moving competitors but also by changing legal and economic realities. To succeed, Apple has to demonstrate that it can deliver on AI, for end users and the developers who power its ecosystem. Especially in a world where AI accelerates everything, Apple can't afford to lag behind.

NASA engineers have spent the past decade developing a rugged, partially autonomous lander designed to explore Europa, one of Jupiter's most intriguing moons. The space agency got cold feet over the project, but engineers are now targeting a new destination for the probe: Enceladus.

Europa has long been a prime target in the search for extraterrestrial biology because scientists suspect it harbors a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, potentially teeming with microbial life. But the robot—packed with radiation shielding, cutting-edge software, and ice-drilling appendages—won't be going anywhere anytime soon.

In a recent paper in Science Robotics, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) outlined the design and testing of what was once the Europa Lander prototype, a four-legged robotic explorer built to survive the brutal surface conditions of the Jovian moon. The robot was designed to walk—as opposed to roll—analyze terrain, collect samples, and drill into Europa's icy crust—all with minimal guidance from Earth, due to the major communication lag between our planet and the moon 568 million miles (914 million kilometers) away.

Designed to operate autonomously for hours at a time, the bot came equipped with stereoscopic cameras, a robotic arm, LED lights, and a suite of specialized materials tough enough to endure harsh radiation and bone-chilling cold. Temperatures on the moon range from about -210 degrees Fahrenheit (-134 degrees Celsius) at its equator to as low as -370 degrees F (-223 degrees C) at its poles.

After years of development—including testing in JPL's labs, advanced simulations, and a final field trial on icy terrain in Alaska—the Europa Lander aced its tests. It was ready to take on the solar system's frosty frontier. But the space agency has now pulled the plug on the mission.

According to the team, the challenges of getting to Europa—its radiation exposure, immense distance, and short observation windows—proved too daunting for NASA's higher-ups. And that's before you take into consideration the devastating budget cuts planned by the Trump administration, which would see the agency's funding fall from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion. The lander, once the centerpiece of a bold astrobiology initiative, is now essentially mothballed.

But the engineers aren't giving up. They're now lobbying for the robot to get a second shot—on Enceladus, Saturn's ice-covered moon, which also boasts a subsurface ocean and has proven more favorable for robotic exploration. Enceladus is still frigid, but has lower radiation and better access windows than Europa.

Whether the ice-walker gets a new lease on its semi-autonomous life remains to be seen. But the robot was built for a moonwalk—albeit a relatively rigid and clanky one—and it deserves its moment.

This will reduce e-waste while making edge devices more accessible and affordable.

Researchers from the University of Tartu in Estonia have developed a way to repurpose old smartphones, chaining them together to build "tiny data centers" used for processing data on location and in real-time. According to the University, the team said that the most sustainable environmental solution is for users to hold on to their phones for as long as possible, but the fast pace of technological change and the fickleness of fashion means that this is easier said than done. So, they decided to think outside the box and decided to find a different sustainable solution instead.

“Innovation often begins not with something new, but with a new way of thinking about the old, re-imagining its role in shaping the future,” said Pervasive Computing Associate Professor Huber Flores. What the researchers did was get four old smartphones and remove their batteries to reduce the risk of leaks and contamination. They then 3D-printed some casings and holders that will host the devices and custom circuitry to regulate the power. This setup will make it easier to reuse the base and replace the phones if and when they break.

We're unsure what other changes the team made to the phones, but it seems that they also created custom software for them. They also likely attached external sensors to gather data, especially as the first test was done underwater. The University said that the first trial was a success, with the setup able to monitor marine life without needing human intervention. Previously, this was only possible with a scuba diver recording video and then bringing the footage to the surface for study.

Aside from the above use case, the team said that this compact 'data center' can be deployed in other environments. One example they gave is installing it in a bus stop, where the phones could get the passenger count in real-time and help optimize the entire public transit system. This isn't a far-fetched idea, too, especially as there are many guides online that teach you how to reuse your old phones and tablets for other tasks. For example, there are tutorials on how you can turn an old phone into a webcam that's way better than most cheap cameras on the market.

There's likely going to be a market for this if the team can turn this initial prototype into a cheap, reliable, and easy-to-use and customize edge node. If this catches on, this will potentially give a second life to the millions, if not billions, of old smartphones out there that are heading into the recycler or even straight to the dump.

Google just blocked ad-blockers, again.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


YouTube has recently expanded its ad-blocking measures, closing the loopholes that browsers and other third-party extensions with ad-blocking capabilities used to remove ads from YouTube videos. The company first started experimental measures against ad-blockers in 2023, before going full steam ahead in 2024. But even so, a few apps, including Mozilla Firefox (and extensions), exploited weaknesses in YouTube's protection over the past few months. However, this is no longer the case, according to 9to5Google, and some users who previously bypassed ads reported they can no longer play YouTube videos unless they add the video hosting site to their adblocker's allowlist or disable their ad-blocker altogether.

You can subscribe to YouTube if you want to get rid of ads on the platform, but many people do not like doing that. After all, why pay a monthly fee when there is an easy way to get around the ads? And when the company first tried implementing the ad-blocker ban, there was a massive uproar online and in the real world. It even went to the point that a privacy consultant in the EU filed a criminal complaint against the company for “unlawful surveillance.”

The aforementioned ruckus died down with the discovery of ad blocker-blocker loopholes. But now that Google has acted again to close loopholes, people are up in arms about the measures.

Nevertheless, it seems that not everyone has been affected by this change yet. Users in Southeast Asia and Europe still seem to have fully-functioning ad blockers for YouTube. We do not know if YouTube hasn't implemented the changes in those regions yet, or if updated filter-lists have already been deployed by ad blockers devs to counter the latest ad blocker-blocker efforts.

While we understand the need for Google to make money, people will still want to access their services for free and without any irksome interruptions. So, as long as there is a demand, there will definitely be a supply. This will likely be the whack-a-mole game that YouTube, and its parent company Alphabet, will need to do as long as it exists.

Microsoft is gearing up for an offensive on SteamOS.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Signs of Microsoft's efforts to bring its Windows and Xbox platforms closer together have started appearing online. Case in point, the just-dropped YouTube trailer for MIO: Memories In Orbit shows the game's availability on both Steam and "Xbox PC." Microsoft's press release for Gears of War: Reloaded also mentioned that it's coming to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox PC, Xbox Cloud Gaming, PlayStation 5, and Steam this summer. This shows how the company is pushing for gamers to use the Xbox app on their gaming PCs instead of just installing a title directly, with Redmond aiming squarely at Steam.

Aside from these mentions, the Xbox App also received a massive change — Xbox users can now see their Xbox console games in the Xbox app library on their PCs. The Verge believes that this was intentional on the part of Microsoft to “closely combine its Xbox and Windows stores.”

While the Nintendo Switch pioneered modern handheld consoles (with the Switch 2 dropping in stores a few days ago), Steam Deck revolutionized it in 2022 when it allowed gamers to play their favorite PC games on such a portable device while running SteamOS. Other PC manufacturers soon followed suit, with Asus, Lenovo, MSI, and even Zotac launching their own competitors. All of them used Windows 11 — until Lenovo launched the Legion Go S With SteamOS.

This console ditched Windows in favor of Valve's Linux-based operating system, so it's normal for one to think that this would primarily be a Steam Deck competitor. But since the Legion Go S is also available with Microsoft's OS, reviewers were able to compare the performance of both devices with the same specifications. Some initial reviews claimed that the Valve-powered device could outperform by Windows-powered version by as much as 75%. Although not surprising, the results probably still alarmed Microsoft, with reports saying the company shelved its work on a first-party Xbox handheld to focus on revamping Windows 11 portable performance.

To be fair, Microsoft has already had something like this in the works for months (or maybe even years) now. News leaked that Asus has been working on Project Kennan, a handheld gaming console that will carry the Xbox brand and has been more closely integrated with Xbox Game Pass. The OEM even dropped a teaser a couple of days before Nintendo launched the Switch 2, although details about the actual console are still sparse. Nevertheless, we expect it to arrive in late 2025, which is the likely reason why we're starting to see Xbox PC logos on game launches.

The Microsoft Xbox Series X|S is sorely lagging behind the Sony PlayStation 5 in sales, with the PS5 estimated to have sold over 75 million units — more than double the Xbox Series X|S's total of over 33 million units. Windows is still king in PC gaming, but its leadership is being threatened by SteamOS. Most desktop and laptop gamers still stick with Windows, even though you can install SteamOS on your PC (but it isn't mainstream gaming desktop ready, as yet). However, handheld gamers now have an option between Windows and SteamOS on the same device, and this likely has kept Microsoft and Xbox executives awake at night.

Who says a robot vacuum can't be a statement piece? While it may not have the name recognition of Roomba or Roborock, Dreame has quietly been making some of the best (and most attractive) robot vacuum/mops for the last few years, and its new flagship model—the X50 Ultra—has all of the features you expect from a top-of-the-line unit (with a price to match). It fared better in some of my toughest tests than any other robovacs to date, but it also hit some snags along the way.

For starters, the X50 Ultra looks a lot like every other high-end robovac on the market today. Seriously, it bears so much resemblance to Roborock's Saros 10, I would think it's the same vacuum just with different labeling. It even has the same retracting LIDAR turret, which also makes me wonder if these are all made in the same factory. That digression aside, the vacuum's docking station looks sleek and modern. I'd call it the most attractive one I've tested to date, which is good because at 13.4 x 18 x 23 inches, it will be somewhat prominent in your home. The dock can wash the vacuum's mop pads with 176-degree Fahrenheit water, which is good for killing bacteria. The two water reservoirs (one for clean and one for dirty) are both massive, and for the three weeks of my testing, I never had to change them. It also comes with a disposable vacuum bag pre-installed and a small reservoir of floor cleaning solution.

Dreame X50 Ultra

If you can stomach the price, the Dream X50 Ultra handles vacuuming and mopping like a champ.

Pros

Cons

Underneath the vacuum, you'll find split, dual roller brushes (again, uncannily similar to the brush system on a lot of Roborock models), and it can suck at a considerable 20,000 Pa, putting it right up there with the most powerful competitors. The X50 Ultra also has dual, rotating mop pads, one of which can extend away from the body to clean closer to walls; the mop pads can detach and remain in the base during vacuum-only tasks. There's also a sweeper arm with three brushes that can extend outwards to help bring debris into the path of the vacuum. The bot features a LIDAR turret (which retracts when going under low furniture) as well as extends in the front for navigation.

Setting up the X50 Ultra is straightforward—you pretty much fill the clean water reservoir, install the detergent bottle, and plug it in. Then, you control everything using a companion app, which first requires scanning the QR code under the robot's hood, installing any firmware updates, and then having your home mapped. The initial scan of my apartment was very quick. The X50 Ultra didn't drive everywhere, so I was worried it missed some areas, but it managed to account for every square foot. You'll have to spend a few minutes naming the rooms and editing the dividing lines between them, but that's par for the course with robovacs.

For my first clean, I just selected CleanGenius mode, which is the default and its most “intelligent” mode. It suggested I start with an initial deep clean, which I thought was a nice touch, but it didn't exactly impress me out of the gates. For starters, the X50 Ultra picked a wildly inefficient route for cleaning my apartment, starting with my kitchen (fine) and then driving all the way across to the bedroom, skipping several areas in between. Then it skipped to the living room, and so on. Within the room, the X50 Ultra seemed to waste a lot of movement just kind of looking around, spinning in circles, and generally meandering. The pattern it made on my carpet was just randomness. The whole vacuuming took 80 minutes total, which was 11 minutes longer than the next slowest vacuum I've tested (the Roborock Saros Z70), even on their deepest-cleaning modes. While the X50 Ultra made it through my one-bedroom apartment on maximum power, the battery was down around 30% by the end of it. That means in a bigger house it might have to stop and recharge mid-cleaning before it continues (or you could reduce the suction power).

The X50 Ultra also missed a fair amount of dirt on the initial run. I was surprised by how many little bits and pieces were still strewn about the kitchen and hallway, so after the floor dried, I sent the robot back to those areas, but this time on Max+ vacuum power. The robovac is a lot louder in that mode, but it did manage to suck up everything in the middle of the rooms. Unfortunately, the edge cleaning was a serious letdown. Even with its extending sweeper arm, it just missed a ton of stuff near the walls.

Dreame's robovac does a very good job of mopping, and it managed to clean up three ketchup spots at varying stages of drying as well as some congealed grease on my floor. Unfortunately, again, it struggled to clean the edges. I'd spilled some juice on the floor right next to my sink (a common place for liquid accidents), and the spot was basically aligned with the edge of an overhanging cabinet. Somehow it didn't get to the spill at all, even though it was well within reach of its extendable mop pad. I will say, though, that the mopping action is whisper quiet. Some of the mops on Roborock's bots scream like banshees. The X50 Ultra was easily the quietest mop in a robovac that I've tested.

Generally, the object recognition on the X50 Ultra is strong. It carefully avoided an orange USB cord on hardwood, and it dodged a white cord on a white rug. Its object detection isn't always perfect—one time it slurped up a black cord on the white rug (which you'd think would be the easiest to see), and I had to turn the bot over and free it from the vacuum brush (a very easy, tool-less affair). The X50 Ultra managed to avoid things like socks and slippers, though, and often labeled them correctly on the map when it saw them. Dreame claims the X50 Ultra can identify over 200 objects, and you can have it set to automatically photograph them if you want that for some reason.

For its toughest test, I threw down my notorious Snack Gauntlet, consisting of goldfish crackers, pumpkin seeds, pistachio shells, some scattered oats, and bits of oregano around the edges of walls, and I distributed them both on hardwood and a medium-pile carpet. It's mostly good news here. The X50 Ultra fared better than any other robovac I've tested in the areas that it reached. Almost all bots really struggle with the pistachio shells and tend to sort of choke on them. This bot didn't bat an eye, hoovering them up effortlessly and quietly. It also didn't crush or regurgitate any of the goldfish or seeds, which is a common issue. The X50 Ultra even got some oats hiding under my TV cabinet—something no other robovac that I've tested has achieved. The vacuum and spinning brush system performed incredibly well here.

The X50 Ultra still suffered from the aforementioned edge issues. Cleaning along the walls was spotty (I used dried oregano so I could clearly see places it missed). The robovac was also inconsistent in the corners, nearly always leaving at least a bit of debris (sometimes more). If a piece of food was within an inch or so of some furniture or a wall, it just missed it completely. I put a couple of shells under cabinet overhangs (which it can get under), and the bot missed those, too. It's especially frustrating because the X50 Ultra performed better than any other vacuum in the open floor.

There are some other excellent features worth mentioning. For starters, the X50 Ultra can vault itself over thresholds up to 1.65 inches tall, which is the biggest climb for any robovac on the market, and it does it with two clever extending legs that sort of catapult it over things. It's cool to watch, and it worked well. The X50 Ultra also has voice commands built right into it, so while you can pair it with Google Home, Apple Home, or Alexa, you don't have to, and you can give it very specific commands (e.g., “vacuum the bedroom,” “mop the kitchen,” etc.)—and it will hop to.

I also love that the X50 Ultra leaves its mop pads on the dock when it doesn't need them, which should help keep your rugs drier. Even if you're doing both at once, the robovac will raise up the mop pads a full 10.5mm (0.4 inches), which should be enough to keep them above most (non-shag) carpets. It can also lower its LIDAR mast, making the bot roughly 3.5 inches tall. Overall, Dreame's companion app is solid, and while it doesn't have quite as much polish as Roborock's apps it offers effectively all the functionality you could want, including remotely controlling the bot with POV video, taking photos of your pets, and pretty granular adjustments for all of the features, such as how much water the mop should use, how aggressive the sweeping arm should be, etc.

Ultimately, the X50 Ultra is a very good robot vacuum/mop. While it's slower than I'd like, the real thing that keeps it from being Great with a capital G is its poor performance around edges, corners, and furniture. I will say, though, that it seems to be a limitation of the software rather than the hardware, which gives me some hope that this could be addressed in future firmware updates. But for now, for a robot vacuum that currently sells at between $1,400 and $1,700, I expect to not have to vacuum/mop any edges by hand after it's done its main cleaning.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

In 1950 the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi was discussing the possibility of intelligent alien life with his colleagues. If alien civilizations exist, he said, some should surely have had enough time to expand throughout the cosmos. So where are they?

Many answers to Fermi's “paradox” have been proposed: Maybe alien civilizations burn out or destroy themselves before they can become interstellar wanderers. But perhaps the simplest answer is that such civilizations don't appear in the first place: Intelligent life is extremely unlikely, and we pose the question only because we are the supremely rare exception.

A new proposal by an interdisciplinary team of researchers challenges that bleak conclusion. They have proposed nothing less than a new law of nature, according to which the complexity of entities in the universe increases over time with an inexorability comparable to the second law of thermodynamics—the law that dictates an inevitable rise in entropy, a measure of disorder. If they're right, complex and intelligent life should be widespread.

In this new view, biological evolution appears not as a unique process that gave rise to a qualitatively distinct form of matter—living organisms. Instead, evolution is a special (and perhaps inevitable) case of a more general principle that governs the universe. According to this principle, entities are selected because they are richer in a kind of information that enables them to perform some kind of function.

This hypothesis, formulated by the mineralogist Robert Hazen and the astrobiologist Michael Wong of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC, along with a team of others, has provoked intense debate. Some researchers have welcomed the idea as part of a grand narrative about fundamental laws of nature. They argue that the basic laws of physics are not “complete” in the sense of supplying all we need to comprehend natural phenomena; rather, evolution—biological or otherwise—introduces functions and novelties that could not even in principle be predicted from physics alone. “I'm so glad they've done what they've done,” said Stuart Kauffman, an emeritus complexity theorist at the University of Pennsylvania. “They've made these questions legitimate.”

Michael Wong, an astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC.

Others argue that extending evolutionary ideas about function to non-living systems is an overreach. The quantitative value that measures information in this new approach is not only relative—it changes depending on context—it's impossible to calculate. For this and other reasons, critics have charged that the new theory cannot be tested, and therefore is of little use.

The work taps into an expanding debate about how biological evolution fits within the normal framework of science. The theory of Darwinian evolution by natural selection helps us to understand how living things have changed in the past. But unlike most scientific theories, it can't predict much about what is to come. Might embedding it within a meta-law of increasing complexity let us glimpse what the future holds?

The story begins in 2003, when the biologist Jack Szostak published a short article in Nature proposing the concept of functional information. Szostak—who six years later would get a Nobel Prize for unrelated work—wanted to quantify the amount of information or complexity that biological molecules like proteins or DNA strands embody. Classical information theory, developed by the telecommunications researcher Claude Shannon in the 1940s and later elaborated by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, offers one answer. Per Kolmogorov, the complexity of a string of symbols (such as binary 1s and 0s) depends on how concisely one can specify that sequence uniquely.

For example, consider DNA, which is a chain of four different building blocks called nucleotides. Α strand composed only of one nucleotide, repeating again and again, has much less complexity—and, by extension, encodes less information—than one composed of all four nucleotides in which the sequence seems random (as is more typical in the genome).

Jack Szostak proposed a way to quantify information in biological systems.

But Szostak pointed out that Kolmogorov's measure of complexity neglects an issue crucial to biology: how biological molecules function.

In biology, sometimes many different molecules can do the same job. Consider RNA molecules, some of which have biochemical functions that can easily be defined and measured. (Like DNA, RNA is made up of sequences of nucleotides.) In particular, short strands of RNA called aptamers securely bind to other molecules.

Let's say you want to find an RNA aptamer that binds to a particular target molecule. Can lots of aptamers do it, or just one? If only a single aptamer can do the job, then it's unique, just as a long, seemingly random sequence of letters is unique. Szostak said that this aptamer would have a lot of what he called “functional information.”

If many different aptamers can perform the same task, the functional information is much smaller. So we can calculate the functional information of a molecule by asking how many other molecules of the same size can do the same task just as well.

Szostak went on to show that in a case like this, functional information can be measured experimentally. He made a bunch of RNA aptamers and used chemical methods to identify and isolate the ones that would bind to a chosen target molecule. He then mutated the winners a little to seek even better binders and repeated the process. The better an aptamer gets at binding, the less likely it is that another RNA molecule chosen at random will do just as well: The functional information of the winners in each round should rise. Szostak found that the functional information of the best-performing aptamers got ever closer to the maximum value predicted theoretically.

Hazen came across Szostak's idea while thinking about the origin of life—an issue that drew him in as a mineralogist, because chemical reactions taking place on minerals have long been suspected to have played a key role in getting life started. “I concluded that talking about life versus nonlife is a false dichotomy,” Hazen said. “I felt there had to be some kind of continuum—there has to be something that's driving this process from simpler to more complex systems.” Functional information, he thought, promised a way to get at the “increasing complexity of all kinds of evolving systems.”

In 2007 Hazen collaborated with Szostak to write a computer simulation involving algorithms that evolve via mutations. Their function, in this case, was not to bind to a target molecule, but to carry out computations. Again they found that the functional information increased spontaneously over time as the system evolved.

There the idea languished for years. Hazen could not see how to take it any further until Wong accepted a fellowship at the Carnegie Institution in 2021. Wong had a background in planetary atmospheres, but he and Hazen discovered they were thinking about the same questions. “From the very first moment that we sat down and talked about ideas, it was unbelievable,” Hazen said.

Robert Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC.

“I had got disillusioned with the state of the art of looking for life on other worlds,” Wong said. “I thought it was too narrowly constrained to life as we know it here on Earth, but life elsewhere may take a completely different evolutionary trajectory. So how do we abstract far enough away from life on Earth that we'd be able to notice life elsewhere even if it had different chemical specifics, but not so far that we'd be including all kinds of self-organizing structures like hurricanes?”

The pair soon realized that they needed expertise from a whole other set of disciplines. “We needed people who came at this problem from very different points of view, so that we all had checks and balances on each other's prejudices,” Hazen said. “This is not a mineralogical problem; it's not a physics problem, or a philosophical problem. It's all of those things.”

They suspected that functional information was the key to understanding how complex systems like living organisms arise through evolutionary processes happening over time. “We all assumed the second law of thermodynamics supplies the arrow of time,” Hazen said. “But it seems like there's a much more idiosyncratic pathway that the universe takes. We think it's because of selection for function—a very orderly process that leads to ordered states. That's not part of the second law, although it's not inconsistent with it either.”

Looked at this way, the concept of functional information allowed the team to think about the development of complex systems that don't seem related to life at all.

At first glance, it doesn't seem a promising idea. In biology, function makes sense. But what does “function” mean for a rock?

All it really implies, Hazen said, is that some selective process favors one entity over lots of other potential combinations. A huge number of different minerals can form from silicon, oxygen, aluminum, calcium, and so on. But only a few are found in any given environment. The most stable minerals turn out to be the most common. But sometimes less stable minerals persist because there isn't enough energy available to convert them to more stable phases.

“Information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge, and energy.”

This might seem trivial, like saying that some objects exist while other ones don't, even if they could in theory. But Hazen and Wong have shown that, even for minerals, functional information has increased over the course of Earth's history. Minerals evolve toward greater complexity (though not in the Darwinian sense). Hazen and colleagues speculate that complex forms of carbon such as graphene might form in the hydrocarbon-rich environment of Saturn's moon Titan—another example of an increase in functional information that doesn't involve life.

It's the same with chemical elements. The first moments after the Big Bang were filled with undifferentiated energy. As things cooled, quarks formed and then condensed into protons and neutrons. These gathered into the nuclei of hydrogen, helium, and lithium atoms. Only once stars formed and nuclear fusion happened within them did more complex elements like carbon and oxygen form. And only when some stars had exhausted their fusion fuel did their collapse and explosion in supernovas create heavier elements such as heavy metals. Steadily, the elements increased in nuclear complexity.

Wong said their work implies three main conclusions.

First, biology is just one example of evolution. “There is a more universal description that drives the evolution of complex systems.”

Second, he said, there might be “an arrow in time that describes this increasing complexity,” similar to the way the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the increase in entropy, is thought to create a preferred direction of time.

Finally, Wong said, “information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge and energy.”

In the work Hazen and Szostak conducted on evolution using artificial-life algorithms, the increase in functional information was not always gradual. Sometimes it would happen in sudden jumps. That echoes what is seen in biological evolution. Biologists have long recognized transitions where the complexity of organisms increases abruptly. One such transition was the appearance of organisms with cellular nuclei (around 1.8 billion to 2.7 billion years ago). Then there was the transition to multicellular organisms (around 2 billion to 1.6 billion years ago), the abrupt diversification of body forms in the Cambrian explosion (540 million years ago), and the appearance of central nervous systems (around 600 million to 520 million years ago). The arrival of humans was arguably another major and rapid evolutionary transition.

Evolutionary biologists have tended to view each of these transitions as a contingent event. But within the functional-information framework, it seems possible that such jumps in evolutionary processes (whether biological or not) are inevitable.

In these jumps, Wong pictures the evolving objects as accessing an entirely new landscape of possibilities and ways to become organized, as if penetrating to the “next floor up.” Crucially, what matters—the criteria for selection, on which continued evolution depends—also changes, plotting a wholly novel course. On the next floor up, possibilities await that could not have been guessed before you reached it.

For example, during the origin of life it might initially have mattered that proto-biological molecules would persist for a long time—that they'd be stable. But once such molecules became organized into groups that could catalyze one another's formation—what Kauffman has called autocatalytic cycles—the molecules themselves could be short-lived, so long as the cycles persisted. Now it was dynamical, not thermodynamic, stability that mattered. Ricard Solé of the Santa Fe Institute thinks such jumps might be equivalent to phase transitions in physics, such as the freezing of water or the magnetization of iron: They are collective processes with universal features, and they mean that everything changes, everywhere, all at once. In other words, in this view there's a kind of physics of evolution—and it's a kind of physics we know about already.

The tricky thing about functional information is that, unlike a measure such as size or mass, it is contextual: It depends on what we want the object to do, and what environment it is in. For instance, the functional information for an RNA aptamer binding to a particular molecule will generally be quite different from the information for binding to a different molecule.

Yet finding new uses for existing components is precisely what evolution does. Feathers did not evolve for flight, for example. This repurposing reflects how biological evolution is jerry-rigged, making use of what's available.

Kauffman argues that biological evolution is thus constantly creating not just new types of organisms but new possibilities for organisms, ones that not only did not exist at an earlier stage of evolution but could not possibly have existed. From the soup of single-celled organisms that constituted life on Earth 3 billion years ago, no elephant could have suddenly emerged—this required a whole host of preceding, contingent but specific innovations.

However, there is no theoretical limit to the number of uses an object has. This means that the appearance of new functions in evolution can't be predicted—and yet some new functions can dictate the very rules of how the system evolves subsequently. “The biosphere is creating its own possibilities,” Kauffman said. “Not only do we not know what will happen, we don't even know what can happen.” Photosynthesis was such a profound development; so were eukaryotes, nervous systems and language. As the microbiologist Carl Woese and the physicist Nigel Goldenfeld put it in 2011, “We need an additional set of rules describing the evolution of the original rules. But this upper level of rules itself needs to evolve. Thus, we end up with an infinite hierarchy.”

The physicist Paul Davies of Arizona State University agrees that biological evolution “generates its own extended possibility space which cannot be reliably predicted or captured via any deterministic process from prior states. So life evolves partly into the unknown.”

“An increase in complexity provides the future potential to find new strategies unavailable to simpler organisms.”

Mathematically, a “phase space” is a way of describing all possible configurations of a physical system, whether it's as comparatively simple as an idealized pendulum or as complicated as all the atoms comprising the Earth. Davies and his co-workers have recently suggested that evolution in an expanding accessible phase space might be formally equivalent to the “incompleteness theorems” devised by the mathematician Kurt Gödel. Gödel showed that any system of axioms in mathematics permits the formulation of statements that can't be shown to be true or false. We can only decide such statements by adding new axioms.

Davies and colleagues say that, as with Gödel's theorem, the key factor that makes biological evolution open-ended and prevents us from being able to express it in a self-contained and all-encompassing phase space is that it is self-referential: The appearance of new actors in the space feeds back on those already there to create new possibilities for action. This isn't the case for physical systems, which, even if they have, say, millions of stars in a galaxy, are not self-referential.

“An increase in complexity provides the future potential to find new strategies unavailable to simpler organisms,” said Marcus Heisler, a plant developmental biologist at the University of Sydney and co-author of the incompleteness paper. This connection between biological evolution and the issue of noncomputability, Davies said, “goes right to the heart of what makes life so magical.”

Is biology special, then, among evolutionary processes in having an open-endedness generated by self-reference? Hazen thinks that in fact once complex cognition is added to the mix—once the components of the system can reason, choose, and run experiments “in their heads”—the potential for macro-micro feedback and open-ended growth is even greater. “Technological applications take us way beyond Darwinism,” he said. A watch gets made faster if the watchmaker is not blind.

If Hazen and colleagues are right that evolution involving any kind of selection inevitably increases functional information—in effect, complexity—does this mean that life itself, and perhaps consciousness and higher intelligence, is inevitable in the universe? That would run counter to what some biologists have thought. The eminent evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr believed that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence was doomed because the appearance of humanlike intelligence is “utterly improbable.” After all, he said, if intelligence at a level that leads to cultures and civilizations were so adaptively useful in Darwinian evolution, how come it only arose once across the entire tree of life?

Mayr's evolutionary point possibly vanishes in the jump to humanlike complexity and intelligence, whereupon the whole playing field is utterly transformed. Humans attained planetary dominance so rapidly (for better or worse) that the question of when it will happen again becomes moot.

But what about the chances of such a jump happening in the first place? If the new “law of increasing functional information” is right, it looks as though life, once it exists, is bound to get more complex by leaps and bounds. It doesn't have to rely on some highly improbable chance event.

What's more, such an increase in complexity seems to imply the appearance of new causal laws in nature that, while not incompatible with the fundamental laws of physics governing the smallest component parts, effectively take over from them in determining what happens next. Arguably we see this already in biology: Galileo's (apocryphal) experiment of dropping two masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa no longer has predictive power when the masses are not cannonballs but living birds.

Together with the chemist Lee Cronin of the University of Glasgow, Sara Walker of Arizona State University has devised an alternative set of ideas to describe how complexity arises, called assembly theory. In place of functional information, assembly theory relies on a number called the assembly index, which measures the minimum number of steps required to make an object from its constituent ingredients.

“Laws for living systems must be somewhat different than what we have in physics now,” Walker said, “but that does not mean that there are no laws.” But she doubts that the putative law of functional information can be rigorously tested in the lab. “I am not sure how one could say [the theory] is right or wrong, since there is no way to test it objectively,” she said. “What would the experiment look for? How would it be controlled? I would love to see an example, but I remain skeptical until some metrology is done in this area.”

Hazen acknowledges that, for most physical objects, it is impossible to calculate functional information even in principle. Even for a single living cell, he admits, there's no way of quantifying it. But he argues that this is not a sticking point, because we can still understand it conceptually and get an approximate quantitative sense of it. Similarly, we can't calculate the exact dynamics of the asteroid belt because the gravitational problem is too complicated—but we can still describe it approximately enough to navigate spacecraft through it.

Wong sees a potential application of their ideas in astrobiology. One of the curious aspects of living organisms on Earth is that they tend to make a far smaller subset of organic molecules than they could make given the basic ingredients. That's because natural selection has picked out some favored compounds. There's much more glucose in living cells, for example, than you'd expect if molecules were simply being made either randomly or according to their thermodynamic stability. So one potential signature of lifelike entities on other worlds might be similar signs of selection outside what chemical thermodynamics or kinetics alone would generate. (Assembly theory similarly predicts complexity-based biosignatures.)

There might be other ways of putting the ideas to the test. Wong said there is more work still to be done on mineral evolution, and they hope to look at nucleosynthesis and computational “artificial life.” Hazen also sees possible applications in oncology, soil science and language evolution. For example, the evolutionary biologist Frédéric Thomas of the University of Montpellier in France and colleagues have argued that the selective principles governing the way cancer cells change over time in tumors are not like those of Darwinian evolution, in which the selection criterion is fitness, but more closely resemble the idea of selection for function from Hazen and colleagues.

Hazen's team has been fielding queries from researchers ranging from economists to neuroscientists, who are keen to see if the approach can help. “People are approaching us because they are desperate to find a model to explain their system,” Hazen said.

But whether or not functional information turns out to be the right tool for thinking about these questions, many researchers seem to be converging on similar questions about complexity, information, evolution (both biological and cosmic), function and purpose, and the directionality of time. It's hard not to suspect that something big is afoot. There are echoes of the early days of thermodynamics, which began with humble questions about how machines work and ended up speaking to the arrow of time, the peculiarities of living matter, and the fate of the universe.

Luciano Spalletti ends his tenure in charge of Italy at home to Moldova in Monday's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier. 

A disastrous 3–0 defeat to Norway on Friday ultimately signalled the end of Spalletti's reign two years after he was appointed. The Azzurri should have minimal trouble sweeping Moldova aside given the gulf in quality between the nations but it will serve as little consolation for the departing manager.

Spalletti is likely to make some changes from the side that were embarrassed in Oslo but he will surely persist with his 3-5-2 formation. Personnel shouldn't matter too much against Moldova, though.

Here is how Italy could line up. 

GK: Gianluigi Donnarumma—Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League hero was unable to deny the likes of Alexander Sørloth and Erling Haaland last time out. He should be much, much quieter against Moldova. 

CB: Giovanni Di Lorenzo—Di Lorenzo's performance was far from flawless against Norway but Moldova are an entirely different and vastly simpler proposition. 

CB: Luca Ranieri—Diego Coppola struggled on his debut against Haaland and Co., with Ranieri potentially being handed his first senior appearance against Moldova. A clean sheet will likely come in his maiden outing. 

CB: Alessandro Bastoni—Bastoni has not enjoyed the past few weeks after Serie A and Champions League final disappointment with Inter was followed by humiliation in Oslo. He needs a straightforward evening more than most.

RWB: Andrea Cambiaso—Davide Zappacosta left much to be desired last time out and Cambiaso should replace him down the right-hand side. He will have plenty of freedom to fly up and down the flank. 

CM: Nicolò Barella—Much like his Inter teammates in the Azzurri setup, it's been a challenging few weeks for Barella. There will be no rest for the midfielder, however, with the FIFA Club World Cup coming shortly. 

CM: Davide Frattesi—Frattesi helped Italy find some stability in midfield after halftime in Norway and has done his chances of starting against Moldova no harm. It's a perfect opportunity for him to add to his eight national team goals. 

CM: Sandro Tonali—Tonali will be given the licence to make forward runs against Moldova and will hope to break the box as effectively as he does in Newcastle United colours. 

LWB: Destiny Udogie—Udogie, perhaps still shaken by the news of Ange Postecoglou's dismissal, should see off competition from Federico Dimarco and start again on Monday. 

ST: Giacomo Raspadori—The recent Serie A champion was unable to provide any significant threat in Scandinavia but should have a much easier assignment against a Moldova defence that has conceded eight times in their last two games. 

ST: Mateo Retegui—Retegui has generally been sharp for the Azzurri but needs greater service moving forward. Moldova will not be excited by the prospect of facing the Atalanta forward after he scored 28 goals in his debut season with La Dea.

CBA limits player prize money to $1m per team

New proposal gives players 20% of total performance prize

Major League Soccer has submitted a new proposal to its players concerning how bonuses for the Club World Cup will be paid, a source familiar with negotiations has told the Guardian. The MLS Players' Association, the union representing MLS players, later confirmed they had received a proposal.

According to the source, the league's offer would see players earn 20% of a team's performance-based prize money at each stage of the tournament with no agreed-upon cap on maximum payout. This means each group of MLS players competing in the tournament would collectively receive $200,000 for a group stage win (from a total prize of $1m), $400,000 for a group stage win (from a total prize of $2m per team, per win), $1.5m for making the Round of 16 (from a total prize of $7.5m) and so on.

The players' current bonus structure, outlined in the MLSPA's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the league, allows MLS players to receive half of any prize or participation money awarded to a team competing in an outside tournament, but with a hard cap of $1m. With the Club World Cup's $9.5m participation prize given to MLS teams, players had already maxed out their maximum payout and would have not been entitled to any more money for progress in the tournament.

Under the proposed terms, in the unlikely event an MLS team wins the Club World Cup, the players would be entitled to split a prize pool that would total up to $23.9m. Alternatively, if an MLS team loses all of its games at the Club World Cup, the players will still only receive a $1m collective bonus.

In their own statement, the MLSPA confirmed that the proposal had been delivered but said that the 20% payout is “below the international standard,” and also said that the league has attempted to “strong-arm” the players into CBA waivers that do not regard the Club World Cup.

The prize money structure was the subject of protest by the Seattle Sounders last weekend, with the squad wearing T-shirts in the warmup reading “Club World Cup Cash Grab.” The MLSPA later said in a statement that the league had “failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.”

The source said that MLS had originally planned to propose the 20% arrangement on the following Monday, but then elected to delay delivering the proposal until Friday.

FIFA Club World Cup

Major League Soccer made a proposal to the MLS Players Association that would increase performance-based bonuses in this summer's FIFA Club World Cup, but the two sides don't appear close to an agreement.

The league sent the proposal to the league on Friday, according to a source briefed on the discussions between the league and the union. The union responded forcefully to that offer in a statement on Sunday afternoon, calling the league's proposal “retaliatory” and saying the league had “ignored months of attempts by players to engage” until making its offer on Friday.

According to the terms of the current collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified in February 2021, MLS players would be paid a maximum of $1 million in prize money from the highly lucrative tournament. MLS teams will be paid a minimum of $9.55 million for their participation in the Club World Cup.

The $1 million cap comes from section 10.8 of the CBA, which defines tournament bonus pools. That section lays out payouts for known tournaments, like the U.S. Open Cup, Concacaf Champions Cup and Leagues Cup. What it didn't account for at the time was a new FIFA-run tournament with unprecedented prize money.

The new MLS proposal would give players the $1 million from the $9.55 million participation fee, as agreed in the CBA, but would add another 20 percent to any money earned beyond that — including for wins, draws and advancement to further rounds.

In addition, MLS previously decided to pay LAFC players an additional $250,000 in bonuses for its win over Club America in the play-in game to the Club World Cup, which followed Club León's expulsion from the competition.

The league also gave an option for owners to convert up to $750,000 of the $9.55 million participation fee into general allocation money, which effectively serves as cap space. All three teams opted to max out that $750,000, according to multiple sources.

The Seattle Sounders staged a protest ahead of their game against Minnesota United on June 1 regarding the $1 million cap on the bonuses. According to multiple reports, Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer angrily confronted the team after the game for the protest.

The source said the league had been in weeks of discussions with the MLSPA about the bonuses and that MLS communicated to the union on May 31 that it was willing to alter the CBA and expected to send a formal proposal on June 2 regarding the bonus structure.

The union's statement pushed back heavily both on MLS's offer and on its willingness to engage on the issue in the weeks leading up to the protest.

“MLS spent most of last week making threats and promising retaliation against the MLSPA and players because Seattle players wore T-shirts that expressed frustration over the league's refusal to engage about Club World Cup compensation,” the statement read. “After ignoring months of attempts by players to engage, late Friday afternoon, less than 48 hours before LAFC and Seattle players were to take the field once again, the league finally provided the PA with their first proposal on this issue. As promised, this proposal was retaliatory in nature.”

The union statement outlines the MLS offer as not adding any bonuses to the participation fees paid out by FIFA beyond the $1 million outlined in the CBA.

The union statement then classified the “back-end compensation” of 20% as being “below the international standard.”

In addition, the union said the league is attempting to strong-arm the MLSPA into making concessions around the CBA waivers that have been issued the past several seasons regarding offseason timing for teams participating in the Concacaf Champions Cup.

“The timing, substance, and retaliatory nature of the proposal sends a clear message: MLS does not respect or value players' efforts with regard to this tournament,” the MLSPA statement reads. “Although not surprised, the players and the MLSPA are deeply disappointed by this message.

“MLS's refusal to negotiate in good faith has created a major distraction for the players who should be focusing on preparing for a major international competition. However, players will not be silenced by threats from MLS. The players remain united in using their collective voice and demanding a fair share of the rewards earned from their hard work.”

It is not clear what “international standard” the MLSPA is using in its appraisal of MLS's offer. There have been few public details about what other teams are paying players for their participation in the tournament. A union spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question asking what the union was using as its “international standard.”

The source said the MLSPA communicated a desire for players to receive 40 percent of all money distributed to MLS teams by FIFA, including the participation fee and any performance payments for results or advancement in the tournament.

The discussions come at a delicate time for the league as it weighs major changes at the board level, including flipping the calendar to a fall-spring format. That change would require player approval and changes to the CBA.

With the relationship between the league and the union seeming increasingly frosty, it could complicate those larger discussions.

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -- It would've been easy for coach Mauricio Pochettino and the players on his U.S. men's national team to hang their heads in despair after squandering a first-minute lead and losing to Türkiye 2-1 in Saturday's friendly in front of more than 34,000 fans at the University of Connecticut's football stadium.

The defeat was the Americans third in a row, the USMNT's longest streak of futility in a decade. And given its self-inflicted nature — the hosts never recovered from two first-half defensive miscues — the result was a maddening one for a program that desperately needed some good vibes after finishing last out of four teams in March's Concacaf Nations League finals.

Yet the postgame mood was decidedly optimistic.

"Are you kidding me? So many positives to take away from that game," U.S. midfielder Tyler Adams said afterward.

"It's one of the first times that we've gone down and we've created so many clear chances afterwards.

"Now," he added, "It's just about putting the ball in the back of the net."

[RELATED: Defensive miscues cost USMNT as losing streak reach three]

Putting the ball in the net has been a struggle for the U.S. for more than a year. The squad managed just three goals in three group games at the 2024 Copa America, becoming the first tournament host not to advance to the knockout round. They scored just once in each of the Nations League losses to Panama and Canada.

So things were looking up when Jack McGlynn finished off a beautiful passing sequence with an even better shot to give the Americans a 1-0 lead just 58 seconds into Saturday's contest before two mistakes in a three-minute span at the opposite end of the field ultimately did them in.

There are no moral victories in top-level international sports. A loss is a loss. Still, all things considered, this isn't a case of the Americans simply trying to spin another setback as something better. There are actually things to build on before Tuesday's second and final pre-Gold Cup warmup against another top European foe in Switzerland.

First and foremost was the fight.

"The team showed what it needed to show," Pochettino said. "For sure, playing in this way, we are going to win most of the games.

The two March defeats would've been bad however they happened. That the Americans seemed strangely disinterested was damning.

"After March, I think we really kind of had to look inside of ourselves and figure out what was the problem," said center back Chris Richards, who served as the U.S. captain in Saturday's match. "It was a good week of training, good performance today, unlucky result. Poch said pretty much this whole week in the way he's been encouraging us, is to keep playing the ball out of the back. And if you make a mistake in possession, then so be it. At least you made a mistake trying."

For a variety of reasons, 14 of the 25 players on the March squad aren't with the USMNT this month, including lock starters like AC Milan star Christian Pulisic and Premier League standout Antonee "Jedi" Robinson.

Instead, Pochettino started an MLS-heavy lineup that had an average of just 13 international caps. Meantime, Türkiye's XI included players from European titans like Real Madrid and Juventus.

"It's a top European side," Richards said. "It's really important for us, especially going into a World Cup, to play this caliber of teams."

All things considered, the young Americans held their own, outshooting and out-possessing the visitors over the 90 minutes.

"They're fearless, and that's the reason that they're here," Adams said of the MLS contingent, which included three international debutants in goalkeeper Matt Freese and second-half substitutes Nathan Harriel and Quinn Sullivan. "These young players just need to be playing games. It doesn't matter the league that they're playing in. MLS players have always been valuable for the national team."

The experience was valuable even for U.S. established players like Johnny Cardoso and Malik Tillman. Usually used as reserves, both players are expected to log a huge number of minutes this summer at the Gold Cup with some of the regular starters unavailable. So while Cardoso's error led to Türkiye's equalizer, he'll have every chance to make up for it in the weeks ahead.

"He's a top, top player," Adams said of Cardoso, who is coming off a career season with Real Betis in Spain's vaunted LaLiga and has been linked with a move to Atlético Madrid. "He'll be fine."

And Pochettino raved about Tillman's performance, even though the German-American probably should've scored on a point-blank second-half header. 

"He was one of the best players for us on the pitch," the coach said. "He was showing personality, character — not only with the ball at his feet [but also] in the way we need to go to press…knowing when we press high, never complain, and always try and try and try."

On a different day, the outcome could've been different, too. After March, it was almost a secondary consideration. The effort was there even if the reward for it wasn't this time.

"We need to compete like we did today," Pochettino said. "This attitude I want to continue to have for the future, until we arrive to the World Cup, because that is the only way that we can improve. If I decide in September [to pick] a different roster, what I want is the same level of commitment.

"That is the way that we want to build our journey together."

ALAJUELA, Costa Rica – The U.S. U-20 Women's National Team fell to Canada 1-0 in the semifinals of the 2025 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship. It was just the fourth-ever loss for the USA at this competition dating back to 2002.

With no Third-Place Match in this year's tournament, the USA heads home having already qualified for the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup by advancing to the semifinal after winning its first two games in Group A. The USA had won a record seven Concacaf championships at this age level, including six of the last eight. The loss marked the first time the USA has not advanced to the title game of this tournament in the past 12 Concacaf U-20 championships.

The 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup will be held from September 5–27 next year in Poland.

It was an end-to-end match with Canada's powerful striker Annabelle Chukwu, who plays at Notre Dame, providing most of the danger for her side. The USA controlled 65% of the possession, had more corner kicks (5-3) and outshot Canada 12-9 for the game. Canada did have a higher expected goals over the USA – 0.94 to 0.45 – but the USA had an edge in shots on goal at 5-2. Unfortunately for the young Americans, one of those two went into the net, and USA could not find a way through a hard-tackling and gritty Canada defense and an in-form goalkeeper.

Canada broke the deadlock in the 56th minute as Teegan Melenhorst chipped a short pass behind the U.S. defense to Léa Larouche, who slotted home from six yards out into the lower right corner past charging U.S. goalkeeper Caroline Birkel.

The USA had its chances. Forward Mary Long came on in the 61st minute in place of Izzy Engle and smashed a left-footed shot off the crossbar in the 71st minute. That ignited a tremendous push for an equalizer in the last 20 minutes plus seven more of stoppage time, but the USA could not beat experienced Canadian goalkeeper Noelle Henning, who played a solid match while making five saves.

An 87th-minute shot from midfielder Linda Ullmark tested Henning and she had to parry the bouncing ball away for a corner kick. In the sixth minute of stoppage time, a hard shot from Ullmark challenged Henning again, but the diving ‘keeper was once again up to the task.

Forward Chloe Ricketts, who came on at halftime, created some problems for Canada down the left flank, but in the end the Americans could not produce a goal and were shut for just the second time in the history of this tournament. The only other time the USA failed to score at a Concacaf U-20 championship was also to Canada in the championship game of the 2008 tournament, also a 1-0 loss. The USA has played 66 total matches in this tournament in its history.

Chelsea are pushing hard to get business done early in this transfer window in order to have the best squad possible to compete for glory in the Club World Cup.

The big signing already announced is the addition of Liam Delap, with the new striker taking on the curse of the number nine shirt at Stamford Bridge.

The youngster has pulled out of international duty over the summer with the England U21s in order to try and win his first trophy as a Chelsea player in the United States.

It will be the first time the competition takes place in its new format, with Chelsea adding to their trophy cabinet when taking part in the old style back in 2022.

A decade earlier, the Blues were left embarrassed after being defeated by Corinthians after entering the competition following the 2012 Champions League triumph.

They lost 1-0 in the final, however missed a heap of chances against the Brazilian side. Fernando Torres was unfortunately responsible for a number of these.

The Spaniard was desperately trying to get his Chelsea career up and running following his £50m move from Liverpool, however struggled over in Japan to put an end to his goalscoring woes.

Drogba had tipped Torres to be the next great striker at Stamford Bridge following his departure, however  this certainly didn't come off throughout his time in West London.

After his time at Chelsea, the Spaniard would move to AC Milan and return for a spell at Atletico Madrid, before finishing his career in Japan.

Since then, Torres has taken to coaching, becoming the manager of Atletico's Under 19 side after coming through the club's academy himself.

He has worked his way up through the age groups, and is now in charge of the club's ‘B side', who currently play in the third tier of Spanish football.

Torres will no doubt be looking for inspiration from former national team colleague Cesc Fabregas, who is currently making a great name for himself in charge of Como in Italy.

International Football

Luciano Spalletti says he has been sacked as Italy head coach ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Spalletti confirmed the news at his news conference on Sunday ahead of Italy's World Cup qualifier against Moldova. That followed increased pressure after Spalletti's side opened their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign with a 3-0 defeat by Norway on Friday, a result which Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma described as “not acceptable”.

“I spoke with (Italian Football Federation president Gabriele) Gravina last night and he informed me that I will be relieved of my duties as national team coach,” Spalletti said. “I am disappointed: given the relationship we have, I had no intention of stepping down. Especially when things are not going well, I would have preferred to stay and do my job.

“However, it is a dismissal and I have to accept it. I have always seen this role as a service to my country and I want to facilitate the future of the national team. I think it is right to seek the best solution.”

Spalletti asked if he feels betrayed. Gets up, walks out

— James Horncastle OMRI (@JamesHorncastle) June 8, 2025



Spalletti took charge of Italy in August 2023, replacing Roberto Mancini. He oversaw a difficult 2024 European Championship campaign as they exited with a 2-0 defeat by Switzerland in the round of 16, winning just one match in the tournament. The 66-year-old has won 11 of his 23 matches in charge of Italy.

Italy reached the knockout stages of the UEFA Nations League but were ousted by Germany in the quarter-final after a 5-4 aggregate defeat.

Four-time champions Italy have not qualified for the World Cup since 2014, despite winning Euro 2020 under Mancini. They sit fourth of five in their qualifying group for the 2026 edition with zero points, but have played one match as opposed to two or three so far due to their participation in the Nations League.

Spalletti previously led Napoli to the Serie A title in the 2022-23 campaign.

Analysis by Italian football writer James Horncastle

Some felt Spalletti should have already gone after Italy's insipid display against Switzerland at the Euros last summer. In fairness, he deserved more time.

People are quick to forget Spalletti was supposed to be on sabbatical after leading Napoli to their first league title in 33 years. His country called when Roberto Mancini resigned during the qualifiers for the Euros after receiving a head-turning offer from Saudi Arabia.

Spalletti has been up against it from the start, taking over at a time of extreme generational transition. Betting scandals implicating Sandro Tonali and Nicolo Fagioli, the marginalisation of Federico Chiesa at Liverpool and a spate of injuries have not helped. But nor has Spalletti's handling of some players and the media.

Friday's 3-0 defeat against Norway came after a fallout with Francesco Acerbi, who turned down a call-up at a time when the national team was already without five centre-backs. That Mancini liked Acerbi's social media post explaining his decision appeared to rattle Spalletti, who hoped his predecessor's phone had been hacked.

Nine points adrift of Norway with two games in hand in their World Cup qualifying group, the nation fears another play-off and missing out on a third consecutive edition of the tournament. The Italian Football Federation is expected to consider Claudio Ranieri, Stefano Pioli and Fabio Cannavaro as prospective replacements.

Explore our soccer expert's Portugal vs Spain predictions and betting tips, pre Sunday's 3:00pm EDT UEFA Nations League Final (06/08/2025). 

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.





Spain were by far the standout side in the Nations League semi-finals. They stormed into a 4-0 and 5-1 lead in their last four encounters with France. Although Les Bleus fought back late on, the damage had already been done by 17-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal and speedster Nico Williams.

La Roja are no strangers to playing on the biggest stage. They are the defending champions of the Nations League, as well as the defending European champions. It's simply impossible to ignore their star qualities.

At a probability of 54.05% to beat Portugal, we believe this is a fair price to back. Portugal's last victory over Spain in a major competition came with their 1-0 win at Euro 2004. A lot has changed since then - the Spaniards have won five major trophies in the last two decades.

After Spain's thrilling 5-4 win over France in the last four, you might assume backing the Overs market on Sunday is a no-brainer. However, the head-to-head data suggests otherwise.

Five of the last six meetings between the rival nations have seen two goals or fewer. Only three goals have been scored during their last four meetings. 

There's a lot on the line in Sunday's contest, so we expect the older, more streetwise Portuguese side to try and stifle the Spaniards in Munich. The betting markets believe there's only a 47.62% chance of under 2.5 goals. This is the biggest value bet among our Portugal vs Spain predictions, as we believe the probability is closer to the 60% mark.

As the clear favourites for Sunday night's Nations League final, it's important to look at the current trends surrounding de la Fuente's Spain. Firstly, they've scored first in their last eight competitive games.

Interestingly, they've also led at half-time in five of their last six competitive games. This suggests La Roja are primed to start fast and take control of games from the outset.

Despite this, the betting markets assign just a 41.67% chance of Spain winning the first half of Sunday's game. Given that La Roja have led in 83.33% of their last six games at the interval, this is also a great value bet.

Arch-rivals Portugal and Spain meet again in Sunday evening's Nations League final in Munich. The Portuguese haven't beaten Spain in a major competition since 2004, so they will be keen to make up for lost time.

Roberto Martinez, who is a Spaniard himself, has masterminded Portugal's run to the final. His second-half tweaks against Germany in the last four turned the tide in Portugal's favour, with Cristiano Ronaldo once again emerging as the likely hero.

Portugal went unbeaten in their Nations League group campaign, securing notable wins over Croatia and Poland. They also hammered Denmark 5-2 in the second leg of their quarter-final tie. Their starting XI ranks among the best in Europe right now.

Spain enjoyed a similarly straightforward passage into the knockout stages of the Nations League. They only narrowly edged out the Netherlands in the last eight, ultimately relying on a penalty shootout to decide their fate.

However, Luis de la Fuente's men were at their very best in the last four against France. They blew Les Bleus away in the opening hour, with the likes of Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams in destructive form.

Portugal Expected Lineup: Costa; Neves, Mendes, Dias, Inacio, Silva, Neves, Fernandes, Trincao, Neto, Ronaldo

Spain Expected Lineup: Simon; Porro, Cucurella, Le Normand, Huijsen, Zubimendi, Merino, Pedri, Williams, Yamal, Oyarzabal

Players to Watch

Lionel Messi (Inter Miami): The Argentine legend will celebrate his 38th birthday during the Club World Cup and has shown that he hasn't lost his touch. It remains to be seen whether his team can compete with the world's elite clubs, but Messi surely is up to the task. 

Kylian Mbappé (Real Madrid): French star finished with 42 goals in all competitions in his first season with Madrid, broke Iván Zamorano's record for the most goals in a debut season and won European Golden Boot.

Harry Kane (Bayern Munich): The 31-year-old England captain scored 37 goals across all competitions (26 in 31 Bundesliga appearances and 11 in 13 UEFA Champions League games). He also had 11 assists.

Omar Marmoush (Manchester City): Egyptian forward left Eintracht Frankfurt in January and made an immediate impact at Man City with eight goals in 22 games. 

Désiré Doué (PSG): French 20-year-old was Man of the Match (a pair of goals and an assist) in the Champions League final and was instrumental in PSG winning the quadruple (Ligue 1 title, Coupe de France, Trophée des Champions, Champions League).

Franco Mastantuono (River Plate): This 17-year-old midfielder is already being anointed as the next great player out of Argentina after becoming the youngest player ever to appear in an official game for the senior national team. He is reportedly headed to Real Madrid for a $45 million transfer fee after being wooed by PSG and Manchester United. 

Cole Palmer (Chelsea): Left his childhood club Manchester City for Chelsea in 2023 and went on to score 40 goals across all competitions over the past two seasons.

Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan): The Argentine has scored 20-plus goals in five of the past six seasons, won Serie A Most Valuable Player and won the Golden Boot while leading Argentina to the 2024 Copa America title.

Estevao (Palmeiras): This 18-year-old Brazilian is Palmeiras' leading scorer this season, with eight goals in all competitions so far in 2025. He has made four appearances for the Brazilian national team and is headed to Chelsea for a reported $68 million transfer fee.

Erling Haaland (Manchester City): Norwegian 24-year-old has won the Golden Boot at the U-20 World Cup, UEFA Nations League (twice), Premier League (twice) and Champions League (twice). 

Others to keep an eye on: Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Rodri (Manchester City), Ousmane Dembele (PSG), Julian Alvarez (Atletico Madrid), Karim Konate (Salzburg), Kenan Yildiz (Juventus), Fidel Ambriz (Monterrey), Jamie Gittens (Dortmund), Kaua Elias (Flumeninse), Amanallah Memmiche (Tunis)

How did teams qualify?

Each confederation was awarded a set number of places based upon its strength. UEFA has 12 slots, CONMEBOL six. Four each for Concacaf, Asia and Africa, plus one for Oceania. There was also a spot reserved for the host country, which FIFA granted to Inter Miami as winner of the 2023 Leagues Cup and 2024 Supporters' Shield for best regular season record. It also didn't hurt that Messi is a world legend and big draw wherever he plays.

Inter Miami's selection for the tournament was controversial because the team has not won an MLS Cup, but league commissioner Don Garber defended FIFA's decision.

“I think it's exciting and I'm glad that we have a showcase for Miami,” Garber said. “This is FIFA's tournament, and they picked a host. They have the right to do that..there was no rule that said the MLS Cup winner needs to be in the Club World Cup.

“I think it was smart. I'm excited about putting Miami up in a showcase around the world to kick off the Club World Cup in our country, in our stadiums as a launch to the World Cup and I couldn't be more excited about it.”

How to watch the Club World Cup

Borja Díaz

Real Madrid is focused on the signings they can make ahead of the Club World Cup this summer. Huijsen and Alexander Arnold were the first two reinforcements they officially announced. In the coming week, they hope to keep doing the same with several more players.

But things are getting more complicated than expected for the Madridists with Álvaro Carreras. Benfica has gotten serious and could cause a problem for the young full-back. For now, they've forced him to travel to the United States with the rest of the Portuguese team.

For now, the agreement with Real Madrid hasn't been reached, which has caused some unease. Especially considering that the transfer window opened by FIFA closes on the 10th. If they haven't signed him by then, Carreras could miss out on the World Cup.

This will happen if Benfica includes him in their squad list and officially registers him for the World Cup. If that happens and he later ends up signing for Real Madrid, it'll be a mess. He won't be able to play in the tournament this summer with the Madridists, but he also won't be able to do so with the Portuguese team.

Xabi Alonso has insisted on signing Álvaro Carreras to have him already for the Club World Cup. With Mendy injured, he knows he'll only have Fran García available for the left-back position. He wanted to have a couple of options to face this title with guarantees.

It seemed there wouldn't be any problems, since the former Madridist youth player wants to return to Real Madrid. He has already communicated this to Benfica, making his intentions clear to the Portuguese team. But that hasn't managed to unblock the negotiations so far.

There are still a couple of days left for the Whites to get the deal closed. That way, Carreras will be at the World Cup and will do so under Xabi Alonso's orders. That's everyone's desire, but for now, it hasn't been confirmed.

The Real Madrid goalkeeper is expected to play in Ukraine's second game of the Canadian Soccer Shield tournament on June 10. 

In the aftermath of Ukraine's 4-2 defeat against Canada on Saturday, head coach Serhiy Rebrov answered Managing Madrid's question on the status of Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin at the post-match press conference in BMO Field, Toronto. 

Mehedi Hassan (Managing Madrid): Hi Serhiy, welcome to Canada first of all, tough game—hope you guys will bounce back against New Zealand. I just wanted to ask you about Andriy Lunin—how do you see his physical level ahead of the Club World Cup that's coming up with Real Madrid?Serhiy Rebrov (Head Coach, Ukraine): He is absolutely fine, we have three goalkeepers. Andriy is going to play in the second game. He's good and he is preparing for the next game. He's ready for the World Cup. 

Here is the video of the interactions between Serhiy and Managing Madrid:

I asked Ukraine head coach Serhiy Rebrov about Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin on how is Lunin's physical level before the Club World Cup. The coach replied he is doing fine, will be playing in Ukraine's next game and is ready for the World Cup. pic.twitter.com/htQXk99NWF

Lunin stayed on the bench for the entirety of the 90 minutes of Ukraine's difficult start in the four-team invitational competition among hosts Canada, Ukraine, Côte d'Ivoire and New Zealand. 

As per the head coach, Lunin is expected to play in their second game against New Zealand on June 10. These will be important minutes for him to get back into some sort of rhythm before reporting to Xabi Alonso for the preparations of the FIFA Club World Cup in the USA, starting just under a couple of weeks from now. 

Lunin is expected to remain as Thibaut Courtois's deputy in the global tournament but the team will obviously expect him to be in the best shape to appear at any moment if required.

From missing stars and top teams to concerns over player welfare, here are five key talking points before the 2025 Club World Cup.

A new-look FIFA Club World Cup, featuring 32 teams, kicks off in the United States on June 14 and runs through to the final on July 13.

In advance of the tournament, Al Jazeera takes a look at the top five talking points:

FIFA's decision to expand the Club World Cup from a six- or eight-team tournament to a supersized 32-team edition has been criticised by FIFPRO, the global football players' union, and the World Leagues Forum (WLF).

Legitimate questions have been raised about the extra workload on players due to the increased number of matches, and the corresponding reduction in rest and recovery time for players in a shortened off season.

“The FIFA Council's decision to schedule the first edition of the 32-team FIFA Club World Cup between 15 June and 13 July 2025 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives,” FIFPRO said in a statement in December.

A report released by FIFPRO and Football Benchmark in April found that several Club World Cup-bound players are among the most overworked for the 2024-25 season.

The report's findings estimated that Real Madrid's Federico Valverde, who made 43 back-to-back appearances up until April 1 with fewer than five days of recovery time before these matches, could potentially reach 65 back-to-back appearances for club and country by the end of the season, racking up close to 7,000 minutes and 78 games.

The WLF, an organisation representing 44 major professional leagues that is chaired by Premier League chief Richard Masters, said the organisation was unhappy that it had been overlooked in FIFA's decision-making process.

According to the Reuters news agency, Masters accused FIFA of prioritising its own commercial interests, adding that the June-July schedule would affect player availability for national leagues at the start of the season in August.

While the expansion of the Club World Cup to 32 sides allows more teams a chance at testing themselves against some of the biggest names in global club football, it also raises questions about the competitiveness of the tournament.

With every group having at least two clubs from Europe or South America, teams from the other continental confederations, such as Asia or Africa, could find themselves having very little chance of glory against the heavyweights of the game.

For example, in Group G, Moroccan side Wydad AC and UAE Pro League Al Ain are pitted against Manchester City and Juventus, who have been supremely successful on the domestic and continental stage.

Teams from the European confederation (UEFA) have historically dominated the Club World Cup, winning 16 of the 20 editions played to date. The remaining four have all been won by clubs from the South American confederation (CONMEBOL).

So, history suggests that the presence of European or South American sides could lead to lopsided matchups in this year's edition.

While Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe will play at the tournament, fans will be denied an opportunity to watch many of the elite performers from the 2024-25 season, such as Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, the Premier League's Golden Boot winner, or teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal, who won three trophies this year with Barcelona.

Salah created history as the first player in Premier League history to finish a season with the most goals and assists as well as win the Player of the Season award. But one of the most in-form forwards in the world will not be among the players in the US as Liverpool could not qualify for the tournament, with Manchester City and Chelsea earning spots from the English quota.

Further confusing the selection of teams was FIFA's abrupt decision to give the host nation a spot and award it to Inter Miami, underlining the opaque nature of the qualifying criteria for the tournament which won't feature Liverpool, Barcelona or Napoli, who have all just been crowned champions in three of the most prestigious leagues in Europe.

Inter Miami gained entry by topping Major League Soccer's regular season standings, despite losing in the first round of the playoffs – a decision critics say shows FIFA's desperation to have Inter's Argentina great Messi at their inaugural showpiece.

Apart from the winners of each confederation's premier club competitions, teams qualified according to a ranking based on their performances over a four-year period. Barcelona, the current La Liga champions, missed out on a spot due to the four-year club coefficient rankings and two-team restrictions, as their archrivals Real Madrid qualified for the Club World Cup alongside Atletico Madrid.

The Catalan giants, fielding some of the most exhilarating footballers on the planet, such as 17-year-old wonderkid Yamal or the goal-scoring genius of Raphinha, are a huge omission from the club-based tournament.

Prodigious talents like Romelu Lukaku and Scott McTominay, who ushered Napoli's stunning 2024-25 Serie A title charge in Italy, will also not play.

In the build-up to the tournament, FIFA announced the creation of a special transfer window, allowing participating clubs to make last-minute transfers before their teams board the flight to the US.

FIFA has said signings can be made from June 1 to June 10 as well as June 27 to July 3, explaining that the objective of the latter window is to encourage clubs and players whose contracts are expiring “to find an appropriate solution to facilitate the players' participation”.

The introduction of this transfer window is unique as signings usually either take place in the close season or the middle of the season, known as the summer and winter windows for European clubs.

FIFA's move has led to speculation that Cristiano Ronaldo could be one of those players to put pen to paper during the window on a short-term deal for one of the participating clubs. Spanish newspaper Marca reported in late May that a club in Brazil had submitted an offer to sign Ronaldo. Botafogo – one of four Brazilian clubs competing at the tournament – have been linked with the veteran forward.

Ronaldo, 40, has hinted he could leave Al Nassr after declaring that a “chapter is over” hours after the Saudi Pro League finished. Al Nassr have not qualified for the Club World Cup, unlike fellow Saudi side Al Hilal, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino recently said “there are discussions” over Ronaldo playing at the Club World Cup.

The Portugal star confirmed on Saturday that he had received “quite a few” offers from participating clubs to play for them at the tournament, but had decided against accepting any.

Should a Ronaldo transfer ultimately occur, the Club World Cup could see Messi and Ronaldo face-off in the US market, greatly boosting media interest, ticket sales, TV viewership figures, and enhancing the overall appeal of the tournament. The duo, who are arguably the greatest players of their generation, last played in the same competition at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

A club which has already benefitted from this special transfer window is Real Madrid, which was able to reach an agreement with Liverpool to sign defender Trent Alexander-Arnold early and make him available for the tournament.

The right back was scheduled to join the Spanish giants on a six-year deal as a free agent after his Liverpool contract expired on June 30, but according to The Athletic, Real paid Liverpool 10 million euros ($11.4m) to fast-track the process and get him on board for the Club World Cup.

Fans in the US will get a glimpse of what the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil will look like when they attend the Club World Cup matches this year.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be co-hosted by the US alongside Canada and Mexico, running for more than a month with 100+ matches.

Among the 12 stadiums that will host the new-look Club World Cup, some have also been chosen as venues for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will have 48 participants for the first time.

MetLife Stadium, an 82,500-seater in New Jersey, will host the semifinals and the final of the Club World Cup as well as the final of next year's prestigious World Cup.

Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, Seattle's Lumen Field and Miami's Hard Rock Stadium are the other venues which will be involved in both tournaments.

The venues, though, might not be filled to their full capacity as organisers have struggled to sell tickets, with club fan tickets, general public tickets, and hospitality sections all still up for sale on the official FIFA site, nearly two weeks out from the start of the event.

EAST HARTFORD, Connecticut — Neither the rain, nor the fact that his team had just lost, dampened Patrick Agyemang's mood as he walked along the edge of the playing surface at Rentschler Field.

Still wearing his Team USA gear, the tall 24-year-old moved slowly. He signed posters, balls, Team USA kits, even a Christian Pulisic jersey and whatever else the kids handed down to him after the United States Men's National Team's 2-1 loss to Türkiye on Saturday. He chatted and patiently posed for pictures, even handling strangers' phones to better frame the selfie for them.

Just over 15 years ago, Agyemang was in those same bleacher seats. He watched in awe as the American national team faced the Czech Republic on May 25, 2010. It didn't matter that USA lost 4-2. Agyemang was enthralled.

“I was one of those kids. It's amazing,” said Agyemang, smiling at the memory. “I just wanna continue being a figure to look up to, and I hope I can continue doing that.”

Agyemang's soccer career began a couple of good kicks from the spot where he's standing. He grew up across town in East Hartford and saw the excitement, not to mention the traffic, that came to town every time the Untied States men's and women's national teams hosted games at the region's best grass field.

He had the same dream of being part of it that so many of his friends did. But reaching that level was more than a long shot. Major League Soccer teams identify the most promising kids, sometimes as young as 12. They invite them to enroll in their academies, which help cultivate talent and prepare players for professional careers.

But they were't interested in Agyemang. 

Today he's among the top 25 goal scorers in the MLS. At East Hartford High School, he was ignored by all seven Division I schools in Connecticut and Agyemang ended up at Division III Eastern Connecticut State for two seasons before transferring to Rhode Island.

He shined for the Rams and the semi-pro Western Massachusetts Pioneers before being selected by Charlotte F.C. in the MLS Superdraft.

After scoring 10 goals for Charlotte last year, Agyemang was named to the national team roster in January and had goals in his first two career matches against Costa Rica and Venezuela.

On Saturday, he got the chance to play at home. He secured 25 tickets for friends and family, including his parents, who'd never seen him don red, white and blue before.

“It was nice just being here. This is my hometown, so to be back here it was amazing,” he said. 

The American roster that faced the Turks didn't feature many players who have locked up a spot on the Team USA roster for next year's World Cup, which is almost exactly a year away. Like Agyemang, most of the players were trying to improve their chances to crack the roster.

It was an opportunity for the young striker to prove something against tougher competition.

“It was maybe his first time playing against two center backs with their experience and their quality, they are playing in the top in Europe,” Mauricio Pochettino said. “Today I saw Patrick fight with two players who are some of the toughest center backs in the world.”

While fighting against them is a good first step, Agyemang was focused on thriving. 

“I want be able to to perform here consistently. That's the next step for myself and obviously I know I could do it and that's what I'm gonna work for,” he said. “I want to adjust and be able to perform here on a high level consistently.”

While he's not ignoring the tantalizing prospect of making Team USA's World Cup roster, he's more focused on improving than auditioning at this point.

“I just want to continue getting better, I'm still relatively new to this environment and obviously the level of it is different. I want to be able to continue learning and adjusting.”

He hopes the kids he met will draw inspiration from his attempt.

“It was a journey. It was ups and downs. It was not straightforward at all. I struggled in each step,” he said. “I just want everyone to know if you're really committed, you can't worry about the noise because I heard it all. I still hear it all. But at the end of the day, as long as you keep going anything can happen.”

Romania came into the match in the Austrian capital of Vienna in fine form after winning seven of their last eight games (L1), and it didn't take Mircea Lucescu's side long to flex their attacking muscles.

Only eight minutes had passed before two early appeals for penalties were turned down by referee Maurizio Mariani. An all-action beginning to the contest continued with Horatiu Moldovan producing a fine save to keep Sabitzer from opening the scoring.

The deadlock then should have been broken nine minutes later. Up from the back for another Austrian attack, Maximilian Wober disappointingly displayed why his particular skill set is at the opposite end of the pitch, not in the final third, as he blazed high into the stands from relatively close range. 

Austria authoritatively continued to search for the game's opening goal before half-time, but it appeared at first sight that Das Team would have to settle for a goalless game at the break as Moldovan twice denied Sabitzer in between acrobatically keeping out Romano Schmid's fierce strike.

However, that all changed in the 42nd minute as Wober's header back into the danger zone was powerfully volleyed in by Michael Gregoritsch.

Even after coming under increasing pressure throughout the opening quarter-hour of the second half, which saw Denis Dragus nearly equalise for Romania, Austria fortuitously put the game to bed after 60 minutes.

Leading by example, Sabitzer finally got his name onto the scoresheet with a strike from just outside of the area that took a double deflection before it beat Moldovan at his near post.

Despite being two goals to the good, Austria were left indebted to Patrick Pentz throughout the concluding stages, as he pulled off two stunning saves to prevent Nicolae Stanciu's set-piece and substitute Adrian Sut's ambitious long-range effort from setting up an intriguing finale.

Denis Alibec headed home a late consolation for Romania with the last kick of the match, however, it was too late to spoil an opening day FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifying success for Austria that puts them in good stride for their match against Group H outsiders San Marino on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Romania will return home to familiar surroundings as Cyprus are the visitors to Bucharest.

Chelsea could be set for a busy few days in the transfer market as they prepare to head across the Atlantic for the Club World Cup. The west Londoners will face Club Leon, Flamengo and ES Tunis in the group phase of the new-look competition. They will be hoping to give a good account of themselves, having been buoyed by their recent triumph in the Conference League and securing a top-five finish in the Premier League.

It has already been a productive window for the Blues, who signed Liam Delap from Ipswich Town earlier this week. The former Manchester City man penned a six-year deal at Stamford Bridge and will travel to the Club World Cup with his new team. He was initially expected to feature for England under-21s in the upcoming Euros, but was not named in Lee Carsley's final squad.



It seems Chelsea could add to the Delap signing with three additional deals before the Club World Cup gets underway. They are said to be making rapid progress in their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens, who has emerged as a top target.

According to RMC Sport, personal terms have already been settled with Gittens eager to join the Blues. He is said to have given the green light to a seven-year contract, but negotiations at club level are still ongoing.

Fabrizio Romano, meanwhile, reports that Chelsea have submitted an opening bid in the region of £29.5million. Gittens remains under contract until the summer of 2028, meaning Dortmund are under no pressure to sell if their demands are not met.

Chelsea also remain in talks over a move for AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, with Enzo Maresca eager to recruit an established stopper. He has also reached an agreement on personal terms with the Blues, according to TEAMtalk.

It is said that Maignan is eager to leave the San Siro and play in the Champions League next season. The report adds that he could be involved for Chelsea at the Club World Cup if a deal can be done over the next few days.

Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike is another reported target for Chelsea, having piqued their interest with his prolific form in Germany. He scored 22 goals in the season just gone and has been touted for a big move to the Premier League this summer.

Chelsea are firmly in the hunt to complete a deal before the Club World Cup but have reservations about Ekitike's asking price, according to Bild. Frankfurt are said to be demanding £84.3m, but the Blues are unwilling to go beyond £67.4m.

Time is running out for Chelsea to sign all three players, with the first part of the summer transfer window set to end on Tuesday. But if they can get those deals over the line, they will be able to travel to the Club World Cup with a revamped squad.

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. — Despite rainy weather, thousands of fans packed Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford on Saturday to watch the U.S. Men's National Soccer Team take on Turkey in a friendly match.

Turkey ultimately prevailed by a 2-1 decision, but that didn't stop attendees from enjoying the experience of catching the national team locally. 

Fans like Ed Szymanski lined up and tailgated for hours before the game, eager to catch a rare live appearance by the national team in Connecticut.

“No place I'd rather be. The rain is not great, but it's worth it to be here. You don't get to see the U.S. national team here too often, so when they are here, I make it a point to show my support,” Szymanski said.

Saturday's match marked the team's first game in Hartford since 2023. 

The U.S. is gearing up for a busy summer, including the CONCACAF Gold Cup, which will be hosted by the United States and Canada from June 14 to July 6.

Fans like Brendan McCabe were also looking ahead to 2026, when the U.S. will co-host the FIFA World Cup.

“We're waiting for the World Cup, okay? We're gonna make a move for the World Cup, we're going hard this year,” McCabe said.

Excitement was especially high for East Hartford native Patrick Agyemang, who made the national team.

“A lot of us played soccer growing up, we love to support the boys. Local kid, it's a great thing that he's here playing with the team,” McCabe said.

Fans Katie Tougas and Colleen Demko shared that sentiment.

“It's so exciting to see someone from Connecticut here. We're rooting him on and we're really excited to watch him play today,” Tougas said.

“In a sport where there's so much hype from overseas, [seeing] someone local to Connecticut being this far along and doing so great is really awesome,” Demko said.

With recent changes to the roster and a new head coach at the helm, many people are eager to see how the team performs heading into tournament season.

National teams don't visit East Hartford often, and fans were thrilled to have the chance to see Team USA close to home.

“Let's go USA,” Szymanski said.

The U.S. men's national team failed to end its current winless run on Saturday in Connecticut, but remains positive heading into its final pre-CONCACAF Gold Cup match. 

Mauricio Pochettino's squad suffered a 2-1 friendly loss to No. 27 ranked Turkey at Rentschler Field in the first match of a busy June schedule. Jack McGlynn's second international goal was cancelled out by a pair of quick goals from Arda Guler and Kerem Akturkoglu, handing the Americans their third three-match losing streak in consecutive years. 

Tyler Adams, Haji Wright, and Quinn Sullivan were among the second-half substitutions which came close to sparking a comeback in the match while Luca De La Torre and Malik Tillman delivered positive performances. Pochettino voiced his team's positives in the match and believed they deserved a better outcome overall.  

“The performance was good,” Pochettino told media postgame on Saturday. “We faced a team like Turkey, which is a very good team with the experienced players at the top. This group of players after playing together for the first time, I think we started the game so well. We played 20 minutes at a high level. We did very good things, very good things. It had an emotional impact when we conceded after we scored in the second minute, after we conceded the first, we conceded the second goal and that was difficult.

“I am really sad because I think this group of players are working so hard and I think we deserved a better result today,” he added. “But if we go to only focus on the performance, I think we perform really well and now we can be focused on how we can improve on the situation and be focused only on game situations.”

Pochettino doesn't have several of his star players this summer including Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, and Yunus Musah, opening the door to many fresh faces. Sullivan, Alex Freeman, and Matt Freese all earned their senior debuts in Saturday's match while McGlynn and Max Arfsten were among the young MLS contingent to earn important minutes in their development. 

Despite the USMNT now being winless in their last three matches, and next set to face off with No. 20 ranked Switzerland on Tuesday, Pochettino expected some growing pains heading into the Gold Cup.

“We knew that the level of the players are at different levels, that is why these two weeks are important to prepare for the Gold Cup,” Pochettino said. “I think we want to win and compete really well in the Gold Cup. And it's going to be tough, of course it's going to be tough. But I think what we expect is what we saw.

“I think what I cannot complain about is that every single player was very connected with the team,” he added. “Even the players that didn't play, they were helping the team, the players that were playing, knowing that maybe they have the opportunity or the chance to play in the next one and they need also the help from the teammates that they are going to play. And that is why I think the impact of the whole team, I am so happy with that.”

Should the USMNT suffer defeat in Nashville on Tuesday, it will mark their first four-match losing streak since 2007.

we are backwards.  we are tentative the end you should be aggressive; swashbuckling the end you should be low risk.

Blablabla. Another game, another loss. At this rate Poch might be canned if we blunder the Gold Cup. A really crappy time for the USMNT and its supporters.

Mcglynn has the tools to be a traditional 10. Passing and creative with an excellent left foot. But with that being said I think he could be a very useful sub in multiple positions. Not necessarily a starter.

I liked what Quinn brought off of the bench. Agyemang has many tools which will be useful. I want to see Luna and Tillman combine a bit more. And I think Mckenzie and Richards is the pairing going forward. I like LDLT ability to break through the lines with his dribbling just needs to get a bit quicker in his decision making. Would like to see how Brendo looks on the right.

i do think we “subbed backwards,” ie, started backups then subbed towards the intended lineup.  however for the Hope Merchants, it was the subs who scored through a quick attack punctuated by mcglynn's direct go to goal effort.  but they were dominated after 15′ and lost the contest.  the starters were more even with turkey (0-0 second half) but a lot of the attacks turned into the same old crossing, LDLT hitting ok hopeful crosses to the far post.  not dropped on a head but more played into space.

i thought 1-2 was a crap result.  turkey is just ok.  turkey lost to montenegro and was in a NL group with wales.  turkey and wales tied 0-0 twice.  we tied wales twice last cycle.  on paper this should have been a tie with zero improvement, a win if the coach is adding anything.  we instead lost.  that's regression.

people keep making Tomorrow excuses.  at some point this is supposed to actualize.

We lost but everything looked good with the exception of some MAJOR mistakes in the back (because of the pressure of playing out the back that are better made in friendlies than during a major tournament)……..and the teams inability to finish…..excluding Jack McGlynn!!!
Nobody looked sharp, dangerous or lethal in front of goal
The shot attempts on goal look desperate rather than calculated or deliberate
Haji Wright and Patrick Agyemang couldn't seem to get by anyone for a good strike on goal (Agyemang couldn't seem to use his size to hold off defenders at all)

——–USMNT——VS——-TURKIYE—–
———–60%——-POS——–40%———-

———–88%—–PASS AC—-84%———-
More possession, more touches on the ball,
better accuracy on passing……..yet
———–3————SOT———-5————
———-13———-SHOTS——11————

Johnny Cardoso made a dreadful mistake but the USMNT still dominated the midfield in the first half with him on the field
Overall we looked more well organized, structured and composed (for the most part) than out last 2-3 games
The real test will be THE SWITZERLAND GAME……as they were clinical and seemed to capitalized on every Mexico mistake ……..a Mexico with Santiago Giménez, Raúl Jiménez, Roberto Alvarado, Carlos Rodríguez, and Érik Lira. USMNT will need to tighten up defensively against Switzerland, as every error made by Mexico was almost converted into an opportunity and the Swiss came alive in the second half (were the US usually seem to die off) and Mexico just kind of lost focus and concentration.

Overall, I think this team exceeded expectations……they looked good, with a few issues that need to be addressed / corrected

Number of Passes for Turkiye is 441 not 44….lol

as they explained on the telecast, turkey, with their italian coach, is content to let you possess the ball, let you make the mistakes and punish them.  we've been selling “we're a possession team now” for years, and what of it.

i mean, we could barely find the strikers.  who cares if we lead the world in passing around the back.  the endgame to soccer is get the ball to players in the danger zone and attack the net.

and we proved for the umpteenth time that playing from the back costs us more pitifully easy punishment than it gets us clever long build goals.

The view from the stands:

– The stadium had higher attendance than I expected given the steady rain
– The US team started pretty well playing the possession-based game MP is trying to implement, but lost their composure and focus after falling behind.
– The US team had no real threats on the wings, and once Turkiye realized that, they made the necessary adjustments
– Agyemang as the target striker has the tools and athleticism, but needs a lot more improvement to jump ahead of Balogun or Pepi
– Cardoso, despite the gaffe, did well for much of the time. Though his replacement, Adams, was a noticeable upgrade.

Agyemang had the touch of a young Jozy Altidore. . . . that is not intended to be a compliment.

johnny was basically on the hook both goals, are you kidding me.  on the first goal, if you start to feel that noose tighten, that ball is either row Z or hit to midfield.  we are being taught to not panic, to try and be clever, precisely when one should not.  and there is zero upside to playing from the back.  i struggle to remember 110 yard build goals.

people chuckled at my expense but the lack of wing quality was foretold in the callup sheet.  you have to call up specialist wings to get good wing play.  we had wright wide, we had LDLT wide, what did we expect?  to be fair, mcglynn accomplished some — was basically the whole first half offense — but he was inverting.

i thought we were more dangerous when we fed agyemang and wright but i thought wright was showing to the ball more.  agyemang wants to sit back, pin the defender, then spin.  and we couldn't find the 9 the whole first half.

Thought Tillman had his best game yet for us, I so wish he would have converted that header from the six, would have made it a statement game for him.  LDLT was really good.  If you could take away the Johnny mistake and the next five minutes it would have been our best performance under Poch.

the cardoso/LDLT MF of the first half got spanked.  are you kidding me.

Certainly better than the last few games, and we looked good at times, but weaknesses are still apparent. Is the US attacking in the style that Pochettino wants? I much prefer how Turkiye attacks. When they went into attack they moved quickly. passed quickly and were in the US third within not many seconds. We need to move the ball a lot quicker. Too often, too, we did not move enough off the ball, especially when facing their press. Too often our passes weren't hit with enough speed, almost as if they didn't trust their teammates to be able to handle passes with pace. Every second lost gives the defense more time to adjust and get into place. The Turks didn't have that problem and their quickness put our defense under a lot of pressure.  I can't stop from remarking about Cardoso's error. How do you kick the ball right into an opponent no more than 5 feet in front of you? I remember that Cardoso had a teammate wide open to his left with no one around. Why Cardoso even tried to pass up the middle is inexpolicable. While Austen missed one very good chance and another decent chance, I think Tillman's failure to convert was worse, considering how often he was scoring in Holland.

it's not “inexplicable,” he forced the pass.  we force the pass all the time.  you see it's a dumb idea but we're being taught to pass from the back and egg the opponent to come forward then try and cleverly work out of it.  we're not that slick.  do the boring things.

nor are we slick enough other end of the field to break down teams half court soccer.

the goal was first 15 we're playing long outlets and even a little kickball, flick it wide, go to goal.  that's quick.  you don't have to break down 11 men, you start putting defenders behind you and you can play into space.

but i generally agree.  i prefer their style.  swarm the mids, win the ball.  get it wide early.  speed or wall ball down the wing.  go to goal.  quit slow play.  quit nibbling at the edges.  get it in smaller number situations, more green space, and attack the net.

last point, but we are way overcommitting near side.  the weak side is open all day.  that's part of what you were seeing.  when they switched, the guy would have 20 yards.  or even on some crosses i'd be like is anyone marking that far post runner.  holland abused that.

A third straight loss didn't prevent Mauricio Pochettino from thinking big.

“We need to believe. We need to compete like today and for sure we're going to have the possibility to win the World Cup,” the U.S. coach said after the Americans lost their third straight game, wasting an early lead in a 2-1 defeat to Turkey in a friendly on Saturday.

Jack McGlynn scored 59 seconds in for the U.S., which was missing many regulars as Pochettino revamped his roster following a dismal performance at the CONCACAF Nations League final four in March.

Turkey took advantage of a sloppy defense as Arda Güler and Kerem Aktürkoğlu scored in a 2-minute, 20-second span midway through the first half.

While the U.S. had 60% possession and outshot Turkey 13-11, the Americans dropped to 5-4 under Pochettino, who took over after first-round elimination at last year's Copa America led the U.S. Soccer Federation to fire coach Gregg Berhalter.

They have lost three straight for the second time in a year.

“Today, who is going to tell me, oh, we showed lack of, we showed lack of — lack of what today?” said Pochettino, a 53-year-old from Argentina who coached Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. “The team showed what (it) needed to show. … Playing in this way, they are going to win most of the games.”

Coaching a nation that hasn't reached the World Cup semifinals since 1930 or the quarterfinals since 2022, Pochettino changed eight starters from the Nations League loss to Canada in March and kept only left back Max Arfsten, winger Diego Luna and forward Patrick Agyemang.

“Some guys that are coming in — and they're not thinking twice about taking someone on. It's not playing safe. It's like, let's take risks and try to go after this thing,” said midfielder Tyler Adams, who entered at the start of the second half. “I think having fresh faces, guys that aren't fearless, young guys, that's going to help us.”

With a year to go before co-hosting the World Cup, the U.S. plays Switzerland on Tuesday at Nashville, Tennessee, in another friendly, then opens the CONCACAF Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15.

“I am really sad because I think this group of players are working so hard and I think we deserve (a) better result today,” Pochettino said. “I think we performed well. I think we're brave enough. I think the attitude was: Go and press, match in every single aspect a team like Turkey that is one of the best teams in the last year in Europe.”

Defender Alex Freeman, a 20-year-old son of former NFL All-Pro receiver Antonio Freeman, started in his U.S. debut. Matt Freese, a starter at Major League Soccer's New York City, made his debut in goal. 

Matt Turner, the usual starter since 2022, didn't play for Crystal Palace after March 1.

Midfielder Quinn Sullivan and defender Nathan Harriel made debuts as 65th-minute substitutes.

McGlynn scored when he ran onto a pass from Malik Tilman, took several touches, cut inside and curled a left-footed shot from just outside the penalty area inside the far post for his second goal in five international appearances. 

It was the earliest U.S. goal since Shaq Moore scored 20 seconds in against Canada during the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Turkey tied it in the 24th minute when Freese tapped the ball to Johnny Cardoso, whose pass ricocheted off a leg and past Freese for Güler's fifth international goal.

Then in the 27th, Miles Robinson tried to clear Oğuz Aydın's shot and the ball went to Aktürkoğlu, who one-timed a bouncing shot past Freese for his 12th international goal and sixth in eight games.

“Of the goals that we concede, that created a big mess on the team,” Pochettino said.

Updated 2m ago

Carlos Alcaraz defended his French Open title with a stunning comeback as he saved three match points and fought from two sets down to beat Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2).

Alcaraz was broken twice as the world No. 1 started in strong fashion on Court Philippe-Chatrier, and Alcaraz went two sets behind after being edged out of the second-set tiebreak.

The 22-year-old, though, recovered to chalk up three breaks in the third set and avoid a clean sweep. Sinner then found a breakthrough for a 5-3 lead. 

Alcaraz saved three championship points before breaking the Italian, who was serving for the match, and won the tiebreak to dramatically level the match.

After the Spaniard's early break in the fifth set was canceled out for 5-5, it was Alcaraz who sealed victory in the championship tiebreak, racking up a 7-0 advantage and eventually winning it 10-2.

He deserves the crown, the Spanish supernova.

He added: “I just want to say thank you to my team, my family, I have the privilege to live great things with you. 

“I was lucky to have a lot of friends from home, from Murcia, to support. Amazing support you have given to me today, throughout the whole two weeks. Even those who are at home who couldn't come.

“Thank you very much and this trophy is yours as well. This tournament is really special, I can't wait to come here year after year. Special thank you to (tournament director) Amelie (Mauresmo), congratulations as well, it's not easy to be with us.

“To Paris, you have been really important support to me since the first practice for the first round. You were insane, unbelievable for me. I can't thank you enough. You were really important, you are in my heart and you will always be.

“Thank you very much and see you next year.”

He said: “Hi everyone. I wanted to start with Jannik. It is amazing the level you have, congratulations for an amazing two weeks, an amazing tournament. I know the hard work you put in every day. I know how hard you chase this tournament.

“I'm pretty sure you're gonna be champion here many, many times. It's a privilege to share the court with you. I'm just really happy to be able to make history with you in this tournament, in other tournaments.

“You are a huge inspiration for the kids, and for me as well. So thank you, and good luck for all that is coming in the future.”

He lifts the magnificent Coupe des Mousquetaires, in his black and white top.

He stares at his reflection and looks back at the man who put in one of the all-time great Grand Slam final performances.

Let's hear from him, right here, right after the Spanish national anthem.

Don't go anywhere!

And Jannik Sinner continued: “Thank you so much to all the ball kids, you do an amazing job, you make our life so much easier. To our chair umpires, thank you so much. It's a big, big privilege to play here. Paris is a special place. 

“It's an amazing trophy so I won't sleep very well tonight, but it's OK. Thank you to the organizers for making it such a special event. 

“Obviously the support has been amazing these couple of weeks. You are amazing. Again, thank you guys. See you next year.”

The runner-up holds up his silver award to applause.

He says on Philippe-Chatrier: “Hello everyone. First of all, Carlos, congrats. Again, an amazing performance, amazing battle. To you and your team, amazing job, I'm very happy for you, and you deserve it, so congrats.

“It's easier to play than talking now. To my team, thank you so much for putting me in this position. We tried our best today, we gave everything we had. Still an amazing tournament, even though it's very, very difficult now, but it's OK.”

Madness, this.

A righteous roar of delight from Carlos Alcaraz.

...but it went by in the blink of an eye.

What on earth have we just witnessed? 

It's hard to place these things in historical context straight away, but there will undoubtedly be comparisons made with Borg-McEnroe Wimbledon 1980, Federer-Nadal Wimbledon 2008 and Djokovic-Nadal Australian Open 2012. 

A truly absurd final.

Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) in the French Open final at Roland Garros Sunday.

The No. 2 seed prevailed over the No. 1 seed in an intense, fast-paced match that turned into a tennis psychodrama as it stretched into its sixth hour and evening fell across the Paris clay. 

It was ultimately decided by Sinner's dominance on short points, Alcaraz's new-found ability to impose his variety, and one of the greatest surges of the Spaniard's young career. It enshrines this young rivalry's place in global sport.

It is Alcaraz's fifth Grand Slam title and his second at the French Open, while this win is his first comeback from two-sets-to-love down in his career.

It takes Alcaraz and Sinner's head to head to 9-4 in the Spaniard's favor, and extends his winning streak over his nearest rival to five matches.

Below, The Athletic's writers, Charlie Eccleshare and Matt Futterman, analyze the final and what it means for tennis. Enjoy.

The winning moment.

What a point it was to win it, too.

Carlos Alcaraz smashed a forehand winner down the line and past the advancing Sinner to win it in characteristic fashion.

Celestial tennis in that tiebreak.

Jannik Sinner came close to becoming only the third man to win three consecutive Grand Slam tournaments in the Open Era, but for now it remains a five-man club with all-time greats featuring on the list.

The Italian arrived at the French Open on the back of winning the 2024 US Open and 2025 Australian Open and he took his unbeaten match run at the majors to 20 and was then one point away from winning the title as he had three match points against Carlos Alcaraz in the final.

But Alcaraz produced a miraculous recovery as he saved all three match points and went on to win 4-6, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (10-2) in five hours and 31 minutes in the second-longest Grand Slam final in history.

It means only five men – including Rod Laver and Novak Djokovic – have won three majors in a row since tennis turned professional in 1968.

The Australian remains the only man to win a Calendar Grand Slam as he achieved the feat in 1969 and, unsurprisingly, that was the year when he secured the three Grand Slams in a row achievement.

Of course, he won three in a row “twice” during his feat as you can say he won the first three majors of the year – the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon – or the final three of the season – the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open.

It would take another 24 years before another man achieved that particular record with Sampras making it a two-man club during the height of his career.

His run started at Wimbledon in 1993 and he then went on to win the US Open before completing the hat-trick at the 1994 Australian Open.

A two-man club turned into a three-man club in 2006 as Federer joined the list, but the Swiss then went on to go solo the following year as he became the first to win three Grand Slams in a row twice.

Federer first achieved the milestone when he won Wimbledon and the US Open in 2005 before securing the three-peat at the 2006 Australian Open.

After missing out on the French Open after losing the 2006 final against Rafael Nadal, he returned to complete the hat-trick again by winning the same three tournaments with the 2007 Australian Open earning him the milestone.

Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer have achieved one feat that has eluded Novak Djokovic so far

The 6 players to beat Novak Djokovic 3+ times in a row: ft. Jannik Sinner, Rafael Nadal

Nadal followed in his great rival's footsteps three years later as he became the fourth man to win three majors in a row.

The Spaniard's run started when he won the 2010 French Open – his seventh title at Roland Garros – and followed it up with a second Wimbledon trophy before beating Novak Djokovic in the final of the US Open for the hat-trick.

Anything Federer and Nadal could, Djokovic did better as he achieved this particular feat four (4!) times.

The first time he won three Grand Slams in a row was during the 2011 and 2012 season with the run starting at Wimbledon in 2011 before he went on to win the US Open and the 2012 Australian Open.

Djokovic then won four Grand Slams in a row, but it wasn't during a calendar year as he won Wimbledon and the US Open in 2014, and followed it up with the 2016 Australian Open to complete the hat-trick. For good measure, he won four consecutive majors as he lifted the French Open trophy as well.

In 2019, he moved ahead of Federer as he became the first to win three Slams in a row three times as he won Wimbledon and the US Open in 2018 and then added the Australian Open at the start of 2019.

And most recently he came close to emulating Laver as the only man to win the Calendar Grand Slam as he won the 2021 Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon to complete the hat-trick, but then came up short in the US Open final as he was beaten by Daniil Medvedev in the final.

Carlos Alcaraz extended his lead in his Big Titles Race with Jannik Sinner by making an unforgettable comeback against the Italian on Sunday in the Roland Garros final.

Sinner held three championship points in the fourth set to earn his third consecutive major and ninth Big Title. But instead of the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings moving within two Big Titles of his rival, the Spaniard now owns a four-trophy advantage.

Alcaraz now has 12 Big Titles, a combination of Grand Slam championships, trophies at the Nitto ATP Finals and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, and Olympic singles gold medals. The 22-year-old has won three of them during the clay-court season alone, having also emerged victorious in Monte-Carlo and Rome.

Big Titles Won: Alcaraz & Sinner




At 22 years and 34 days old, Alcaraz became the third-youngest man to win five Grand Slam titles in history. He only trails Bjorn Borg (22 years, 5 days) and Rafael Nadal (22 years, 33 days).

Alcaraz won his first major crown at the 2022 US Open as a 19-year-old, and he has now claimed at least one Slam in four consecutive seasons. The 22-year-old became the eighth man in the Open Era to successfully defend the Roland Garros title 

By triumphing at the clay-court major, Alcaraz has won a Big Title for every 4.2 tournaments he has played, moving ahead of Roger Federer (1 per 4.4) in win rate. Only Novak Djokovic (3.2) and Rafael Nadal (3.5) are ahead of Alcaraz. 

Sinner was trying to claim his third consecutive major title and move within a Wimbledon trophy of the Career Grand Slam. Alcaraz, who has won three of the four majors (except the Australian Open), has claimed the crowd at Roland Garros and Wimbledon twice each.

Carlos Alcaraz became just the ninth player to rally from two sets down and win a Grand Slam final in the Open Era when he came back to stun Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(10-2) for the Roland Garros trophy on Sunday.

Alcaraz entered the championship clash without a two-set comeback on his resume. Now he has a very important one and is 13-1 in five-setters, including 4-0 at Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

The 22-year-old is the fifth player to rally from two sets down in the Roland Garros final and the first since Gaston Gaudio surged past Guillermo Coria in 2004. This was the first final-set tie-break at the tournament in history.

Two-Set Comebacks In Grand Slam Finals






From the start of the Open Era in 1968 until Gaudio defeated Coria, only four men rallied from two sets down in a major final. Each of those occasions was in the Roland Garros championship match.

Since the 2020 US Open, in which Dominic Thiem shocked Alexander Zverev, there have now been five two-set comebacks in Grand Slam finals. This was the first one to happen at Roland Garros during that stretch.

In last year's Australian Open final, Sinner earned a two-set comeback of his own against Daniil Medvedev. However, this time he fell on the wrong side of the result.

 When Carlos Alcaraz stepped up to the line to serve at 3-5, 0/40 in the fourth set of Sunday's Roland Garros final, a Jannik Sinner victory seemed a near certainty. 

 The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Sinner, who led Alcaraz by two sets to one and a break, had powered a typically ferocious forehand, which Alcaraz could not return, to start the game. The pressure of the situation then appeared to get to Alcaraz, who helped Sinner to the brink of victory with a double fault and a forehand that went wide, digging a 0/40 deficit. 



 It was at that moment, with the relentless Sinner on the brink of his third consecutive major title, that the Alcaraz comeback began. With the next point into another baseline rally, it was Sinner who blinked first on his first championship point. The top seed struck a forehand on the run long. 

 Now at 15/40, Alcaraz fired his first serve long, but added enough kick to his second serve that a charging Sinner, who had moved in to take the ball early, was unable to prevent his backhand from flying long. 

 With one championship point left for Sinner at 30/40, the two great rivals entered another baseline exchange. This time, Sinner netted a forehand, and Alcaraz had resurrected his dwindling hopes of lifting the Coupe de Mousqetaires for the second consecutive year.

 Alcaraz delivered an ace and a stunning forehand thunderbolt to complete his escape for 4-5, but there was still the small issue of the Spaniard needing to break Sinner, whose precise serving had powered his Roland Garros run, in order to stay alive longer. The defending champion did just that, breaking to 15 to level at 5-5 and send the Court Philippe-Chatrier crowd into raptures. 

 Those proved to be the pivotal moments in one of the most gripping finals in recent memory. After falling behind an early mini-break at 0/2 in the fourth-set tie-break, Alcaraz produced a near-flawless display the rest of the way to level the match at two sets all. In the fifth set, Sinner reclaimed a break for 5-5 but Alcaraz dominated the deciding-set tie-break, which he at one point led 7/0, to complete a 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(10-2) win and secure his fifth major trophy.

It was a classic final on the red clay of Roland Garros.

Though things looked bleak early, Carlos Alcaraz successfully defended his French Open title, rallying to stun world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in an epic five-set marathon.

Alcaraz, 22, claimed his sixth career Grand Slam, coming back from a two-set deficit to win for the first time in his pro career, 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in a match that lasted 5 hours and 29 minutes.

It was the longest men's singles final in French Open history, surpassing the 4 hours and 42 minutes it took Mats Vilander to beat Guillermo Vilas in 1982.

The second-seeded Spaniard was in big trouble early as Sinner held him off in a second-set tiebreaker. But with the crowd at Court Phillippe-Chatrier behind him, Alcaraz summoned the inner strength to battle back -- fighting off three match points in the fourth set with Sinner serving for the championship.

Alcaraz's improbable comeback ended Sinner's bid for a third consecutive Grand Slam title, after the Italian had previously won the 2025 Australian Open and 2024 U.S. Open.

USA TODAY Sports will be providing updates for Sunday's men's final at Roland Garros:

There was just no way the final set in this record-setting marathon would be easy.

With a service break in the opening game of the decisive fifth set, Carlos Alcaraz was poised to complete his epic comeback from two sets down against Jannik Sinner.

Riding the momentum of his tiebreak win in the fourth set, Alcaraz quickly took the upper hand with a service break that put him ahead for the first time since early in the opening set.

Yet with Alcaraz serving for the championship, Sinner dug deep for a crucial service break that tied it back up 5-5 as the match passed the five-hour mark to become the longest men's final in French Open history.

Alcaraz ended it quickly in the final set tiebreaker, winning 10-2.

We'll be going to a fifth and deciding set in Paris.

Carlos Alcaraz fought off three championship points in the fourth set before pulling off a clutch service break as Jannik Sinner was serving for the match.

By holding serve at 6-5, the defending champion pulled even to extend the match. Despite losing the first two points of the tiebreaker, Alcaraz roared back with a pair of aces to win it 7-3.

Alcaraz has rallied from down two sets to win two of his own – setting up a winner-take-all Grand Slam showdown between the world's two best players on the clay courts of Roland Garros.

In his pro career, Carlos Alcaraz has never come back from two sets down to win a match. He's at least one step closer to that historic first after taking the third set from Jannik Sinner.

Alcaraz seemed to grab new life as he won an epic 22-shot point to close out a service break and take a 3-1 lead on Sinner, putting a finger to his ear to urge the crowd on.

But with the Spaniard serving for the set at 5-3, Sinner bounced back just in time with a break of his own.

And yet, somehow Alcaraz found a way to return the favor, breaking Sinner at love to win the set. That snaps Sinner's streak of 31 consecutive sets won in Grand Slam events.

Jannik Sinner is one set away from his third consecutive Grand Slam title.

An unforced error by Alcaraz at 15-30 in the second game gave Sinner an early opening in the second set. After saving one break point, Alcaraz hit a forehand long to give Sinner a 2-0 edge.

Despite trailing 4-1, Alcaraz refused to give in. After holding serve to make it 4-2, he began pumping his arms in an effort to get the crowd fired up. He's clearly the fan favorite here at Court Phillippe-Chatrier.

Perhaps buoyed by the fan support, Alcaraz surged back with a clutch break in the ninth game to get back on serve – paving the way to a tiebreaker.

Alcaraz saved one set point on Sinner's serve, but couldn't hold his own in falling 7-4 in the tiebreaker.

The first game on the storied clay court was a 12-minute mini-marathon as Sinner finally held serve. That would be a portent of things to come in the opening set.

The two heavyweights traded a pair of service breaks midway through before Sinner stunningly ended the progression by breaking Alcaraz at 5-4 to take the first set.

Officially, it took one hour and two minutes to complete. We could be in for a classic.

There has been a slight delay in the proceedings, but we're now ready to go in the 2025 French Open men's final.

Sinner will serve first.

The French Open men's final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will start Sunday at 9 a.m. ET (3 p.m. in Paris).

The French Open men's final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will be broadcast live on TNT.

Tournament's No. 1 seed

Tournament's No. 2 seed

Alcaraz has a 7-4 head-to-head advantage over Sinner going into Sunday's final. Alcaraz also has a 2-1 edge over Sinner on clay, most recently on May 18 in the Italian Opne final, where Alcaraz defeated Sinner 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 in Rome. The two previously met at the 2024 French Open in the semifinal round. Alcaraz downed Sinner 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in a five-set thriller en route to winning his first French Open and third career Grand Slam singles title. Alcaraz has won the last four matches against Sinner. Sinner last defeated Alacarz in October 2023 at the China Open in Beijing 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 on a hard court.

Aryna Sabalenka wants to set the record straight following the controversial comments that were made after her Roland Garros final defeat to Coco Gauff.Taking to her Instagram story Sunday, the world No. 1 reflected on a tough day at the office while recognizing that her opponent rose to the occasion with the cards both competitors were dealt."Yesterday was a tough one. Coco handled the conditions much better than I did and fully deserved the win. She was the better player yesterday, and I want to give her the credit she earned,” wrote Sabalenka.

"Yesterday was a tough one. Coco handled the conditions much better than I did and fully deserved the win. She was the better player yesterday, and I want to give her the credit she earned,” wrote Sabalenka.

Sabalenka was broken nine times during the 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 loss, winning 48 percent of her first-serve points. She also contributed 70 unforced errors, with 39 coming on the backhand side."You all know me... I'm always going to be honest and human in how I process these moments. I made over 70 unforced errors, so I can't pretend it was a great day for me. But both things can be true... I didn't play my best, and Coco stepped up and played with poise and purpose.During her post-match press conference, Sabalenka described her performance as “the worst final I ever played.” But the three-time major winner had also expressed a belief that Iga Swiatek would have defeated Gauff had the three-time defending champion advanced past Sabalenka in their semifinal.“if Iga would win me another day, I think she would go out today and she would get the win,” Sabalenka declared.

Gauff responded that it wasn't “a fair thing to say” and had preferred to play Swiatek given her recent 6-1, 6-1 win over the Pole.“The way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favorite to win. So I think she was the best person that I could have played in the final,” said Gauff.“Neither of them would have been the better shot. But it played out how it played out. That's why I'm here today.”

In her reflection 24 hours later, Sabalenka said of the American, “She earned that title. Respect.”As for Sabalenka's next move, the 27-year-old previously shared that her plans to disconnect from tennis would involve a trip to Mykonos full of tequila, gummy bears and swimming.“Time to rest, learn, and come back stronger."

Emma Raducanu felt “pretty good” after completing her first rigorous grass-court training session of the season as she manages an ongoing back issue in the build-up to Wimbledon.

The 2021 US Open champion, who suffered a second-round exit to Iga Swiatek at the French Open, has been hindered by persistent spasming for much of 2025.

She is set to play at Queens this week, with grand slam action at the All England Club scheduled to start on Monday, June 30.

“I got back (from Paris) last week and then I got straight back on the court,” Raducanu told a press conference.

“I had a small interruption with a bit of a back spasm again, which was a bit annoying and that hindered my grass prep. But the last few days I have managed to get on the grass.

“I can't really predict the future. I know I have been managing my back for the last few weeks now and it's something that comes and goes.

“It can be frustrating. I try not to let it get to me because I have a pretty good feel when it happens of how to manage it. All I can do is deal with what's in front of me

“Today was the first day I opened it up and played points on the grass. It is pretty early days and I can't say I have had a lot of prep on it. But I felt pretty good today.”

British number two Raducanu, who is ranked 41st in the world, was dismantled 6-1 6-2 by reigning champion Swiatek at Roland Garros.

Subject to overcoming a qualifier, she could face current Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova in the second round at Queens, while she is set to pair up with British number one Katie Boulter in the doubles.

“Playing a doubles match with Katie will hopefully give me a good feel for that surface and it will be positive,” the 22-year-old said.

“I really like playing with Katie. We've practised a few times together in the past at Billie Jean King Cup ties.”

20:55 CET - CARLOS ALCARAZ HAS JUST WON THE LONGEST ROLAND GARROS FINAL EVER - AND ONE OF THE GREATEST MATCHES OF TENNIS EVER - TO WIN HIS SECOND FRENCH OPEN CROWN!

The Spaniard was two sets down and staring down the barrel against world number one Jannik Sinner, but after saving three championship points in the fourth set, Alcaraz mounted a truly remarkable comeback to win in a final set tiebreak, 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 in a whopping five hours and 30 minutes. It is the second-longest Grand Slam final of all time.

Sinner will be absolutely heartbroken after missing his huge chance in the fourth set, and he has now lost his first Slam final. For Alcaraz, he is a five-time major winner and has won his second here in Paris.

Read our full match report of the final here.

20:47 CET - This match is getting the climax it deserves. We are heading to a final-set tiebreak to decide the French Open champion

20:33 CET - I can't believe what I am witnessing. With Carlos Alcaraz serving for the match, it is Jannik Sinner's turn to break back and make it 5-5 in the decider. What is going on?

19:47 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has an early break in the fifth set! All the momentum is with him now in this phenomenal match.

19:38 CET - Absolutely astonishing scenes here at the French Open as Carlos Alcaraz takes the fourth set 7-6(3), with this sensational final heads to a fifth set. Jannik Sinner will be devastated that he didn't take his chances, and now there is all to play for in the last set of this tournament.

19:22 CET - Incredible scenes here at Roland Garros, with Carlos Alcaraz saving three championship points on his own serve, then breaking back at 5-4 to bring it back level at 5-5. We are not done yet! Heartbreak for Jannik Sinner but jubilation for Alcaraz.

19:04 CET - A potentially HUGE moment in this match. Jannik Sinner has the first break of the set to take a 4-3 lead, and he is just two games away from his first French Open title.

19:01 CET - Midway through the fourth set, the pair are locked at 3-3. Incredible tension around Philippe-Chatrier.

18:29 CET - Jannik Sinner has lost a set of tennis at a Grand Slam for the first time since the Australian Open fourth round! Carlos Alcaraz produced an exceptional set to win it 6-4, breaking Sinner to love in the 10th game. Huge pressure now on the world number one as Alcaraz attempts a seismic comeback.

18:26 CET - Right in the nick of time, Jannik Sinner has broken back! Carlos Alcaraz was serving to take the third set at 5-3, but the Italian pounced. What a crucial few games we have coming up.

After being broken back when serving for the set, he kept his cool in typical Sinner fashion to regather himself, and has now put himself in a strong position to clinch his first French Open title against a player whose level seems to be constantly fluctuating. 

Remember: Alcaraz has never won from two sets down before. He has a mountain to climb.

17:18 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has broken back at the perfect time! With Jannik Sinner serving for the second set at 5-3, the Spaniard has capitalised on some poor serving from his opponent to get back into the contest.

16:31 CET - After a sensational set that lasted just over an hour, Jannik Sinner has landed the first real blow, winning it 6-4. There was some otherworldly tennis on show, but Carlos Alcaraz produced a few really poor errors in the 10th game to give his rival the set. Can the defending champion bounce back?

16:11 CET - Jannik Sinner has the break back in the very next game! Brilliant from the world number one.

16:05 CET - There is the break for Carlos Alcaraz! It has been a high-quality start to the match, and the Spaniard has first blood, taking a 3-2 lead!

15:40 CET - A stunning 12-minute first game has seen Jannik Sinner just about hang onto his serve. How about that for a start!

15:27 CET - Right then, we are underway! Let's hope it is a classic!

15:10 CET - World number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz are about to head out to the court to contest the 2025 French Open men's final!

Stay tuned to the Tennis Tracker for major updates throughout the match or follow it point-by-point via the link below.

13:26 CET - Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini are the women's doubles French Open champions! The Italian duo have followed up their triumph in Rome with victory here in Paris, beating Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1.

On the same court in which they clinched Olympic Gold just under a year ago, they are victorious once more. For Errani, it is her ninth Grand Slam title in doubles, while Paolini has her hands on her very first. A great moment for both of them, as Italian tennis continues to thrive.

11:30 CET - Welcome back to the Tennis Tracker on the final day of the French Open, and what an absolute treat there is in store.

Before the tournament began, every tennis fan would have wanted to see world number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the showpiece event, and that is exactly what has happened.

Sinner has had a near-flawless run to the final. Taking part in his second tournament since returning from a drugs ban, the Italian hasn't dropped a single set and saw off 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in a high-quality last-four clash.

His relentless and suffocating brand of tennis has been too much for anyone, and he will be looking to produce that against an opponent who has beaten him in their last four meetings. Victory would see him win his first French Open and fourth Grand Slam, which would take him level with Alcaraz.

It hasn't been as plain sailing for Alcaraz, who has dropped a set in four of his matches. He didn't look his best against Lorenzo Musetti in his semi-final, but eventually managed to overcome his ailing opponent, who retired with an injury in the fourth set.

However, Alcaraz tends to save his best for Sinner, and there is little doubt that the Spaniard is a better clay-court player than his rival. At one point, Alcaraz trailed the head-to-head 4-3, but now leads it 7-4. If he can continue his winning run over Sinner, he will pick up his second title at Roland Garros and his fifth Slam.

It is a match that is so hard to call, and everyone will be hoping that it is an absolute thriller. Neither player has lost in a Grand Slam final before, so something will have to give. Proceedings get underway around 15:00 CET.

Emma Raducanu has revealed that she suffered another injury setback ahead of her Queen's campaign. The world No. 41 is starting her grass swing on home soil but hasn't been able to get as much time on the surface as she would have liked after a back issue resurfaced following the French Open.

Raducanu had been dealing with back spasms in Strasbourg last month and said she wasn't feeling 100 per cent going into Roland Garros. She still reached the second round there, but after returning home, her grass preparations were interrupted. The 22-year-old has only just started playing points in practice again, though she's raring to go at the Queen's Club, where she has also entered the doubles draw with Katie Boulter.

Ahead of the WTA 500 at Queen's, Raducanu explained: “I got back, like, end of last week, and then I had two days off after I finished in Paris and then got straight back on the court.

“Had a small interruption with a bit of a back spasm again, so that was a bit annoying. So that kind of hindered my grass prep, but the last few days I've managed to get on the grass and kind of just begin to try and find my feet.”

Raducanu still has a packed schedule for the grass swing and will also play in Berlin and Eastbourne before Wimbledon. For now, she is happy to manage the back issue.

“I can't really predict the future, how it's going to be, I know I've been managing my back for the last few weeks now, and it's something that comes and goes,” she continued.

“But, I mean, overall, I just have to manage what I can take care of and if these things happen, then I just need to deal with it and just keep doing the right things.

“It can be frustrating. I think when I was playing in Strasbourg in my second round match, it definitely hindered me, and first round in Paris, but I got through.

“And I think that just having to manage it, knowing that it keeps coming back, but I try not to let it get to me because I think I have a pretty good feel overall of when it happens, what to do and how to manage it. It does take a few days out, but all I can do is kind of deal with what's in front of me.”

Raducanu will open her singles campaign at Queen's against a qualifier. If she makes it to the second round, she'll face either reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova or Rebecca Sramkova.

But she doesn't have high expectations after her back issue flared up again.

She added: “My expectations, truthfully, are pretty low because as I said, I played points for the first time today.

“I've had maybe like, two, three days on the grass court, so it's not been much. But I just have to take it as it goes. I know that I'm doing what I can and I've dealt with everything as best as I can.”

Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu are to play doubles together for the first time in a British dream team at Queen's this week.

British No 1 Boulter has confirmed that the pair plan to team up as women return to Queen's for the first time in more than 50 years.

They will join forces alongside their commitments in the singles draw in order to maximise court time, as the grass season gets under way at the prestigious West Kensington club.

“I think myself and Emma, we've been wanting to play for a while now,” Boulter said on Sunday. “I think we've talked about it a lot of times, and unfortunately, it just hasn't quite happened for various reasons. I think [for the] first week on grass, to get a couple more matches is super important.

“I think we were actually here at Queen's, practising on the clay, and we decided we thought we'd come back and play on the grass together.

“It'll be extremely special. Obviously, she's a great player, and I'm looking forward to having the first of many more.”

Boulter, 28, and Raducanu, 22, have been neck-and-neck for the British No 1 spot this year, with the former set to move to a world ranking of No 34 on Monday and the latter just three spots behind her at No 37.

Their campaigns at Queen's therefore will be hugely influential in their attempts to secure a ranked seeding for Wimbledon next month, which will go to the top 32 seeds.

Raducanu faces a tough ask at Queen's though, having been drawn in the same half as top seed Zheng Qinwen, the reigning Olympic champion and world No 7. Should she progress from an opening round tie against a qualifier, Raducanu will come up against Barbora Krejcikova, last year's Wimbledon champion.

Boulter will also face a qualifier in the first round with a potential meeting in the second round against fifth seed Diana Shnaider.

The pair will then team up in the doubles to take on the Chinese duo of Wu Fang-Hsien and Jiang Xinyu, with a potential meeting with fellow British team Jodie Burrage and Sonay Kartal on the cards.

Raducanu also confirmed the latest development in her ongoing coaching saga with the return of Nick Cavaday, the man who decided to step away from the role earlier this year in order to prioritise his own health.

Cavaday oversaw Raducanu's training session on Sunday at Queen's and the 2021 US Open champion confirmed that he will team up with her current coach, Mark Petchey, having filled in this week while the latter remains in Paris on television commentary duty.

“I'm happy to see him healthy, first of all,” said Raducanu, who split from Cavaday in January to leave her looking for a seventh full-time coach in three-and-a-half years as a professional.

“I mean, it's been such a long time since we were last on court together in Australia, and Mark is in Paris commentating, so Nick was around and it was nice to just have a few days with him.”

Raducanu confirmed that the appointment of both Cavaday and Petchey will continue through to the end of Wimbledon next month. “They'll both be helping me throughout the grass,” she added.

“I think having Mark and Nick... both people who have banks of experience and I think they can complement each other really well and I trust both of them a lot. So that is a big fundamental for me. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to this upcoming season and see how it goes.”

Other British players to have secured wildcards are Kartal, Burrage and Francesca Jones, who will all feature in the first women's championship at Queen's Club since 1973.

Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu are to play doubles together for the first time in a British dream team at Queen's this week.

British No 1 Boulter has confirmed that the pair plan to team up as women return to Queen's for the first time in more than 50 years.

They will join forces alongside their commitments in the singles draw in order to maximise court time, as the grass season gets under way at the prestigious West Kensington club.

“I think myself and Emma, we've been wanting to play for a while now,” Boulter said on Sunday. “I think we've talked about it a lot of times, and unfortunately, it just hasn't quite happened for various reasons. I think [for the] first week on grass, to get a couple more matches is super important.

“I think we were actually here at Queen's, practising on the clay, and we decided we thought we'd come back and play on the grass together.

“It'll be extremely special. Obviously, she's a great player, and I'm looking forward to having the first of many more.”

Boulter, 28, and Raducanu, 22, have been neck-and-neck for the British No 1 spot this year, with the former set to move to a world ranking of No 34 on Monday and the latter just three spots behind her at No 37.

Raducanu faces a tough ask at Queen's though, having been drawn in the same half as top seed Zheng Qinwen, the reigning Olympic champion and world No 7. Should she progress from an opening round tie against a qualifier, Raducanu will come up against Barbora Krejcikova, last year's Wimbledon champion.

The back of Raducanu's clay season was impacted by back issues, with the 22-year-old revealing that she had suffered from irregular spasms that kept impacting her ability to train and play. As a result of the ongoing issues, her hopes are not high heading into the grass-court season.

“Of course you want to win the tournament like every tournament, but especially when it's at home,” Raducanu said. “My expectations, truthfully, are pretty low because I played points for the first time today and I've had maybe two or three days on the grass courts so it's not been much.

“Today was the first day I opened it up and played points on the grass so it's pretty early days. I wouldn't say I've had a lot of prep on it but I felt pretty good today. Playing with Katie in a doubles match on the grass hopefully will help give a good feel of how it is to serve, to move and to react to balls on that surface.

“I know I've been managing my back for the last few weeks now and that's something that comes and goes. Overall I just have to manage what I can take care of and if it does happen then I just need to deal with it and just keep doing the right thing.”

Boulter will also face a qualifier in the first round with a potential meeting in the second round against fifth seed Diana Shnaider.

The pair will then team up in the doubles to take on the Chinese duo of Wu Fang-Hsien and Jiang Xinyu, with a potential meeting with fellow British team Jodie Burrage and Sonay Kartal on the cards.

Cavaday oversaw Raducanu's training session on Sunday at Queen's and the 2021 US Open champion confirmed that he will team up with her current coach, Mark Petchey, having filled in this week while the latter remains in Paris on television commentary duty.

“I'm happy to see him healthy, first of all,” said Raducanu, who split from Cavaday in January to leave her looking for a seventh full-time coach in three-and-a-half years as a professional.

“I mean, it's been such a long time since we were last on court together in Australia, and Mark is in Paris commentating, so Nick was around and it was nice to just have a few days with him.”

Raducanu confirmed that the appointment of both Cavaday and Petchey will continue through to the end of Wimbledon next month. “They'll both be helping me throughout the grass,” she added.

“I think having Mark and Nick... both people who have banks of experience and I think they can complement each other really well and I trust both of them a lot. So that is a big fundamental for me. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to this upcoming season and see how it goes.”

Other British players to have secured wildcards are Kartal, Burrage and Francesca Jones, who will all feature in the first women's championship at Queen's Club since 1973.

19:22 CET - Incredible scenes here at Roland Garros, with Carlos Alcaraz saving three championship points on his own serve, then breaking back at 5-4 to bring it back level at 5-5. We are not done yet! Heartbreak for Jannik Sinner but jubilation for Alcaraz.

19:04 CET - A potentially HUGE moment in this match. Jannik Sinner has the first break of the set to take a 4-3 lead, and he is just two games away from his first French Open title.

19:01 CET - Midway through the fourth set, the pair are locked at 3-3. Incredible tension around Philippe-Chatrier.

18:29 CET - Jannik Sinner has lost a set of tennis at a Grand Slam for the first time since the Australian Open fourth round! Carlos Alcaraz produced an exceptional set to win it 6-4, breaking Sinner to love in the 10th game. Huge pressure now on the world number one as Alcaraz attempts a seismic comeback.

18:26 CET - Right in the nick of time, Jannik Sinner has broken back! Carlos Alcaraz was serving to take the third set at 5-3, but the Italian pounced. What a crucial few games we have coming up.

18:05 CET - And just like that, Carlos Alcaraz has broken again to go 3-1 up! Is this the start of a miraculous comeback?

17:52 CET - But Carlos Alcaraz has broken right back with some brilliant tennis! What a start to the second set!

17:46 CET - Just like at the start of the second set, Jannik Sinner has an early break at the start of the third. Carlos Alcaraz is in trouble.

17:40 CET - Jannik Sinner has just won a huge and utterly critical second set against Carlos Alcaraz, hitting top gear in the tiebreak to go 6-4, 7-6(4) up. After being broken back when serving for the set, he kept his cool in typical Sinner fashion to regather himself, and has now put himself in a strong position to clinch his first French Open title against a player whose level seems to be constantly fluctuating. 

Remember: Alcaraz has never won from two sets down before. He has a mountain to climb.

17:18 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has broken back at the perfect time! With Jannik Sinner serving for the second set at 5-3, the Spaniard has capitalised on some poor serving from his opponent to get back into the contest.

16:43 CET - And now an early break for Jannik Sinner at the start of the second set! The Italian is oozing confidence and has a 2-0 lead.

16:31 CET - After a sensational set that lasted just over an hour, Jannik Sinner has landed the first real blow, winning it 6-4. There was some otherworldly tennis on show, but Carlos Alcaraz produced a few really poor errors in the 10th game to give his rival the set. Can the defending champion bounce back?

16:11 CET - Jannik Sinner has the break back in the very next game! Brilliant from the world number one.

16:05 CET - There is the break for Carlos Alcaraz! It has been a high-quality start to the match, and the Spaniard has first blood, taking a 3-2 lead!

15:40 CET - A stunning 12-minute first game has seen Jannik Sinner just about hang onto his serve. How about that for a start!

15:27 CET - Right then, we are underway! Let's hope it is a classic!

15:10 CET - World number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz are about to head out to the court to contest the 2025 French Open men's final!

Stay tuned to the Tennis Tracker for major updates throughout the match or follow it point-by-point via the link below.

13:26 CET - Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini are the women's doubles French Open champions! The Italian duo have followed up their triumph in Rome with victory here in Paris, beating Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1.

On the same court in which they clinched Olympic Gold just under a year ago, they are victorious once more. For Errani, it is her ninth Grand Slam title in doubles, while Paolini has her hands on her very first. A great moment for both of them, as Italian tennis continues to thrive.

11:30 CET - Welcome back to the Tennis Tracker on the final day of the French Open, and what an absolute treat there is in store.

Before the tournament began, every tennis fan would have wanted to see world number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the showpiece event, and that is exactly what has happened.

Sinner has had a near-flawless run to the final. Taking part in his second tournament since returning from a drugs ban, the Italian hasn't dropped a single set and saw off 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in a high-quality last-four clash.

His relentless and suffocating brand of tennis has been too much for anyone, and he will be looking to produce that against an opponent who has beaten him in their last four meetings. Victory would see him win his first French Open and fourth Grand Slam, which would take him level with Alcaraz.

It hasn't been as plain sailing for Alcaraz, who has dropped a set in four of his matches. He didn't look his best against Lorenzo Musetti in his semi-final, but eventually managed to overcome his ailing opponent, who retired with an injury in the fourth set.

However, Alcaraz tends to save his best for Sinner, and there is little doubt that the Spaniard is a better clay-court player than his rival. At one point, Alcaraz trailed the head-to-head 4-3, but now leads it 7-4. If he can continue his winning run over Sinner, he will pick up his second title at Roland Garros and his fifth Slam.

It is a match that is so hard to call, and everyone will be hoping that it is an absolute thriller. Neither player has lost in a Grand Slam final before, so something will have to give. Proceedings get underway around 15:00 CET.

In a shocking turn of events, the tennis world is buzzing with anticipation as a new American dream seems to be unfolding in the year 2025. With the likes of Madison Keys and Coco Gauff already making waves in Melbourne and Paris, the spotlight is now on Wimbledon, where a bold prediction has been made by former tennis pro Mardy Fish.

The 2025 Grand Slam season started off with a bang as Madison Keys claimed her first major title at the Australian Open, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in a thrilling final. Following Keys' triumph, Coco Gauff continued the American success story by clinching her second Grand Slam title at the French Open, solidifying her name alongside legends like Serena Williams.

Looking ahead to Wimbledon, Mardy Fish has caused a stir by backing Jessica Pegula as his top pick for the grass-court glory. Pegula, known for her resilience on the WTA tour, has had a rollercoaster season marked by both triumphs and setbacks. Despite a disappointing exit at the French Open, Fish's unwavering confidence in Pegula has set the stage for a potential American sweep of the Grand Slam titles this year.

As the tennis world gears up for Wimbledon, all eyes will be on Jessica Pegula as she aims to overcome recent challenges and make her mark on the prestigious tournament. With Madison Keys and Coco Gauff already setting the stage on fire in 2025, Pegula has the opportunity to rise above the criticism and shine on the grass courts of SW19. Will she be able to turn the tide and fulfill the American dream at the third Slam of the year? Stay tuned for all the action and drama as Wimbledon unfolds.

Coco Gauff became the first American in a decade to lift the trophy after the women's singles final at Roland-Garros and she was asked what it means to represent the United States. 

After defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in three sets to win the French Open, Gauff was asked what it's like traveling the world as an American.

"It means a lot. Obviously there's a lot going on in our country right now," Gauff responded, via The Tennis Letter. "Just to be a representation of that and a representation of people that look like me in America, who maybe don't feel as supported during this time period. Being that reflection of hope and light for those people."

Gauff continued by bringing up this past year's presidential election, and the response by the country after President Donald Trump was elected for his second term. She referred to it as a "down period" in the States. 

"I remember after the election and everything, it felt like a down period a little bit. My mom told me during Riyadh, try to win the tournament just to give people something to smile for. That's what I was thinking about today," Gauff said. 

Despite the "down period" comment, Gauff said she is "definitely patriotic."

"Some people may feel some type of way about being patriotic and things like that, but I'm definitely patriotic. I'm proud to be American. I'm proud to represent Americans that look like me and people who kind of support the things that I support," Gauff added.

The 21-year-old dropped to the clay and covered her face at Roland-Garros following a thrilling match against Sabalenka. Gauff lost the first set in a tiebreak, but fought back to win the second set, 6-2, and came away with her second Grand Slam after a third-set 6-4 finish. 

The last American to win the French Open? Serena Williams lifted the trophy in 2015. 

"The crowd really helped me today," Gauff said after the match, as celebrities like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman and many more were noticeably cheering her on throughout the match. "You guys were cheering for me so hard, and I don't know what I did to deserve so much love from the French crowd. But I appreciate you guys."

Updated 25s ago

Carlos Alcaraz produced a comeback for the ages to defeat Jannik Sinner and take the 2025 French Open final in a six-hour instant classic in Paris.

Alcaraz, 22, defended his title by coming back from two sets down and saving three championship points to win 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2).

The Spaniard was broken twice as the world No. 1 started in strong fashion on Court Philippe-Chatrier, and went two sets behind after being edged out of the second-set tiebreak at Roland Garros.

Alcaraz won three breaks in the third set and won a dramatic tiebreak to dramatically level before he went 7-0 up in the championship breaker with some celestial tennis and sealed his triumph with a laser forehand.

He added: “I feel the same (that winning was a miracle). I didn't know what I did to win the match, three match points down. My grandfather, I'm pretty sure he was watching from home. I hope he is proud of my performance.

“I tried not to think about anything else, just to go point after point with a positive mind, with everything I had inside. To overcome the problems, trying to play much better tennis than Jannik. 

“It was very difficult in some moments but I'm proud and very happy about how I dealt with everything today. To say it was one of the best finals in the history of a Grand Slam is really high status.

“I have to say there have been more or better finals, Novak Djokovic vs. Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open final. I'm just really happy to put my name into one of the longest finals, in the history of the Grand Slam, Roland Garros.

“I'm really happy, especially for Samu, his first Grand Slam as a coach. I'm gonna celebrate tonight, I'm not gonna lie!”

Alcaraz, courtside, speaks on TNT Sports.

He added: “Yeah, it was honestly amazing. To put into words is really difficult. Being two sets down against the world No. 1, the level he was playing was unbelievable. The first match I came back from two sets down.

“I just put my heart into it, tried to keep it going, not thinking about the result, just putting my tennis on. Not giving up. It was just fighting, fighting, thinking point after point. 

“At the end of the fifth set I was just playing with the heart, and I think I did OK.”

Carlos, you think you did OK?

The trophy he so dearly merits.

...to ecstasy.

From agony...

He deserves the crown, the Spanish supernova.

He added: “I just want to say thank you to my team, my family, I have the privilege to live great things with you. 

“I was lucky to have a lot of friends from home, from Murcia, to support. Amazing support you have given to me today, throughout the whole two weeks. Even those who are at home who couldn't come.

“Thank you very much and this trophy is yours as well. This tournament is really special, I can't wait to come here year after year. Special thank you to (tournament director) Amelie (Mauresmo), congratulations as well, it's not easy to be with us.

“To Paris, you have been really important support to me since the first practice for the first round. You were insane, unbelievable for me. I can't thank you enough. You were really important, you are in my heart and you will always be.

“Thank you very much and see you next year.”

He said: “Hi everyone. I wanted to start with Jannik. It is amazing the level you have, congratulations for an amazing two weeks, an amazing tournament. I know the hard work you put in every day. I know how hard you chase this tournament.

“I'm pretty sure you're gonna be champion here many, many times. It's a privilege to share the court with you. I'm just really happy to be able to make history with you in this tournament, in other tournaments.

“You are a huge inspiration for the kids, and for me as well. So thank you, and good luck for all that is coming in the future.”

He lifts the magnificent Coupe des Mousquetaires, in his black and white top.

He stares at his reflection and looks back at the man who put in one of the all-time great Grand Slam final performances.

Let's hear from him, right here, right after the Spanish national anthem.

Don't go anywhere!

And Jannik Sinner continued: “Thank you so much to all the ball kids, you do an amazing job, you make our life so much easier. To our chair umpires, thank you so much. It's a big, big privilege to play here. Paris is a special place. 

“It's an amazing trophy so I won't sleep very well tonight, but it's OK. Thank you to the organizers for making it such a special event. 

“Obviously the support has been amazing these couple of weeks. You are amazing. Again, thank you guys. See you next year.”

The runner-up holds up his silver award to applause.

He says on Philippe-Chatrier: “Hello everyone. First of all, Carlos, congrats. Again, an amazing performance, amazing battle. To you and your team, amazing job, I'm very happy for you, and you deserve it, so congrats.

“It's easier to play than talking now. To my team, thank you so much for putting me in this position. We tried our best today, we gave everything we had. Still an amazing tournament, even though it's very, very difficult now, but it's OK.”

Madness, this.

A righteous roar of delight from Carlos Alcaraz.

...but it went by in the blink of an eye.

What on earth have we just witnessed? 

It's hard to place these things in historical context straight away, but there will undoubtedly be comparisons made with Borg-McEnroe Wimbledon 1980, Federer-Nadal Wimbledon 2008 and Djokovic-Nadal Australian Open 2012. 

A truly absurd final.

                All about the Jannik Sinner household.            

When World No. 1 Jannik Sinner steps onto the court, one has got to feel sorry for the tennis balls. The 23-year-old Italian is one of the most brutal offensive maestros on tour. A three-time Grand Slam champion, Sinner is turning glory-hunter in a positive sense at Roland Garros 2025. The reigning Australian Open and US Open winner will battle Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday in a bid to capture his maiden French Open trophy.

Behind every successful tennis player, is a supportive family that has sacrificed a lot. There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes which fans are occasionally unaware of. Over the years, Sinner has repeatedly stressed on the importance of his team and family. Born in South Tyrol, he started playing tennis at the age of 7 since his father liked the sport. But did you know that Jannik Sinner also has a brother? Let's find out more about him.

Mark Sinner is the elder brother of ATP starlet Jannik Sinner. He was born in Russia in 1998, making him close to three years older than Jannik. Sinner has previously tagged his elder brother Mark as his best friend and a close confidant.

On several occasions, Mark is not seen at his brother Jannik Sinner's matches. He is currently working as a trainer for the fire brigade in South Tyrol, near Austria. He reportedly said in a 2023 interview, “The relationship with Jannik is normal, like that of most brothers. We played tennis – we tried at least. For a few years, I managed to keep up with him. Then he took off and it was impossible to exchange shots.”

After his glorious triumph at the 2025 Australian Open where he retained his crown, Sinner was open in his admissions. “Having Mark here was maybe the best part of the victory. Nobody knows me better than him. For me, he is an important person. I call him, I confide in him, I know that I can tell him everything and he understands me.”

Yes, Jannik Sinner's brother Mark is adopted. He was reportedly born in Rostov-on-Don which lies in Russia. At the age of 9 months, he was adopted by the Sinner household. Parents Hanspeter and Siglinde worked as a chef and waitress respectively, and gave birth to Jannik two years after adopting Mark.

Sinner was born on August 16, 2001 in the town of Innichen in South Tyrol, Italy. He grew up in Sexten which is his family hometown. Sinner's mother Siglinde has German roots and his father Hanspeter worked as a chef when they grew up. In fact, his love for tennis was one of the primary reasons for Jannik to pick up the racquet and start playing the sport.

After overcoming Daniil Medvedev in a thrilling 2024 Australian Open final, Sinner expressed his heartfelt gratitude to his parents. “I wish that everyone could have my parents, because they let me choose whatever I wanted to,” he emoted. “Even when I was younger, I tried some other sports and they never put pressure on me. I wish that this freedom is possible for as many young kids as possible. Thank you so much to my parents!”

Carlos Alcaraz came back from two sets down to beat Jannik Sinner in a fifth-set tiebreak, retaining his title in one of the greatest finals ever played, in any sport

And oh! Tumani's report is here! Enjoy, and that really is that.

Oh, and don't miss this!

That, then is us. What an absolute joy and honour it's been to experience one of the greatest finals ever, in any sport; what an absolute joy and honour it's been to bring it to you. As I type, Sinner signs autographs, which tells us everything about what this is: a triumph of the human spirit. I'll level with you, I'm quite keen to stop typing now, but at the same time, the last thing I want to do is stop typing now – how can it be over? Except it'll never be over: it'll be part of us all, enshrined in the annals of humanity for eternity. Thanks so much for sharing it with us we'll be back three weeks tomorrow for Wimbledon, with a bit of Queen's Club between now and then. But otherwise, it's been epochal; peace and love, mates.

“Hi everyone,” Alcaraz begins. “I want to start with Jannik”. He then praises his opponent for his hard work, assuring him he'll win this tournament many times and it's a privilege to share the court and make history with him.

He then thanks him for being a “great inspiration” as Sinner looks into the middle distance, trying to hold it down, the moves on to his family and team.

He's lucky to have a lot of people who've come from Murcia to support him, along with those at home, telling them the trophy is theirs too.

This tournament is very special for him and he can't wait to come back year after year, thanking Amelie Mauresmo, the tournament director and acknowledging it's not easy to deal with the players.

Next, it's thanks for the crowd – You are in my heart, you'll always be in my heart, thanks very much, see you next year.”

And that's our lot – but what a lot it's been.

Now it's Alcaraz to receive the trophy, which he holds aloft, businesslike look on his coupon. He then hugs it tight, kisses it, and tears well. What a human being – and he's only 22! Next, the Spanish anthem…

Sinner takes the mic and the crowd roar his name. “Hello everyone,” he begins in typically understated fashion; I'm absolutely gone.

He congratulates Alcaraz on an “amazing performance, amazing battle, amazing everything” – he's not wrong. “I'm very happy for you,” he says. “You deserve it.” Gosh, what a mensch.

“It's easier to play than talking … now,” he continues, before thanking his team for putting him in this position. “We tried our best today, we gave everything we had,” he says, adding that a while ago they'd have signed up for this. “An amazing tournament, even though it's very very difficult now, but it's OK.”

He then thanks the ball kids on an amazing job – the look in their eyes as they gaze up at him is beautiful. He then talks about how great Paris is, concedes that he won't sleep very well tonight, says thanks again, and off he goes.

Well expletive played, old mate, well played.

Here comes Jannik. Oh mate, you absolute hero. I think my eyeballs might be sweating.

Andre Agassi, who came back from two sets down to beat Andriy Medvedev to win this trophy in 1999, is here to present it to Alcaraz. What an honour for both of them.

You know what's mad? There's another decade-odd of this to come, assuming the world doesn't end in a minute, now humanity has justified its purpose on this planet. How can we carry on?

Alcaraz sits alone, watching the screen as it replays his miraculous deeds, then begins laughing. He is history.

I hope that, in the fullness of time, Sinner can feel pride in this match – he contributed just as much to it as Alcaraz and it'll be part of both of them for evermore. Lots of great teams and players lost the match for which they're best remembered – Australia's men's cricket team of 2005; the Hungary football team at the 1954 World Cup; Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2008. Sinner will come again, he will win that trophy, and what he now has, that he will never lose, is the love of the people.

The players embrace, but Sinner doesn't really want any of it – his head is spinning, you can see it in his eyes, and Alcaraz races up to his box, joining a huddle of contagious, inspiring ecstasy. I am in awe of both of these players, we'll all be talking about this match for as long as talking is a thing.

One last astounding forehand winner, and Alcaraz is the champion again! He collapses onto the red clay, arm over eyes, and what on earth has he done? What on earth has Sinner done! Thank you boys, thank you so, so much.

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-6 Alcaraz (2-9) Sinner goes down the line with a backhand but he's long, just; a service-winner follows, and Alcaraz has seven championship points, 90-odd minutes after Sinner's three. Here we go…

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-6 Alcaraz (2-7) Oh man, imagine how poor Jannik feels right now. All that work, all that pain, all that suffering, and a backhand down the line makes 7-0; this is the second-longest grand slam final in the open era, behind Djokovic v Nadal in 2012. Sinner takes two service points and clenches fist, trying to convince himself he's still in it. Godspeed, old mate.

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-6 Alcaraz (0-6) Alcaraz drops then swing-volleys, and that's a double mini-break! Again, he raises an arm, the crowd responding to the consummate showman, and when Sinner wafts long, it's a third break! But in a race to 10, 5-0isn't quite as definitive as in a race to seven; there are the straws, and the Italian must clutch at them. But instead, he nets a forehand, and this is almost over!

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-6 Alcaraz (0-3) A buggy-whipped forehand and Alcaraz seizes the immediate mini-break, then endorses it. He is so good at calculating exactly what he must do to win.

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-6 Alcaraz* we've never had a French Open final settled on a tiebreaker, but when Alcaraz plays two volleys, both to balls annihilated at his heart, we're a point closer; 15-0. A netted backhand, though, gives him 15-all, then another glorious backhand return – the shot of the match in a way – allows him to come in and, when a disgusting response lands near his ankle, he flicks a touch half-volley back over and Alcaraz can't direct his riposte in court. He does though, make 30-all, then a monstrous backhand winner makes 30-40 and he's a point away from a tiebreak. Here we go … and Sinner forces a backhand return on to the line! At deuce, he's two points away and how good has that shot been for him today? Another great return then puts him ahead in the next rally only for Alcaraz to immediately reverse the situation and claim advantage before, sent to towards the backhand corner and in trouble, he only flips a winner flat and cross-court! We've got ourselves a 10-point breaker, and this is one of the greatest finals ever, in any sport. What on earth are we experiencing?

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 6-5 Alcaraz A serve out wide to which Alcaraz offers a token arm, unable to move feet, and that's an ace; another follows for 30-15, then a return falls long and now the crowd chant “Yannik! Yannik! Yannik!”, tribal but as one. It's beautiful to behold; it feels like the entire energy of the cosmos is fixed on Roland Garros, lifting us all in the process. We wind up at deuce, a winner apiece returning us to it after Sinner makes advantage. And from there, he closes out, skidding into the kind of forehand winner that looked beyond him 20 minutes ago. We've been going 5 hours 12 minutes, and there's more to come. Look after each other, mates.

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 5-5 Alcaraz* The man who earlier on saved three championship points will now serve for that championship. Shall we all hold hands? Sinner sends a backhand towards the corner, Alcaraz swats a riposte long; 0-15. And oh my days, one of those backhand returns down the line makes 0-30! Sinner's mum is all over the show as we all are, how proud must she be of her boy? What a show of love and character this is regardless of how things end; Alcaraz closes to 15-30. AND OH MY COMPLETE AND URTTER ABSOLUTE EVERLASTING DAYS! Another Alcaraz drop, this time Sinner must try chasing it down … he gets there … and has the stillness and skill to caress a beauty back over the net! Two break-back points are his, and he raises an arm to the crowd, Alcaraz-style … THEN ALCARAZ NETS A FOREHAND! JANNIK SINNER HAS BROKEN, AND I AM HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE WITH THIS MATCH! WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO BE LIVING IN ITS TIME!

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 4-5 Alcaraz Serve out wide, forehand winner; body-serve, wrong-footing forehand winner; 30-0. Alcaraz, though, conjures a forehand winner of his own … but can do nothing about a service winner, and when he wafts a forehand long, he ensures that he'll have to serve the match out. Can he hold it down? How is it even possible to hold it down?

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 3-5 Alcaraz* Sinner nets a backhand but Alcaraz then does likewise with a drop, doing his best to affect composure but looking peaky; an ace follows. And though a loopy return falls long for 40-15, a forehand winner to the corner gives the Italian a chance … but this time, his backhand return is off, and the champ is a game away from retaining his title. Should he lose, Sinner will take this feeling to his grave; it'll haunt the nightmares of his unborn grandchildren.

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 3-4 Alcaraz Sinner's rejuvenated over the last 10 minutes or so and he crouches to mash another backhand winner down the lie for 15-0; a wide return gives him the blessed relief of a short point. I'd love to hear the internal monologues these two have going on here, but in the meantime another winner gives Sinner love hold, and pressure switches to Alcaraz. How can he, or anyone, possibly cope?

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 2-4 Alcaraz* Sinner is running out of break-back opportunities, but OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME! He absolutely creams a backhand pass and Alcaraz, coming in, falls rather than dives into a stretch … and controls a barely believable winner for 15-0! Gosh, but behind it there's a double, his seventh to Sinner's none, then a beautiful backhands down the line makes 15-30! The Italian is semi-limping between points and there's nothing he can do about the classic one-two that comes next, serve out wide, forehand towards the opposite corner. And another drop then makes 40-30, though Sinner's unhappy the serve wasn't called out – it looks so and was by a distance, but he didn't back himself – then a flapped return means Alcaraz leads 4-2 in the fifth!

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 2-3 Alcaraz During change of ends, Alcaraz, on sight the fresher of the two, dug into his pickle juice, which tells us he's either cramping of in fear of cramping. Sinner then makes 30-15, but a backhand winner, spirited cross, restores parity in the game … before a backhand return drops long. Up 40-30, Sinner then takes a little while longer bouncing the ball, trying to slow himself down, and his second serve is sent back into the net. This match is now the longest French Open final ever, nudging above the 1982 edition between Mats Wilander and Guillermo Villas at 4 hours 43 minutes.

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 1-3 Alcaraz* This now the best match I've seen since Alcaraz beat Djokovic in the 2023 Wimbledon final – at least. A drop makes him 15-0, and that's smart play – he knows his opponent is flagging, and a disgusting forehand from corner to corner facilitates another. Again, Sinner doesn't chase, and that's 30-0 … but a clean-up forehand then hits the net, so he's in the game. Oh, and have a look! Alcaraz massively overhits a forehand, creating tension where previously there was … ever so slightly less, but Sinner then wafts a forehand long and reasons with his box. He can feel it slipping away – for someone as reticent as him, that intimates desperation … except he then punishes a backhand return down the line to make deuce! And aaaarrrgghhh! Alcaraz plants a forehand wide and, out of nowhere, finds himself down advantage! so naturally he responds with a short second serve, out of Sinner's hit-zone, then puts away at the net; deuce, AND THERE HE GOES AGAIN! A tickled drop, this time inciting Sinner to pursue it – he thinks he can get it, he needs the point … and he can't, so he doesn't. No matter, a devastating forehand restores deuce, and this is some of the maddest behaviour I've seen in my life; how is this even possible? Alcaraz sends down a double … but next rally, Sinner can't control a backhand, and his mum looks like she's in a washing machine with a hangover. And this time, the champ closes out, that middle to corner forehand that's served him so well securing the hold. Simple, really.

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 1-2 Alcaraz Earlier in the match we talked about the differences between these two and I wonder how much of the difference between them is made up, not by tennis but by Alcaraz's unstoppable life-force. Sinner makes 30-15, the champ sends two forehands long, and that is a crucial hold. For as long as he can stay within a break, he's still in the match.

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 0-2 Alcaraz* At 15-0, Sinner bends double, looking to conserve all the energy he has left; Alcaraz is bouncing about like a new-born puppy. Wearing a knuckle duster. A buggy-whipped forehand down the line – the kind Sinner might've retrieved earlier in the match – makes 40-15, and seconds later, the consolidation is secure. Alcaraz might get nervous as victory draws nearer, but at this point, a comeback looks beyond the Italian.

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 0-1 Alcaraz Alcaraz outlasts Sinner in the opening point of the fifth, the punishes a forehand down the line to which the Italian is noticeably slower, his riposte facilitating a forehand winner down the line; 0-30, and trouble. Sinner does close to 15-30, but then nets an overhand forehand and here come two break points! I can barely feel my fingers! Alcaraz's first return is wide, after which follows a rally of frankly evil nature, sinner eventually finding himself unable to reach a drop and steer his response into court! The champ leads with a break, Sinner now seems to be limping, and Carlos Alcaraz has some of the most compelling, affirming competitive charisma I've ever seen. I love him; I love them both; I love this.

“Remember when Federer and Nadal retired and we thought we'd never see matches like that again?” wonders Nath Jones.

The regenerative, regenerating power of sport. I feel simultaneously 20 years older and 20 years younger.

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 (3)6-7 Alcaraz This is some of the very best stuff this world has to offer us; drink it in, friends. Alcaraz hammers a forehand into space and we're going to a decider! Their poor parents!

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 6-6 Alcaraz (3-6) I'm trying so hard to stay in the moment, but can't stop my ADHD brain kvelling at how many more of these outrageous contests await us. Facing a second serve, Sinner slams a forehand long – that, mes amis, is pressure – then another error means the man who, 20 minutes ago held three championship points, is now three set points down!

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 6-6 Alcaraz (2-4) And another ace follows that! Alcaraz leads 3-2 and it's now him playing the biggest points better, which is to say there's almost nothing between them. And when Sinner slaps a forehand marginally wide, the champ is up a mini-break! He's so unbelievably brilliant at doing whatever a situation demands of him.

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 6-6 Alcaraz (2-2) Immediate mini-break to Sinner when Alcaraz nets, then at 2-0 and out of naewhere, the champ invents a forehand that breaks the sideline to erase the advantage. An ace follows!

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 6-6 Alcaraz Sinner rights himself, making 30-0, and I am in awe of these lads. What it takes to get to here, then embrace the moment, is mind-boggling; we reach the four-hour mark as the Italian reaches 40-15, then Alcaraz lashes a flat forehand winner from centre to corner that leaves no less a legend than Andre Agassi shaking his head in mystification. I'm not sure I've ever seen tennis balls hit harder, and Sinner secures the holds that gives him – and us! – a fourth-set breaker. Hold me!

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 5-6 Alcaraz* Sinner was so close to the title and has never won a match of this length. He'll know the situation got big on him there, a lot to process in the maelstrom of the moment, and a love hold further amps up the pressure, Chatrier a rabid agglomeration of confused, bemused, elated humanity.

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 5-5 Alcaraz Carlos Alcaraz has some stones. He could easily have shrunk down 0-40, but these two are of different ilk to the likes of us …. which is why, down 0-15, Sinner is able to hammer down an overhead then, when it comes back, find the steadiness of hand to feather a drop for 15-all. An overhit forehand, though, nudges Alcaraz back in front in the game, the crowd cavorting with every point he wins, and another gorgeously-played rally allows him to finish at the net, two break-back points in his pocket. What can Sinner find? He's never been under pressure like this in a major final, and when his first serve lands out, the champ stays back then astonishes a forehand down the line that the world no 1 can't get back! Chatrier is now hovering above the planet, and are we all still breathing? Sinner tightened, Alcaraz loosened, and who will recover from the accordant emotional dump the better?

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 5-4 Alcaraz* Sinner's returning today has been wondrous, more of the same again forcing Alcaraz to play around himself from the line; he gets the ball back, but a forehand makes 0-15 and a double follows! The world no 1 is two points from a first French Open title and looks the chillest due in the arena, all the more so when Alcaraz whumps long to hand over three championship points! Sinner's mum is tearful, looking ready to explode with every emotion known to mankind, but she'll need to wait at least one more rally, a forehand on the run falling long. Oh, and another does likewise then, having been sent to the corner, Alcaraz responds with a brave forehand that lands close to the line, and sinner nets! We're at deuce, three championship points saved, and OH MY COMPLETE AND UTTER DAYS! Alcaraz makes advantage then, directed to the forehand corner, he smooooookes a forehand winner down the line to secure his hold! He again noises up the crowd – and himself – while Sinner returns to his seat with a lot to think about about which to think…

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 5-3 Alcaraz Sinner nets for 0-15 but plays like nothing happened, whacking from the back till Alcaraz goes long. Then, when the champ comes in, he gets enough dip on a cross-court pass such that the riposte goes into the net then delays the next point to use the towel, whether to clam himself or discomfit his opponent. Either way, a serve out wide allows yet another violent forehand for 40-15, another seals the hold, AND JANNIK SINNER IS A GAME AWAY FROM A THIRD SLAM IN A ROW!

Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 4-3 Alcaraz* At 0-15, Sinner dematerialising a backhand to the corner in order to caress a gorgeous drop across the face of the net; that is delightful, and when another vicious forehand enables 0-40, we're at a juncture-point. Ohhh, and Alcaraz flaps a backhand wide! As Alex Ferguson once said, when it goes, it goes quickly, and might that be the match? Sinner is two games away from a third major on the spin!

*Sinner 6-4 7-6(4) 4-6 3-3 Alcaraz Will fatigue become a factor as the match goes deeper? We've seen Alcaraz struggle before, the pressure as much an issue as the exhaustion, but for now both players look alright – under the circumstances. I nip for a comfort break, Sinner holds to love, and I could watch this for days.

19:22 CET - Incredible scenes here at Roland Garros, with Carlos Alcaraz saving three championship points on his own serve, then breaking back at 5-4 to bring it back level at 5-5. We are not done yet! Heartbreak for Jannik Sinner but jubilation for Alcaraz.

19:04 CET - A potentially HUGE moment in this match. Jannik Sinner has the first break of the set to take a 4-3 lead, and he is just two games away from his first French Open title.

19:01 CET - Midway through the fourth set, the pair are locked at 3-3. Incredible tension around Philippe-Chatrier.

18:29 CET - Jannik Sinner has lost a set of tennis at a Grand Slam for the first time since the Australian Open fourth round! Carlos Alcaraz produced an exceptional set to win it 6-4, breaking Sinner to love in the 10th game. Huge pressure now on the world number one as Alcaraz attempts a seismic comeback.

18:26 CET - Right in the nick of time, Jannik Sinner has broken back! Carlos Alcaraz was serving to take the third set at 5-3, but the Italian pounced. What a crucial few games we have coming up.

18:05 CET - And just like that, Carlos Alcaraz has broken again to go 3-1 up! Is this the start of a miraculous comeback?

17:52 CET - But Carlos Alcaraz has broken right back with some brilliant tennis! What a start to the second set!

17:46 CET - Just like at the start of the second set, Jannik Sinner has an early break at the start of the third. Carlos Alcaraz is in trouble.

17:40 CET - Jannik Sinner has just won a huge and utterly critical second set against Carlos Alcaraz, hitting top gear in the tiebreak to go 6-4, 7-6(4) up. After being broken back when serving for the set, he kept his cool in typical Sinner fashion to regather himself, and has now put himself in a strong position to clinch his first French Open title against a player whose level seems to be constantly fluctuating. 

Remember: Alcaraz has never won from two sets down before. He has a mountain to climb.

17:18 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has broken back at the perfect time! With Jannik Sinner serving for the second set at 5-3, the Spaniard has capitalised on some poor serving from his opponent to get back into the contest.

16:43 CET - And now an early break for Jannik Sinner at the start of the second set! The Italian is oozing confidence and has a 2-0 lead.

16:31 CET - After a sensational set that lasted just over an hour, Jannik Sinner has landed the first real blow, winning it 6-4.

16:11 CET - Jannik Sinner has the break back in the very next game! Brilliant from the world number one.

16:05 CET - There is the break for Carlos Alcaraz! It has been a high-quality start to the match, and the Spaniard has first blood, taking a 3-2 lead!

15:27 CET - Right then, we are underway! Let's hope it is a classic!

15:10 CET - World number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz are about to head out to the court to contest the 2025 French Open men's final!

Stay tuned to the Tennis Tracker for major updates throughout the match or follow it point-by-point via the link below.

13:26 CET - Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini are the women's doubles French Open champions! The Italian duo have followed up their triumph in Rome with victory here in Paris, beating Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1.

On the same court in which they clinched Olympic Gold just under a year ago, they are victorious once more. For Errani, it is her ninth Grand Slam title in doubles, while Paolini has her hands on her very first. A great moment for both of them, as Italian tennis continues to thrive.

11:30 CET - Welcome back to the Tennis Tracker on the final day of the French Open, and what an absolute treat there is in store.

Before the tournament began, every tennis fan would have wanted to see world number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the showpiece event, and that is exactly what has happened.

Sinner has had a near-flawless run to the final. Taking part in his second tournament since returning from a drugs ban, the Italian hasn't dropped a single set and saw off 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in a high-quality last-four clash.

His relentless and suffocating brand of tennis has been too much for anyone, and he will be looking to produce that against an opponent who has beaten him in their last four meetings. Victory would see him win his first French Open and fourth Grand Slam, which would take him level with Alcaraz.

It hasn't been as plain sailing for Alcaraz, who has dropped a set in four of his matches. He didn't look his best against Lorenzo Musetti in his semi-final, but eventually managed to overcome his ailing opponent, who retired with an injury in the fourth set.

However, Alcaraz tends to save his best for Sinner, and there is little doubt that the Spaniard is a better clay-court player than his rival. At one point, Alcaraz trailed the head-to-head 4-3, but now leads it 7-4. If he can continue his winning run over Sinner, he will pick up his second title at Roland Garros and his fifth Slam.

It is a match that is so hard to call, and everyone will be hoping that it is an absolute thriller. Neither player has lost in a Grand Slam final before, so something will have to give. Proceedings get underway around 15:00 CET.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Winning a grand slam title is something most tennis players dream of from the day they start swinging their racquet. 

Despite the difficulty of winning a grand slam tournament, a select few have dominated on the biggest stage throughout the years. 

The past two decades, in particular, have seen certain players cement their place in history by winning a record number of grand slam titles. 

In 2025, the battle for those records continues, with Roland-Garros at the pointy end.

MORE: Who is the current men's world No.1? | Who is the current women's world No. 1?

In running order, the four grand slam events held each year are:

The French Open is played on clay, Wimbledon on grass and the other two are held on hard courts. 

Wimbledon is the oldest grand slam event, founded in 1877, followed by the US Open four years later, the French Open in 1891, and the Australian Open in 1905. 

Novak Djokovic and Margaret Court currently hold the record for most grand slam singles titles. They have each won 24.

Djokovic took the lead outright in the men's game by winning his third Roland-Garros title at the 2023 French Open when Rafael Nadal was ruled out through injury.

Nadal had taken sole ownership of the men's singles record after edging past Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic with his 2022 Australian Open triumph. He then extended his lead at that year's French Open before Djokovic pulled back within one at Wimbledon.

Djokovic's victory in the 2023 Australian Open final, where he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas, saw him draw level with Nadal at the top of the men's standings and, after losing a five-set thriller to Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final that year, he beat Daniil Medvedev in straight sets at the US Open.

That meant a third grand slam in 2023 and a victory that drew him level with Court's iconic haul of 24 major tournament triumphs.

Swiss great Federer won't add to his grand slam haul after announcing his retirement following the Laver Cup in September 2022, while Nadal's chances of catching Djokovic again are also over after retiring following the Davis Cup in November 2024.

Court, meanwhile, looked set to be caught by Serena Williams, but the American failed to win any of her last four grand slam finals and has also since stepped away from the sport. 

*Active players have been bolded

The term 'Grand Slam' actually refers to the achievement of winning all four tournaments in the same year. 

Winning one title is hard enough, but winning all four straight is extremely difficult. 

American Don Budge was the first to achieve a Grand Slam in 1938, with Australian Rod Laver the only other men's singles player to repeat the feat. 

Maureen Connolly was the first woman to pull it off in women's singles when she did so in 1953. Margaret Court and Steffi Graf are the only other players to have done the same since. 

If a Grand Slam wasn't rare enough, a Golden Slam requires players to also win Olympic gold on top of the four grand slam events in the same year. 

Steffi Graf was the first to complete a Golden Slam in 1988, with only wheelchair players Diede de Groot and Dylan Alcott managing to replicate the feat since.

Joshua specialises in rugby league, motorsport and tennis. He is still waiting for Arsenal to win the Premier League again.

The world No. 1 expressed a belief that had she lost to Swiatek, the Pole would've beaten Gauff in Saturday's championship.ByTENNIS.comPublished Jun 08, 2025 copy_link

Disappointed and frustrated aren't strong enough words to describe what Aryna Sabaelnka was feeling after losing out on adding the Roland Garros title to her Grand Slam trophy haul Saturday. Wounded, perhaps, does slightly more justice.On a day where Sabalenka described her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 defeat to Coco Gauff as “the worst final I ever played”, the world No. 1 concluded her press conference by expressing her belief that had she lost to Iga Swiatek in the semifinals, the Pole would have gone on to clinch a four-peat in Paris.“If Iga would win me another day, I think she would go out today and she would get the win. Yeah, it just hurts,” said the three-time major winner. "Honestly hurts. I've been playing really well, and then in the last match, go out there and perform like I did.”

Sabalenka notably ended Swiatek's 26-match win streak at the clay-court major, but Gauff also had a recent win over their mutual rival—sweeping Swiatek over a pair of 6-1 sets to reach the Madrid final before losing that 1000-level championship to Sabalenka.Upon hearing what Sabalenka said, Gauff understanbly saw it far differently.“I don't agree with that. I'm here sitting here (laughter). Last time I played—no shade to Iga or anything—but I played her and I won in straight sets. Yeah, I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can really happen,” she said.Read more: After "worst final ever," Aryna Sabalenka set for tequila, gummy bears and “flight to Mykonos”

Given the way this season had played out to this point, Sabalenka wasn't the woman Gauff was hoping to see across the net. Swiatek's last title run came at 2024 Roland Garros, while the top seed came into Saturday's clash with a 40-6 record and three crowns from six finals in 2025.See it: Coco Gauff celebrates Roland Garros title with parents, toasts champagne at Tennis Channel set“Honestly the way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favorite to win," Gauff said. "So I think she was the best person that I could have played in the final. Her being No. 1 in the world was the best person to play, so I think I got the hardest matchup just if you go off stats alone.“Obviously, Iga being a champion here, it was going to be a tough match either way. ButI think regardless of who I played, I think I had a good shot to win. I definitely had that belief. If you asked me, honestly speaking to you guys who I wanted to play, it was Iga just because I felt Aryna was playing so good, and she was.”Gauff has now won both of her majors against Sabalenka from a set down, adding to her 2023 US Open breakthrough. The Delray Beach. Fla. resident now leads their head-to-head record 6-5.

	The U.S. secretary of defense has threatened to send active-duty Marines into the streets of Los Angeles to confront protesters opposing the administration's detention and deportation of immigrants. At least three prominent Republicans don't seem concerned about potential overreach.


	“The [Department of Defense] is mobilizing the National Guard IMMEDIATELY to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles. And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert,” Hegseth wrote late Saturday on X, formerly Twitter, on his personal account.


	This prompted ABC's Jonathan Karl to ask House Speaker Mike Johnson: “Could we really see active duty Marines on the streets of Los Angeles?” 

“I think the president did exactly what he needed to do … Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or unwillingness to do what is necessary there, so the president stepped in,” Speaker Johnson tells @JonKarl after Trump deploys California National Guard. https://t.co/XS5Rl4O1po pic.twitter.com/JtuK9TyuHW


	“One of our core principles is maintaining peace through strength,” Johnson said during an interview on Sunday's episode of This Week. “We do that on foreign affairs and domestic affairs as well. I don't think that's heavy handed. I think that's an important signal.”

	











	“You don't think sending Marines into the streets of an American city is heavy-handed?” Karl asked.


	“We have to be prepared to do what is necessary, and I think the notice that that might happen might have the deterring effect,” Johnson said.


	Active-duty military troops have not been sent in to suppress unrest since the 1992 Los Angeles protests after a jury acquitted four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a Black man who was pulled over for a traffic violation. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits federal troops from engaging in civilian law enforcement unless there is a clear legal or constitutional basis for doing so. It was created to restrict the president's ability to use the military against civilians. The exception to Posse Comitatus is the Insurrection Act, which Trump has not invoked.

	











	Instead, Trump invoked Title 10 of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, which limits the troops' actions to protecting federal officials rather than enforcing laws. Title 10 gives Trump authority to deploy the National Guard during “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” and two other specific circumstances. Chris Mirasola of Lawfare wrote that Trump's justification for using this authority is “factually contestable and, even on the face of the memorandum, unusually weak.”

	Republican Sen. James Lankford on NBC's Meet the Press argued that by deploying the National Guard, Trump is “trying to deescalate all the tensions that are there.” Newsom has said that Trump activating National Guard troops is “purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions”


	“This is an American city, and to be able to have an American city where we have people literally flying Mexican flags and saying, ‘You cannot arrest us,' cannot be allowed,” Lankford said on Sunday. “If someone violates the law, no matter what state that they're in, they're in violation of a federal law. They should face consequences for that.”


	Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin also criticized protesters for carrying Mexican flags. “They were literally out there protesting, carrying a foreign flag. That is absolutely insane. They are not just peaceful protesters. These are illegals,” he said Sunday on State of the Union.


	“Carrying a flag is not illegal, as you know,” CNN's Dana Bash responded.


	“Foreign flag while you're attacking law enforcement, it's pretty bad,” Mullin said.

	Carrying a Mexican flag and saying “You cannot arrest us” is not a prosecutable offense. It is free speech protected by the First Amendment. And the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has been clear that anyone found destructing property will be arrested.


	“Everyone has the right to peacefully assemble and voice their opinions,” LAPD posted on X. “However, vandalizing property and attempting to seriously injure officers, whether Federal or LAPD, is not peaceful.”


	When Meet the Press host Kristen Welker pointed out to Lankford that “Governor Newsom says there is no unmet law enforcement need. The LAPD says the protests were peaceful,” the senator claimed that it is “clear” that the LAPD is “being overwhelmed.” (LAPD has not said they are overwhelmed.)


	“This wouldn't be an issue if California didn't promote sanctuary city policies to be able to tell people literally, ‘You can violate federal law and live in our state, and no one will arrest you for this,'” Lankford said. “Now suddenly when they are arrested for federal crimes then suddenly they go into this kind of protest saying, ‘No, you can't arrest us here. We're immune from federal law.' That's not true.”

	











	Here, Lankford is being misleading. Sanctuary city policies do not grant anyone immunity, they only limit how state and local resources are allocated to aid federal immigration enforcement. Under the Tenth Amendment, states have the right to allocate resources as they see fit, and states have used that amendment in court to justify not assisting with federal immigration raids.

	It's disturbing that prominent GOP lawmakers are signing on to the president's use of authority to activate the National Guard — against a governor's wishes — and signaling their agreement that deploying active duty Marines against civilians would be fine with them should Trump choose to do so.


	“Don't kid yourself they know they are absolutely getting cooked politically [with] their terrible bill and rising prices, and they want to create a violent spectacle to feed their content machine,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz posted on X late Saturday. “It's time for the mainstream media to describe this authoritarian madness accurately.”

Evan Goldberg, who directed the episode with Seth Rogen, says Scorsese waited to share his thoughts until later: "He was like, 'I knew you were doing this wrong, but I didn't want to be a backseat director, so I just didn't say anything.' "

Martin Scorsese might be an Oscar-winning director, but he apparently doesn't want to overstep when it comes to other directors' sets.


	Scorsese played a version of himself in the pilot of Apple TV+‘s The Studio. In the episode, he pitches an idea to Matt Remick (Seth Rogen), the new head of the fictional Continental Studios, for a movie about the Jonestown mass murder-suicide. Spoiler alert: Matt buys the script, thinking it'll fill a mandate for him to make a movie based on the Kool-Aid Man, but Matt is later forced to tell Scorsese that not only will he not be making his movie, but the director can't shop it anywhere else since Continental owns the rights. An upset Scorsese gets comforted by another guest star, Charlize Theron.

	Even though Scorsese has an Oscar for best director (for The Departed) as well as nine other directing noms, he didn't share his thoughts with The Studio co-creators Evan Goldberg and Rogen, who directed the pilot together, while filming his scenes.


	“He had one note, but he didn't give it until later,” co-creator and executive producer Alex Gregory told People.


	Added Goldberg: “There was a moment where him and Charlize Theron were whispering to each other, and it took like 10 takes to get the shot. And then we got it and I was like, ‘What were you whispering about?' He was like, ‘I knew you were doing this wrong, but I didn't want to be a backseat director, so I just didn't say anything.' And I was like, ‘Well, we could have used that time, but I appreciate that you didn't wanna manhandle us.' “


	Goldberg did not reveal what that note was in the People story.


Casting director Melissa Kostenbauder recently told The Hollywood Reporter that Scorsese was the “white whale” that Rogen and Goldberg were hoping for in terms of guest stars.

	











	“I feel like they got their white whale, which was Martin Scorsese,” casting director Melissa Kostenbauder told THR. “I know what big fans they are, and truly everyone is of Marty, and once they got him and Ron Howard, it really started to show people the kind of level they were looking for.”


	Indeed, the Gotham Award-winning show boasts several A-list guest stars in each episode. Kostenbauder told THR that this consisted of a very “unusual casting process” in that they wouldn't send scripts when initially sending the offer out to the talent.


	“We would offer up a meeting with Seth and Evan, and they were so good about making time to talk to all those people to help woo them and explain the character and answer any questions and make them comfortable, because it was never their intention to lampoon anyone,” Kostenbauder said, noting that full scripts were sent after these meetings.


	Of those stars who were approached, “Some were game, and some weren't. And some really did want to lean more into — I don't know if it was Olivia Wilde or Dave Franco — kind of poking fun at themselves.”


	As for landing Scorsese, Goldberg told People: “I think unanimously we would say Martin Scorsese as an actor was unbelievable. … The fact that he actually showed up, 'cause we kept thinking, ‘He's gonna cancel. It's too amazing. It's too special. He's just the best.'”


	As for why Scorsese signed on, Goldberg said he thinks Jonah Hill — who's collaborated with Rogen several times and starred in Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street — had a hand in that.

	











	“I got the feeling he dropped in a good word for us and that might've helped it happen,” Goldberg said.

Olivia Rodrigo threw it back to the '80s this weekend to jam out with a new wave legend.


	During her Saturday performance at Governors Ball in New York City, the 3x Grammy winner was joined onstage by Talking Heads frontman David Byrne for a surprise performance of the band's 1983 single ‘Burning Down the House' for the crowd at Flushing Meadows—Corona Park.


	The British rocker matched Rodrigo's red performance look in a pair of matching overalls as they playfully re-enacted the choreography to the song.

	Byrne's surprise appearance comes after the Talking Heads were introduced to a new generation of fans with A24‘s 40th anniversary re-release of their 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, which grossed more than $5 million domestically after a limited run in 2023.

The “McConaissance” is officially back. Apple Original Films has dropped the teaser trailer for Matthew McConaughey's upcoming action drama “The Lost Bus,” a story is inspired by real events and helmed by the Oscar-nominated “United 93” director Paul Greengrass.

While no exact release date has been announced, “The Lost Bus” will hit select theaters and stream on Apple TV+ this fall. In a release, Apple TV+ described the movie as a “white-knuckle ride through one of America's deadliest wildfires.” McConaughey stars as a school bus driver alongside America Ferrera as a teacher. The pair teams up “to save 22 children from the terrifying inferno.”

Greengrass — who co-wrote the story with Brad Ingelsby — called “The Lost Bus” a tale of “quiet heroism,” adding that he was “honored to have been entrusted with the story.” It is based on Lizzie Johnson's book “Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire” and is produced by Inglesby and Gregory Goodman. Jason Blumhouse for Blumhouse Productions is on board, too, as a producer, as is Comet Pictures' Jamie Lee Curtis, who took the production to Blumhouse after hearing Johnson speak on NPR. Johnson also serves as an executive producer.

 










McConaughey took a six-year break from live-action roles, returning with a role in “The Rivals of Amziah King,” which premiered in March at SXSW. That part, he told Variety, helped him rekindle his love for acting — and through it he also rediscovered how his profession can be a “vacation” from his personal life.

“I remembered a couple of things: One, how much I truly enjoy performing. Two, I remembered, ‘hey, McConaughey, you're pretty damn good at this,'” he said. “And three, I remembered that acting is a vacation for me, and what I mean by vacation is that when I'm performing, it's my singular focus. When I walk out the door in the morning, my wife says, ‘Go kick some ass. I got the kiddos. We're good.' That's vacation. Because I'm not multitasking. I'm not compartmentalizing. I'm fully focused on finding the truth of my character.”

Olivia Rodrigo welcomed David Byrne onstage during her headlining set Saturday at New York's Governors Ball festival for a rendition of the Talking Heads classic “Burning Down the House.”


	Toward the end of her weather-delayed set, Rodrigo brought out the “legendary” Byrne, who immediately launched into the Speaking in Tongues track. The two singers then traded verses on the track, with Byrne eventually dropping his acoustic guitar to engage in some synchronized dance routines with the Guts singer:


	Like much of the Talking Heads' work following the Stop Making Sense rerelease, “Burning Down the House” has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years: Paramore covered the track for the Talking Heads tribute album Everyone's Getting Involved, and later added it to their live repertoire. Dave Matthews Band also performed the 1983 song during their own induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

	Byrne and his trademark dance moves also recently joined another pop star onstage when he and Robyn performed her “Dancing on My Own” and the Talking Heads' “This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)” during the all-star SNL 50 concert.

	











	Rodrigo has made it a habit to share the stage with her musical heroes, from crashing No Doubt's reunion at Coachella to performing “Hot to Go!” alongside Chappell Roan to inviting Jewel onstage at a Madison Square Garden gig to duetting with Tyler Childers.

But on June 7, 2025, the two friends — who cruised together with fans in January 2024 — celebrated their real-life love stories, realizing that they share the same wedding anniversary with their wives. 

Both men paid tribute to their spouses in touching Instagram posts on June 7. Polaha marked 22 years with his wife, Julianne Morris, and Walker celebrated 13 years with his wife, Cassandra Troy. 

Walker commented on Polaha's post, “We've got the same anniversary brother! Happy Anniversary you two. ❤️” and Polaha replied, ” happy anniversary to you two lovebirds as well! Love you guys!!!”

A post shared by kristoffer polaha (@polahaha)

Polaha, who has starred in more than a dozen Hallmark romances, honored his real-life life story in his tribute to his wife, sharing a photo from their wedding and writing, “22 years ago today, in a little church on a rainy day in Florida, this girl said ‘I do,' I said it right back, and God used her to change the course of my life forever. Better in every single way.”

He continued, “I love you, Julianne, with every breath I take and every beat of my heart. You are the love of my life. Happy anniversary, baby. Here's to 50 more. Thank you for this adventure that we get to call our life together.” 

In 2021, Polaha told Highbrow Magazine that he met Morris while he was in Los Angeles, working on a TV pilot and it was “love at first sight.” Polaha said he noticed her right away when he walked into a Mexican restaurant, Casa Vega. At the time, Morris was an actress on “Days of Our Lives,” where she played Greta Von Amberg from 1998 to 2002, per IMDb. 

“She was surrounded by this whole circle of dudes, and it was like time stood still for a second,” Polaha told Highbrow. “Then, we all sat down at this table and it was a table that was kind of small, but she got squished in between two guys that she already knew. So, she orchestrated a move to another table, and she was at the end. I had a choice. I could sit next to some guy or I could sit next to her. I sat next to her and we talked. We talked the whole night.” 

The two spent quality time together before he flew back to New York, and then had “a really beautiful, innocent two-year courtship where we just took our time to get to know each other,” he told the outlet. 

He continued, “It was in that time where I was like, ‘I don't think that my career is going to amount to anything unless I have someone to share it with.' And I loved meeting Julianne when I did because I knew she wasn't marrying me for my money or my fame or anything other than the fact that she just loved me.”

Polaha and Morris share three sons — aspiring singer-songwriter Caleb, 20, aspiring filmmaker Micah, 19, and soon-to-be high school freshman Jude, 14.

Walker, meanwhile, posted a video montage of his wife out in nature at their temporary home in Vancouver, where he's been shooting a new Hallmark movie. 

The couple loves exploring nature with their sons — West, who's almost 10, and five-year-old Wolf — and have relished living on the water and near a bird sanctuary, regularly delighting in seeing bald eagles and other winged wonders on their property. 

In his post, Walker wrote, “13 years married ❤️ Happy anniversary @casstroywalker … 21 years ago, this bird woman walked into my life…Your love for life, friendship and the joy you bring to every moment is a gift I'll never not cherish. Thank you for sharing me with the birds. 😘” 

Before pursuing acting, Walker, who grew up in Vancouver, earned a full football scholarship to Boston College, per TV Guide, but suffered a career-ending ACL injury during a routine practice drill. 

The “Curious Caterer” star headed to Los Angeles to pursue acting, but met Troy in 2004 during a trip home, according to People. After she finished college, Troy moved from Montreal to Los Angeles in 2006 to live with Walker, the outlet reported, and they eventually eloped in 2012. 

On May 3, Walker also paid tribute to his wife on her birthday, writing in a post, “You're the heart of our family, the most incredible mom, and partner I never stop being grateful for. Your energy lifts us, your love grounds us, and every adventure is better because of you.”

Bruce Willis found ways to continue to work and appear on screen through the beginning of his degenerative illness, his wife has revealed in her forthcoming book.


Australian News.com. au website reports that Willis's plan to continue working as long as he was able will be detailed in Emma Heming Willis's upcoming book – one she calls “not a memoir but under the category of self-help” – The Unexpected Journey, due for release in September.


	The Die Hard star announced in February 2023 that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. He had retreated from the spotlight a year earlier due to his deteriorating health.

	However, according to news.com.au, Heming Willis's book will reveal that her action hero husband had found ways to continue to work on films such as Assassin (2023) and the Detective Knight series (2022-23), having directors reduce his dialogue and employing a trusted friend to feed him lines through an earpiece.


	The website adds that the actor's deterioration wasn't immediately apparently either on set or on screen, because Willis had always had a slow speech pattern, after having a stutter as a child – something he once told interviewer Michael Parkinson he was able to put to good effect:


	“It's how I got my sense of humour, because I realised, yeah I stutter, but I could make people laugh by doing stupid stuff.”


Heming Willis shared on Instagram that she had written the book to help others facing her husband's condition, as well as their families.

	











	She said: “I really wrote the book that I wish someone had handed me the day we got our diagnosis with no hope, no direction … not much. Today life looks different for me and our family because I was able to put support into place.”


	As well as his successful turns in the Die Hard franchise, Willis has enjoyed a string of hit films including Look Who's Talking, The Sixth Sense and Death Becomes Her. He had his breakthrough success in early 1980s TV series Moonlighting, co-starring with Cybil Shepherd as private detectives David Addison and Maddie Hayes.

Bruce Springsteen is performing his first-ever shows in Liverpool, England — the birthplace of the Beatles — this week, so naturally Paul McCartney came out to join the E Street Band for a couple of songs Saturday.


	Wednesday marked Springsteen's first concert in Liverpool, and it was a Beatle-less affair. Saturday brought the Boss back to the city's Anfield stadium, and it was a pretty routine E Street show again until the encore, when Springsteen and company welcomed out McCartney:


	“Thank you Liverpool. You're lucky tonight, we have a young man, a local young man from Liverpool, he's gonna play with us tonight, I think he has a lot of talent, and I believe he's gonna be going places,” Springsteen quipped in his introduction. “So let's bring out Paul McCartney.”


	McCartney first led the band on a rendition of the Fab Four classic “Can't Buy Me Love” — Springsteen and the E Street Band's first time performing that song live — followed by a rendition of Little Willie Littlefield's “Kansas City” that was popularized by Little Richard and then the Beatles on Beatles for Sale.

	











	The two rock legends have shared the stage together on a handful of occasions over the past dozen-plus years: At London's Hyde Park in July 2012, and again at New York's Madison Square Garden in September 2017 (both times they played “I Saw Her Standing There”).

	They also performed together during McCartney's East Rutherford, New Jersey gig in June 2022 (playing the Beatles' “I Wanna Be Your Man” and Springsteen's own “Glory Days”) and, most recently, a week later during McCartney's headlining set at Glastonbury.

	











	Mirroring the Beatles' own sojourn from Liverpool to Germany, Springsteen and the E Street Band's European tour next heads to Berlin on June 11. McCartney, who played a residency at New York's tiny Bowery Ballroom back in February, has no tour dates presently on his 2025 calendar.

The two musicians hit the stage together in red outfits to perform a rendition of Talking Heads' 1983 hit.

Olivia Rodrigo had a surprise for fans during the Governors Ball Music festival on Saturday night: special guest David Byrne. 


	The Talking Heads band member joined the Grammy winner on stage to perform a rendition of his band's 1983 hit “Burning Down the House.” 




	The two musicians somewhat matched during their Gov Ball performance, with Rodrigo sporting an all-red bra and short set while Byrne wore a white T-shirt and red overalls. Rodrigo and Byrne danced (and ran) around the stage together while taking turns singing lines from the track after the festival was postponed due to weather.

	After embarking on her sold-out, 95-date GUTS World Tour, Rodrigo has been headlining festival after festival. In a few weeks, she'll be in the U.K. to headline Glastonbury 2025, and later this summer, the “bad idea right?” singer will make her Lollapalooza debut.

	Notably, “Burning Down the House” peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the year of its release, making it the highest charting track for the rock band. The song, too, earned the Talking Heads a Grammy nom at the 26th annual awards ceremony.  


	Earlier this week, the band released the long-awaited music video for “Psycho Killer,” starring Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan.

The helmer, speaking at a 25th anniversary celebration of the Christian Bale starrer at the Tribeca Festival, says the world is "so much worse than when I was making the film," specifically calling out "open fascism."


							By 

	Katherine Schaffstall



American Psycho director Mary Harron admitted that the cult classic film is just as relevant today as it was when it was released in 2000 while celebrating its 25th anniversary during a conversation with Hasan Minhaj at the 2025 Tribeca Festival on June 7.


	The horror film, which takes place between 1987 and 1989, follows investment banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as he deals with murderous fantasies. Harron told Minhaj she believed that Wall Street employees were “dinosaurs” at the time of filming and that we would “never see” men like that in the future.

	“Not that there wouldn't be rapacious Wall Street behavior and greed,” she continued. “It was true, actually, for a few years after the film came out. It was much better hidden.” However, Harron pointed out that people are still “reveling in bad behavior” and “the joy of being overly racist” today. She continued, “I would never have thought you would see that.”


	Minhaj said that Bateman seemed to say “the quiet part of loud” in his voiceovers, while people in the present day seem much more comfortable using hateful and offensive rhetoric. Harron agreed and explained that she viewed Bateman more as a symbol than as a person. “Patrick Bateman is like if you took everything terrible about, like, 20th century capitalism and about the Reagan era,” she said, listing cruelty, despising the poor, sexism and racism as some of the issues he wasn't afraid to glorify. Meanwhile, she said that the character also represents the “triumph” of “male dominance and money.”


	When Minhaj asked if “reality now is oddly mimicking” the plot of the movie, Harron admitted that her views of the world have changed since it was made. “I would've said when we were making [the] film, you know, the arc of history bends towards justice. And now I think maybe the arc of history is like a corkscrew or maybe it's a rollercoaster,” she said. “Maybe it doesn't just bend towards justice. I would like to think that we'll get through this and find better times.”

	











	After noting that she never would have imagined the state of the world would look like it does in 2025, Harron added, “It's so much worse than when I was making the film. You know, open fascism.” She also pointed out that the direction of today's society may be “why people still like this film” today.


	Harron, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Guinevere Turner, reflected on the popularity of Bateman today after Minhaj pointed out that there are some people that view the character as aspirational. “I know the film is very popular with Wall Street guys and Guinevere and I were, ‘Wait, what? Like, we're making fun of this,'” she said. “I don't know. I can't explain it.”


	She then theorized that people may find the character to be aspirational because he “has everything materially that a person would want” and that he “does whatever he wants.”


	The movie also includes several mentions of the Trump family, while Donald Trump is mentioned in the 1991 Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name that the movie is based on. “It was as a quasi-celebrity,” she said of Trump being mentioned, noting that Bateman's fiancée Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon) complained about his obsession with the now-president. “That, I thought, was part of his dorkiness, really. ‘Cause Donald Trump in the 80s, you know, New Yorkers did not really think of him as cool. He was just, like, he was kind of a joke.”


	Also during the interview, Harron reflected on why Bale was the perfect person to play Bateman after the role was re-cast several times. “It was very strange because he hadn't actually done anything like that before in his work,” she said, adding that Leonardo DiCaprio briefly had the role.

	











	Harron explained that Bale was the only actor up for the role who viewed the script as “funny” as she did, which gave her confidence that he was the perfect person to play Bateman. “It was basically that we had the same sense of humor,” she said of why he ultimately got the role. “The other actors I met, some of them well known and certainly better known than Christian at the time, I could tell that they thought Bateman was sort of cool. And to me, it's like there's nothing cool here. We're not doing the coolness. We're doing the absurdity of him. So, I knew that it was very important we be on the same page.”


	The conversation concluded with Harron recalling how difficult it was to get the film made until Lionsgate agreed to produce it. “I would never have imagined that it would be so embraced,” she said of the film's legacy.

The Day Two headliner at New York's Governors Ball festival had a surprise guest in the form of the Talking Heads frontman. 


													By

	“We're in for nasty weather,” prophesied David Byrne 42 years ago on his band Talking Heads‘ biggest  Billboard Hot 100 hit. He probably wasn't making specific predictions about 2025's Governors Ball festival in New York, but that's certainly what was in store for attendees Saturday (June 7), as heavy rain and possible thunder and lightning forced the fest to delay its Day Two start time by four hours. 

	











	As a result, headliner Olivia Rodrigo didn't take the stage at Gov Ball until 9:35 p.m. ET — but the packed audience showed that few if any fans had been deterred by the bad weather and late start time. And along with her usual captivating set of heart-rending acoustic ballads and stomach-punching alt-rock riffers, Rodrigo had a surprise in store for those who'd stuck around with a Byrne guest appearance, as he came out to duet with the singer-songwriter on the Heads' 1983 smash “Burning Down the House.”

	After being introduced by a starstruck Rodrigo, Byrne — who could be seen earlier in the night checking out Feid's performance at the Kiehl's stage — emerged in an all-white outfit, covered by red overalls to match Rodrigo's own two-piece getup. The two traded off lines throughout the always-incendiary new wave classic, and then Rodrigo joined Byrne in some of his signature on-stage moves — bending her knees, running in place, and generally looking his traditional combination of charmingly stilted and impossibly cool.

The sci-fi TV show Stranger Things was successfully pitched with a remix. Its creators, the Duffer Brothers, cobbled together a fake trailer featuring clips from Steven Spielberg's E.T. with its soundtrack replaced by the menacing synths of horror king John Carpenter. The effect was, according to Matt Duffer, “really fucking cool.” That integration of the vaguely familiar with the eerily sinister would power the show like it did for 2011 pastiche film Drive, itself working like Tangerine Dream put over Death Wish II.

Together, they served as a rebuttal to 30 years of the received wisdom of “'80s nostalgia,” the gags about asymmetrical haircuts and Rubik's Cubes that permeated slop like The Wedding Singer and The Goldbergs. It was a way of communicating through vibes instead of hack references, a Proustian madeleine for survivors of an America scarred by nuclear anxiety, exploding space shuttles, Satanic panic, Chinese stars, lawn darts, and Punky Brewster's friend getting trapped in the fridge. Do you want new wave or do you want the truth?

The Zoltar machine that predicted all of this was a 125-second YouTube clip of the obscure 1983 arcade game Laser Grand Prix soundtracked by a loop from Chris de Burgh's saccharine 1986 ballad “The Lady in Red.” Uploaded in the summer of 2009 and currently standing at 4.3 million views, the video—titled “Nobody Here” after its cycling, haunting refrain—would serve as something like an a-ha moment for people who craved something deeper than A-ha references, a big bang for a generation of musicians attempting to live on the edge of memory and imagination.

“Nobody Here” would reappear as the untitled 12th track on Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1, a profoundly inauspicious release—put out on a cassette, limited to a mere 100 copies, no text on the shell, no text on the back of the J-card. The artwork, borrowed from the box art of the tranquil Sega Genesis game Ecco the Dolphin, was close-cropped to feature a frowning shark instead of the playful cetacean. It would become the most influential cassette tape of the 21st century.

Released in 2010, Eccojams was a collection of 15 remixes all with the same concept: the dross of radio's past, slowed down, echoed, and run through some dream-logic computer effects. Songs both familiar and unfamiliar transmogrified into a sleep paralysis slurry of half-remembered traumas. Putting Toto's “Africa” in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City conjured the cool '80s of Don Johnson blazers, neon lights, and DeLorean doors. Putting Toto's “Africa” in the Eccojams funhouse conjures the lived '80s of wainscotted hallways, dust-caked mini blinds, station wagon interiors yellowed from cigarette smoke, lawns speckled with white dog shit and cathode ray TVs that play “The Star-Spangled Banner” at 4 a.m.

Chuck Person was not a real person (though the actual Chuck Person, the 1987 NBA Rookie of the Year, was naturally, a piece of '80s ephemera). “Chuck Person” was Daniel Lopatin, better known as Oneohtrix Point Never, a Brooklyn drone merchant who had spent the previous three years processing and reconstructing the abstract dreamscapes he culled from his Roland Juno-60. He was at the vanguard of the American noise scene in the hazy years when it retreated from feedback-soaked harshness into an unkanny kosmische. Alongside artists like Emeralds, Yellow Swans, Skaters, and Carlos Giffoni, noise music was starting to sound less like Texas Chain Saw Massacre and more like Tarkovsky's Stalker—and Lopatin was quietly training to become the house DJ for the “Zone.”

“[T]he entire point of Eccojams was that it was a DIY practice that didn't involve any specialized music tech knowledge,” Lopatin said in a Reddit AMA, “and for me it was a direct way of dealing with audio in a mutable, philosophical way that had very little to do with music and everything to do with feelings.” Like rope making or basket weaving, the Eccojam is a folk art requiring very little in the way of equipment or natural ability. He started doing it as a way to amuse himself at his job at a Boston textbook publisher. “I was nothing,” he said about the gig. “I was a piece of furniture. I could just feel the life draining out of me.” In his boredom, Lopatin ripped songs and videos from YouTube, slowing them to narcoleptic speeds using GoldWave and editing little films in Windows Movie Maker.

The first taste of Lopatin spelunking the collective unconscious was a 2009 DVD-R leadingly titled Memory Vague, a 33-minute mash-up of his music set to evocative detritus: '80s commercials for VCRs, golf balls, and Russian cassette players; creepy video logos; primordial video art and computer animations; obscure 1980 TV movie The Arrival; trippy 1985 new age curio Pilot Video Presents California Images: Hi-Fi for the Eyes and more. It included the first two released Eccojams—both posted to the YouTube page “sunsetcorp” that summer. “Angel” was a skipping, pitch-tweaked, highly phased reimagining of Fleetwood Mac's 1982 album track “Only Over You.” The aforementioned “Nobody Here” would become the “Blitzkrieg Bop” of phantasmal fuzzies.

Of course, Lopatin did not invent slowing down music to discover its hidden pleasures. Belgium's hedonistic “popcorn” clubs of the '70s featured popular American soul 45s spun at a sensuous 33 1/3. Perennial hip-hop breaks like the Winstons' “Amen Brother” and ESG's “UFO” were pitched down substantially when they appeared on the sampling bedrock compilations Ultimate Breaks and Beats. Pioneers like Ft. Lauderdale's Jam Pony Express and Houston's DJ Screw made hundreds of molasses-speed DJ mixes ideal for slow-motion crawls on Southern highways. Slowed-down cumbia records, renamed cumbia rebajada, were popularized by sonideros around Monterrey, Mexico in the '90s. English turntable artist Philip Jeck culled sooty fogs of dubby melancholy from crackling thrift-store vinyl that crawled along at a snail's pace. Lopatin himself credits DJ Screw and “plunderphonics” outlaw John Oswald for the genesis of the Eccojam. You can hear the bones of the Eccojam in Oswald pieces like the frenetic Madonna montage “madmod” and the stuttering Michael Jackson reconstruction “dab,” the latter released before the '80s had even concluded.

However, it was Lopatin's Eccojams that would strike a singular nerve in an era where it seemed like the bones of “the '80s” had been picked clean. Xennials like Lopatin had already lived through the emergence of quirky new-wave replicas, which had been around since the '90s. In the 2000s, every '80s subculture was given a light coat of paint and rebranded: Post-punk became “Brooklyn dance-punk,” obscure hip-hop songs became “random-rap mixtapes,” electro became “electroclash.” Nostalgia was the new normal and Eccojams arrived roughly concurrent with other critically overdissected microgenres all supposedly evoking the childhood of an era: UK “hauntology” (the eerie '70s), synthwave (the decadent '80s), hypnogogic pop (the wistful '80s) and chillwave (the blissful '90s). Everyone was feeling it all around, but Lopatin was the closest to actually touching it.

Unlike the music of, say, Ariel Pink or Washed Out, Eccojams are inextricable from their source material. Nearly 70 percent of the material on Eccojams Vol. 1 is constructed from actual music from the actual '80s: past-their-prime boomers going soft rock, R&B softies navigating the production techniques of quiet storm era, the adult contemporary ballads you'd hear at the grocery store. Most of the remaining 30 percent—including bits of a Byrds album track, Radio Disney balladeer JoJo, Belgian trance act Ian Van Dahl and Michael Jackson's mostly forgotten '90s remix album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix—had their own ephemeral appeal.

Lopatin's real feat with Eccojams is not his ethereal production techniques, but his curation. The crates had been dug, the reissues reissued, so Lopatin found the dollar bin records that hadn't been looted. And he didn't even have to leave YouTube to get them. His choices were unorthodox but prescient. Fleetwood Mac (“A2,” “B2”) would begin a new life as a Zoomer fave and meme soundtrack after a Glee episode that aired in 2011. Kate Bush (“B1”) would re-enter the Billboard singles chart at No. 4 after “Running Up That Hill” was used in a Stranger Things episode. Womack & Womack (“B7”), Alexander O'Neal (“A8”) and Teddy Pendergrass (“B2”) would all receive critical reappraisal once R&B became the new indie rock. Toto's “Africa” (”A1”) had an absolutely insufferable second life that's not worth going into here.

As a selector, Lopatin pillages these songs for their most forlorn and cryptic moments, exploding their hidden melancholia: “Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you,” “It doesn't matter anyway, you know it's just too little too late,” “I know that door that shuts just before.” “The key,” said Lopatin, “is if everyone can do it, then each piece reveals something about what its producer likes about it. So I'm always searching for the juiciest moment in a pop track to sample...and get into this hypnotic state with it.” Take the 1978 smash “Baker Street” by Gerry Rafferty. Director David Fincher jumps right to that iconic sax line to score a haunting staredown in 2007's Zodiac. Lopatin finds a sour lyrical shard of despondency, forcing Rafferty to repeat over and over again in what sounds like an opiate-saturated daze, “Another year and then you'd be happy.”

The album briefly created a small army of Eccojammers, most notably Laserdisc Visions and New Dreams Ltd., both pseudonyms of Portland-based producer Vektroid. However, this would quickly metastasize into “vaporwave,” a slowpoke collage-art music that plundered the '80s and '90s for R&B, smooth jazz, Japanese pop, muzak, video games, and Microsoft sound effects. Though many will cite chillwave or hypnogogic pop as the birth of too-online music, vaporwave was truly the first internet microgenre, a self-sufficient community ignored by any critical establishment larger than e-zines and vloggers. The vaporwave community instead blossomed in subreddits and Last.fm scrobbles, serving as the test kitchen for the next 15 years of weird little microscenes, from the fleeting (“seapunk,” “mallsoft,” “dariacore”) to the tectonic (the Haunted Mound/Bladee/TeamSESH axis of white trap that's breaking containment after nearly a decade in the internet's margins).

After Eccojams, the dustiest, most overlooked corners of Goodwill were rethought and re-appreciated. Drafthouse Films exhumed kitschy '80s genre films like the 1981 3D Western Comin' at Ya! and the 1987 karate musical Miami Connection. Reissue label Light in the Attic moved from Betty Davis and Rodríguez to successfully recontextualizing soft rock, adult contemporary, new age cassettes, and Japanese AOR. The “uncanny '80s” was explored in films like weirdo comedy Brigsby Bear, psychedelic horror Mandy, and nü-slasher MaXXXine. The “uncanny '90s” is next at bat with films like Skinamarink and I Saw the TV Glow. The folk tradition of the Eccojam lives on nearly unrecognizably in YouTube videos called “slowed + reverb,” where slowpoke versions of Hindi love songs get views in the tens of millions.

Critics and theorists mostly paint Eccojams and vaporwave as a critique of the market, with Simon Reynolds saying it reveals “the buried utopianism within capitalist commodities” in his essential 2011 nostalgia screed Retromania. That reading, while popular, fails to see the forest for the pixelated palm trees. “I think a lot of those Eccojams are just cathartic for me,” said Lopatin. “I make them when I hear something in pop music, and I'm just like, ‘Fuck, I just wanna hear that over and over.'” An Eccojam is a celebration of the ineffable. Like ASMR, horror movies, cat videos, rage bait, or pornography, it's a functional medium painstakingly calibrated to evoke a specific sensation. An Eccojam or a vaporwave song gives a listener a sense of placelessness, with the knowledge that “placelessness” is still an interesting place you want to visit.

“The sublime is located in all times and across all brows at once,” Lopatin told The Wire, railing against the “timbral fascism” that won't let synth musicians use chorus effects without seeming cheesy. With Eccojams, Lopatin uses the bit-compressed technology of the present to extract the sublime from the trash heap of the past, and provides instructions on how to access it in the future. Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Scott Pelley said that a settlement of Donald Trump‘s lawsuit would be “very damaging” to the reputation CBS and Paramount, while the 60 Minutes correspondent also defended a recent commencement speech where he warned of the threats to freedom of speech.


	Appearing on CNN‘s post show following the live telecast of Good Night, And Good Luck, Pelley sat down down fellow 60 Minutes correspondent and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper.


	“If there is a settlement, and as part of a settlement, there's an apology, how damaging is that to CBS?”

	“It will be very damaging to CBS, to Paramount, to the reputation of those companies,” Pelley said. “I think many of the law firms that made deals with the White House are at this very moment regretting it. That doesn't look like their finest hour.”

	As CBS-parent Paramount Global seeks Trump administration approval of its merger with Skydance, company lawyers have been in talks to settle the president's lawsuit against the network. Trump sued CBS for $20 billion over the way that a 60 Minutes edited an October interview with Kamala Harris. The lawsuit, filed under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a law typically invoked for false advertising claims, has been deemed baseless by a number of legal observers.


	Cooper called the situation “very strange.”


	“You really wish the company was behind you 100%, right?” Pelley said. “You really wish the top echelons of the company would come out publicly and say, ‘60 Minutes, for example, is a crown jewel of American journalism, and we stand by it 100%. I haven't heard that.”


	“On the other hand, my work is getting on the air, and I have not had anyone outside 60 Minutes put their thumb on scale and say, ‘You can't say that. You should say this. You have to edit the story this way. You should interview this person.' None of that has happened. So I while I would like to have that public backing, maybe the more important thing is the work is still getting on the air.”

	











	Still, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, Bill Owens, resigned in April, concluding that he no longer had the ability to make independent decisions about the show. The newsmagazine has in the past enjoyed freedom from corporate interference.


	Pelley said, “Bill's decision to resign may not have been much of a decision for him, because he was always the first person to defend the independence of 60 Minutes. Bill didn't work for Paramount. Bill worked for our viewers, and he felt very keenly about that, and so I'm not sure Bill had any choice once the corporation began to meddle in Bill's decisions about the editorial content, or just place pressure in that area. Bill felt he didn't have the independence that honest journalism requires.”


	During CNN's post-performance coverage of Good Night, And Good Luck, Cooper also talked to a panel that included Kara Swisher, Connie Chung, Abby Phillip and Bret Stephens, with comparisons made to the situation that legendary CBS News journalist Edward R. Murrow faced as he took on Joe McCarthy, to today, as journalists are under attack by Trump and his allies.


	In their interview, Cooper asked Pelley how he thinks that Murrow would have handled the current situation at the network. 


	Pelley noted that Murrow's producer, Fred Friendly, went on to become president of CBS News and eventually quit in principle over a disagreement about coverage of the Vietnam War. 


	“I wonder if Ed might have done the same thing, given our present situation,” he said. “He would probably be waiting to see how this lawsuit with the president works out, and how the Paramount corporation deals with that and whether it fights. I think that would mean everything to Ed, and I also know where he would be on that question. It would be for fighting.”


	Pelley also addressed a commencement speech he gave to Wake Forest University last month, Speaking to Wake Forest University graduates, Pelley said that “our sacred rule of law is under attack. Journalism is under attack. Universities are under attack. Freedom of speech is under attack. An insidious fear is reaching through our schools, our businesses, our homes and into our private thoughts. The fear to speak. In America?”


	MAGA commentators blasted Pelley for the comments.


	Pelley, though, said that he “felt very strongly that this was something that needed to be said. It did not strike me that this would impact people's thought of me as a journalist, because part of that speech is a speech about freedom of speech. That should be non-controversial.”


	He said that “there was a little bit of hysteria among some about this speech. And I simply ask you, what does it say about our country when there's hysteria about a speech that is about freedom of speech?”


	Pelley said that what has surprised him the most about his reporting on the Trump administration is “how pervasive the fear is.” He said that it is more difficult to get people to talk about Trump on camera.


	“They do not want to stick their head up over the foxhole,” Pelley said. “And that is part of what the Wake Forest speech was all about, that we must not be in fear. This is exactly what Ed Murrow was saying in that editorial at the end of the McCarthy broadcast. We much not walk in fear of one another. We are not descended from fearful people.”


	Pelley said that he believe that the U.S. is moving in a “similar direction” as the McCarthy era. “People are silencing themselves for fear the government will retaliate against them, and that's not the America we all love.”

	Avant garde filmmaker Lars von Trier is no stranger to controversy, and Bryce Dallas Howard has her own story to share regarding the polarizing filmmaker who, among other instances, has courted rebuke due to allegations of sexual harassment by Björk and John C. Reilly's exit from film Manderlay over the killing of an animal.


	In a new interview with The Times U.K. to promote the soon-to-be-released Deep Cover on Prime Video, Howard discussed her background growing up on sets due to her father Ron Howard‘s rich directing and acting career. One such anecdote that was perhaps less glamorous was an interaction with the Melancholia director on the set of Manderlay, a credit which came early on in the Jurassic World star's career.

	Upon arriving to the set of the Danish director's film, she remembered “he started insulting me: ‘Your father's a terrible filmmaker.' I went, ‘Lars, what are you trying to see?' and he said, ‘Your angry face. I don't know what it looks like.'”

	Then, von Trier threw a glass of water in her face, “so I threw a glass of water in his face. He goes, ‘Why did you do that?' and got up and left. That was my introduction to the Lars von Trier experience, but it wasn't like I went to my room and cried or anything. I was sort of delighted by it,” she said.


	Von Trier, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 2022 and was admitted to a care center in February 2025, has long been regarded as a problematic figure, whether for making jokes about sympathizing with Nazis due to his German roots or for his treatment of actresses and ways of depicting women on screen.

	











	In 2005's Manderlay, which also stars Willem Dafoe and Danny Glover, a woman and her father discover a plantation in rural Alabama circa the 1930s that is still operating under the conditions of slavery. The film, a sequel to 2003's Dogville led by Nicole Kidman, traces her conviction to facilitate the freedom of the enslaved people.

Maks Chmerkovskiy recently revealed that money impacted his “Dancing With the Stars” performances. The former “DWTS” pro shared how the paychecks and the need to get to the show's semifinals fueled his competitive behavior.

A post shared by Maksim Chmerkovskiy (@maksimc)

In a June 2025 interview with Us Weekly, Chmerkovskiy gave some insight into the biggest motivation for him in the “Dancing With the Stars” competition — money.

“There's definite ways to influence you to want to do your best and stay on and so I think that somebody like me, for example, that backfires,” he said.

The former “DWTS” pro continued, “Sometimes that competitiveness kicks in because on top of it, if I don't keep making it week after week, I don't get paid. And so now my time here becomes, like, ‘Now I'm wasting time.'”

Chmerkovskiy shared that making it to the semifinals meant he would get a “paycheck all 10 weeks.”

During his 15 seasons on “DWTS,” Chmerkovskiy made it to the finals five times and won season 18 with partner Meryl Davis.

Of his only win, he shared, “I don't think I had a bonus. Maybe I didn't. I dunno.” “The thing you know is how busy you are, how completely engulfed in the show you are. Especially at that time, I was under so much pressure to, like, ‘Oh, you have to win.'”

He called Meryl “an incredible partner,” adding, “And I think I was also at that time already ready to go all the way in that type of partnership.”

Chmerkovskiy also shared that the current pros' contracts have likely “evolved” from when he was on the show.

“I don't think [that's] the case anymore. I think there are some guarantees,” he said.

The former “DWTS” pro noted that he “had some incredible partnerships with people who were a certain type.”

He explained, “Honestly, it's whatever they want. They want to push themselves. They want to have a great time. They want to be athletically inclined. They want it to be more of a showmanship. It's whatever you want, but I just want you to have a fantastic time.”

A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)

Will Chmerkovskiy return to “Dancing With the Stars?

He hasn't ruled it out.

“I think today I would come back.  It doesn't matter whether it's to judge or to dance, I think it's just fun to even be in this situation,” he said.

Chmerkovskiy noted, “Who would've thought there were moments in talk about reminiscing. There were moments in my journey with ‘Dancing With the Stars' that I've never thought that 20 years later I will be as part of it as I was.”

The star reteams with director Dean DeBlois for a retelling of the 2010 animated hit. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	15 years after How to Train Your Dragon debuted, the live-action adaptation landed in Los Angeles on Saturday, as Gerard Butler and director Dean DeBlois continued their roles at the helm of the franchise.


	Butler, who played Viking chief Stoick the Vast through all three animated films, returns to the role for the live-action project, joking that when he first heard it was happening, “I was like, ‘Are you guys crazy? That's going to be terrible.'”




	But he did have some “questions,” and DeBlois told him to come “spend a day in Belfast and see what we're building, what we're preparing, how the dragons are going to look, how the world is going to look, and when I saw that I was like ‘OK, I get it all.' I mean I kind of got it anyway, just wanted to play a bit hard to get,” he joked to The Hollywood Reporter at the premiere.

	And as for playing the same character again in essentially the same story, Butler noted, “When I watch myself, there's moments where I go, ‘That's very like how I did it before,' then there's moments where you just go completely different. What I did want to do was be fresh, coming in there and starting as a new story and suddenly I'm embodying that all day long — I didn't get to do that when I was just doing the voice. I wore my pajamas every day.”  


	The star's return almost didn't happen, DeBlois revealed, noting that Butler was initially unavailable and booked in back-to-back projects in the window the movie planned to shoot. The news that he would have to cast someone else in the role was “kind of distressing to me,” the filmmaker said, but then the actors strike happened and shifted production schedules in a way that allowed him to do the film. “When Gerry came in I felt a great sense of confidence and comfort like, ‘Oh, this going to work now,'” DeBlois said.

	The adaptation is DeBlois' first live-action film, after writing and directing the three animated How to Train Your Dragon projects. He noted he had “been publicly saying I didn't like this trend, and it's true — as an animator I don't freely like the idea that live-action movies come along and replace the years of hard work that we put into it, that made it a classic in the first place. But I did appreciate that they were talking to me, and so Universal's the first studio to actually take a chance on a writer and director of the animated movie.”


	He continued, “For better or worse, it has that continuity to it, but I promised [the studio] even though I hadn't made a live-action film before, I would do everything I can to deliver the wonder and the emotion of those original stories to the screen.” DeBlois added that there were a couple of key scenes where they went shot-for-shot with the original — particularly revolving around Mason Thames' Hiccup and his beloved dragon Toothless — but they also were able to be “a little more experimental in other parts of the movie.” 


	One of those big changes was filling out the character of Astrid, with DeBlois commenting he always felt “she was a little bit underserved in that first animated movie.” Nico Parker plays the role, which America Ferrera voiced in the animated films — the two actresses haven't spoken about the adaptation but Parker emphasized, “She's so wonderful and I hope that she sees and she likes it.”  

	











	Recalling her reaction to learning a live-action film was coming, Parker said, “I never tell my friends when I'm auditioning for things because there's that awkward thing of then you don't get it and you see it on a bus and they think it's funny to be like, ‘Oh my God, you auditioned for that,' and it's still a pang of pain. So I never tell them but with this one it's such an iconic film and I'm such a huge fan and my friends are such huge fans and it's such a big deal that I was like, ‘Guess what I'm auditioning for?' Because I knew that even if I didn't get it I'd be seeing it on opening day.”


	She added, “The fact that we're here and actually I'm in it is so surreal.”

He also shared that Liane Moriarty, the author of the novel the TV series is based on, has “written another book” that a potential new installment “will be based on.”

David E. Kelley is holding onto hope that Big Little Lies will return for a third season. 


	Season two of the HBO series arrived in 2019, two years after season one debuted. It's been half a decade since the show debuted new episodes, though the series creator told People that he's “hopeful” season three will “happen.”




	“We're hoping it happens,” he said Monday at the Gotham TV Awards. “We had a great time doing the first two seasons and we all want to do it again … I'm hopeful it'll happen.”

Big Little Lies featured an A-list slate of stars, including Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Lauren Dern, Meryl Streep, Zoë Kravitz and Shailene Woodley. If a third season does come to fruition, Kelley noted that no one is “under contract” at the moment, but they'd “need to corral a lot of high-caliber talent and their publicists, but everyone is very committed to it.” 

	











	Kelley praised Liane Moriarty, the author of the novel the TV series is based on, for the continued interest in the show. He also teased that Moriarty has “written another book” that a potential next season “will be based on.”


	“I think it's a credit to Liane Moriarty, too, who wrote the original book,” he said. “And she's written another book that season three will be based on. It's a pretty good collection of talent.”


	In January 2024, sources told The Hollywood Reporter stars and exec producers Witherspoon and Kidman were developing an idea for season three that they were looking forward to pitching to the network. Five months later, the actresses opened up about their hopes for a new season in an interview with Vanity Fair, somewhat indicating that a new installment was happening. 

	











	“I've got Laura [Dern] calling me and Zoë [Kravitz] and Shailene [Woodley]. They're all like, ‘Nic said that we're making Big Little Lies season three?'” Witherspoon said, to which Kidman rebutted, “But we are now! We're moving fast and furious, and Liane [Moriarty] is delivering the book.”

	For the second time in just over a week, Sean “Diddy” Combs wants the judge in his sex-trafficking case to declare a mistrial and kick the whole sordid matter to the curb. 


	Citing “prosecutorial misconduct,” defense attorney Alexandra Shapiro wrote to Judge Arun Subramanian today to insist this case, which could see Combs behind bars for the rest of his life if found guilty,  should go no further. 


	“In this trial the government has presented testimony that it knew or should have known was materially false related to its allegation that Mr. Combs dangled Bryana Bongolan from the balcony of Cassie Ventura's apartment in September 2016,” Shapiro's correspondence stated with references to Bongoloan's height in relation to the Bad Boy Records founder and to apparent inconsistencies in the testimony this past week by the good friend  of Cassie Ventura. “Accordingly, to avoid an unfair conviction in this case the Court should grant a mistrial.”

	The 55-year-old Combs was arrested in September 2024 in a New York hotel lobby by a phalanx of police and federal officials on federal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and more. From Combs' crying ex-girlfriend “Jane” and her tales of abuse, and before that Ventura's pal Bongolan, who had told the court Wednesday that Combs had dangled her off a 17th-story balcony on September 26, 2016, the panel of eight men and four women in the courtroom has heard explicit and sometimes heartrending testimony about rapes, emotional and physical violence. They also listening, sometimes in obvious discomfort to tales of blackmail, narcotics being moved across statelines and an apparent arson attempt to Kid Cudi's car. 












Additionally, perhaps most damning, the jurors heard of a 2018 rape and the years of filmed drug-juiced “freak-offs” from the then very pregnant “Me & U” singer Ventura, male escorts,  and Comb's ex-personal assistant “Mia,” who also alleged Diddy repeatedly raped her. 


	Unlike the last mistrial request of May 28 in the Diddy case, which was made in the lower Manhattan courtroom where the May 12 starting trial is taking place, Judge Subramanian has not issued a quick order on the latest motion. Contacted by Deadline today, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment on the latest mistrial move. 


	Casting almost all of Bongolan's testimony, and by implication, the government's position in disrepute, defense attorney's Shapiro's somewhat redacted four-page letter also recommended the prosecution own up to what it supposedly knows. 


	“The government knew or should have known this testimony was perjured, and that Ms. Bongolan could not possibly have been injured by Mr. Combs on a Los Angeles balcony in the early morning hours of September 26, or even the day before that,” the Shapiro Arato Bach LLP partner wrote 


	“The government has long known that Mr. Combs was on the East Coast in late September, and specifically at around the time of this alleged incident,” Shapiro added with footnotes mocking what a simple Google search would tell the feds, with a name drop of the pardon considering current POTUS. “The government knew that he had stayed at Trump Hotel in New York City between September 24-29, 2016. In fact, the government had marked as GX7Y111 the records of this hotel stay, which are now in evidence. And it has had other evidence in its possession for some time showing Mr. Combs's travel schedule and proving that he was on the East Coast when it told the jury he dangled Ms. Bongolan over a balcony in front of Ms. Ventura.”


	A link to a New Jersey website's September 26 review of Diddy's show in Newark on September 25 that the defense provides in their letter brought up the “Puff Daddy's Bad Boy reunion tour ignites Newark, despite B.I.G. hole” article. 


	Not content to let the Bongolan matter make their case for mistrial, the defense spend the last pages of the letter rehashing their previous unsuccessful mistrial effort. Specifically, on the matter of some destroyed fingerprints of Kid Cudi a.k.a. Scott Mescudi from 2012,  they claim “the government's motive all along must have been to suggest that Mr. Combs had corrupt influence over the LA authorities.” Putting the pretty powerful testimony of Combs' former aide “Mia” under the microscope over an incident where some LAPD officers let the personal assistant off the hook from driving infractions because she revealed she worked for Diddy, the letter gets very specific. “In other words, the subsequent questioning of Mia, even if itself permissible, further corroborates that the government's real purpose in its questioning of the fire inspector, Lance Jiminez, was to improperly suggest that Mr. Combs corruptly caused the destruction of the fingerprints.”


	At the tail end of a week that saw the judge reprimand Combs for interacting with the jury and threatening to toss him out of the courtroom for his own trial, today's letter ends: “This constitutes another instance of prosecutorial misconduct. Accordingly, the Court should grant a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct.”

	











	Scheduled to pick up on June 9 for another week, the trial is set to run from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. ET day-in, day-out. With more testimony from accuser “Jane” expected on Monday and maybe Tuesday, the trial will likely see the prosecution rest its case and the defense will pick up the baton.

The "Leave Me Alone" singer laughed and blew kisses from the back of a pickup truck draped with a transgender flag at WorldPride in Washington, D.C.

	Associated Press



	Gray skies and drizzle gave way to sunshine, multicolored flags and celebrations as the nation's capital held the WorldPride parade Saturday (June 7).


	Tens of thousands of people participated in parades and other festivities, in defiance of what activists say is an unprecedented assault on the LGBTQ+ community that challenges the rights for which many have fought over the years.


	A rainbow flag the length of three football fields flowed through the streets, carried by 500 members of the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, D.C., to kick off the parade. Behind them, people waved Pride flags and flags representing the transgender, asexual and bisexual communities from atop a bus.

	Singer-songwriter and actor Reneé Rapp laughed and blew kisses from the back of a pickup truck draped with a transgender flag while Laverne Cox, a transgender actress and activist known for her role in Netflix's Orange is the New Black, waved from an open convertible.

	











	“Pride means us looking out for each other no matter what,” she declared to the crowd as the convertible rolled to a stop. “We know how to be there for each other.”


	Many LGBTQ+ travelers have expressed concerns or decided to skip WorldPride due to anxieties about safety, border policies and a hostile political climate that they say hearkens back to another time. But that did not keep international travelers and other participants away, with groups visible from Iran, Namibia, Kenya and Russia.Along the parade route, hundreds gathered outside the National City Christian Church as rainbow flags and balloons lined its steps and columns. A child with rainbow face paint blew bubbles at the base of the steps while Whitney Houston's “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” blared from loudspeakers.


	“D.C. is already one of the biggest cities in the country for celebrating Pride,” said Cheo White, 33, from Annapolis, Maryland, “But we are all collectively more united and turning out more because of what's happening in the White House.”


	Many have said the gathering has taken on a new meaning amid the Trump administration's aggressive policies against protections for transgender Americans and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.


	White's partner, Nick Kerver, 26, who was visiting from Toledo, Ohio, said Pride has “always been a political tool” but has taken on more importance this year amid mounting threats to the LGBTQ+ community, especially transgender and nonbinary Americans.


	“It feels more important than ever,” Kerver said while wearing a rainbow hat, sunglasses and a T-shirt. “But we also have to get involved in our local communities too.“


	David Begler, a 58-year-old gay man from Philadelphia, expressed disappointment that many international travelers felt unsafe visiting D.C. for WorldPride but said he appreciates its presence in the city during this political climate.

	











	“It's the perfect time to have WorldPride in D.C.,” Begler said. “We need it right now. I want us to send a message to the White House to focus on uplifting each other instead of dividing.“


	Stay DeRoux, 36, usually plans a day trip to D.C. Pride from her home in Fredericksburg, Virginia. But this year, she and her wife, Deenie DeRoux, planned a full weekend. “This is a really big year,” Stay DeRoux said. “There's been a lot of turmoil. So it's an amazing thing to be among allies, among people who love because we've experienced so much hate on a daily basis.”


	For the day, the idea of threats and opposition took a backseat to the celebration. Streets were closed, but filled with floats, and impromptu parties broke out with music and food in streets adjoining the parade route. Cynthia Erivo was set to perform on the Capitol Stag following the parade.


	Johnny Cervantes Jr., dressed in a black suit and top hat, headed to a grandstand at a church-themed float to marry his partner of 28 years, Freddie Lutz, owner of Freddie's Beach Bar and Restaurant in Arlington, Virginia.


	Events culminate Sunday with a rally and protest march and a giant street party and concert (headlined by Doechii) covering a multi-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.


	“This is WorldPride in the best city in the world,” Mayor Muriel Bowser declared as she walked the parade hand-in-hand with her daughter, Miranda.

Supernatural already has at least one easy way to return for another season without retconning the original ending. Centering on brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester as they travel the country hunting monsters, Supernatural developed a passionate fan base who continue to support the show and its cast. Supernatural ran for an impressive fifteen seasons, finally coming to an end in 2020 with a definitive, if divisive, conclusion. Almost immediately after Supernatural's controversial series finale, fans began speculating about whether the show could ever return.

The Supernatural series finale saw Dean killed while on a hunt, leaving Sam to live out the rest of his life, before the two brothers reconnected in Heaven. While the Supernatural spinoff, The Winchesters, altered Dean's ending a bit, the way the original story ended doesn't leave much room for a potential sixteenth season. Still, Supernatural established a multiverse of different realities where anything is possible, leaving options open for a continuation. But there's another option for a potential Supernatural return that wouldn't involve rewriting the original ending.

After Sam and Dean defeated God (Rob Benedict) himself in season 15's penultimate episode, the series finale saw them go on one final hunt. While taking out a vampire nest initially appeared to be a routine job, Dean was fatally impaled on a spike during the fight. A devastated Sam then gave his brother a hunter's funeral and found a way to continue living his life. While some viewers felt Dean was always destined to die on a hunt, others felt it was an abrupt, lackluster, and even cruel ending for a character who had already suffered so much.

In the end, Sam and Dean reunited in Heaven, where time moves differently. At some point before Sam's death, Dean helped save the multiverse as seen in the finale of The Winchesters. While this opens the door for Dean to return as an angel of sorts, the Supernatural season 15 finale makes season 16 more complicated. To truly bring the Winchesters back together for more hunting adventures, season 16 would have to retcon the show's original ending. While there are ways to undo Dean's death that could work, a future Supernatural project could also take a different route.

 Despite Dean Winchester's death, there are other ways Supernatural could return without undoing the original series finale. A future Supernatural season or seasons could adapt some of the seventeen non-canonical novels that have been written about the Winchester brothers. Beginning with Nevermore by Keith R.A. DeCandido, these novels are standalone adventures depicting monster hunts that take place throughout the show's run. The events of Nevermore take place during the show's second season, while the events of the final book, Children of Anubis by Tim Waggoner, occur during season 12.

Supernatural has inspired countless works of fan fiction over the years, but there are also seventeen official Supernatural tie-in novels.

From serial killers to ghosts to demons, the Supernatural novels feature an array of monsters and villains that would be perfect for an adaptation. While a few of the novels feature direct connections or references to the events of the show, others could easily be adapted to occur anytime during Supernatural's run. Some of the novels also feature other characters from Sam and Dean's life, including Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver), Castiel (Misha Collins), Lucifer (Mark Pellegrino), and Garth (DJ Qualls), and it would be great to see some of these characters return onscreen.

By the time Supernatural came to a close, Sam and Dean had faced off against Lucifer, God, and everything in between. They had saved the world several times over and had literally been to Hell and back. It would be difficult to raise the stakes much higher than that, but a Supernatural season based on the novels could bring the show back to the basics. In its earliest seasons, Supernatural focused on monster-of-the-week episodes in which Sam and Dean traveled to a new town and did what they do best – saved people and hunted things.

An anthology-type Supernatural season inspired by the novels would allow other beloved characters to return, even if they had been killed off during the show's run.

Every season of Supernatural included some of these standalone monster hunt episodes, and they were often some of the show's best. While the intense season-long story arcs were always entertaining (and often heartbreaking), Supernatural developed a near-perfect formula for its standalone episodes. A season based on the novels would allow the show to deliver miniature horror movies each week, while focusing on the dynamic between Sam and Dean. While it might be necessary to move the stories around or change some details, the Supernatural novels could provide an excellent starting point for a future continuation of the show.

 The main complication with adapting the Supernatural novels is that Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles have, of course, continued to age. While they have certainly aged well, they can no longer pass for the Sam and Dean Winchester of Supernatural's earliest seasons. This would require the show to set the stories later during Supernatural's timeline, but it also means the series would have to return sooner rather than later. As the actors continue to noticeably age, it becomes more difficult to set a series during the original show's run.

Supernatural could always come back for season 16, but there is another way that the popular show could continue with far fewer difficulties.

It's impossible to imagine any future Supernatural stories with anyone other than Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles portraying Sam and Dean. If another Supernatural season or mini-series ever does happen, the creative minds behind it will have to find a way to make it work with Jared and Jensen, and potentially Misha Collins, as well. With multiple universes, angelic and demonic powers, and time travel shenanigans, there are numerous ways Supernatural could return with both Sam and Dean Winchester, and the novels could provide a perfect blueprint for more monster-hunting stories.

Some of the most prevalent UFO conspiracy theories — including about aliens being housed a Area 51 in Nevada — were fueled by the Pentagon in an attempt to provide cover for secret weapons programs, according to a bombshell report.

A review by the Department of Defense found that in the 1980s, an Air Force colonel visited a Nevada bar near Area 51 and gave the owner fabricated photos of flying saucers near the secret government base, according to a review of the 2024 report by the Wall Street Journal.

The incident renewed local fervor over UFOs, with the now-retired colonel confessing to Pentagon investigators that he was on an official mission to spread disinformation and hide the true purpose of the site, where the government was testing the first-ever stealth warplane, the F-117 Nighthawk.

The military reasoned that the best way to keep its new technology hidden from the Soviet Union's prying eye during the Cold War was to bury it amid the trove of conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51, investigators found.

The incident is just one of several where government agencies allegedly played up America's UFO mythology for the purpose of protecting its military assets, according to the 2024 report.

Other military attempts to obscure secret projects with conspiracy theories were not made public.

Sean Kirkpatrick, the first director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was the man tasked by the government to dissect countless UFO theories in 2022. 

As his office probed decades of documents, memos and messages across the Defense Department, he found several conspiracy theories that circled back to the Pentagon itself.

In one instance, Kirkpatrick's team found that the Air Force hazed members with briefings introducing them to a fake “Yankee Blue” unit that purported investigated alien aircraft.

The briefings came with a direct order never to mention the details to anyone, with many of the targets of the prank never learning it was all a ruse, according to interviews with Kirkpatrick's team.

The bizarre practice was still taking place during the investigation, with the Pentagon eventually sending an order across the DOD in 2023 to finally put an end to it.

It remains unclear why officials presented subordinates with the fake briefings, with rumors speculating it could have been used as a loyalty test or to spread misinformation.   

Kirkpatrick also found that the government deliberately left people in the dark when they witnessed secret military projects, according to the WSJ. 

Robert Salas, a former Air Force captain, was one of those people. Salas claims he witnessed a UFO descend over a nuclear missile testing site in Montana in 1967. 

During the event, a flashing light was able to disable all 10 nuclear missiles at the bunker, along with all electrical systems.

He was ordered to never discuss what he saw, with Salas maintaining that he witnessed alien visitors chiming in on the Cold War.  

Kirkpatrick's team, however, discovered that Salas was never told that what he actually saw was a test of a fledging electromagnetic pulse test to see if American silos could withstand the radiation of atomic weapons and retaliate if the Soviet Union ever attacked first.

With the test failing, officials decided that it was best no one knew the secret of the vulnerability, so Salas and the other witnesses were intentionally left in the dark to make their own conclusions.

The DOD has acknowledged that not everything has been made public about the AARO's discoveries, but the military claims it will be more transparent in its follow up report scheduled for later this year.

“The department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO's findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,” the DOD said in a statement.

It remains unclear why officials presented subordinates with the fake briefings, with rumors speculating it could have been used as a loyalty test or to spread misinformation.   

Kirkpatrick also found that the government deliberately left people in the dark when they witnessed secret military projects, according to the WSJ. 

Robert Salas, a former Air Force captain, was one of those people. Salas claims he witnessed a UFO descend over a nuclear missile testing site in Montana in 1967. 

During the event, a flashing light was able to disable all 10 nuclear missiles at the bunker, along with all electrical systems.

He was ordered to never discuss what he saw, with Salas maintaining that he witnessed alien visitors chiming in on the Cold War.  

Kirkpatrick's team, however, discovered that Salas was never told that what he actually saw was a test of a fledging electromagnetic pulse test to see if American silos could withstand the radiation of atomic weapons and retaliate if the Soviet Union ever attacked first.

With the test failing, officials decided that it was best no one knew the secret of the vulnerability, so Salas and the other witnesses were intentionally left in the dark to make their own conclusions.

The DOD has acknowledged that not everything has been made public about the AARO's discoveries, but the military claims it will be more transparent in its follow up report scheduled for later this year.

“The department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO's findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,” the DOD said in a statement.

Israeli psychic Uri Geller has threatened to stop activist Greta Thunberg as her Gaza aid flotilla continues its journey to Israel, telling The Jerusalem Post that he also is responsible for the navigation malfunctions on her ship, the Madleen.

"I stopped the navigation systems of the ship," explained Geller, who is also the owner of the Uri Geller Museum in Jaffa. He had warned on his X/Twitter account on Friday that he would use psychic powers to interfere with her ship. On Sunday, Israeli media reports showed that the navigation tools on the ship were malfunctioning, with the leader of the Freedom Flotilla ship accusing Israel of being behind it. 

Hey @GretaThunberg - you won't get to #Gaza on your fake protest. I will use my psychic powers to mess with your boat! 😵‍💫 For a climate activist, it's funny how you don't mind belching out shit into the sea and air with your motorised vessel when it comes to #Israel! 😂… pic.twitter.com/kXqDt9kAkh— Uri Geller (@theurigeller) June 6, 2025

Hey @GretaThunberg - you won't get to #Gaza on your fake protest. I will use my psychic powers to mess with your boat! 😵‍💫 For a climate activist, it's funny how you don't mind belching out shit into the sea and air with your motorised vessel when it comes to #Israel! 😂… pic.twitter.com/kXqDt9kAkh— Uri Geller (@theurigeller) June 6, 2025

Though Israel did not claim to have done so, Defense Minister Israel Katz did warn that the IDF would not allow the ship to reach Gaza.

"I have instructed the IDF to act so that the Madleen flotilla does not reach Gaza. To Greta the antisemite and her friends, I say clearly: you'd better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza," Katz said in a statement, with sources telling the Post previously that Israel is set to intercept the ship when it reaches Gaza in the next 48 hours or so.

Geller, however, takes full credit for the ship's navigation errors. When asked how he did it, he told the Post that he utilized a technique known as remote viewing. This alleged paranormal ability is supposed to allow the user to project their mind elsewhere to be able to see distant people or places.

"It's like a laser, like the IDF's new weapon, the Iron Beam. That's how powerful the mind is for some people."

Geller, who the CIA said presented his paranormal abilities in "a convincing and unambiguous manner" while being studied by them in the 1970s, compared remote viewing to drone piloting, noting that it just requires being in a dark room, often with a computer, and with a joystick. 

"And in my case, I don't need a joystick. My joystick is my mind, and I can navigate my mind into whatever I want to."

Geller said he would not reveal if he interfered with the Madleen's navigation systems of his own volition, or if it was on behalf of the IDF.

"Greta thinks she's heroic, but this is - in my opinion - just a publicity stunt. Everything she's doing is just a publicity stunt," he said. 

"She's supposed to be the greatest environmental activist, but she's using a motorized vessel. She's belching out tons of CO2 on this journey, and she doesn't care. In my opinion, she's a hypocrite."

He further said, "I will warn her through The Jerusalem Post. Greta, if you come to harm Israel, Uri Geller is going to stop you."

Geller concluded the interview by adding, "I congratulate The Jerusalem Post on the most amazing website I have ever seen" in honor of the Post's new updated look.

The Jerusalem Post reached out to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition for comment.

NASA's Parker Solar Probe has directly observed a powerful magnetic explosion in the sun's corona that could help us predict geomagnetic storms on Earth.

While making a death-defying dive through the sun's atmosphere, NASA's Parker Solar Probe has directly recorded a powerful plasma explosion heading toward our star's surface in unprecedented detail.

Parker's new measurements found protons with about 1000 times greater energy than expected and a plasma jet shooting toward the sun, not away from it. Parker was uniquely positioned between the sun and the particles' source, allowing scientists to easily figure out where they came from. These findings indicate that the complexity and strength of tangles in the sun's magnetic field can accelerate charged particles to much greater speeds than expected from the field's strength alone.

The sunward plasma jet was caused by "magnetic reconnection" in the sun's atmosphere — the explosive process in which magnetic fields fracture and reconnect. The powerful phenomenon transforms energy stored in the sun's magnetic field into energy that accelerates the solar wind — the constant stream of charged particles that the sun blasts across the solar system.

Understanding magnetic reconnection is critical for making better predictions about space weather, which is driven by the solar wind and other energetic outbursts from our star. Space weather is a primary suspect for what stripped away Mars' atmosphere, turning it from a habitable planet into an icy desert wasteland. On Earth, space weather can trigger geomagnetic storms that cause blackouts, damage satellites, interfere with radio and GPS signals, and even put astronauts at risk. On the bright side, it also gives Earth its signature glorious auroras.

The sun's magnetic field is extremely powerful, complex and dynamic. Space weather predictions require complicated computer simulations based on equations that describe how magnetic fields behave — but the sun is so large and convoluted that these equations will always be approximations. To improve the models' accuracy, scientists must collect extremely detailed measurements of the sun. This is where the Parker Solar Probe comes in.



The Parker Solar Probe is the first mission to fly into the sun's upper atmosphere, called the corona. It has been directly measuring magnetic fields and particles in and around the corona in unprecedented detail, providing scientific insight into the heliosphere (the sun's atmosphere, which encompasses the entire solar system in a massive, elongated bubble).

"These findings indicate that magnetic reconnection … is an important source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind," lead study author Mihir Desai, director of the Southwest Research Institute's Department of Space Research, said in a statement. "Everywhere there are magnetic fields there will be magnetic reconnection. But the Sun's magnetic fields are much stronger near the star, so there's a lot more stored energy to be released."

Understanding the workings of magnetic reconnection events could help scientists better predict harmful space weather, the researchers said.

"Reports from the American Meteorological Society indicated that the powerful solar events in May 2024 wreaked havoc with farmers when extreme geomagnetic storms disrupted the precise GPS-guided navigation systems used to plant, fertilize and harvest rows of seeds, causing an estimated loss of up to $500 million in earning potential," Desai said. "Parker's access to this new data is critical, particularly as we remain in the midst of a very active solar cycle."

The latest measurements of magnetic reconnection, reported in a paper published May 29 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, are one of many new discoveries Parker has made. In 2023, over 700 peer-reviewed scientific papers were published using data collected in the probe's first four years of operation, and there are still many more discoveries to be made. The spacecraft completed its second ultra-close flyby of the sun on March 22, zooming within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the sun's surface — matching its own record from December 2024.

A number of 'smoke' rings have been spotted in oceans around the world and a new study suggests it could help us in our search for extra-terrestrial life.

These rings aren't actually made of smoke at all, actually being made of bubbles that are being blown by humpback whales.

In a behaviour that looks eerily similar to a human smoker blowing rings or 'Os' themselves, these rings are far larger and stick around for longer in the water.

It is suggested that the actions from the sea creatures could be a friendly interaction with humans, with those swimming or sailing past able to see the large circular shape.

They may represent a form of curiosity, and might even aid humans in their search for alien life.

Though these signs have only been seen in an ocean environment, researchers at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute and University of California believe them to be promising, publishing their findings in the journal Marine Mammal Science.

Bubbles are known to be used as tools by Humpback whales, whether it be in a method to herd fish, or making bubble trails to attract mates, but this new behaviour isn't related to their eating habits or reproduction, the study says.

It suggests that they are attempts to communicate with humans, as co-lead author Dr Fred Sharpe explained: “Humpback whales live in complex societies, are acoustically diverse, use bubble tools and assist other species being harassed by predators.

“Now, akin to a candidate signal, we show they are blowing bubble rings in our direction in an apparent attempt to playfully interact, observe our response, and/or engage in some form of communication,” the UC Davis Affiliate added.

Researchers looked at 12 instances where 11 individual whales across the world exhibited the behaviour, as every case saw the whales approach the on-looking humans to release a total of 39 bubble rings, in a study titled 'Humpback Whales Blow Poloidal Vortex Bubble Rings.'

This new study is part of the WhaleSETI project, focusing on non-human intelligence as a way to better understand potential signals in the future from alien life.

Scientists say that understanding how non-human, non-terrestrial beings display curiosity or other feels can help to better understand any future alien intelligence we may run into.

These findings could lead to a better understanding of communication from extra-terrestrial intelligence, says SETI Institute scientist and co-author Dr. Laurance Doyle.

“Because of current limitations on technology, an important assumption of the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is that extra-terrestrial intelligence and life will be interested in making contact and so target human receivers,” he added.

Dr. Doyle said that this assumption is 'supported' in the evolution of humpback whales' 'curious behaviour.'

Co-lead author Jodi Frediani pointed out the 'friendly behaviour' from humpback whales to humans, explaining: “We've now located a dozen whales from populations around the world, the majority of which have voluntarily approached boats and swimmers blowing bubble rings during these episodes of curious behaviour.”

The man who stripped down the espionage thriller earlier this year also revives the original atmosphere of the haunted house story

Ghosts have been a perpetual fixture of human artistry for generations, one of our oldest existential curiosities — we've used them as a tool to wrestle with mortality in books, live theatre, and, (since 1896's The Haunted Castle) movies as well. They're perhaps the original on-screen horror archetype, predating even Dracula. Their ubiquity speaks to the power that genre cinema has in helping us understand not just mortality, but trauma, and regret, and historical bloodshed as well.

For as long as they've haunted the collective cinematic consciousness, they've also undergone changes that reflect our increasingly cynical appetites. Gone are the hokey, spectral-white, mostly peaceful apparitions from the Golden Age of Hollywood, replaced by the overtly evil, often gruesome-looking ghouls made popular by Paranormal Activity and The Conjuring. Modern ghost stories resemble their classic Gothic origins increasingly little, which is why Steven Soderbergh's recent Presence feels so fresh: it marries a genuinely unique visual style with the atmosphere of a traditional haunting.

While the initial setup is quite simple (a relatively well-off, seemingly picture–perfect upper class family moves into a new house in the suburbs that turns out to be haunted), the film's divisive visual approach is anything but. Known for constantly playing around with different formats for the sake of convenience, or even to challenge how audiences approach a story (shooting Unsane and High Flying Bird on iPhones, for instance), Soderbergh shot Presence himself entirely from a 1st person POV, specifically that of the titular ghost. Some folks were naturally off-put by the uncanny, disorienting camera movement, but in the context of the genre it's an inspired decision. Never before has a movie committed so fully to immersing you in the experience of existing in a hypothetical afterlife, but there's also a profound sense of isolation evoked by the aesthetic style. Even before the movie reveals exactly who this presence is (or was), the visual storytelling conveys such a deep feeling of sorrow, and of being on the outside looking in — curious and wistful, and perhaps envious, of the life it observes in the Payne family.

Part of how the film resurrects the classical nature of a ghost story is truthfully in its focus on the (suburban) Gothic domestic drama unfolding inside the house. Like the emotionally and psychologically destructive tragedies of Poe's House of Usher and Shirley Jackson's original Hill House, the paranormal in Presence functions like a house of mirrors, turning familial trauma into a frightening, inexplicable abstraction. Grief becomes an unrecognizable and warped reflection of human yearning and sadness. But instead of reflecting the social anxieties of the 1830s, or even the 1950s, here the supernatural points a flashlight at the skeletons in the closets of perfectionist 21st century suburbanites, their socioeconomic appetites, and their fatalist imperfections.

A haunting might be worth it for this house in this economy.

Soderbergh's specter observes silently and tries to understand its reason for existing, a goal it ironically shares with the living. Just like it, audiences watch invisibly and scrutinize the immediate flaws in this idealistic fresh start and the hollow victory of “upward mobility.” Rebekah's (Lucy Liu) heavily implied white-collar financial fraud, the Oedipal undertones of her fawning relationship with her son Tyler (Eddy Maday), how that toxic dynamic nurtures the confidence with which he belittles his grieving sister Chloe (Callina Liang), and how the entire collapsing sandcastle is driving meek father/husband Chris (Chris Sullivan) maybe further and further away from them — all of it is passively witnessed by a force desperately trying to figure out how to make its influence active, not to terrorize, but perhaps for something else.

There's such a caustic bite to the way that these characters interact with each other, very specifically in regards to how they react to emotional or spiritual sincerity. Whether it's the stone-faced stubbornness with which Rebekah ignores Chris' obvious feelings of emotional neglect (watching Liu and Sullivan perform marital crisis here is some of the best acting of the year), or the conscience-less teenage cruelty Tyler deploys in the face of his sister's very real emotional turmoil and her vague clairvoyant sensitivity. But it's not as if the problem is exclusively their own, there's a lack of empathy to the world at large that bleeds into the house from other places as well. 

One of cinema's fastest inductees into the hall of Most Uncomfortable Boy Moms.

The financial and social circles that the family navigate (the relative privilege of the upper-middle class, competitive private schools and the wildly repressed and rebellious adolescent communities they inevitably cultivate, and the broad emotional disaffection experienced by many high school boys today) feel rotten, shredded by a culture where greed and consumerism and schadenfreude have consumed a reverence for life and mortality and the thought of experiencing either sincerely. But by the time their experience with their phantom is over, the Payne family's lives have been radically upended, acutely refocused on what truly matters by a harrowing and inexplicable experience that leaves them (and will leave you) emotionally shell-shocked. Presence works because at its best, its bold visual approach and its Gothic traditions reminds us that more than anything, a good ghost story should remind us about the fragility of life itself and how much every moment matters.

A Pentagon report released in 2024 found no evidence of a cover-up regarding extraterrestrial life but omitted how the government had perpetuated UFO myths through deliberate disinformation. This omission led to accusations that the report itself was an attempt at a cover-up.

An investigation conducted by a unit of the United States Department of Defense uncovered that the "UFO mythology" in the US was fueled by the Pentagon's own disinformation. The inquiry revealed that these disinformation campaigns were aimed at hiding the testing of military technology, including stealth fighter jets. Investigators are still determining whether these campaigns were local initiatives or centralized programs within the military hierarchy.

Central to the investigation was the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established under the US Department of Defense in July 2022 based on legislation passed by Congress. The main mission of AARO was to investigate so-called Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) observed in all domains, including land, sea, air, and space. AARO investigators reviewed government documents dating back to 1945 and interrogated current and former military officers.

Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, a former chief scientist at the Missile and Space Intelligence Center, was recruited in 2022 to lead the investigation at the direction of Congress through AARO. He identified issues regarding the dissemination of disinformation and reported them to Department of Defense leadership. He resigned from his position as AARO director in December 2023. Four months after his resignation, a report was released that omitted these critical issues, leading to controversy over concealment.

"The craft was described as an antigravity maneuvering vehicle," stated the Wall Street Journal, noting the sensational nature of some of the misinformation disseminated. According to its investigations, military officials had disseminated misleading documents to create a "smokescreen" regarding real secret weapon programs, as in the case of Area 51.

Area 51, long a subject of conspiracy theories and associated with claims of extraterrestrial life, turned out to be a cover for secret military projects developed during the Cold War. These projects included the testing of classified stealth fighter jets and electromagnetic pulse generators. In a case from the 1980s, a US Air Force colonel visited a bar near Area 51 and gave the bar owner photographs allegedly showing flying saucers. These tampered photographs later adorned the walls of the bar, becoming one of the most talked-about topics of that period.

When these aircraft were seen by the public, there was concern about the military program being exposed. To prevent exposure, the Air Force allowed the local population to believe in UFO sightings rather than acknowledge the existence of their aircraft. In some cases, U.S. officials had allowed the spread of myths related to UFOs in line with "national security interests." One of the purposes of these efforts was to deter the Soviet Union from identifying weaknesses in nuclear facilities and equipment.

"For decades, certain new commanders of the Air Force's most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer," detailed the Wall Street Journal. Many of these commanders were informed they were joining "Yankee Blue," a program aimed at reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology. This practice affected hundreds of officers who believed in its authenticity, signed non-disclosure agreements, and never told their spouses.

In the spring of 2023, an order was given to discontinue the briefings regarding the false UFO photographs. The Wall Street Journal reported that the defense secretary's office sent a memo ordering the practice to stop immediately, but the damage was already done. The unclear Pentagon bureaucracy regarding secret programs nested within other secret programs created fertile ground for the spread of myths.

The deliberate spread of UFO myths has led to a wide-ranging investigation at the Pentagon, tracing examinations back to the 1980s.

Actor Michelle Randolph is in early negotiations to lead Malibu, a subterranean horror thriller helmed by Paranormal Activity 2 director Tod Williams. The film, currently in pre-production, is set to begin shooting later this year and promises to deliver a genre-bending scarefest anchored by a strong female lead.

Produced under the Spooky Pictures banner—run by genre veterans Roy Lee (Barbarian, It) and Steven Schneider (Insidious, The Devil Inside)—Malibu is being pitched as a “thriller skulking around in the subterranean horror subgenre.” While specific plot details remain tightly under wraps, the film's tone and pedigree suggest a gritty psychological horror story with a claustrophobic edge.

Michelle, 27, has been steadily building her portfolio with a string of high-profile roles across television and streaming platforms. She recently starred in Taylor Sheridan's oil-rig drama Landman (2024) alongside Billy Bob Thornton, as well as the Yellowstone prequel 1923 (2022) and the mystery series The Resort (2021). Her film credits include the comedy The Throwback (2023), showcasing her range beyond dark drama.

If confirmed, Malibu would mark Michelle's first full-fledged foray into horror—a genre that continues to thrive both critically and commercially. It also aligns with her upcoming appearance in Scream 7, directed by franchise creator Kevin Williamson. Slated for release next year, the new Scream instalment is already generating buzz and could further cement Michelle's place in the horror circuit.

While no official announcement has been made about her role in Malibu, the industry chatter signals a promising next move. With Tod Williams behind the camera and the reliable horror pedigree of Spooky Pictures, the project is shaping up to be one to watch. As the horror renaissance continues, Michelle Randolph may just be its next scream queen-in-the-making.
