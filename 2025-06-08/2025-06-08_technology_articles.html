                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a conversation with NBC News, Trump said he has no interest in making nice with Musk right now, but did make it clear that if the billionaire decides to switch parties and back Democratic candidates, “he'll have to pay consequences for that.” He has already threatened to cancel the billions of dollars worth of government contracts that Musk's companies currently count on, and his close ally and former advisor, Steve Bannon, has encouraged Trump to investigate Musk as an “illegal alien,” deport him, and seize control of his companies under the Defense Production Act. In a series of now-deleted posts, Musk claimed that Trump appears in the Epstein files and has been withholding information in order to protect himself and supported the idea of impeaching the president whom he spent nearly $300 million trying to get into office. Musk took those posts down, but has continued to be critical of Trump. Trump rebuked the attacks in his conversation with NBC, calling the Epstein angle “old news” and that he had “nothing to do with” Epstein. Other than that, Trump has basically just decided to wash his hands of Musk—at least for the time being. When asked if his relationship with the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is over, Trump told NBC, “I would assume so, yeah.” He also reiterated that he has no intention of speaking with Musk directly and said, “I'm too busy doing other things” and “I have no intention of speaking to him.” That remains pretty mild for a guy who is certainly capable of being a bomb thrower, but Trump might have a sense that he will come off better by easing off after Musk flew off the handle. A YouGov poll found that among Republicans, 71% would take his side compared to just 6% who said they would throw their backing behind Musk. Even if you expand the survey sample to include Democrats and Independents, Trump comes out ahead with 28% of support compared to just 8% for Musk (though notably, 52% said “Neither,” so the “a pox on both your houses” demographic is strong). Politico reported Sunday that aides representing both sides have spoken, and there is something of a mutual truce at the moment to stop the bomb-throwing—though it noted that neither Musk nor Trump wanted to stop. Seems like they are locked in a battle of restraint at the moment, which is not exactly a skill either of them is known to possess. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Retro tech tuber Perifractic has released an intriguing video dubbed Can We Save Commodore? Ultimately, this will mean a whole host of new Commodore branded and ‘chicken head' logo-bearing products that the community believes pass muster to be worthy of the official marque. Nevertheless, it is pretty interesting for retro fans to hear about the chance of a beloved brand of old being rejuvenated – and not just for a cash grab (fingers crossed). After an intro, a brief history of Commodore, and talk about the achievements of the retro community up to this point, Perifractic starts to outline his plan. Starting to outline the plan, Perifractic explains that to begin, efforts should be made to “negotiate an exclusive license with Commodore.” This would honor the company legacy, deliver fairer pricing for the community, and provide QC-tested branded Commodore machines, official upgrades, and official replacement parts. Next, the video broached the potentially thorny issue of funding in situations like this where crowdfunding isn't possible. Don't worry about checking out the form, all it does is give Retro Recipes a way to get in touch about updates. However, you can also use parts of the form to indicate if you are interested in any investments, partnerships, licensing, or other business matters. Perifractic reveals that he received a message direct from Commodore Corporation B.V. that states “yes we can grant you an exclusive license, but your team seems to know Commodore better than we do, we might like to sell you the whole company.” Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was palpable excitement around Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) last year. Apple's broader struggles with AI have become clearer over the past year. The vision that Apple sold in 2024 — a seamless blend of on-device AI, revamped Siri interactions, and powerful new developer capabilities — has yet to materialize in full. Apple Intelligence features saw a staggered rollout that came with several hiccups. The personalized version of Siri that was showcased last year has been delayed, which matters because Apple framed the new Siri as a cornerstone of its AI strategy — a context-aware assistant that could understand user behavior across apps. This also meant that developers couldn't take full advantage of the new AI-powered Siri, and users couldn't rely on the assistant to perform in-app actions as promised. For developers, that's a lost opportunity to build more interactive, intelligent app experiences. With WWDC 2025 now just around the corner, expectations for consumer-facing Apple Intelligence features are more cautious than last year. Most developers and analysts are now hoping for incremental improvements: smoother integration of AI into native apps, and tools that empower developers to actually use the AI that Apple is building. One of Apple's best opportunities lies in enabling AI-assisted app development. The rise of tools like Cursor, Replit, and Bolt.new has made code generation a whole lot easier, helping developers, and even non-developers, bring products to life faster. At the same time, tools like WordPress, Hostinger, Canva, and Figma now let non-technical users create simple apps using natural language prompts. Ideally, new AI tooling should allow more developers to create apps and post them on the App Store. That would enrich the iOS app ecosystem and open up new revenue opportunities for Apple, which is even more critical now that some of its App Store income is under threat. Apple has made some announcements, but many have yet to materialize. Swift Assist, a coding assistant for Xcode, was shown off last year but hasn't seen wide release. In April, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers asked Apple to remove restrictions around linking to outside payment methods for digital purchases in apps for the U.S. App Store. More importantly, the ruling also barred Apple from charging any fees for these kinds of payments. This means developers will encourage customers to purchase subscriptions and add-ons outside the App Store, also possibly at a discounted rate compared with their App Store prices. This ruling could also spur other regulators to put similar pressure on Apple and cull App Store fees for third-party payments. Earlier this week, Apple reported that it generated $1.3 trillion in billings and sales in 2024, with 90% of that value generation happening without paying Apple a commission. Amid all this, Apple needs to reassert the value of its ecosystem. It's not clear if Apple will cut its commissions, but it will be interesting to see what kind of App Store features the company launches to make native iOS apps a more lucrative avenue for developers.

Researchers from the University of Tartu in Estonia have developed a way to repurpose old smartphones, chaining them together to build "tiny data centers" used for processing data on location and in real-time. “Innovation often begins not with something new, but with a new way of thinking about the old, re-imagining its role in shaping the future,” said Pervasive Computing Associate Professor Huber Flores. What the researchers did was get four old smartphones and remove their batteries to reduce the risk of leaks and contamination. This setup will make it easier to reuse the base and replace the phones if and when they break. We're unsure what other changes the team made to the phones, but it seems that they also created custom software for them. They also likely attached external sensors to gather data, especially as the first test was done underwater. Previously, this was only possible with a scuba diver recording video and then bringing the footage to the surface for study. This isn't a far-fetched idea, too, especially as there are many guides online that teach you how to reuse your old phones and tablets for other tasks. For example, there are tutorials on how you can turn an old phone into a webcam that's way better than most cheap cameras on the market. There's likely going to be a market for this if the team can turn this initial prototype into a cheap, reliable, and easy-to-use and customize edge node. If this catches on, this will potentially give a second life to the millions, if not billions, of old smartphones out there that are heading into the recycler or even straight to the dump.

YouTube has recently expanded its ad-blocking measures, closing the loopholes that browsers and other third-party extensions with ad-blocking capabilities used to remove ads from YouTube videos. But even so, a few apps, including Mozilla Firefox (and extensions), exploited weaknesses in YouTube's protection over the past few months. However, this is no longer the case, according to 9to5Google, and some users who previously bypassed ads reported they can no longer play YouTube videos unless they add the video hosting site to their adblocker's allowlist or disable their ad-blocker altogether. You can subscribe to YouTube if you want to get rid of ads on the platform, but many people do not like doing that. After all, why pay a monthly fee when there is an easy way to get around the ads? But now that Google has acted again to close loopholes, people are up in arms about the measures. Nevertheless, it seems that not everyone has been affected by this change yet. Users in Southeast Asia and Europe still seem to have fully-functioning ad blockers for YouTube. We do not know if YouTube hasn't implemented the changes in those regions yet, or if updated filter-lists have already been deployed by ad blockers devs to counter the latest ad blocker-blocker efforts. While we understand the need for Google to make money, people will still want to access their services for free and without any irksome interruptions. This will likely be the whack-a-mole game that YouTube, and its parent company Alphabet, will need to do as long as it exists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is gearing up for an offensive on SteamOS. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Signs of Microsoft's efforts to bring its Windows and Xbox platforms closer together have started appearing online. Case in point, the just-dropped YouTube trailer for MIO: Memories In Orbit shows the game's availability on both Steam and "Xbox PC." This shows how the company is pushing for gamers to use the Xbox app on their gaming PCs instead of just installing a title directly, with Redmond aiming squarely at Steam. The Verge believes that this was intentional on the part of Microsoft to “closely combine its Xbox and Windows stores.” While the Nintendo Switch pioneered modern handheld consoles (with the Switch 2 dropping in stores a few days ago), Steam Deck revolutionized it in 2022 when it allowed gamers to play their favorite PC games on such a portable device while running SteamOS. Other PC manufacturers soon followed suit, with Asus, Lenovo, MSI, and even Zotac launching their own competitors. All of them used Windows 11 — until Lenovo launched the Legion Go S With SteamOS. This console ditched Windows in favor of Valve's Linux-based operating system, so it's normal for one to think that this would primarily be a Steam Deck competitor. Although not surprising, the results probably still alarmed Microsoft, with reports saying the company shelved its work on a first-party Xbox handheld to focus on revamping Windows 11 portable performance. To be fair, Microsoft has already had something like this in the works for months (or maybe even years) now. News leaked that Asus has been working on Project Kennan, a handheld gaming console that will carry the Xbox brand and has been more closely integrated with Xbox Game Pass. Nevertheless, we expect it to arrive in late 2025, which is the likely reason why we're starting to see Xbox PC logos on game launches. Most desktop and laptop gamers still stick with Windows, even though you can install SteamOS on your PC (but it isn't mainstream gaming desktop ready, as yet).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. If alien civilizations exist, he said, some should surely have had enough time to expand throughout the cosmos. Many answers to Fermi's “paradox” have been proposed: Maybe alien civilizations burn out or destroy themselves before they can become interstellar wanderers. A new proposal by an interdisciplinary team of researchers challenges that bleak conclusion. If they're right, complex and intelligent life should be widespread. According to this principle, entities are selected because they are richer in a kind of information that enables them to perform some kind of function. They argue that the basic laws of physics are not “complete” in the sense of supplying all we need to comprehend natural phenomena; rather, evolution—biological or otherwise—introduces functions and novelties that could not even in principle be predicted from physics alone. Michael Wong, an astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC. Others argue that extending evolutionary ideas about function to non-living systems is an overreach. The quantitative value that measures information in this new approach is not only relative—it changes depending on context—it's impossible to calculate. But unlike most scientific theories, it can't predict much about what is to come. Might embedding it within a meta-law of increasing complexity let us glimpse what the future holds? Szostak—who six years later would get a Nobel Prize for unrelated work—wanted to quantify the amount of information or complexity that biological molecules like proteins or DNA strands embody. Per Kolmogorov, the complexity of a string of symbols (such as binary 1s and 0s) depends on how concisely one can specify that sequence uniquely. For example, consider DNA, which is a chain of four different building blocks called nucleotides. Α strand composed only of one nucleotide, repeating again and again, has much less complexity—and, by extension, encodes less information—than one composed of all four nucleotides in which the sequence seems random (as is more typical in the genome). Jack Szostak proposed a way to quantify information in biological systems. But Szostak pointed out that Kolmogorov's measure of complexity neglects an issue crucial to biology: how biological molecules function. In biology, sometimes many different molecules can do the same job. Consider RNA molecules, some of which have biochemical functions that can easily be defined and measured. In particular, short strands of RNA called aptamers securely bind to other molecules. If only a single aptamer can do the job, then it's unique, just as a long, seemingly random sequence of letters is unique. Szostak said that this aptamer would have a lot of what he called “functional information.” Szostak went on to show that in a case like this, functional information can be measured experimentally. He made a bunch of RNA aptamers and used chemical methods to identify and isolate the ones that would bind to a chosen target molecule. Hazen came across Szostak's idea while thinking about the origin of life—an issue that drew him in as a mineralogist, because chemical reactions taking place on minerals have long been suspected to have played a key role in getting life started. “I concluded that talking about life versus nonlife is a false dichotomy,” Hazen said. In 2007 Hazen collaborated with Szostak to write a computer simulation involving algorithms that evolve via mutations. Hazen could not see how to take it any further until Wong accepted a fellowship at the Carnegie Institution in 2021. Wong had a background in planetary atmospheres, but he and Hazen discovered they were thinking about the same questions. “From the very first moment that we sat down and talked about ideas, it was unbelievable,” Hazen said. Robert Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC. “I thought it was too narrowly constrained to life as we know it here on Earth, but life elsewhere may take a completely different evolutionary trajectory. So how do we abstract far enough away from life on Earth that we'd be able to notice life elsewhere even if it had different chemical specifics, but not so far that we'd be including all kinds of self-organizing structures like hurricanes?” The pair soon realized that they needed expertise from a whole other set of disciplines. “We needed people who came at this problem from very different points of view, so that we all had checks and balances on each other's prejudices,” Hazen said. They suspected that functional information was the key to understanding how complex systems like living organisms arise through evolutionary processes happening over time. “But it seems like there's a much more idiosyncratic pathway that the universe takes. We think it's because of selection for function—a very orderly process that leads to ordered states. At first glance, it doesn't seem a promising idea. All it really implies, Hazen said, is that some selective process favors one entity over lots of other potential combinations. A huge number of different minerals can form from silicon, oxygen, aluminum, calcium, and so on. But only a few are found in any given environment. “Information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge, and energy.” This might seem trivial, like saying that some objects exist while other ones don't, even if they could in theory. But Hazen and Wong have shown that, even for minerals, functional information has increased over the course of Earth's history. Minerals evolve toward greater complexity (though not in the Darwinian sense). These gathered into the nuclei of hydrogen, helium, and lithium atoms. And only when some stars had exhausted their fusion fuel did their collapse and explosion in supernovas create heavier elements such as heavy metals. “There is a more universal description that drives the evolution of complex systems.” Second, he said, there might be “an arrow in time that describes this increasing complexity,” similar to the way the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the increase in entropy, is thought to create a preferred direction of time. Finally, Wong said, “information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge and energy.” Biologists have long recognized transitions where the complexity of organisms increases abruptly. The arrival of humans was arguably another major and rapid evolutionary transition. Evolutionary biologists have tended to view each of these transitions as a contingent event. But within the functional-information framework, it seems possible that such jumps in evolutionary processes (whether biological or not) are inevitable. In these jumps, Wong pictures the evolving objects as accessing an entirely new landscape of possibilities and ways to become organized, as if penetrating to the “next floor up.” Crucially, what matters—the criteria for selection, on which continued evolution depends—also changes, plotting a wholly novel course. On the next floor up, possibilities await that could not have been guessed before you reached it. For example, during the origin of life it might initially have mattered that proto-biological molecules would persist for a long time—that they'd be stable. But once such molecules became organized into groups that could catalyze one another's formation—what Kauffman has called autocatalytic cycles—the molecules themselves could be short-lived, so long as the cycles persisted. Ricard Solé of the Santa Fe Institute thinks such jumps might be equivalent to phase transitions in physics, such as the freezing of water or the magnetization of iron: They are collective processes with universal features, and they mean that everything changes, everywhere, all at once. Yet finding new uses for existing components is precisely what evolution does. This repurposing reflects how biological evolution is jerry-rigged, making use of what's available. From the soup of single-celled organisms that constituted life on Earth 3 billion years ago, no elephant could have suddenly emerged—this required a whole host of preceding, contingent but specific innovations. However, there is no theoretical limit to the number of uses an object has. “Not only do we not know what will happen, we don't even know what can happen.” Photosynthesis was such a profound development; so were eukaryotes, nervous systems and language. But this upper level of rules itself needs to evolve. The physicist Paul Davies of Arizona State University agrees that biological evolution “generates its own extended possibility space which cannot be reliably predicted or captured via any deterministic process from prior states. Davies and his co-workers have recently suggested that evolution in an expanding accessible phase space might be formally equivalent to the “incompleteness theorems” devised by the mathematician Kurt Gödel. Gödel showed that any system of axioms in mathematics permits the formulation of statements that can't be shown to be true or false. We can only decide such statements by adding new axioms. Davies and colleagues say that, as with Gödel's theorem, the key factor that makes biological evolution open-ended and prevents us from being able to express it in a self-contained and all-encompassing phase space is that it is self-referential: The appearance of new actors in the space feeds back on those already there to create new possibilities for action. This isn't the case for physical systems, which, even if they have, say, millions of stars in a galaxy, are not self-referential. This connection between biological evolution and the issue of noncomputability, Davies said, “goes right to the heart of what makes life so magical.” Is biology special, then, among evolutionary processes in having an open-endedness generated by self-reference? A watch gets made faster if the watchmaker is not blind. That would run counter to what some biologists have thought. The eminent evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr believed that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence was doomed because the appearance of humanlike intelligence is “utterly improbable.” After all, he said, if intelligence at a level that leads to cultures and civilizations were so adaptively useful in Darwinian evolution, how come it only arose once across the entire tree of life? Humans attained planetary dominance so rapidly (for better or worse) that the question of when it will happen again becomes moot. If the new “law of increasing functional information” is right, it looks as though life, once it exists, is bound to get more complex by leaps and bounds. It doesn't have to rely on some highly improbable chance event. What's more, such an increase in complexity seems to imply the appearance of new causal laws in nature that, while not incompatible with the fundamental laws of physics governing the smallest component parts, effectively take over from them in determining what happens next. Arguably we see this already in biology: Galileo's (apocryphal) experiment of dropping two masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa no longer has predictive power when the masses are not cannonballs but living birds. In place of functional information, assembly theory relies on a number called the assembly index, which measures the minimum number of steps required to make an object from its constituent ingredients. “Laws for living systems must be somewhat different than what we have in physics now,” Walker said, “but that does not mean that there are no laws.” But she doubts that the putative law of functional information can be rigorously tested in the lab. “I am not sure how one could say [the theory] is right or wrong, since there is no way to test it objectively,” she said. Hazen acknowledges that, for most physical objects, it is impossible to calculate functional information even in principle. Even for a single living cell, he admits, there's no way of quantifying it. But he argues that this is not a sticking point, because we can still understand it conceptually and get an approximate quantitative sense of it. Wong sees a potential application of their ideas in astrobiology. That's because natural selection has picked out some favored compounds. There's much more glucose in living cells, for example, than you'd expect if molecules were simply being made either randomly or according to their thermodynamic stability. So one potential signature of lifelike entities on other worlds might be similar signs of selection outside what chemical thermodynamics or kinetics alone would generate. Hazen's team has been fielding queries from researchers ranging from economists to neuroscientists, who are keen to see if the approach can help. But whether or not functional information turns out to be the right tool for thinking about these questions, many researchers seem to be converging on similar questions about complexity, information, evolution (both biological and cosmic), function and purpose, and the directionality of time. It's hard not to suspect that something big is afoot.
