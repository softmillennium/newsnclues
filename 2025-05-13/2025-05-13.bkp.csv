            A dangerous round of early season extreme heat is on tap for parts of Texas this week in a prelude to what's expected to be an abnormally hot summer across much of the United States.
    


            Long-standing records could fall across central and southwest Texas, including in Austin and San Antonio, as temperatures reach highs that would be unusual for mid-summer, let alone early-to-mid May.
    


            More than 6 million people in Texas are under heat advisories from the National Weather Service Tuesday and Wednesday, with one forecast office calling this early-season heat wave “potentially historic.”
    


            Millions of people in central Texas, including the Austin metro area, will be in the National Weather Service's “major” heat risk Wednesday. Such heat “affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration,” the agency warns.
    


            Parts of southern Texas, near the Mexico border, are forecast to be at risk of “extreme” heat—an unusually early appearance in the year for the highest risk level.
    


            San Antonio and parts of the greater Houston area are at risk of “major” heat Thursday.
    


Where Americans are at the most risk for extreme heat this year



            The heat is likely to pose a serious health threat simply because it's the first heat wave of the season, and an early one, coming before people have become accustomed to high temperatures.
    


            “The risk for heat related illness is higher than normal,” the Austin-San Antonio forecast office cautioned, particularly for vulnerable groups including the elderly and young children.
    


            The unseasonably high temperatures could also stress Texas' power grid with record or near-record demand. Texas, with its independent grid, is no stranger to extreme weather-related electricity problems, whether by heat waves or cold snaps. However, the state has added large amounts of solar power and battery storage since its winter power crisis in 2021.
    


            Human-caused climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme heat events in the US and around the globe.
    


            And it's supercharging Texas heat: Climate change has made San Antonio's forecast high temperature on Wednesday about five times more likely than it would have been without fossil fuel pollution, according to the nonprofit research group Climate Central.
    


Texas needs money to keep the lights on during extreme weather. It's funding more fossil fuel instead



            Before 2022, San Antonio had only seen two heat waves during which there were three straight days with highs of 105 degrees or hotter – this week could potentially bring the sixth such stretch in the last three years if temperatures climb just 1 to 2 degrees higher than currently forecast.
    


            Heat is by far the deadliest form of severe weather in the US, killing on average twice as many people a year as tornadoes and hurricanes combined.
    


            While summer heat elbows its way into spring, the actual summer months are shaping up to be warmer than normal for the entire US.
    


            The latest forecast from the Climate Prediction Center paints a very toasty picture from June through August: Above average temperatures are likely over the Lower 48, Alaska and Hawaii this summer.
    


            A sizzling summer is most likely in the West and parts of the South and Northeast — an outlook strikingly similar to last summer's predictions. Last summer was the second-warmest on record for the West and the warmest on record for the Southwest. The Northeast had its fourth-warmest summer.
    


            The summer outlook also includes a concerning precipitation trend for a large portion of the US that goes hand-in-hand with prolonged heat: Drier than normal conditions are expected for portions of the West, Midwest and much of the Plains.
    


            Dryness and heat are cyclical. The hotter an area becomes, the more it dries out, which could be a recipe for new or worsening drought. A dry area will then get even hotter as most of the sun's energy goes into heating the ground, with little energy lost to evaporation of wet soil.
    


            It's the opposite story for the East and Southeast, where wetter than normal conditions are likely — a projection that could be due in part to forecasts for an active hurricane season. Combine that with the anticipated heat, and it could be a humid summer for these areas.

Follow:


            A court in Paris on Tuesday found French actor Gérard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021 and handed him an 18-month suspended prison sentence, in a fall from grace for a towering figure of French cinema.
    


            In one of the highest-profile #MeToo cases to come before judges in France, Depardieu repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer said he would appeal the court's decision.
    


            Depardieu, 76, was a towering figure in French cinema, starring in more than 200 films over five decades, including “Green Card,” “The Last Metro” and “Cyrano de Bergerac.”
    


            His trial marked a moment of reckoning for the #MeToo protest movement over sexual violence, which has failed to gain the same traction in France as in the United States, although there are signs that social attitudes are changing.
    


            One of the two plaintiffs, Amelie K, a set decorator now aged 54, told the court the actor had groped her all over her body as he trapped her between his legs and made explicit sexual comments on set in 2021.
    


            “I was terrified, he was laughing,” she recounted.
    


            Depardieu, who denied sexual assault, had argued before the court that he did not consider placing a hand on a person's buttocks sexual assault and that some women were too easily shocked.
    


            Handing down his sentence, the presiding judge, Thierry Donard, said of Depardieu: “He does not seem to have grasped either the concept of consent or the deleterious and traumatic consequences of his behaviour towards the women he assaulted.”
    


            He ordered Depardieu, who was not in court for the verdict, to be put on a list of sex offenders.
    


            Depardieu has figured prominently in the debate over the #MeToo movement in France, as he faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations that put a spotlight on how women are treated in the movie industry.
    


            Prosecutors say he should face trial in a separate rape investigation, following allegations brought by actress Charlotte Arnould, 29, who said she could not bear remaining silent any longer.
    


            More than a dozen women have accused Depardieu of sexual violence, though not all have filed complaints.
    


            Depardieu has consistently denied wrongdoing. “Never, absolutely never, have I abused a woman,” he wrote in an open letter in the daily Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023.
    


            The Depardieu trial laid bare a generational divide in France over sexism.
    


            Earlier during the investigation, a group of 50 French stars, including Carla Bruni, wife of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, denounced what they called the “lynching” of Depardieu.
    


            Brigitte Bardot, 90, told BFM TV this week that “those who have talent and grope a girl get thrown into the gutter.”
    


            Women's rights campaigners say they have seen a shift in attitudes in France - notably following the case of Gisele Pelicot whose ex-husband was convicted last year of inviting dozens of men to rape her after drugging her unconscious.
    


            “It's truly a victory and a step forward. We're making progress,” Amelie K. told reporters after the verdict.

A member of the European Parliament claims he and other lawmakers who recently traveled to Moscow are facing an EU investigation over their diplomatic outreach to Russia.

Independent Cypriot MEP Fidias Panayiotou visited the Russian capital with other lawmakers during Victory Day celebrations, where he met with the chairman of the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin.

In a video posted to X on Monday, Panayiotou said his trip “was not liked at all in the European Parliament, and they have already started an investigation against us.”

Panayiotou has openly criticized the EU's combative stance on Russia and the Ukraine conflict. He argues that Brussels should prioritize diplomacy over supplying weapons to Kiev.

During last Saturday's meeting, Volodin lauded international dialogue that allows officials “understand each other and come up with decisions important for their peoples and states,” according to the State Duma's website.

Other guests at the Russian parliament reportedly came from Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Serbia.

The Moscow visit coincided with Russia's Victory Day commemorations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. The event drew 28 foreign leaders, including Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic – both of whom ignored threats from Brussels should they go.

“I consider today's trip to Moscow to be extremely successful,” Fico said, noting he held talks with senior officials from Brazil, China, and other countries on the sidelines of the event.

Vucic, speaking from Moscow's Red Square, said he was proud to represent Serbia – an EU candidate – at the ceremony, even though he expected to face personal consequences from the EU for his attendance.

Russian President Vladimir Putin praised visiting foreign leaders who attended Victory Day celebrations, calling them “leaders not through their office, but through strength of character, convictions, and readiness to defend those convictions.”

Isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to help resolve the Ukraine conflict, senior US negotiator Steve Witkoff has said, calling the approach lacking in logic.

Western nations have attempted to marginalize Moscow diplomatically since the escalation of the conflict in 2022, but Witkoff, speaking to Breitbart News last week, criticized that approach. He emphasized the necessity of including all major players in the dialogue.

”We need to talk to any stakeholders in this conflict,” Witkoff said in the section of the interview published Monday. “There is no deal without President Putin's sign-off.” US President Donald Trump's special envoy added that he found it difficult to “understand the logic” of those who oppose direct engagement with the Russian leader.

The Trump administration's current stance is that Russian and Ukrainian officials must be brought together physically so that the US can “show them that the alternatives to a peaceful resolution here are bad for everybody.”

The Trump administration's current stance is that Russian and Ukrainian officials must be brought together physically so that the United States can “show them that the alternatives to a peaceful resolution here are bad for everybody.”

Putin last week reiterated Moscow's call to resume negotiations that Kiev abandoned in 2022, proposing that talks be held again in Istanbul. Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky and several European NATO members have insisted that Russia first agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, warning that failure to do so will result in further sanctions. Russian officials say such a pause would give Kiev an opportunity to regroup militarily and renew hostilities.

Putin has offered to restart negotiations as early as Thursday. Zelensky has said he will go to Istanbul that day and expects Putin to come too.

Witkoff emphasized that the US could step back from its mediating role if progress is not made. “The president has issued an ultimatum to both sides” to begin direct talks, he said.

”I think if the US pulls back from this conflict… that's a bad result for everybody,” he added. “It's bad for the Europeans. It's bad for the Ukrainians. I don't think it's good for the Russians. I think the Russians actually do want a peaceful settlement.”

Moscow has urged a comprehensive agreement that addresses what it sees as the root causes of the conflict, including a promise by NATO to eventually admit Ukraine and discriminatory policies by Kiev toward ethnic Russians.

Harvard University will not compromise its “core, legally protected principles,” despite a looming grant suspension by the US Department of Education, university president, Alan Garber, has said. Garber cited a “strategy to combat anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry” in a letter published on Monday.

In a letter posted on X last week Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon accused the university of “serious failures” in anti-Semitism, racial discrimination, academic rigor, and viewpoint diversity. “Harvard University has made a mockery of this country's higher education system,” the secretary wrote, saying that it “should no longer seek” federal funding “since none will be provided.”

US President Donald Trump's administration is reviewing nearly $9 billion in federal funding for Harvard amid intensive pro-Palestinian protests on campus. Last month, the White House called for changes to governance, hiring and admissions and the elimination of all DEI programs at Harvard in a letter it later claimed was “unauthorized.”

The elite Ivy League university rejected the demands, accusing the White House of attempting to “control” its campus. The university filed a lawsuit over the suspension of approximately $2.3 billion in funding and reaffirmed its commitment to addressing discrimination internally.

In Monday's letter, Garber said Harvard's reform efforts were being “undermined and threatened by the federal government's overreach into the constitutional freedoms of private universities and its continuing disregard of Harvard's compliance with the law.” He added that the university was pursuing necessary reforms in line with its values and legal obligations.

“But Harvard will not surrender its core, legally-protected principles out of fear of unfounded retaliation by the federal government,” Garber wrote.

Garber also rejected claims of partisanship, adding that he had seen no evidence suggesting international students are “more prone to disruption, violence, or other misconduct” than their peers.

BELGRADE, May 13. /TASS/. Serbian leader Aleksandar Vucic has rejected European Council President Antonio Costa's call to condemn Russia, citing a duty to do the right thing for his country, not the EC.

""I am not obliged to obey anyone. My duty is to serve the people of Serbia. This is what I will always do. I always speak my mind. I announced plans to visit Moscow, and I never lied. Naturally, we celebrated the 80th anniversary of the Victory over Nazism. We also discussed the gas contract. Serbia continues to pursue a European path but sometimes, its president can rebel. However, even amid this rebelliousness, I have never put Serbia's European path into question,"" the Serbian leader pointed out following a meeting with Costa.

During the meeting, the European Council chief urged Belgrade to work together with the European Union ""to overcome its history"" and fully back the EU's foreign policy, condemning Russia and supporting Ukraine, as well as normalizing relations with Kosovo, steps which he said were necessary for Serbia's ongoing EU accession process.

Earlier, Russian Ambassador to Belgrade Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko stated that the European Union's threats against Belgrade over Vucic's visit to Moscow to attend the Victory Day parade were an affront to the country's sovereignty. The Serbian leader, in turn, has repeatedly stressed that his visit to Moscow and talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin would in no way harm Belgrade, while as for himself, he was ready to take any ""punishment"" from the European Union. Vucic also noted that he knew EU officials would not be happy with him but that he was determined to stand up for himself and answer any potential grievances.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BEIJING, May 13. /TASS/. The proposals of Brazil and China on the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict will lay the foundation for a comprehensive dialogue between the parties and the restoration of peace in Europe, Brazil's head of state Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said at a joint press address following his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.

""The common agreements between Brazil and China, aimed at a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine, provide the basis for a comprehensive dialogue that will bring peace back to Europe,"" the Brazilian leader stated.

Lula da Silva reiterated his call for a reform of the United Nations, emphasizing that the current format of the UN Security Council does not allow it to address the planet's major challenges. ""The Security Council must reflect the diversity that has emerged in today's realities,"" he emphasized.

On May 12, CNN Brasil quoted the Brazilian president's foreign policy advisor, Celso Amorim, as saying that Lula da Silva offered to mediate talks on Ukraine with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on May 9. Amorim added that the position of the Brazilian government was close to that of the administration of US President Donald Trump, which is to facilitate the earliest possible start of the negotiation process.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, May 13. /TASS/. The silence of the German government following the release of the video showing German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer traveling on a train is indicative, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Solovyov Live TV channel.

""The most indicative in this situation, of course, is the silence of Berlin, which apparently decided to take no risks and just hide in a tank or in a bunker, as they like to do,"" the diplomat said.

Zakharova added that the Elysee Palace immediately labeled the news as fake, but did not ask the Kiev regime to stop spreading false information.

Earlier, a video surfaced in the media featuring the French president, German chancellor, and British prime minister aboard a train en route to Kiev. In the footage, the French leader, upon realizing that journalists had begun filming the meeting, hastily removed a small white roll from the table.

On Monday evening the airport had far fewer than the 14 controllers agreed on between the union and regulators

New Jersey's Newark Liberty airport, one of three major airports serving New York City, had just three air traffic controllers on duty on Monday, which was well short of the 14 called for and forced air regulators to delay arriving flights for up to seven hours.

The air traffic controller shortfall, first reported by the New York Times, comes amid a growing number of problems for the hub. In a little more than a week, Newark has suffered three communications blackouts, rendering the control tower unable to track or communicate with planes for up to 90 seconds.

The most recent failure, on Sunday morning, came as government and airline officials have made multiple efforts to reassure airline passengers that flying into or out of the airport is safe.

But on Monday evening, during the 3pm to 10pm shift, the group that manages Newark air traffic from Philadelphia was operating with one or two fully certified controllers, the outlet reported – far fewer than the 14 controllers agreed on between the controllers union and air traffic control regulators.

The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, on Monday said a new software update had prevented the previous day's issues from multiplying after aviation officials issued a 45-minute ground stop.

In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it “briefly slowed aircraft in and out of the airport while we ensured redundancies were working as designed.

“Operations have returned to normal.''

That came after Duffy announced plans to reduce the number of flights arriving and departing from Newark for the “next several weeks” and would meet with the airport's major carriers to discuss the issues. Flight reductions, he said, would target the hours when international flights arrive.

Duffy said he wanted to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61, to help offset a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers. After the first Newark failure, on 28 April, the union representing air traffic controllers said several members were placed on trauma leave.

“While we cannot quickly replace them due to this highly specialized profession, we continue to train controllers who will eventually be assigned to this busy airspace,” the FAA said earlier in May.

The problems at Newark appear to be related to copper wiring at Philadelphia Tracon Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark airspace. Tracon is an acronym for Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility.

The FAA has installed new fiber optic lines at Newark airport and New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia airports to replace copper wires. But the plan is to spend the next two weeks testing those new lines out before switching over to them.

Duffy recently laid out an extensive plan to replace the nation's outdated air traffic control system, including installing 4,600 new high-speed data connections and replacing 618 radars.

He has sought to blame the issues on the failures during the Biden administration that oversaw a move of air traffic control for the airspace control from Long Island to Philadelphia that he said was “bungled”.

A spokesperson for Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary during Joe Biden's presidency, said Duffy “needs to spend more time doing what the American people are paying him to do – fix problems – and less time blaming others.”

But the issues are creating anxiety for travelers. Hundreds of flights were delayed on Sunday at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson because of a runway equipment issue. In late January in Washington DC, an American Airlines jet from Wichita collided with a military helicopter, killing 67. The fatal crash has been blamed on the helicopter pilot's failure to heed air traffic controllers' instructions.

Despite Newark's problems, both technical and in terms of the numbers of air traffic controllers available, officials are trying to quell rising airline customer concerns.

“It's problematic, but our commitment is always safety,” Duffy said on Monday. “We're going to make sure that if you fly, you're going to fly safely. And if we reduce the number of flights at Newark, we're not doing it to annoy people. We're not doing it to delay people's travel. What we're doing is guaranteeing safety.”

Separately, Newark's mayor, Ras Baraka, told MSNBC on Sunday that the inconvenience of flight delays and cancellations was offset by an emphasis on safety.

“I would be concerned if they weren't delaying and canceling flights, given the amount of disruption that we're seeing,” Baraka said. He added he was glad that the Trump administration had “moved away” from claiming diversity initiatives were to blame for the problems and “understanding the structural problems that exist there, the fact that we need more air traffic controllers”.

“There's too many planes in our airspace, frankly,” Baraka added. “We need to put a gap between the time planes are leaving and coming in to the airport. We need to fly fewer planes until we get this thing under control. The fact that there are delays and cancellations is because they're doing this day by day.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Olympic wrestling champion Kyle Snyder was one of more than a dozen people arrested as part of a prostitution sting in Ohio.

Police in Columbus conducted an operation aimed at reducing prostitution in the city on Friday, and the 29-year-old Snyder was arrested in a hotel room for engaging in prostitution. He was released from custody at the scene.

Columbus police spokesperson Caitlyn McIntosh said officers had posted online ads last week to “solicit others to engage in sexual activity for hire”. Police said a man later identified as Snyder had replied to one of the postings and arranged to meet at a local hotel. Once there he paid money to an undercover officer and requested sexual services. Police said 15 other men were caught in the sting. Snyder is scheduled to appear in court on 19 May.

Snyder is considered one of the best wrestlers of his generation, and was a college star at Ohio State, located in Columbus. While still at college he won an Olympic gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics. In college, he won three straight NCAA heavyweight titles between 2016 and 2018, and was later inducted into Ohio State's athletics hall of fame. He also won an Olympic silver at the Tokyo Games in 2021 along with three world championship titles.

In 2018, Donald Trump appointed Snyder to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. This month Snyder signed up to Hulk Hogan's Real American Freestyle wrestling league, which is due to start in August.

Snyder, Ohio State and the Real American Freestyle wrestling league have yet to comment publicly on his arrest.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Some of president's most devoted supporters speak out against accepting $400m luxury jet as new Air Force One

Donald Trump is all too comfortable brushing aside criticism from Democrats and the “fake news media”, but when the flak over his decision to accept a $400m luxury jet from the Qatari government comes from his most devoted supporters it might behoove the US president to listen.

Stars of Trump's Make America great again (Maga) firmament are speaking out in unambiguous terms against the plan for him to be donated a jet described as a “palace in the sky” and convert it into Air Force One. They are damning the idea in Trump's own language – telling him this is not “draining the swamp” as he promised to do during his first presidency, and nor does it conform to the theme of his second Oval Office term: “America First.”

Ben Shapiro, the prominent rightwing commentator, led the charge on his daily podcast. “President Trump promised to drain the swamp – this is not, in fact, draining the swamp,” he said.

Linking Qatar to the militant Palestinian group Hamas and Al Jazeera, the media network that is widely detested on the right and is partly funded by the Qatari government, he added: “Taking sacks of goodies from people who support Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood, Al Jazeera, all the rest, that's not America First … If you want President Trump to succeed this kind of skeezy stuff would be stopped.”

The planned gift of the 13-year-old, Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, which Trump would inherit personally after he leaves the White House, has achieved the seemingly impossible: it has united the president's most fervent fans with his most ardent opponents. Laura Loomer, the far-right Maga activist, warned that the proposed gift would put “such a stain on the administration”.

Loomer said she loved Trump and would “take a bullet for him. But I have to call a spade a spade. We cannot accept a $400m ‘gift' from jihadists in suits.”

The conservative New York Post, meanwhile, published an editorial headlined: “Qatar's ‘Palace in the Sky' jet is NOT a ‘free gift' – and Trump shouldn't accept it as one.”

Rightwing pundits on social media have proceeded to dredge up uncomfortable material for Trump with an enthusiasm which they normally reserve for progressive Democrats. A clip of Trump talking on the White House lawn from 2017 in which he accused Qatar of historically being “a funder of terrorism at a very high level” circulated widely.

The maelstrom comes as Trump begins a four-day tour of wealthy Gulf states, arriving in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. His aim is to seal a number of lucrative investments and arms deals in the region, but the visit is in danger of being overshadowed by the plane controversy.

Republicans in the US Senate have also begun to pipe up, speaking ominously about interrogating the gift under the emoluments clause of the US constitution. That clause prevents federal officials, including the president, from accepting high-value gifts and payments from foreign governments without the say-so of Congress.

Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, told Fox News that in his opinion “it's not worth the appearance of impropriety”.

Former vice president Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) yesterday said that he has not yet received any official assignment from the government to attend the inauguration Mass of Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican on Sunday.

Chen said that he is scheduled to attend health-related events in Geneva, Switzerland, and at the Vatican during his upcoming trip to Europe.

“My trip to Europe this time is to speak at a forum on universal healthcare coverage organized by the World Taiwan Foundation in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday next week, when the World Health Assembly is having its annual conference,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a new conference in Taipei organized by the foundation.

“That would be followed by a trip to the Vatican, where I am scheduled to deliver a speech at a cancer research forum hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which I will preside over from Thursday to Friday next week,” Chen added.

The relationship between Taiwan and the Vatican is solid, and the two share common values: freedom, democracy, rule of law, human rights and humanitarianism, Chen said, adding that both would strive to facilitate world peace and global prosperity.

Pope Leo XIV would make a good pope, Chen said, citing the emphasis he placed on religious freedom and freedom of speech during the first Mass he held on Monday.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the pope is scheduled to meet with Taiwan's ambassador to the Vatican on Friday, adding that the Presidential Office would decide who would represent Taiwan at the inauguration Mass.

As for his upcoming speech on universal healthcare, Chen said he would share Taiwan's experience in implementing the National Health Insurance system, adding that it is a microcosm of the broader need for universal healthcare.

The government would provide full scholarships for international students to further their studies for two years in Taiwan, so those who want to pursue a master's degree can consider applying for the program, he said.
The fields included are science, technology, engineering, mathematics, semiconductors and finance, Yeh added.
The program, called “Intense 2+2,” would also assist international students who completed the two years of further studies in

Tsai arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport on Friday night, but did not speak to reporters before departing.
Tsai wrote on social media later that the purpose of the trip was to reaffirm the commitment of Taiwanese to working with democratic allies to promote regional security and stability, upholding freedom and democracy, and defending their homeland.
She also expressed hope that through joint efforts, Taiwan and Europe would continue to be partners building up economic resilience on the global stage.

The torchbearers at the World Masters Games' opening ceremony in Taiwan on Saturday would include baseball legend Peng Cheng-min, centenarian shuttler Lin Yu-mao and Olympic boxing gold medalist Lin Yu-ting. 

The three announced on Monday by the event's sporting committee were among the five torchbearers set to appear at the ceremony, with the other two to be announced “in due course.” 

The torchbearers would play a key role in conveying the event's motto, which is “sports beyond age and life without limits,” the Games' organizing committee said in a news release.

The three people named were chosen to carry the torch, because they each embodied one of the following values — sports, youth, technology, culture and inclusion, the committee said. 

Symbolizing “sports,” Peng is a former star player for the CTBC Brothers in Taiwan's professional baseball league. 

Known for his consistency at the plate and strong leadership, he was beloved by fans and played for Taiwan in numerous international competitions, the committee said. 

Lin Yu-ting, who won gold in the 57kg division of women's boxing at the Paris Olympics last year, symbolizes “youth.” 

Meanwhile, Lin Yu-mao is a great representation of “inclusion,” the committee said. 

It said the 104-year-old athlete, the Guinness World Records-certified oldest badminton player, was interested in other sports when he was younger, including track and field, and volleyball. 

He turned to playing badminton at the age of 50, it said. 

Lin Yu-mao was quoted in the news release as saying that he especially enjoys the thrill of smashing the shuttlecock and getting applause from the crowd. 

The World Masters Games in Taipei and New Taipei City is being held from Saturday to May 31.

The hosts remain top with 78 points, holding a slim lead over Inter, who won 2-0 at Torino earlier on Sunday, with two rounds remaining.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) yesterday thanked Japan, the US and like-minded countries for their continued support of Taiwan's international participation, and called on the WHO Secretariat to stop aligning with China in efforts to block Taiwan's inclusion.

The 78th World Health Assembly (WHA) is set to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, from Monday to May 27. 

However, due to political influence, the WHO has once again declined to invite Taiwan, Department of International Organizations Deputy Director-General Chang Chih-sha (張芝颯) said.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOFA and Taiwan's overseas missions have consistently advocated for Taiwan's participation in the WHO throughout the years, she said.

This year, the ministries are also assembling a “Taiwan WHA Action Team,” led by Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-yuan (邱泰源), to travel to Geneva and host a series of events aimed at promoting Taiwan's positive contributions to global health, she said.

In the past few years, Taiwan has garnered growing support from the international community — which has bolstered the legitimacy of its bid and raised global awareness of its exclusion, she added.

“MOFA thanks Japan, the US and other like-minded countries for taking action to support Taiwan's international participation,” Chang said, citing examples of their support, such as the US-Japan Joint Leaders' Statement in February, the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in March and the US-Japan-South Korea Joint Statement last month.

The governments of the US, Japan and Taiwan's diplomatic allies, along with the legislatures of Sweden, Ireland, Italy and several other countries, have issued resolutions and statements supporting Taiwan's participation in the WHO, she said.

However, the People's Republic of China (PRC) continues to deliberately and systematically misinterpret UN Resolution 2758 in international forums to “dwarf” Taiwan and block its right to participate in international organizations, she said.

“MOFA again stresses that nowhere is ‘Taiwan' mentioned in the full text of UN Resolution 2758, and it neither determines that Taiwan is a part of the PRC, nor gives the PRC permission to represent Taiwan in the UN,” she added. 

“Only the democratically elected government of Taiwan has the right to represent the 23.5 million Taiwanese,” Chang said. “The authoritarian government in Beijing does not have the right to interfere with or limit Taiwan's right to participate in international organizations.”

The foreign ministry expressed its appreciation to the US for strongly condemning China's attempts to isolate Taiwan during a UN Security Council meeting on April 23. 

At the meeting, the US underlined China's misuse of UN Resolution 2758 to misrepresent other countries' policies and restrict their diplomatic choices, Chang said.

“MOFA urges the WHO Secretariat to stop ‘bandwagoning' with China in excluding Taiwan from the WHO,” she said.

With this year's WHA theme being “One World for Health,” which emphasizes the universal right to health, Taiwan hopes the WHO Secretariat would prioritize global health and welfare, she said, adding that the nation is capable and willing to contribute to the world and help the WHO achieve its goals.



                                                                                The Ministry of Education (MOE) is to launch a new program to encourage international students to stay in Taiwan and explore job opportunities here after graduation, Deputy Minister of Education Yeh Ping-cheng (葉丙成) said on Friday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average of the New York Stock Exchange surged 1,160 points Monday, recovering to the level just before U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement that tariffs would be imposed.

An optimistic view that U.S.-China trade friction would ease clearly pushed stocks up. Washington and Beijing reached a deal in Geneva on Monday for a 90-day pause and for reciprocal tariffs to be reduced by 115 percentage points.

On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 42,410.10 points, up 1,160.72 points from Friday's finish. A joint statement on the U.S.-China meeting on tariff measures was well received, easing concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy. The index recovered to the level of the closing price on April 2 at 42,225.32 points, just before the U.S. government's announcement of reciprocal tariffs on imports.

Shares in major U.S. online retailer Amazon.com Inc., which handles many imports from China, rose 8%. Apple Inc. also increased 6%. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 18,708.34, up 779.42 points.

Major European stock markets also closed higher on Monday. Germany's DAX rose 0.29% from Friday's close, setting a new record closing high. In Paris, the CAC 40 increased 1.37%, while Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.59%. The markets saw buy orders swell for firms related to semiconductor, logistics and luxury brands that are expected to benefit from tariff reductions.

In the Tokyo market, buy orders increased from Tuesday morning. The Nikkei average of 225 selected stocks listed on the Prime section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose more than 800 points at one point, recovering to the 38,000 level for the first time in about a month and a half during trading hours. The Nikkei 225 closed up 539 points at 38,183.26.

The yen weakened temporarily to the 148 level against the dollar on the Tokyo foreign exchange market, leading to notable gains in automobile and other export-related stocks.

Market observers generally felt that U.S.-China tariff talks had made progress beyond their expectations. However, an analyst at a major securities firm said there was a sense of overheating in stock markets, stressing the importance of continually monitoring how U.S.-China negotiations develop.

""Our people are going to be going there,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said.



German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that further concessions from Ukraine during negotiations would be unreasonable if Russia continues to attack civilian targets.

U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, will travel to Istanbul for possible peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, Reuters reported on May 13, citing three undisclosed sources.



President Volodymyr Zelensky said he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, but said both leaders are ready to fly to Istanbul if Russian President Vladimir Putin chooses to attend the talks there.

Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a major industrial and logistical hub, remains untouched by ground incursions but is under growing threat.

Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said Ukraine is ""ready to discuss anything,"" but ""only if a ceasefire is achieved.""

A captive named Umit allegedly agreed to serve in the Russian army in exchange for Russian citizenship and a monetary reward of 2 million rubles ($25,000).

Russia's Buryatia Republic declared a state of emergency on May 13 over massive forest fires that have engulfed multiple regions in the Russian Far East.



Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko's statement came as Strong Shield 5 exercises involving military personnel from other NATO countries began in Lithuania. 

""Amendments to the Budget Code are needed to implement the provisions on funding the U.S.-Ukrainian Reconstruction Investment Fund,"" lawmaker Roksolana Pidlasa said.

Russia will announce its representative for the expected talks in Istanbul once Putin ""deems it necessary,"" the Kremlin said.

During reconnaissance in an unspecified front-line sector, Special Operations Forces' operators detected Buk-M3 and Uragan-1 on combat duty, the unit said.

Russia launched an overnight drone attack across Ukraine early on May 11, injuring one person in Kyiv Oblast and damaging civilian infrastructure in several regions, according to Ukrainian officials.

The assault began around 2 a.m. on May 11, with Russian forces deploying 108 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy UAVs from multiple directions, Ukraine's Air Force said.

Ukrainian air defense systems, including aviation units, missile forces, electronic warfare units, and mobile fire teams, intercepted 60 Shahed drones across the eastern, northern, southern, and central regions of the country. Another 41 decoy drones were lost from radar but did not cause damage.

In Kyiv Oblast, a 70-year-old man in Brovary District suffered an acute stress reaction during the attack and is receiving medical care, according to regional authorities. A summer house was damaged in the strike, and five private homes were hit in the Obukhiv District, which lies south of the capital, Kyiv. No critical infrastructure was affected.

In Sumy Oblast, Russian forces carried out more than 100 strikes on 31 settlements across 14 communities over the past day. The attacks included nearly 10 guided aerial bombs, 30 FPV drone assaults, approximately 30 grenade drops from drones, and over 70 multiple-launch rocket system explosions, regional officials reported. Additionally, Russian helicopters launched 10 rockets.

While there were no fatalities or injuries reported in Sumy, several civilian structures were damaged or destroyed, including non-residential buildings and private homes.

The attack comes as Russia invited Ukraine to engage in direct talks in Istanbul beginning May 15. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected a ceasefire proposal, saying, ""Russia is ready for negotiations without any preconditions."" 

Putin unilaterally declared a temporary ceasefire in honor of Victory Day — which Russia observes on May 9 — from midnight May 8 until midnight on May 11. Despite the three-day truce, Russian attacks against Ukrainian civilians and combat operations on the front line continued.

President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders on May 10 demanded that Russia agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting on May 12. The proposal is backed by U.S. President Donald Trump. If Russia refuses the proposal, Europe and the U.S. are threatening to respond with increased sanctions.

Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier that Russia needs to ""think about"" the ceasefire proposal and is ""resistant to any kinds of pressure.""

With just two days to go before Russian-proposed peace talks might begin in Istanbul, the Kremlin is still refusing to confirm whether or not President Vladimir Putin will attend the event.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has already said he will meet Putin there, a move that puts the ball very much into the Kremlin's court.

Upping the pressure further, U.S. President Donald Trump said on May 12 that he believes that ""both leaders"" will be there, thrusting Putin into a delicate diplomatic dilemma — how to avoid caving into Zelensky's proposal without upsetting Trump.

""We're quite hesitant about whether or not Putin will arrive in Turkey,"" Yelyzaveta Yasko, a lawmaker from Zelensky's Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent.

""I wonder if he would send someone else or make up an excuse not to be there — it's very hard to say at this point what will happen.""

Russia has consistently demonstrated it has no interest in a full, 30-day ceasefire and has repeatedly refused to agree to U.S., European, and Ukrainian proposals to implement one.

Instead, it has unilaterally announced short-term ceasefires that Ukraine says have all been violated by Moscow.

Putin's proposal to hold direct talks with Ukraine in Turkey came after the latest push for a full, 30-day ceasefire, backed by Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S.

The Kremlin has not responded well, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying that ""ultimatum language"" in talks with Russia is ""unacceptable.""

""It's not appropriate. You cannot talk to Russia in this language,"" Peskov told a pool of Russian journalists on May 12.

The consensus among experts and Ukrainian lawmakers who spoke with the Kyiv Independent is that Russia's counterproposal for talks in Istanbul, and its faux outrage, are simply delaying tactics to avoid doing the one thing Putin doesn't want to do — stop the war and give up his maximalist demands.


""It's an attempt to damage Ukraine's reputation as a responsible international partner and paint us as unwilling to negotiate.""
    

""In my view, Russia's proposal to hold talks in Turkey serves two main objectives,"" Halyna Yanchenko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent.

""First, it's an attempt to damage Ukraine's reputation as a responsible international partner and paint us as unwilling to negotiate — Moscow clearly hoped we would reject the offer outright.

""Second, it's a push to revive the so-called 'Istanbul agreements' from 2022 which effectively demanded Ukraine's capitulation. What Russia is trying to do now is normalize those old ultimatums and use them as a starting point for new talks.""

Moscow and Kyiv held unsuccessful talks in Belarus and Turkey in the early months of the full-scale war, with no direct negotiations having taken place ever since.

Leaked copies of Russia's demands at this time show Moscow was demanding Ukraine reduce its army to 50,000 people, five times less than the country had before the all-out war, as well as reduce the number of ships, helicopters, and tanks.

Russia also planned to ban Ukraine from developing ""any other types of weapons as a result of scientific research, and not to produce, acquire or deploy in Ukraine missile weapons ""of any type with a range of more than 250 km.""

As well as leaving Ukraine defenseless, Russia now insists that, as a condition for peace negotiations, Ukrainian troops must leave the country's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, recognize Russia's annexation of the regions, and abandon any ambition to join NATO.

What Russia didn't appear to anticipate was Zelensky immediately agreeing to talks and insisting that Putin meet him there.

Ukraine has made very clear that Zelensky will be in Istanbul on May 15, and that he will only talk to Putin, with presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak explaining that talks with lower-level representatives would be pointless.

""Only Putin can make a decision to continue the war or stop the war,"" Podolyak said on May 15.

The Kremlin has yet to say whether or not Putin will attend in person, and to do so would not be in the Russian president's interests.

Putin does not see himself as Zelensky's equal, and has repeatedly mocked him and called him ""illegitimate,"" so to appear on the same level on the global stage would risk him, in Russian eyes, as gifting Zelensky with the legitimacy he has tried so hard to deny.

""I don't think there's a cat in hell's chance of him turning up,"" former U.K. Defense Attache in Moscow, John Foreman, told the Kyiv Independent.

""He doesn't regard Zelensky as legitimate, and any talks would be technical. He'll send a functionary,"" he added.

This view is shared by Jenny Mathers, a Russian political expert and lecturer at the U.K.'s Aberystwyth University, who told the Kyiv Independent that Putin is ""very good at finding excuses"" and will likely try to engineer one that allows him to save face whilst also keeping Trump on side.

""It seems unlikely that he would grant Zelensky the status of meeting him personally, president to president, after years of claiming that the post-EuroMaidan political order is illegitimate and indeed full of Nazis,"" she said.

""He could easily engineer another pressing engagement, or give no excuse at all but send a negotiating team,"" she added.

One possible excuse on hand is a decree approved by Zelensky in the fall of 2022, that ""stated the impossibility of holding negotiations with Russian President Putin,"" as a response to Russia's illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, parts of which it didn't even control.


""Putin is not ready to stop the military campaign already planned for this summer and autumn.""
    

Moscow has previously cited Zelensky's decree as a ban on talks with Putin and used it as an excuse for avoiding direct talks with Kyiv.

But according to a source in the President's Office, the decree was a ""a signal to those in Ukraine who wanted to speak (to Russians) bypassing the central government.""

They added that it had been ""twisted"" by the Kremlin and it was in fact solely up to Zelensky to determine if he could speak directly with Putin.

Among Ukrainian lawmakers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, it's clear that Putin is simply stalling for time in order to prolong the war.

""Putin is not ready to stop the military campaign already planned for this summer and autumn,"" Volodymyr Ariev, Ukrainian lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity party, said.

""He will not change his mind,"" he added.

As Russia continues to reject a full ceasefire, there are plenty of signs that its military and offensive operations are still in full swing.

Even as the U.S.-led peace talks have been in progress since February, Russia has been amassing troops across the border from Ukraine's Sumy Oblast, Zelensky has said.

And on the front lines in the east, Russia this week reportedly bolstered troops trying to take the city of Chasiv Yar with the elite FSB Presidential Regiment.

Meanwhile, devastating missile and drone attacks against Ukrainian civilians have only escalated during Trump's term in office, and there is no indication they will relent.

Over the weekend, after a warning from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv of a ""significant attack in the coming days, it was reported that Russia could be closing the airspace over the site from which it launches its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile.

Russia regularly uses close, and short-range ballistic missiles in aerial attacks against Ukraine, but intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are far larger, can be equipped with nuclear payloads, and are designed to hit targets at far longer ranges.

""Putin does not want any peace talks, because his goal is to seize Ukraine,"" Ariev said.

""Our people are going to be going there,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said.



German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that further concessions from Ukraine during negotiations would be unreasonable if Russia continues to attack civilian targets.

U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, will travel to Istanbul for possible peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, Reuters reported on May 13, citing three undisclosed sources.



President Volodymyr Zelensky said he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, but said both leaders are ready to fly to Istanbul if Russian President Vladimir Putin chooses to attend the talks there.

Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a major industrial and logistical hub, remains untouched by ground incursions but is under growing threat.

Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said Ukraine is ""ready to discuss anything,"" but ""only if a ceasefire is achieved.""

A captive named Umit allegedly agreed to serve in the Russian army in exchange for Russian citizenship and a monetary reward of 2 million rubles ($25,000).

Russia's Buryatia Republic declared a state of emergency on May 13 over massive forest fires that have engulfed multiple regions in the Russian Far East.



Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko's statement came as Strong Shield 5 exercises involving military personnel from other NATO countries began in Lithuania. 

""Amendments to the Budget Code are needed to implement the provisions on funding the U.S.-Ukrainian Reconstruction Investment Fund,"" lawmaker Roksolana Pidlasa said.

Russia will announce its representative for the expected talks in Istanbul once Putin ""deems it necessary,"" the Kremlin said.

During reconnaissance in an unspecified front-line sector, Special Operations Forces' operators detected Buk-M3 and Uragan-1 on combat duty, the unit said.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated

Three were injured in Russia's Kursk Oblast when the town of Rylsk was allegedly struck by a missile attack on May 11, local governor Alexander Khinshtein claimed.

Ukraine regularly strikes military targets within Russia as Moscow continues to wage its war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged on April 30 that Ukrainian soldiers remain in Kursk Oblast.

""According to preliminary information, three people were injured. All were taken to the Rylsk Central Regional Hospital,"" Khinshtein said.

A hotel entrance was damaged as a result of the impact from a missile, the local governor claimed.

""The blast wave also damaged two cars and two private homes: windows were knocked out, the roof and garage were damaged. Three more cars were cut by shrapnel,"" Khinshtein said.

Ukraine has not officially commented on the reported strikes, and the Kyiv Independent could not independently verify claims made by Russian officials.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will travel to Istanbul for peace talks on May 15 in response to Putin rejecting a ceasefire proposal and instead suggesting peace talks between Ukraine and Russia should continue.

Ukraine has insisted on a full 30-day unconditional ceasefire before peace talks begin.

""We expect a ceasefire from tomorrow — this proposal is on the table. A complete and unconditional ceasefire — long-term, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy — could bring peace much closer,"" Zelensky said.

Prime Minister Mark Carney added fresh faces to the Liberal cabinet Tuesday with a post-election shuffle that also kept veteran ministers in key economic portfolios like finance, Canada-U.S. relations, internal trade and foreign affairs.

François-Philippe Champagne retains the Finance portfolio and takes on the additional role of Revenue Minister, a portfolio that had its own minister under former prime minister Justin Trudeau.

The three senior ministers who joined Mr. Carney on his recent trip to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House - Melanie Joly, Dominic LeBlanc and David McGuinty - also remain in cabinet, but with adjusted roles.

Ms. Joly moves from Foreign Affairs to Industry, Mr. LeBlanc's responsibilities shift from trade and intergovernmental affairs to President of the King's Privy Council and Minister responsible for Canada-U.S. Trade, Intergovernmental Affairs and One Canadian Economy.

Mr. McGuinty moves from Public Safety to National Defence, replacing Bill Blair, who was dropped from cabinet.

Oakville MP Anita Anand will replace Ms. Joly as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Former Justice Minister Gary Anandasangaree moves over to Mr. McGuinty's former position as Minister of Public Safety.

High-profile rookie MP Tim Hodgson was added to cabinet with an economic portfolio. He was named Minister of Energy and Natural Resources. The Markham-Thornhill MP is a former head of Goldman Sachs's Canadian operations and a former board chair of Hydro One. He also worked as an adviser to Mr. Carney at the Bank of Canada. 

The new cabinet comprises a core group of 28 ministers and 10 secretaries of state.

The latter will not manage federal departments or attend all cabinet meetings. Instead, they have been assigned specific policy priorities, such as defence procurement, seniors and combatting crime.

Mr. Carney said in a statement Tuesday that the new cabinet is built to deliver change.

“Everyone is expected and empowered to show leadership – to bring new ideas, a clear focus, and decisive action to their work,” he said.

The Prime Minister is scheduled to speak with journalists Tuesday afternoon.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is also planning to hold a news conference Tuesday. 

Former Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson joins the cabinet as Minister of Housing.

In Quebec, new MP Mandy Gull-Masty, the former grand chief of the Grand Council of the Crees, takes on the role of Minister of Indigenous Services. 

She replaces Patty Hajdu, who becomes Minister of Jobs and Families.

Ms. Gull-Masty will be assisted on the Indigenous file by another rookie MP, Rebecca Alty, who is now the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations. 

Ms. Alty represents the Northwest Territories and is a former mayor of Yellowknife. 

Two new cabinet job titles suggest a focus on modernizing the federal public service. 

Quebec MP Joël Lightbound, first elected in 2015, joins cabinet as Minister of Government Transformation, Public Works and Procurement, while former television journalist Evan Solomon joins cabinet as Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation. 

Marjorie Michel, who replaced Mr. Trudeau as the Liberal candidate in the Montreal riding of Papineau, was named Health Minister. She is a former deputy chief of staff in the Prime Minister's Office.

Steven Guilbeault, who was Mr. Carney's Quebec adviser during the federal election campaign, remains as Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture. He is also responsible for official languages. 

Mr. Carney filled the lack of cabinet representation from Alberta and Saskatchewan by naming new Edmonton MP Eleonor Olszewski as Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister for Prairies Economic Development Canada.

The lone Liberal MP elected in Saskatchewan, Buckley Belanger, is Secretary of State for Rural Development.

In Atlantic Canada, Nova Scotia MP Sean Fraser returns to cabinet as Justice Minister after initially planning not to seek re-election. Newfoundland and Labrador MP Joanne Thompson remains as Fisheries Minister. 

Some of the other former ministers who have been dropped from cabinet include Rachel Bendayan, Kody Blois, Terry Duguid, Ali Ehsassi, Ginette Petitpas Taylor, Jonathan Wilkinson, Élisabeth Brière and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith.

In his first remarks after the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the Prime Minister promised strong retaliation for future attacks. Meanwhile, military officials held talks regarding the ceasefire.

This blog is now closed. Thank you for following along.

Below is a roundup of developments from India and Pakistan on Monday, May 12:

The Board of Control for Cricket in India said the Indian Premier League will resume on Saturday.

""After extensive consultations with government and security agencies, and with all the key stakeholders, the Board has decided to proceed with the remainder of the season,"" it said in a statement. 

A total of 17 matches will be held across six venues, which will be announced later. 

The IPL is the sport's richest tournament.

It was suspended last week as fighting escalated between India and Pakistan. 

Pakistani Ambassador to Germany Saqlain Syedah told DW the international community must address the issue of Kashmir.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to deliver a strong response to any future ""terrorist attack,"" after a weekend ceasefire with Pakistan halted several days of military conflict between the neighbors.

""If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given,"" Modi said in a televised address to the nation, adding that New Delhi would not tolerate ""nuclear blackmail"" in the event of conflict.

He also said Pakistan must dismantle its ""terrorist infrastructure"" if it wants to be ""saved,"" delivering his first public remarks since last week's deadly military clashes between the two countries.

""I will tell the global community also, if we talk to Pakistan, it will be about terrorism only... it will be about Pakistan-occupied Kashmir,"" Modi said in a televised address, referring to the region administered by Pakistan.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first public comment on the recent military conflict between India and Pakistan, stating that the Indian Army had been given full operational freedom during the clashes.

""We gave a free hand to the Indian Army to bury the terrorists,'"" Modi said.

Modi said more than 100 ""terrorists"" were killed in India's strikes and that the strikes specifically targeted terrorist hideouts and training centres located in Pakistan.

The recent hostilities came in in the wake of the April 22 attack, which saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed by Islamist militants near the mountain town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.

India blamed Pakistan for backing the militants and launched ""Operation Sindoor,"" a series of airstrikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Pakistan denied the accusations and carried out strikes against Indian targets.

Both agreed over the weekend to a ceasefire that seems to be largely holding. 

US President Donald Trump says it was US intervention that helped prevent a nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan, following the ceasefire agreement reached by the two South Asian rivals after a series of clashes.

""We stopped a nuclear conflict. I think it could have been a bad nuclear war, millions of people could have been killed. So I'm very proud of that,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.

Expert teams in India defused unexploded bombs along the border with Pakistan, the AFP news agency is reporting.

The move is to allow displaced Kashmiri villagers to begin returning home following a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed nations.

Tens of thousands had fled their homes on the Indian-administered side of the disputed Himalayan region last week, as intense artillery fire reduced some homes to rubble.

The ceasefire, announced on Saturday, brought an end to four days of missile, drone, and artillery exchanges. The violence has been the worst violence between India and Pakistan since 1999.

Police had issued formal warnings urging the public ""NOT to under any circumstances approach, touch, tamper with, or attempt to move any suspicious object resembling an explosive shell or device.""

Bomb disposal squads were deployed in Uri, near the de facto border, to ensure homes were safe before civilians returned.

""We started at homes where people had reported unexploded ordinance,"" senior police officer Gurinderpal Singh told AFP. He declined to disclose how many teams were involved or their specific locations.

""Every piece of ordinance is unique and needs to be handled very carefully,"" Singh added, noting that villagers were only being allowed to return to ""areas that have been cleared.""

India and Pakistan's military operations chiefs held a phone conversation on Monday evening, CNN-News18 has reported, only two days after the nuclear-armed neighbors agreed to a ceasefire following intense clashes last week.

The two countries had exchanged missile, drone and artillery fire across each other's airspace over four days of conflict.

Earlier the Indian military said both sides' director generals of military operations would speak by telephone, but gave no further information. 

Pakistan's army spokesperson told local media that his country reacted rather mildly to India's army operation against it due to the risk of ""mutual annihilation.""

According to Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the conflict between India and Pakistan ""can lead to the peril of more than 1.6 billion people.""

Chaudhry said that there was ""no space"" for war between New Delhi and Islamabad. 

""If anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving our space for mutual annihilation,"" he said.

The spokesman said that Pakistan's military response had been carried out ""in a very mature manner.""

After the worst escalation between the two countries in the past two decades, a ceasefire has been in place since Saturday.

DW correspondent Shalu Yadav, speaking about 15 miles (24 km) from the Line of Control between India and Pakistan, said it was the first time ""in days that people have woken up to a peaceful morning.""

""Today there is a sigh of relief but there is still a little bit of tension on the ground,"" she added when asked about the mood amongst locals.

However, she cautioned, their safety was far from certain at the moment. Although India and Pakistan have technically had a ceasefire over the region since 2003, it has been broke ""time and time again.""

""It's gonna take a lot of effort on both sides to iron out the details of the [most recent] ceasefire,"" Yadav said.

Yadav was speaking from the town of Rajouri in the Jammu region of Indian-administered Kashmir.



Speaking to the Indian Express daily, Germany's ambassador to New Dehli, Philipp Ackermann, was asked if he saw the violence in Pahalgam as similar to the 2008 terror attacks on Mumbai that killed some 175 people.

""The Pahalgam attack was horrifying for its selective killings. It should be called a terrorist attack and has had an impact on the consciousness,"" Ackermann said.

""You cannot help but feel strongly when you see the families and spouses of those who have been killed. It's heartbreaking to see the young and newly-married lose their husbands,"" he said.

He described the attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir as a ""game changer.""

""Pahalgam is a game changer in many ways and there's an enormous amount of solidarity that has gone out to India.""

He added that he was in Kashmir last year and had noticed how things had changed since 15 years ago when he ""saw tourists everywhere.""

Ackermann stressed that Germany stood with Delhi after this ""attack on the heart of India"" but said that ""both governments know that de-escalation is the question of the hour.""

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a ""high level"" meeting with several ministers and army chiefs.

This comes after Saturday's US-brokered ceasefire came into force, with the night being calm for the first time in days, according to India's army.

India and Pakistan's military operation chiefs are set to meet this evening to discuss the ceasefire.

India and Pakistan's chiefs of military operations are set to discuss the next steps after the US-brokered ceasefire restored calm to the border region between the countries.

After initial reports of ceasefire violations, no explosions were heard in the region overnight.

India's army said this was the first peaceful night along the country's border in recent days.

The Indian army confirmed the talks will take place in the evening local time. 

India's airport authority said the 32 airports in the country's northern and western regions that were out of operation due to the military escalation in Pakistan will now be reopened, with civil aircraft being able to make use of them with immediate effect.

This comes after a similar announcement made by Pakistan on Saturday as the announcement on the US-brokered ceasefire was made.

India and Pakistan have reopened airports that had been shut due to the escalation between the countries after a ceasefire was reached.

Senior military officials from both countries are also set to hold talks regarding the ongoing ceasefire.

On Sunday, India and Pakistan traded accusations of ceasefire violations but reported that hostilities had not intensified.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","UN body finds Russia responsible for downed MH17 flight","https://www.dw.com/en/un-body-finds-russia-responsible-for-downed-mh17-flight/a-72523668","Tue, 13 May 2025 11:22:56 GMT","

Almost 300 people were killed when the Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down over Ukraine in 2014. The UN aviation council has ruled that Russian-backed separatists were to blame.

The United Nations' aviation council on Monday ruled that Russia was responsible for the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight over Ukraine, which killed all of the nearly 300 people on board in 2014.

This number included 196 Dutch citizens and 28 Australian citizens, their governments said in separate statements. 

The case was launched in 2022 by Australia and the Netherlands. 

The Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) said the claims brought were ""well founded in fact and in law."" 

""The Russian Federation failed to uphold its obligations under international air law in the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17,"" the agency said in a statement

The council does not hold any regulatory powers but still sets global aviation standards which are widely followed by its member states. The ICAO said Monday's ruling was the first time in its history that it has weighed in on a dispute between two member states.

""The decision is an important step toward establishing the truth and achieving justice and accountability for all victims of Flight MH17, and their families and loved ones,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said in a statement.

""This decision also sends a clear message to the international community: states cannot violate international law with impunity.""

Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong also welcomed the decision. ""We call upon Russia to finally face up to its responsibility for this horrific act of violence and make reparations for its egregious conduct, as required under international law,"" she said.

The Netherlands and Australia want the ICAO Council to order Russia to enter into talks on possible reparations, Veldkamp said.

Moscow rejected the ICEO's conclusions, calling them ""biased.""

""Russia was not a country that participated in the investigation of the incident,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

""Therefore we do not accept all these biased conclusions.""

Russia has repeatedly denied responsibility for the MH17 flight crash.

Flight MH17 of the Malaysian Airlines departed from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014 before being shot down over eastern Ukraine. This was at a time when fighting raged between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces. 

The plane was hit by a Russian-made BUK surface-to-air missile.

All 298 passengers and crew who were on board were killed. Two-thirds were Dutch, with another 38 Australians and 30 Malaysians.

Eight years after the incident, a Dutch court convicted two Russian men and a Ukrainian man, in absentia, of murder for their role in the attack. Moscow has refused to extradite its citizens, calling the ruling ""scandalous.""

“Correction, May 13, 2025: A previous version of this article stated that Flight MH17 was shot down in 2022. This has now been corrected. We apologize for the error.”

The US President made the announcement in Saudi Arabia, the first stop on his three-nation visit to the Middle East. He also secured a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. DW has more.



US President Donald Trump is traveling to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in his first trip to the Middle East since returning to the White House. 

In Riyadh, his first stop on the trip, he signed an agreement with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that secures billions in investment.

Trump also announced he is lifting sanctions on Syria, and plans to meet the country's interim leader in Riyadh.

Here are the latest developments from the United States and President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East:

US President Donald Trump said he would remove all sanctions against Syria.

""I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,"" Trump said. 

Speaking at an investment forum in Riyadh had served an important function, but it was now time for Syria to move forward.

Trump is expected to meet Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Wednesday.

""The President agreed to say hello to the Syrian President while in Saudi Arabia tomorrow,"" the White House said.

Trump is in the kingdom, the first leg of his three-nation visit to the Middle East.

US President Donald Trump urged Iran to take a ""new and a better path"" as he pushes for a new nuclear deal.

Speaking at the US-Saudi investment conference, he said he wants to avoid conflict with Tehran.

""As I have shown repeatedly, I am willing to end past conflicts and forge new partnerships for a better and more stable world, even if our differences may be very profound,"" Trump said.

""If Iran's leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors, then we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure, drive Iranian oil exports to zero like I did before,"" Trump added.

During a visit by US President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday reaffirmed its promise to invest in the United States in the coming years.

Trump has welcomed a pledge by de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of $600 billion in investment. However, Trump has quipped that the total should be $1 trillion, without providing basis or specifics on the claim.

The White House said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia was set to invest $600 billion in the United States, including a massive arms sales agreement worth nearly $142 billion.

Chip giant Nvidia and Saudi Arabia on Tuesday also announced new partnerships, as the kingdom plans to develop AI and cloud computing infrastructure. 

""We have the biggest business leaders in the world here today and they're going to walk away with a lot of checks,"" Trump told the prince at the Royal Court in Riyadh.

US President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia started with a reception held by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

At Riyadh Airport's grand hall, Trump and his aides had Arabic coffee served by waiters wearing ceremonial gun-belts.

Several business executives were invited to the event, including Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

Musk held a brief talk with Trump and Crown Prince bin Salman at the event.

US President Donald Trump was greeted by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammen bin Salman upon his arrival in Riyadh.

The two leaders will hold talks about Iran's nuclear program, the war in Gaza and oil prices.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the country now has a ""mechanism"" to avoid tensions with China.

Speaking at an investment forum just before US President Donald Trump landed in Riyadh, Bessent said such a mechanism was now in place.

""After this weekend, we have a mechanism to avoid escalation like we had before,"" Bessent said after meeting Chinese officials in Switzerland. 

According to the Treasury Secretary, the US could have a ""big, beautiful rebalancing"" with Beijing.

The White House Correspondents Association said it was a ""disservice to every American"" that Donald Trump's administration barred any wire service news reporters from traveling with the president on Air Force One to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

No reporters from The Associated Press, Bloomberg or Reuters were on the plane as it took off toward the Middle East. Presidents often take questions from journalists during such flights.

According to the group, which represents White House journalists, every US citizen ""deserves to know what their highest elected leader is up to, as quickly as possible.""

While no wire reporters were allowed on the flight, Fox News host Sean Hannity posted on his X account that he had interviewed the US president on board Air Force One as it traveled toward the Middle East.

A group of 59 white South Africans has been welcomed as ""refugees"" by the Trump administration.

Their arrival in the United States comes amid an outcry over the White House's current campaign of immigrant arrests and mass deportations.

On Monday, US President Donald Trump repeated disputed claims, popular with the far right, that white farmers in South Africa are ""being killed"" and even facing ""genocide.""

DW explains why the Trump administration is granting Afrikaners refugee status and South Africa's response.  Take a look. 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has discussed the ""way forward for a ceasefire"" in Ukraine with European foreign ministers.

The State Department said in a statement that the foreign ministers of Germany, Britain, France, Poland and Ukraine were on the call, as well as the EU's foreign policy chief.

It remains unclear if Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey, as proposed by Russia's President Vladimir Putin, are to take place.

Earlier on Monday, Trump offered to join the prospective talks following his trip to the Middle East.

Left-wing influencer and political commentator Hasan Piker has said he was detained for hours by US border officials and interrogated about his political views. 

Piker, a US citizen, said on Monday that he was held at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for over two hours on Sunday as he was returning to the United States from a family trip to France. 

Piker, who has millions of followers on YouTube, Twitch and X, has been outspoken in his criticism of Israel. 

His exchanges with officials were ""cordial"" and the experience wasn't ""that bad,"" Piker stressed in a YouTube video about his experience. 

But an officer asked his views on Trump and whether he has been in contact with militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

""Do you like Hamas? Like, do you support Hamas? Do you think Hamas is a resistance group?"" Hasan said the border official asked.

""The reason for why they're doing that is, I think, to try to create an environment of fear, to try to get people like myself, or at least like others that would be in my shoes that don't have that same level of security, to shut up,"" Piker said. 

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has denied that Piker's political beliefs triggered the more intense screening. 

""Claims that his political beliefs triggered the inspection are baseless. Our officers are following the law, not agendas,"" she said in a statement.

Defending Rights and Dissent, a US organization defending civil liberties, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" that border officials are stopping political commentators to interrogate them.""

""Such an abuse of power is an affront to press freedom,"" it said in a post on X.


The US State Department has authorized two arms deals with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 

The combined deals, which include sales of military aircraft and equipment, are worth around $1.4 billion (€1.3 billion). 

One proposed sale involves six CH-47F Chinook helicopters and other equipment, the State Department Bureau of Political-Military Affairs said in a statement on Monday. 

""The UAE will use these assets in search and rescue, disaster relief, humanitarian support, and counterterrorism operations,"" the statement said.

In addition to the helicopters, the State Department also approved the sale of $130 million in F-16 fighter jet components.

Congress has a 30-day window if it wants to block the proposed sale.

Amnesty International last week accused the UAE of supplying Sudan's paramilitary RSF group with Chinese weapons in defiance of a UN embargo, fuelling the civil war there. 

The UAE strongly denied Amnesty's claims.

However, other experts, including from the United Nations, have accused the Arab nation over the past year of arming the RSF, which has been fighting the  Sudanese army for more than two years. 

The Sudanese government has severed diplomatic ties with the Gulf state.

An opulent welcome is awaiting the US president when he arrives in the oil-rich monarchy.

There is also the prospect of $1 trillion (€900 billion) in arms deals and AI investments.

But one of Trump's major goals, the normalization of Israel-Saudi relations seems to be off the table for now.

The Abraham Accords, set up by Trump in his first term, sought to bring about Israel's official recognition by Arab states, some of which have already made the move.

However, Saudi Arabia has said that ending the war in Gaza and a credible path to Palestinian statehood are prerequisites for any advancement on this issue.

The monarchy's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had been close to signing a defense pact with the US in exchange for recognizing Israel before October 7.

Hamas' attacks on Israel that day are seen, in large part, as being an attempt to foil that deal.

The US will also be hoping to wield its influence in the region to push back increasing involvement by China and Chinese capital in the kingdom.

US media have reported that the Trump administration is set to accept a new Air Force One from Qatar as a gift.

Trump has called the deal a ""transparent transaction,"" but critics point to likely conflicts of interest.

Read the full report here.



Welcome to DW's coverage of the latest developments in the United States as US President Donald Trump sets off on his first major foreign trip after returning to the White House for his second term.

Trump will land in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday before traveling on to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 

The president will meet with business and diplomatic partners in the Gulf while at the same time deepening US business ties in the region. 

The question of the future of Gaza will likely come up — Trump has proposed relocating the enclave's population to build a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" — as well as the state of ongoing talks with Iran about its uranium enrichment program.

Although Trump has been unable to deliver on his promise to immediately end Israel's war in Gaza, the Islamist militia Hamas offered a goodwill gesture before his arrival when it released Israeli-American soldier Edan Alexander on Monday after 19 months in captivity there.  

The president is not planning on visiting Israel during his time in the region.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Joe Biden's aides discussed the prospect of him needing a wheelchair if he were re-elected as president, according to claims in a bombshell new book.

The 82-year-old had grown so frail in 2023 and 2024 that aides are said to have spoken privately about whether he would need assistance to stay upright.

The upcoming book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson, is out on May 20 and promises to lift the lid on efforts to conceal Mr Biden's mental and physical decline by those around him in the lead up to the election.

The Democrats have been widely criticised for not facing up to the former president's deterioration, ultimately resulting in Donald Trump's victory.

“Biden's physical deterioration – most apparent in his halting walk – had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election,” the authors wrote.

“Given Biden's age, [his physician Kevin O'Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery.”

The former president's advisers are said to have grown increasingly fearful of a fall after he tripped over a sandbag in 2023.

The tumble prompted aides to take precautions to avoid a repeat incident before the November 2024 election, including encouraging him to wear trainers, plotting easier walking routes and using the short set of stairs on Air Force One.

Aides are said to have believed it was politically impossible to have Mr Biden use one during his re-election campaign, as Mr Trump repeatedly brought attention to his frailty.

The former president's physician is alleged to have clashed with aides over the impact of the presidency on Mr Biden's health, joking that his staff were trying to kill him.

Mr O'Connor is said to have remonstrated with Mr Biden's team to squeeze more downtime into his busy schedule.

Of particular concern was the former president's stilted gait, which his doctor attributed to “significant spinal arthritis” as well as “mild post-fracture foot arthritis”, resulting from a foot injury in November 2020.

Aides suggested at the time that the injury did not heal properly because Mr Biden refused to wear a walking boot.

Despite clear signs of Mr Biden's mental and physical decline, he, his family and senior White House officials pushed ahead with his re-election campaign, the book claims.

The former president eventually dropped out of the race in June after a disastrous debate performance, leaving Kamala Harris just four months to convince the public she was the woman to beat Mr Trump.

Addressing the claims made in the book, a Biden spokesman told Axios that the former president's “medical exam made clear that he had a stiffened gait caused, in part, by wear and tear to his spine – but that no special treatment was necessary and that it had not worsened.

“He was transparent about this, and it was far from ‘severe',” the statement added. “Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.

“We are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite – he was a very effective president.”

On Tuesday, hours after excerpts of the book were released, a Biden spokesman released a statement saying that a small lump was found in the former president's prostate.

“In a routine physical exam a small nodule was found in the prostate which necessitated further evaluation,” the spokesman told ABC News.

Further tests will be required to determine the cause of the lump, and it is too early to say if it is benign, caused by inflation or something more serious.

“It's really an unnecessary and an unfortunate threat to our security,” one judge said.

Federal judges across several states are being delivered unsolicited pizza orders — an act of harassment and attempted intimidation, they say, from people who are unhappy with their rulings involving President Donald Trump.

The U.S. Marshals Service has been tracking such deliveries since February. Although the agency hasn't divulged details on how prevalent they are, The Washington Post reports that the deliveries may number “in the hundreds,” and have occurred in at least seven states.

The deliveries aren't just happening at judges' homes, but also at the homes of their family members, some judges revealed in interviews with the publication.

“It's unsettling because I'd like to go to work every day, even with the hardest case, just feeling like there's no sense of intimidation,” said U.S. Circuit Judge J. Michelle Childs, a Washington-based judge who received pizza deliveries shortly after taking part in a ruling against Trump over his administration's firing of a government watchdog.

Childs added:

It's really an unnecessary and an unfortunate threat to our security when we're trying to be judicial officers in a very neutral position with respect to our cases. You need a strong judiciary for the system to work. This is infringing on democracy generally.

U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, whose son Daniel was killed in 2020 by a person posing as a delivery driver, said the pizza deliveries — some under her son's name — were a clear attempt at intimidation. 

“We know what that all means, right?” Salas said. “We know the first is, ‘I know where you live.' Second is, ‘We know where your children live.' And the third now is, ‘Do you want to end up like Judge Salas? Do you want to end up like Daniel?'”

A spokesperson for the White House suggested that Trump is against the intimidation tactics, saying that attacks on judges “have no place in our society.” But despite that assertion, Trump has made a series of online posts and public statements condemning judges who have ruled against him — and attacking judges' credibility, character and loyalty to the country.

Over the weekend, for example, Trump decried a supposed “radicalized and incompetent Court System” and criticized judicial orders relating to his draconian immigration policies, writing on Sunday that the rulings would make the U.S. a “CRIME RIDDEN THIRD WORLD NATION, NEVER TO SEE GREATNESS AGAIN.” (Notably, data shows that migrants living in the U.S. are less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens.)

On Monday, Trump continued his attacks on the judiciary, claiming that “Radical Left Judges” didn't care about protecting the country from supposed “murderers and other criminals.”

Trump has also demanded the impeachment of judges who have issued rulings against him. And his attacks extend beyond the rhetorical, as the FBI recently arrested a judge in Wisconsin, alleging that she blocked immigration agents from detaining someone outside of her courtroom earlier this year. 

Critics called that action a blatant intimidation tactic against judges in general. 

“Milwaukee's Judge Hannah Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade ICE by not turning her courtroom into a trap. This isn't justice. It's a warning shot: obey, or get cuffed,” opined podcaster Brian Allen.

“We do not have kings in this country. … By attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders and arresting a sitting judge,” Trump is “putting basic democratic values…on the line,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin).

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia—President Donald Trump arrived in Riyadh at 9:49 a.m. local time Tuesday, kicking off the first major overseas trip of his second term.

The White House has described the visit as the president's “historic return to the Middle East,” with stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from May 13 to May 16.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman welcomed Trump upon his arrival at the airport.

As in his first term, Trump has chosen Saudi Arabia for his first state visit, signaling the strategic importance he places on ties with Gulf nations. His visit comes amid regional tensions and significant global developments, including the conflict between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group, recent tensions between India and Pakistan, and potential Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul that could alter his itinerary.

Trump is expected to announce a series of major investment deals aimed at drawing Gulf capital into critical U.S. sectors such as defense, technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). He will also hold meetings focused on pressing regional issues, including the ongoing Gaza conflict, the future of displaced Palestinians, and Iran's nuclear ambitions.

Traveling with the president are several top officials and advisors, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, as well as senior aides Susie Wiles and Stephen Miller.

On his second day in Riyadh, Trump is expected to attend a summit with leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.

Trump announced on Monday that Qatar will donate a luxury plane to be used as the new Air Force One. When asked about the gift, Trump told reporters it was a “great gesture.”

“I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,” he said. He added that the plane will “go directly” to his presidential library after he leaves office.

However, his schedule remains flexible. Trump suggested he may fly to Turkey to attend a potential meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. “There's a possibility of it, I guess,” Trump told reporters on Monday, adding that he would go “if I thought it would be helpful.”

While media speculation has hinted at a possible meeting between Trump and Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, an administration official told The Epoch Times that no such meeting is planned. Still, Trump indicated he may consider lifting sanctions on Syria that were imposed during the Assad regime.

“We're going to have to make a decision on the sanctions, which we may very well relieve,” Trump told reporters before heading to the Middle East. “We may take them off of Syria because we want to give them a fresh start.”

Trump also expressed hope that more hostages held by Hamas would be released during his trip.

“We hope that we're going to have other hostages released, too,” Trump said, estimating that about 20 living hostages may still be held by Hamas.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

SAN FRANCISCO—Three years after a California teenager died by suicide, four men in West Africa have been arrested on suspicion of participating in “international sextortion scheme,” according to federal investigators.

The 2022 death of Ryan Last, a 17-year-old high school senior, prompted a lengthy international investigation, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. Department of Justice.

Last had corresponded online with someone on a Meta social media platform he believed to be a young woman who sent him explicit photos. The teen reciprocated with similar photos of himself and was immediately hit with a blackmail demand. Terrified the photos would be exposed, Last died by suicide, the statement said.

In April, the blackmailer was arrested in Cote d'Ivoire, officials said. At the time of his arrest, the suspect “still had the sextortion messages he sent to the 17-year-old victim in February 2022 on his phone,” the DOJ said. The teen, from San Jose, had paid him $150. The city is around 42 miles southeast of downtown San Francisco.

Three other men in Cote d'Ivoire were arrested on money laundering charges. The DOJ said the men targeted “thousands of victims” in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Because Cote d'Ivoire does not extradite citizens, the four men will face cybercrime charges in their own country, officials said. A fifth man arrested in Los Angeles in Dec. 2022 was convicted of extortion and was sentenced to 1 1/2 years in jail.

In the U.S., the case was investigated by the FBI, the San Jose Police Department and the tech company Meta, which the DOJ credited for providing critical information to help identify the suspects.

In a similar case, two brothers from Nigeria were sentenced in 2024 to 17 1/2 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to sexually extorting teenage boys and young men across the U.S., including a 17-year-old from Michigan who took his own life.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

When U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted, on May 10, that India and Pakistan had agreed to a cease-fire, the world breathed a sigh of relief. The two nuclear-armed neighbors had teetered perilously close to all-out war as they fired missiles and drone strikes at each other's military installations and religious sites over the previous three days. The stakes grew especially high after the Indian military hit Pakistan's Nur Khan air base, close to the country's nuclear command forces. It was an attack that could have provoked uncontrolled escalation—and that pushed Washington to intervene even after senior officials had insisted the administration was disinclined to do so.

But although the guns have now fallen silent, the danger remains high. The two sides continued to fire at each other for hours after the cease-fire had taken effect, and no one should be under any illusion that these adversaries will resolve their fundamental clash over Kashmir anytime soon. The dispute over this divided mountainous territory goes back to the 1947 partition of the subcontinent; since then, Kashmir has held symbolic resonance for both countries and shaped how they perceive their national identity. As a country created to be a homeland for Muslims in South Asia, Pakistan believes it is justified in claiming the Muslim-majority region. Indian officials reject this argument and view it as an integral part of their state, especially since the original leader of pre-partition Jammu and Kashmir (a Hindu) acceded to India.

India and Pakistan have fought two wars, battled in a border conflict, and experienced multiple military crises over the status of Kashmir. New Delhi's response to terrorist provocations on its side of the line of control—the de facto boundary between the two countries—has grown increasingly intense since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government came to power in 2014. The current Pakistani army chief, Syed Asim Munir, has a reputation as a hard-liner, evident in his vitriolic, mid-April remarks about Kashmir and Hindu-Muslim differences. Each country, then, has a domestic incentive not to back down from its maximalist positions.

Trump, a self-styled dealmaker, may be tempted to try to permanently resolve the status of Kashmir. But he should resist the urge. Any effort by Washington to strike a final deal could encourage Pakistan to fuel further terrorist attacks against India. It will needlessly strain U.S.-Indian relations. And it will almost certainly not work. The United States can push Pakistan to reduce its support for terrorism, and it should call on both sides to respect the line of control. But Washington should mostly stick to its role as a crisis manager, which it has a unique responsibility to fulfill. It should not try to fix an unfixable issue. India and Pakistan's dispute over Kashmir is a clear example of the kind of foreign policy challenge that can be neither solved nor neglected and thus requires ongoing work to prevent it from spiraling out of control.

The spark for the current Indian-Pakistani conflict was all too familiar, mimicking a pattern that has prompted military crises between the two countries over the last 25 years. On April 22, terrorists killed 26 civilians, mostly Indian tourists, in Indian-administered Kashmir. New Delhi claimed that the attackers were operating at the behest of the Pakistan-based, U.S.-designated terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba, and then retaliated on May 7 by striking the group's headquarters in Muridke along with eight other sites in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir and Pakistan's Punjab Province. India said its targets were “terrorist infrastructure,” and whether all those sites fit that bill remains unclear. But one of the dead is Abdul Rauf Azhar, a U.S. Specially Designated Terrorist Leader involved in the 1999 hijacking of India Airlines Flight 814. (To end the hijacking and secure the safe release of the passengers, India was forced to release terrorist leaders, including Omar Sheikh, who in 2002 kidnapped the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl; Pearl was then brutally murdered.)

What transpired after India's May 7 military response was the most serious incident between India and Pakistan since the 1999 Kargil border conflict. In that brief war, Pakistani regular army units, disguised as militants, took over portions of territory on India's side of the line of control, precipitating a two-month battle that resulted in at least 1,000 deaths of Indian and Pakistani soldiers. But even the Kargil conflict was limited to one specific area of Kashmir. Last week's fighting occurred along the line of control, across the two countries' international boundary, and deep into each side's territory outside Kashmir. The countries used drones and missiles against both military and civilian religious sites, adding unpredictability and risking uncontrolled escalation.

At first, Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance demonstrated little interest in getting involved in the fight between India and Pakistan, even though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been working the phones with Indian and Pakistani officials. “They'll get it figured out one way or the other,” Trump said on April 25. “It's fundamentally none of our business,” Vance said on May 8. But after India struck Nur Khan on May 9, Washington began to seriously worry that the two sides might entertain nuclear war. Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif had said earlier that Pakistan would exercise the nuclear option if “there is a direct threat to our existence,” and U.S. officials worried that India's Nur Khan strike signaled that New Delhi could decapitate Pakistan's nuclear command structure, a step that would likely cross Pakistan's nuclear redlines. The Trump administration then finally brokered a cease-fire, surprising and relieving everyone.

A few hours later, Trump said he would increase trade with both nations and help them permanently resolve the vexed Kashmir dispute. But the differing Indian and Pakistani reactions to the cease-fire announcement suggest this will be a quixotic task. Both sides have been jockeying to control the narrative about the cease-fire: India denied that Washington had a substantial role in the negotiations, while Pakistan's prime minister thanked Trump for his involvement. India also rejected the notion that it had committed to bilateral dialogue on a broad array of issues, which Rubio had asserted in his statement about the cease-fire and Pakistan had affirmed.

It is no surprise that India downplayed U.S. involvement in brokering the cease-fire. New Delhi has long shunned the idea of third parties mediating its disputes with Pakistan, and it is particularly sensitive to any hint of international involvement when it comes to Kashmir. Islamabad, on the other hand, wants to bring international attention to the issue and convince Washington that resolving the dispute is essential to avoid an Indian-Pakistani war that could potentially go nuclear. India is the status quo power, and Pakistan is responsible for sparking most of their crises by either sponsoring terrorist attacks or trying to wrest territory through direct force, as it did during the Kargil conflict. Following that war, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared that the two countries should respect the line of control and that neither country's land could change hands through bloodshed, a statement India endorsed.

Given the fraught history of the Kashmir dispute and Indian sensitivities to outside involvement, the Trump administration must exercise caution if it wants to keep building a strategic partnership with India and discourage Pakistan from supporting terrorists. There is a tremendous difference between getting the two countries to step back from the brink of war and facilitating a permanent solution to an 80-year dispute. The former is something Washington has, historically, done well. But the latter is something only India and Pakistan can accomplish.

Trump should know this. He has fallen into the Kashmir mediation trap before. In July 2019, standing next to then Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan at a press conference, Trump said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked him to mediate over Kashmir. It was a tremendous confabulation that anyone who follows South Asian politics knew was untrue. At the time, I was the deputy assistant to the president and the National Security Council's senior director for South and Central Asia, and it marked one of the worst days of my stint at the NSC. Two weeks after Trump's statement, India revoked the autonomy afforded the state of Jammu and Kashmir and divided it into two territories in what may have been an attempt by New Delhi to signal that it would not discuss changing Kashmir's territorial status. Following subsequent briefings, Trump never broached the issue of Kashmir mediation again during his first term, and it would be a mistake for him to revive the idea now.

The reason why is simple: raising the specter of international mediation encourages Islamabad's unrealistic expectation that a final settlement will give Pakistan a greater share of Kashmir. Such fallacies perpetuate Pakistan-based terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, whose leader claimed to have lost several family members during India's recent strikes. These expectations may also incite outright Pakistani attacks. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf used the 1999 incursion into Kargil to try to raise the international profile of the Kashmir issue, and it is possible that the Pakistani military leadership encouraged the latest attack to again garner greater international attention.



To stop Pakistan from elevating the profile of Kashmir, Trump must not play into the country's hands by offering to mediate the dispute. He can affirm the sanctity of the line of control. But he should then focus on aims that are achievable—such as sustaining the current cease-fire. Neither India nor Pakistan can afford to allow military escalation to ratchet back up. They have already come too close to all-out war. The U.S.-brokered cease-fire has provided an opportunity for both to claim victory and climb down the escalatory ladder, and Trump should see to it that they do. To that end, American officials must closely monitor the cease-fire and call out violations. Rubio should continue to work the phones and counsel military restraint with both parties.

Next, Washington should pressure Pakistan on the issue of terrorism. Although analysts do not yet know whether Pakistan had any role in the most recent attack, the country's involvement in various other terrorist atrocities, such as the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist strikes, puts the onus on Islamabad to crack down on terrorists that reside in its territory. For instance, Pakistan could move the Lashkar-e-Taiba leader Hafiz Mohammad Sayeed from house arrest to a prison. Doing so would help weaken the organization and show that the government is serious about cracking down on the group.

Most important, Washington must better position itself to act as a crisis manager. It can do so, in part, by cultivating strong relationships with both India and Pakistan. India is more important to the United States, given its fast-growing economy, military, and technological prowess; its role in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (known as the Quad, a partnership with Australia, Japan, and the United States); and its desire to balance against rising Chinese power. But Washington also has an interest in maintaining good ties with Pakistan, partly to compete with China's influence in the region. U.S. officials cannot wean Pakistan off China entirely, and U.S.-Pakistani relations will never return to the heights reached following the September 11 attacks (when the United States provided billions in economic and military aid to the country). But Washington can provide trade, economic investment, educational opportunities, and other types of assistance to Pakistan. It would certainly be unwise for the Trump administration to ignore the country. The only way Washington can play the role of honest broker during times of crisis between India and Pakistan is if it maintains ties to both.

None of this means that Trump can't encourage the two sides to sit down for talks. But the White House must resist the temptation to get directly involved in the Kashmir dispute. If American officials seek to meddle in this sensitive, intractable issue, they will sacrifice India's trust and partnership, which is fundamental to the United States' broader Indo-Pacific strategy, and fuel terrorist elements inside Pakistan that seek to provoke conflict and threaten regional stability. It is better, then, for Washington to recognize the narrow parameters of its influence and stick to preventing war rather than aiming to achieve a lasting peace.

 Ian Bremmer

In February 2022, as Russian forces advanced on Kyiv, Ukraine's government faced a critical vulnerability: with its Internet and communication networks under attack, its troops and leaders would soon be in the dark. Elon Musk—the de facto head of Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), xAI, the Boring Company, and Neuralink—stepped in. Within days, SpaceX had deployed thousands of Starlink terminals to Ukraine and activated satellite Internet service at no cost. Having kept the country online, Musk was hailed as a hero.

But the centibillionaire's personal intervention—and Kyiv's reliance on it—came with risks. Months later, Ukraine asked SpaceX to extend Starlink's coverage to Russian-occupied Crimea, to enable a submarine drone strike that Kyiv wanted to carry out against Russian naval assets. Musk refused—worried, he said, that this would cause a major escalation in the war. Even the Pentagon's entreaties on behalf of Ukraine failed to convince him. An unelected, unaccountable private citizen had unilaterally thwarted a military operation in an active war zone while exposing the fact that governments had remarkably little control over crucial decisions affecting their citizens and national security.

This was “technopolarity” in action: a technology leader not only driving stock market returns but also controlling aspects of civil society, politics, and international affairs that have been traditionally the exclusive preserve of nation-states. Over the past decade, the rise of such individuals and the firms they control has transformed the global order, which had been defined by states since the Peace of Westphalia enshrined them as the building blocks of geopolitics nearly 400 years ago. For most of this time, the structure of that order could be described as unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar, depending on how power was distributed among countries. The world, however, has since entered a “technopolar moment,” a term I used in Foreign Affairs in 2021 to describe an emerging order in which “a handful of large technology companies rival [states] for geopolitical influence.” Major tech firms have become powerful geopolitical actors, exercising a form of sovereignty over digital space and, increasingly, the physical world that potentially rivals that of states.

In 2021, the power of those companies seemed poised to grow, and over the last three years, it has. I argued that governments would not go down without a fight, and in the time since, their struggle for control over digital space has intensified. But the balance of power between technology firms and states has shifted in some surprising ways. What is emerging as a result of this contest is not quite any of the scenarios I originally envisioned—neither a globalized digital order, in which tech companies wrested control of digital space from the state, nor a U.S.-Chinese tech cold war, in which governments reasserted authority over the digital realm, nor a fully technopolar world, in which Westphalian state dominance gave way to a new order led by tech firms.

Instead of a clean triumph of states over firms or vice versa, the future is taking on a more hybrid form—a bifurcated system pitting a technopolar United States, where private tech actors increasingly shape national policy, against a statist China, where the government has asserted total control over its digital space. Most of the rest of the world is under pressure to reluctantly align with one pole or the other, but with both models offering little in the way of democratic accountability and individual freedom, the choice is less stark than it may seem. As tech power and state power fuse everywhere, the question is no longer whether tech companies will rival states for geopolitical influence; it is whether open societies can survive the challenge.

In late 2021, the tech industry was riding high. Companies that controlled major technology platforms were at the zenith of their power. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg promised to create a fully immersive parallel “metaverse” free from real-world and government constraints, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum were starting to go mainstream, promising a viable decentralized alternative to governments' authority over financial and payment systems. The COVID-19 pandemic had forced people to spend more time online than ever before, cementing tech's influence as digital platforms became essential for work, education, entertainment, and interpersonal connection.

This period accelerated the adoption of digital tools and made tech companies even more central to private, social, economic, and civic life. As the world grew ever more dependent on digital connectivity, decisions made in corporate boardrooms—about what products to launch, how algorithms worked, and what rules and regulations to enforce—determined much of what billions of people saw and heard, shaped their opportunities, and even rewired their thought patterns.

But Big Tech companies didn't just become more autonomous masters of their virtual walled gardens. They also expanded their influence in the physical realm, with their products and services becoming critical infrastructure. Data centers, cloud computing systems, satellite networks, semiconductors, and cybersecurity tools increasingly underpinned the operation of national economies, militaries, and governments.

This shift was on full display in the early days of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. If American companies such as SpaceX, Microsoft, and Palantir hadn't chosen to leap to Ukraine's defense—enabling communication, repelling cyberattacks, analyzing intelligence, and powering drones—Russia could have knocked the country offline, decapitated its command structure, and seized the capital. Ukraine might have lost the war within days.



But it wasn't long before governments realized that what technologists giveth, they can as easily taketh away. The Starlink-Crimea episode—and the pandemic-era supply shortages before it—exposed the fragility created by reliance on a few dominant companies for key services and supplies. A single point of failure, or a single CEO's decision, could have catastrophic consequences.

Faced with these risks, states struck back. In 2022, a wave of legislation and regulatory action targeted Big Tech on issues such as market power, content moderation, user protection, and data privacy. The EU passed the landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, some of the most ambitious efforts to constrain tech power anywhere. The United States advanced high-profile antitrust cases, congressional oversight efforts, and state-level privacy rules. India, South Africa, and others followed suit, while the EU, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and others took more aggressive enforcement action against big platforms. But these rearguard actions did little to dent Big Tech's control of the digital space, where they—not governments—continued to act as the primary architects, actors, and enforcers.

Big Tech's power deepened further in late 2022 with the debut of large language models and the subsequent explosion of artificial intelligence—a breakthrough technology that has entrenched the tech industry's lead over nation-states. The development and deployment of advanced AI systems demands immense computational power, vast data troves, and specialized engineering talent—resources concentrated in a handful of firms. These entities alone determine and understand (most of) what their models can do, and how, where, and by whom they are used. Even if regulators could design adequate governance regimes to contain the technology as it currently exists, AI's exponential pace of advancement would quickly render them obsolete.

As AI becomes more powerful and more central to economic, military, and geopolitical competition, the tech firms that control it will grow even more geopolitically influential.

But as tech companies expanded their influence, traditional geopolitics came roaring back. Rising protectionism fueled by a populist backlash to globalization, a post-pandemic push for economic security reinforced by the shock of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and, above all, intensifying U.S.-Chinese strategic rivalry converged to shatter the illusion of a global tech ecosystem.

In Washington, an effort to limit China's technological development began with targeted export and investment controls on a narrow set of strategically sensitive advanced technologies—a “small yard, high fence” approach, as the Biden administration framed it. But the campaign soon widened into an ever-expanding domain of restrictions on a vast array of goods that could be considered dual-use. Even mundane data became a national security concern, as did the apps and devices that generate it. Everything from social media to electric vehicles to fitness trackers was pulled into the vortex of “de-risking,” as U.S. policymakers scrambled to limit China's access to anything that could give Beijing an edge in technological competition. Economic and security interests became indistinguishable, and technological fragmentation—if not outright decoupling from China—became the norm.

Meanwhile, industrial policy made a comeback as Western governments poured billions into subsidy programs to build strategic capabilities at home. Those carrots, however, came with sticks: build at home and leave China, or miss out on U.S. government largess. As Washington imposed limits on semiconductors and AI tools and Beijing tightened control over its critical minerals, supply chains balkanized and cross-border data flows slowed.

This unraveling of digital and physical globalization has since undermined the globalist business model adopted by firms such as Apple and Tesla, which relied on open markets and integrated supply chains to maximize their global profits. Even before Trump's return to office, many of these firms had begun “friend shoring” some of their operations, shifting them from China to countries such as India, Mexico, and Vietnam to hedge against rising geopolitical risk. Last month, however, Trump announced massive tariffs that would hit allies and adversaries alike. The move signaled Washington's retreat from globalization and dealt a blow to the globalist paradigm. By contrast, so-called national champions, such as Microsoft and Palantir, now find themselves in a new golden hour, able to leverage their long-standing alignment with the U.S. government to thrive in a fractured, post-globalization environment.

Washington's statist turn has been more surprising but far less complete than Beijing's. Since 2020, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cracked down on the Alibaba CEO Jack Ma, whom officials believed had grown too powerful and independent, Beijing has reasserted total control over its tech sector. Today, even China's largest tech firms—regardless of their formal ownership structure—serve at the pleasure of President Xi Jinping, and the question of who controls China's digital future has been decisively answered: the state.

In the West, the answer to that question is still up for grabs. Complicating matters is the fact that it is not only control of digital space that is unsettled; it is control of the state itself.

A subset of Silicon Valley visionaries such as Musk, Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, and Marc Andreessen once saw technology not just as a business opportunity but as a revolutionary force—one capable of liberating society from the limits of government and ultimately rendering the state obsolete. These “techno-utopians,” as I defined them in 2021, were skeptical of politics and “look[ed] to a future in which the nation-state paradigm that has dominated geopolitics since the seventeenth century has been replaced by something different altogether.”

But in recent years, some of these figures have taken a techno-authoritarian turn. No longer content to transcend the state, they now seek to capture it—repurposing public power to advance private ambitions. Part of this shift has been self-interested, driven by a desire to secure favorable regulations, tax breaks, and public contracts, as the wealthy and special interests in America often try to do. But it also reflects the rising stakes and changing balance of technological power in a geopolitically contested era.

Unlike earlier digital platforms, which blossomed under minimal government intervention, most of today's frontier technologies—such as aerospace, AI, biotech, energy, and quantum computing—actively require implicit or explicit state backing to scale up. As these domains grew central to U.S.-Chinese competition and national security engulfed more of the digital realm itself, alignment with Washington evolved from a nuisance into a strategic necessity, making the techno-utopian vision less viable—and the national champion model more attractive. The incentives for state capture soared along with the spoils of it.



Yet for some, the choice of state capture wasn't only pragmatic—it was also ideological. Several prominent tech figures, most notably Musk and Thiel, have embraced an antidemocratic worldview. They see American governance (and republican governance more generally) as irreparably broken, and its pluralism, checks and balances, and professional civil service as bugs, not features. These figures want the U.S. government to be run like a startup, with an unelected “national CEO” wielding concentrated power in the name of technological progress. In their view, control of the state—and the future—should shift to self-anointed techno-elites who are fit to lead the country through an era of exponential change. Thiel declared as early as 2009 that he no longer believed “freedom and democracy are compatible.” In 2023, Musk called for a “modern day Sulla,” referring to the Roman dictator whose reign was credited with the collapse of the republic.

Although he may have been joking at the time, Musk has in fact spent the past four months attempting to seize the reins of the U.S. government. But this is not a hostile takeover, as some have characterized it. It's a leveraged buyout. Musk alone spent nearly $300 million to help elect Trump and a Republican Congress in 2024—not including the cost of remaking X into a pro-Trump social media platform. In return, the most transactional president in American history rewarded the world's richest man with unparalleled influence over the mightiest state on earth.

Trump was already predisposed toward crony capitalism. But in his second term, tech moguls haven't just been empowered to shape policy—they have been invited to hire (or fire) their own regulators and write (or erase) their own rules. Since he was put in charge of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and granted “root access” to federal government systems, Musk has purged tens of thousands of civil servants, installed loyalists across dozens of agencies, slashed congressionally appropriated funding, and acquired terabytes of confidential data belonging to millions of Americans.

He and many of his techno-authoritarian allies embedded throughout government have retained their private-sector roles despite conflicts of interest. These technologists now hold sway over federal personnel and policy—shaping rulemaking, regulatory enforcement, procurement, taxation, and subsidies, affecting not only their own firms but their rivals' firms, as well. A recent Senate report estimated Musk's financial gains from this arrangement at $2.37 billion, excluding the potential value of public contracts and competitive advantages that his newfound access could unlock.



Already, there are reports that DOGE is collecting and consolidating troves of sensitive government data—tax filings, immigration databases, Social Security records, health information, and more—with the purported aim of uncovering “waste, fraud, and abuse” in federal spending to enhance government efficiency, especially when combined with AI tools. But with no legal firewall between Musk's public role and private interests, there is no way to know whether he has already begun feeding this data into his company xAI's proprietary AI models—and, if he has, whether the outputs will serve the public good or his own. This master dataset could generate significant productivity gains for the U.S. economy, which other countries would soon try to adopt themselves. It could also give him a decisive edge in the race to build superintelligent AI systems that no rival could match, enable new forms of consumer profiling and behavioral targeting, and tighten his grip on markets and platforms.

The implications go beyond self-enrichment. Once in place, the same algorithmic infrastructure that delivers economic advantage could be weaponized for political control. Whistleblowers allege that DOGE is using AI to flag anti-Musk and anti-Trump sentiment among civil servants, and IRS officials have resigned over the Trump administration's plans to mine tax data to track immigrants. The danger isn't exactly an American version of China's CCP-run surveillance regime, which exists primarily to secure the party's hold on power. What Musk might produce is something more diffuse: an algorithmically powered, decentralized surveillance network leveraging captured state power but infused with market incentives, built to advance the commercial and political interests of select technology owners.

To be clear, Big Tech's grip on Washington may not be permanent. Musk has claimed that DOGE is a time-limited initiative, and he has already signaled plans to step back from government amid plummeting public popularity and rising consumer backlash against his companies. Prominent figures in the populist wing of Trump's coalition, such as Steve Bannon, have also denounced Musk and his peers as “technofeudal” globalists bent on turning Americans into “digital serfs.” The tech right's alliance with Trump was always transactional, not ideological. The administration's policies thus far—on trade, immigration, and science funding—have often run counter to the accelerationist ethos that these technologists espouse. The partnership may yet fray.

But for now, the capture is real, inverting the logic of the national champion model: where the state once directed technology firms to serve the public interest, policy is increasingly subordinated to the private objectives of technologists. Even if this doesn't last, the damage will. In just a few months, DOGE has so hollowed out U.S. state capacity that after it is gone, private technology firms may become essential to help fill the void.

In 2021, I posited three possible paths for our digital future: “Will we live in a world where the Internet is increasingly fragmented and technology companies serve the interests and goals of the states in which they reside, or will Big Tech decisively wrest control of digital space from governments, freeing itself from national boundaries and emerging as a truly global force? Or could the era of state dominance finally come to an end, supplanted by a techno-elite that assumes responsibility for offering the public goods once provided by governments?”

Today, the digital realm seems to be heading toward a more hybrid future—a world bifurcated into two digital spheres of influence. One pole is formed by an unmistakably more technopolar United States, where a handful of tech firms and leaders wield digital dominance, control critical infrastructure, and exert direct influence over U.S. foreign and domestic policy. These companies and the individuals who run them can manipulate the global information environment, destabilize foreign governments, and shape geopolitical outcomes. What makes this influence more potent now is that these actors boast the implicit (and sometimes explicit) backing of the American state. Foreign governments are increasingly reluctant to crack down on U.S. tech firms—not just because of their digital leverage and economic clout but also because doing so could provoke official backlash from Washington. In effect, politically endorsed components of Big Tech enjoy geopolitical impunity: shielded by the state but not accountable to it. This fusion of public and private power should allow U.S. firms to push countries to adopt their products, platforms, and standards.

The opposing pole is anchored by China and its state-capitalist model, where technology champions remain fully subordinated to the CCP. Although Beijing's statist approach may sacrifice some long-term innovation potential and economic dynamism at the margins, it ensures that strategic technologies are aligned with national priorities. And recent breakthroughs—from DeepSeek's latest AI reasoning models to Huawei's CloudMatrix 384 chip cluster—demonstrate that China's model, despite these political constraints and U.S. export controls, remains highly competitive.

Caught between these poles is Europe, once seen as a potential counterweight to the power of Big Tech. The EU has few indigenous tech giants of its own and is mired in a structural growth and productivity trap. As a result, its ability to translate regulatory ambitions into digital sovereignty is limited. Brussels faces mounting pressure to soften AI regulations for American firms and may even hesitate to tax U.S. digital service exports in response to Trump's tariffs.



Meanwhile, the few remaining efforts at state-led and global tech governance are under siege—undermined by American Big Tech actors such as Musk and stifled by a vacuum of global leadership. As geopolitical, geoeconomic, and geotechnological fragmentation deepen, the checks on technopolar power are rapidly eroding, leaving technopolarity to grow unchecked.

The result is likely to be not a fully technopolar world but a more technopolar United States mirrored by a tightly state-controlled digital bloc in China. Most advanced industrial economies will have little choice but to align with the U.S. model, while much of the global South will find the Chinese offering more attractive.

Yet beneath their ideological differences, the American and Chinese models are converging in function. One is driven by market logic, the other by political imperatives—but both prioritize efficiency over accountability, control over consent, and scale over individual rights. In a world where authority accrues to those who control the digital space, it may matter less whether power resides in public or private hands than how effectively it can be centralized.

The great paradox of the technopolar age is that, rather than empowering individuals and bolstering democracy as early Internet visionaries once hoped, technology may instead be enabling more effective forms of hypercentralized, unaccountable control. AI and other breakthrough technologies may even render closed political systems more stable than open ones—where transparency, pluralism, checks and balances, and other key democratic features could prove liabilities in an age of exponential change. Whether lodged in governments or corporate actors, concentrated tech power poses risks to democracy and individual freedom. In 2021, I wrote that “Big Tech's eclipse of the nation-state is not inevitable.” But it seems as if Big Tech's eclipse of democracy, at least, has already begun.

            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Tuesday he is placing a blanket hold on all Justice Department political nominees, as he seeks answers related to the Trump administration's plans to accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family to use as Air Force One.
    


            “News of the Qatari government gifting Donald Trump a $400 million private jet to use as Air Force One is so corrupt that even Putin would give a double take,” Schumer said on the Senate floor, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “This is not just naked corruption, it is also a grave national security threat.”
    


            “So, in light of the deeply troubling news of a possible Qatari-funded Air Force One, and the reports that the attorney general personally signed off on this clearly unethical deal, I am announcing a hold on all DOJ political nominees, until we get more answers,” he added.

            A blanket hold does not mean the Senate is unable to confirm these nominees, but it does force the chamber's Republican majority to burn valuable floor time to overcome the hold. Only a simple majority vote is needed to overcome the hold.
    


            Schumer demanded the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act Unit “disclose all activities by Qatari foreign agents inside the US that could benefit President Trump or the Trump Organization,” and read a detailed list of questions probing the details of this jet offer. He also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi testify before the House and Senate “to explain why gifting Donald Trump a private jet does not violate the Emoluments Clause — which requires congressional approval — or any other ethics laws.”
    


            The Democratic leader focused his questions on the national security risks of trusting a key piece of government equipment, like Air Force One, to a foreign country, and pressed on whether the Qataris could be trusted to outfit the plane.
    


            “President Trump has told the American people that this is a ‘free jet.' Does that mean the Qataris are delivering a ready-on-day-one plane with all the security measures already built in? If so, who installed those security measures and how do we know they were properly installed? Why would we take the risk of trusting any foreign country to do this sensitive work? If not, what security modifications would be needed to ensure a foreign-sourced Air Force One is safe to use?” he asked
    


            Schumer also pressed for other details, including how much it would cost taxpayers to make the necessary security adjustments for the plane, who in the administration was involved in arranging the offer, and whether there is any quid pro quo attached to what the president has called a “gift.”
    


            “What are the parameters of this deal, and which country brought it up first — us or them? What is Qatar being offered in return?” he asked.

            Schumer's announcement come as ethics experts have raised concerns about the Trump administration's potential move and questioned whether accepting the plane will violate the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits a president from receiving an “emolument” or profit from any “King, Prince, or foreign state” unless Congress consents.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the legal details on accepting the jet, which would be retrofitted and used as Air Force One, are “still being worked out.”
    


            “Any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law,” she added.
    


            Democrats have slammed the plan, with Schumer posting on social media Sunday: “It's not just bribery, it's premium foreign influence with legroom.”
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters in the Capitol that “there are lots of issues associated with that offer, which I think need to be further talked about.” The South Dakota Republican did not elaborate on what he sees as issues.
    


            Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, for his part, declined to weigh in on the administration's plan, telling CNN earlier in the day: “I haven't had a chance to even look at that yet.”
    


            While some in the president's party have defended the move, several Republican senators on Monday expressed misgivings about Trump's plans, noting the potential for security and legal risks.
    


            Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a member of the Senate GOP leadership team, said Monday evening that Trump and the White House “need to look at the constitutionality” of the issue.
    


            “I'd be checking for bugs is what I'd be checking for,” Capito said.
    


            Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri argued that it “would be better if Air Force One were a big, beautiful jet made in the United States of America.”

• Cassie Ventura on the stand: Cassie Ventura, the former girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs and one of his accusers, is testifying in his federal criminal trial. She described Combs as controlling and said some of their arguments would get violent and result in “physical abuse,” leaving her with injuries and bruises.
    


• Graphic video: The jury has viewed hotel surveillance footage from an altercation between Combs and Ventura from 2016.
    


• Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


• Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            Cassie Ventura testified if Sean “Diddy” Combs disapproved of her, he had his staff take her belongings.
    


                    “I would get my car taken away. I got kicked out of the house, my apartment. I had jewelry taken away. It was very random depending how he felt,” she said.
                





            Ventura said there were times when Combs personally took her electronics from her, and other times his security personnel did it.
    


            She'd eventually get the items back. “It depended how long I was being punished for, I guess,” Ventura said. “Sean would give them back to me if I would go to his house.”
    


            Cassie Ventura testified that Sean “Diddy” Combs was “very involved” in her physical appearance, and started making comments about the way she looked almost immediately in their relationship.
    


            “Appearance was very important to him — my appearance,” she said, adding that Combs would make comments about her hair and nails.
    


            “We had tons of conversations about my body at that time,” she testified. That included discussions about breast implants and “keeping my shape a certain way,” she said.
    


            “My self worth took a hit for the entirety of the relationship, just trying to establish who I was, who I wanted to be, who I was allowed to be,” Ventura said
    


            Cassie Ventura said that James Cruz, an employee of Bad Boy Records, managed her career after she started dating Sean “Diddy” Combs, but she added that decisions ultimately went through Combs.
    


                    “His role in managing my career was that he was managing me with one hand tied behind his back,” she said of Cruz.
                





            She testified that any decision had to go through Combs.
    


            Cassie Ventura has returned to the stand in the federal criminal trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            Ventura testified this morning and described Combs as controlling and said some of their arguments would get violent.
    


            Cassie Ventura, the former girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs who is currently testifying in his federal criminal trial, is the “linchpin” in the government's case against the music mogul, according to CNN anchor and chief legal analyst Laura Coates.
    


            Prosecutors want to use her testimony to “bridge the gap” for the jury between Combs' public persona and who they say he is in this felony indictment, Coates said.
    


                    “They claim he is a racketeer, that he is a sexual trafficker and that he is a violent man,” she said.
                





            Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            Ventura has testified about the beginning of their relationship and how the power dynamic changed as time went on. She also detailed allegations of abuse and said some of their arguments would be violent.
    


            The defense said in its opening statement that the domestic violence is not trafficking. Lawyers for Combs also plan to argue Ventura “made a choice” of staying with him for more than a decade.
    


            Defense lawyers for Sean “Diddy” Combs indicated Tuesday that they may call Cassie Ventura's husband Alex Fine to the stand to testify about allegations that Combs raped Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend and one of his accusers, in 2018.
    


            Fine was allowed by Judge Arun Subramanian to sit in the courtroom to support his wife during her testimony, which began on Tuesday, until the 2018 allegations are brought up.
    


            Ventura and Fine wed in 2019 during a secret ceremony in Malibu, one year after Ventura and Combs' years-long relationship ended. According to an interview with Vogue, Fine, who is a personal trainer, and Ventura first met at a gym.
    


            The couple are parents of two daughters, Frankie and Sunny, and announced in February they are expecting their third child.
    


            After video footage emerged of Combs physically assaulting Ventura in a California hotel lobby in 2016, Fine issued an apparent response to the video in what he wrote was a “letter to women and children” posted to his Instagram page.
    


                    “Our daughters, sisters, mothers, and wives should feel protected and loved,” he wrote. “Hold the women in your life with the upmost regard. Men who hurt women hate women.”

            Cassie Ventura, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former girlfriend, took the stand this morning in the government's sex-trafficking case against the music mogul.
    


            She entered the courtroom with her eyes facing forward, passing by the jury box to the witness stand. Combs, who was seated, turned around in his chair and watched Ventura walk to her seat. She did not appear to make eye contact with him. As she testified, Ventura dabbed her nose and eye at times.
    


            As a reminder before we get into her testimony, some of the details below are graphic. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.
    


 Here's what we learned from her testimony:

            Cassie Ventura testified that the “Freak Offs” could last 36, 48 or 72 hours, forcing her to spend  a “big chunk of her life” recovering from the drug use and dehydration.
    


                    “The ‘Freak Offs' became a job, where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again,” she said.
                





            Ventura recalled the longest “Freak Off” continued for four or more days with some breaks.
    


            The jury was dismissed for a lunch break.
    


            Cassie Ventura will return to the stand at 1 p.m. ET and continue her testimony.
    


            Cassie Ventura said that she recorded hundreds of songs, and while some of them got released, some “didn't see the light of day.”
    


            She didn't release nine of the albums that were included on her record deal. Asked how not releasing albums affected her financially, Ventura said her career was stifled.
    


            Cassie Ventura testified that she eventually moved to Los Angeles full time from New York to follow Sean “Diddy” Combs. She said he wanted to be near his kids so she went, too.
    


            “I moved because I was in love and I wanted to be near him,” Ventura said.
    


            Combs paid her rent during her time in New York, Ventura confirmed. When Combs paid the rent for places she lived, he had his own keys that he used “whenever he wanted.”
    


            Combs lived “right down the block” from Ventura's apartment in California, she said. She said she could walk or drive about three minutes to his home.
    


            Ventura said she later bought her own house in Studio City because she “wanted that freedom for myself.”
    


            “I wasn't getting it in a lot of other ways and there was no fight,” she said.
    


            Cassie Ventura described her complicated relationship with Sean “Diddy” Combs. She testified that she thought they were in a monogamous relationship, but soon realized they were not.
    


            “I didn't get that he was him — he was Puff Daddy, and Puff Daddy has many women,” Ventura said, describing how she felt jealous about seeing him with other women. “He likes the company of women, and I had to just really learn that over time, despite what he would tell me just between us.”
    


            She continued, “He made me feel like we were in a monogamous relationship more often than not. It was really me figuring out that we were not.”
    


            “He expected that of me, so I guess I assumed it was the same,” Ventura said.
    


            Cassie Ventura said Sean “Diddy” Combs would check in on what music she was working on and he would give her “busy work” on projects that never released.
    


            “I think busy work, just the way I interpreted it, was just control — control over what I was doing over every minute of the day,” she testified.
    


            Ventura said that if she didn't respond to Combs, he would call her constantly and sometimes send someone — usually his security — to her home to check on her.
    


            On a typical day, Cassie Ventura said she talked to Sean “Diddy” Combs “all day, throughout the day.” She said sometimes she wouldn't answer his calls or messages right away, and he would be an “incessant caller” or he would have his staff call until she answered.
    


            There were times Combs' assistants or security personnel would locate her for him in person, she said.
    


            Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Ventura to give an example of how Combs' moods impacted her. Ventura said Combs' mood “swung different ways quite a bit.”
    


            “The most complicated and the greatest examples are the abuse because I also felt at certain times when I knew it wasn't even about me and you make the wrong face and the next thing I knew, I was getting hit in the face,” Ventura said.
    


            Cassie Ventura said once she started dating Sean “Diddy” Combs, she broke ties with her management company, which also managed her former boyfriend.
    


            After the Miami trip, she said she fell in love with Combs.
    


            “I traveled with him everywhere. I was in studios. I was just like [his] little shadow for a little while,” she testified.
    


            Ventura said that at this point, the relationship was “fun,” describing it as her “first adult, real adult relationship.” She also noted that Combs' lifestyle was “much different” than her own.
    


            “He had assistants at his beck and call. He could get anything done quickly. He had respect from everyone. He traveled quite a bit,” Ventura said.
    


            Ventura testified that early on, she was “just enamored by him.” But later on, she began to “experience a different side of him, which was his abusive side.”
    


            She said Combs was “very controlling over my life and the things that I wanted to do, but there was still love there.”
    


            ”Control was everything from the way that I looked to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to. Control was kind of an all-around thing to a certain point,” she testified.
    


            Cassie Ventura testified that became one of Sean Combs' girlfriends after the Miami trip.
    


            “Sean Combs had many girlfriends,” Ventura said.
    


            At the time, “I knew that we were spending a lot of time together, one-on-one, and I really felt like we were in a monogamous relationship for a period,” she said.
    


            Their relationship wasn't public for years, she said, because she was his artist and because of his family.
    


            Cassie Ventura is detailing the early phase of her relationship with Sean “Diddy” Combs. After he kissed her on her 21st birthday, she said Combs began inviting her to hotel rooms in New York, where he was staying while his home was being renovated.
    


            She said they started to develop a more comfortable relationship with each other.
    


                    “I wanted to be around Sean for the same reasons as everyone else at the time — just this exciting, entertaining, fun guy that also happened to have my career in his hands,” Ventura said. “It felt special because not a lot of people got that time with him.”
                





            Ventura described herself as being sexually unexperienced at this time. During one of those New York visits, she said Combs performed oral sex on her and made her “feel crazy” for not reciprocating.
    


            “I was just so young, I didn't even have the vocabulary for some of the things that we talked about,” she testified.
    


            “I was also still in a relationship with someone else,” she added.
    


            Eventually, Combs, Ventura and other friends took a trip to Miami, she said. Ventura said she took ecstasy that Combs gave her while they were drinking and partying on a boat. Ventura said she and Combs had sex for the first time on this trip.
    


            Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Cassie Ventura how Sean “Diddy” Combs influenced her career at the time.
    


            “He called most of the shots, well all of the shots. I had a new record, I would play it for him. He chose what was next for me basically,” Ventura said.
    


            Cassie Ventura testified that she saw Sean “Diddy” Combs about once a month at social outings in 2006.
    


            In August 2007, while celebrating her 21st birthday in Las Vegas, Combs kissed her in a bathroom, Ventura said.
    


            “I was just really confused at the time,” she said, noting that she was a “young, new artist” who “just didn't really know the lay of the land when it came to things like that.”
    


            She testified that she cried and ran off.
    


            “Did you want to kiss Sean at your 21st birthday?” Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Ventura.
    


            “No, not at my 21st birthday,” Ventura said.
    


            Cassie Ventura testified that she signed a contract with Bad Boy Records, Sean “Diddy” Combs' company, in early 2006.
    


            She said that before she met Combs, she knew him as a “larger than life” music entrepreneur, and she met him when she was about 19 years old.
    


            Ventura said she had a platonic relationship with Combs in the time just after she signed with his record label. She said he looked out for her when she had a few “rough performances.”
    


            Prosecutor Emily Johnson then showed the jury a photo of Ventura and Combs together in 2006, the same year she signed her record deal.
    


            Cassie Ventura testified that she was also afraid that the “blackmail materials” would become public.
    


            She said she kept broken laptops, iPads and phones because she didn't know what material was on them.
    


            She also said, “Sean is a really polarizing person, also very charming so it's hard to be able to decide in that moment like what you need when he's telling you what he wants.”
    


            Cassie Ventura recalled on the stand when Sean “Diddy” Combs first proposed “Freak Offs” to her. She said she remembers the feeling of her stomach falling.
    


            “I also felt a sense of responsibility. It was him sharing something like that with me. I was confused, nervous but also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy so,” she said.
    


                    “I knew it wasn't something I wanted to be doing especially as regularly as it became, but again, I was just in love and wanted to make him happy,” she testified.
                





            Ventura said she didn't know how to refuse “Freak Offs.”
    


            “It got to a point where I just didn't feel like I had much of a choice, didn't really know what ‘no' could be or what ‘no' could turn into,” she said.
    


            She said Combs controlled “a lot” of her life, from her career to the way she dressed.
    


            “And I just didn't feel like I had much say in it at that time, being really super young, naive, total people pleaser,” Ventura said. “I didn't know if he would be upset enough to be violent or if he would write me off and just not want to be with me at all.”
    


            Prosecutor Emily Johnson pulled up a still image of the well-known hotel surveillance footage from the InterContinental in 2016.
    


            Cassie Ventura said the image showed her leaving after “an encounter that we called a ‘Freak Off.'”
    


            Ventura was asked how she and her former boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs started doing “Freak Offs.”
    


            “Within the first year of our relationship, he proposed this idea, this sexual encounter that he called voyeurism where he would watch me be in intercourse with a third party, specifically with another man,” she testified.
    


            Ventura went on to say that a “Freak Off” would entail “hiring an escort and setting up this experience, so that I could perform for Sean.”
    


            She said she couldn't remember where the name “Freak Off” came from, but she said that Combs introduced it to her.
    


            “Eventually it became a job for me, pretty much, so I knew if it was something he wanted me to do, I had the contacts to set it up and get a hotel room and all of that, but in the beginning, Sean set it up. He was in charge,” Ventura testified.
    


            Cassie Ventura said some of their arguments would be violent and result in “some sort of physical abuse.”
    


            “He would smash me in my head, knock me over, drag me, kick me, stomp me in the head if I was down,” Ventura said of her relationship with Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            Johnson asked, “How frequently was shear physical with you during your relationship?”
    


            “Too frequently,” Ventura said.
    


            Ventura said she suffered injuries from the abuse, including knots on her forehead, busted lips, and “bruises all over my body.”

            Prosecutor Emily Johnson showed Cassie Ventura a photo of Sean “Diddy” Combs and asked her to identify him.
    


            When asked how she knew Combs, Ventura said, “We were in a relationship for a little over 10 years.”
    


            Cassie Ventura, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former girlfriend, has now taken the stand in the government's sex-trafficking case against the music mogul.
    


            Ventura walked passed the jury box on her way to the witness stand. Prosecutor Emily Johnson will question her.
    


            Earlier today, Ventura's attorney Douglas Wigdor said she was “very ready” to take the stand, and told reporters she is “confident.”
    


            Cassie Ventura's husband, Alex Fine, just walked into the courtroom and sat next to Doug Wigdor, Ventura's attorney.
    


            Fine is staring at Combs, who just re-entered the courtroom and sat down at the defense table. Court is still on a short break, and testimony is expected to resume soon.
    


            Cassie Ventura's husband will be allowed to sit in the courtroom to support her for a portion of her testimony.
    


            Sean “Diddy” Combs' attorney Teny Geragos said the defense may need to call Alex Fine to testify about allegations that Combs raped Ventura in the summer or fall of 2018. Ventura's husband can remain in court for her testimony until the 2018 allegations come up in her testimony, the judge ruled.
    


            Ventura's husband was not on Comb's witness list. Judge Arun Subramanian says going forward, the defense must give the government more notice if they intend to make applications like this.
    


            Assistant US attorney Emily Johnson said those allegations may not come up in her direct examination until tomorrow.
    


            Defense attorney Teny Geragos is making an application that Cassie Ventura's husband be barred from the courtroom for her testimony.
    


            Geragos says that Ventura's husband may be called in Combs' defense case if certain testimony comes up when Ventura takes the stand.
    


            Geragos says the defense will not make an application to bar any other family members of Ventura from the courtroom for her testimony.
    


            She said Ventura's brother and mother are expected to be in the courtroom to support her.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian just dismissed the jury for a 10-minute break.
    


            The parties are at side bar, the next witness hasn't been called yet.
    


            Daniel Phillip, the male revue manager, has wrapped up his testimony.
    


            On redirect examination, Prosecutor Maurene Comey asked Phillip to recount his recollection of the moments after he watched Sean “Diddy” Combs drag Cassie Ventura into a bedroom and then heard what he believed to be Combs beating Ventura. He said he experienced erectile dysfunction because he was shook by the altercation.
    


            “I was completely shocked and messed up in my head, there was nothing I could do,” he said. “She was afraid I could see she was afraid.”
    


            Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson is done cross-examining Daniel Phillip.
    


            Prosecutor Maurene Comey is now questioning Phillip on redirect examination.
    


            Comey asked Phillip in quick succession to confirm who would direct him and Cassie Ventura to rub baby oil on each other, who would direct him to have sex and who would direct Ventura to give Phillip oral sex.
    


            Each time he answered “Sean Combs.”
    


            Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson is now reviewing parts of Daniel Phillip's testimony from yesterday, when prosecutors questioned him.
    


            We're not hearing any new information, as Donaldson is asking Phillip to confirm details he already said on the stand yesterday.
    


            Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson asked Daniel Phillip again about the time he saw Sean “Diddy” Combs assault Cassie Ventura at her home.
    


            Phillip confirmed that he went to Ventura's apartment after she sent him her address, and they had sex before the assault. He confirmed that she did not appear to be under the influence at the time.
    


            Phillip said Monday that after the assault Combs pushed Phillip and Ventura to continue having sex. Donaldson challenged Phillip's trial testimony with a report from a previous law enforcement interview he gave in 2023, when he told investigators that Combs told him, “Yo man, I'm going to need to deal with this, you need to get the f**k out.”
    


            On the stand, Phillip said he didn't recall telling investigators that.
    


            Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson asked Daniel Phillip again about the first day he had sex with Cassie Ventura in front of Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            Not long after he left the hotel room following their first sexual encounter, Ventura called him to ask if he'd come back that same day, Phillip testified.
    


            Phillip said he agreed to return to their hotel room at the Gramercy Park Hotel, where he and Ventura again had sex “for a few hours.” When asked, Phillip testified that Combs did not direct him and Ventura as to how they should have sex that day.
    


            Ventura also appeared sober, Phillip testified. He said he didn't see her drink alcohol or take drugs while he was with the couple. When Donaldson asked if Ventura seemed “in complete control of everything she was doing” during that encounter, Phillip testified, “I cannot say that.”
    


            Daniel Phillip, the male revue manager who testified yesterday that he was paid to have sex with Cassie Ventura on several occasions, is back on the stand. Defense Attorney Xavier Donaldson will continue questioning Phillip soon.
    


            The jury is now entering the courtroom.
    


            Defense attorney Anna Estevao told the court they intend to bring up messages between Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura when she was out of state and he was concerned she was cheating on him, and she told him she hadn't responded because she had gotten into a bar fight.
    


            Estevao said the incident demonstrates that Ventura had substance abuse issues independently of her relationship with Combs.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian overruled prosecutors' objections and allowed the incident to come into the trial.
    


            Cassie Ventura, the former girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs, could take the stand today as day two of the trial against the embattled music mogul gets underway.
    


            Ventura, who is also one of Combs' accusers, is expected to testify as a central witness for the prosecution about her years-long relationship with Combs, and her testimony could “really be the key” to the government's case, according to CNN legal analyst Jennifer Rogers.
    


                    “Sometimes prosecutors put on an FBI agent, for example, to be kind of the narrator of what happened here, but in this case, Cassie Ventura is that narrator here,” Rogers told CNN, adding that the government needs “to show that this was not just sex — this was coercion, this was a concerted plan involving not just him but a lot of other people, including people who worked for him, to bring people across state lines for these big sex parties and that it was not voluntary.”
                





            Rogers said other witnesses will serve the purpose of corroborating and adding to Ventura's story for the prosecution.
    


            Ventura is referred to as “Victim 1” in the indictment but has chosen to testify under her real name. Prosecutors claim Combs coerced her into having sex with male prostitutes during sexual performances called “Freak Offs,” according to the indictment.
    


            Combs' attorneys have said all sex was consensual.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian said he's inclined to grant the media's motion for public access to sexually explicit footage and images that are expected to be submitted as evidence, but he said he hasn't made a decision yet.
    


            Attorneys for Sean “Diddy” Combs and the prosecutors want sexually explicit videos and images sealed so that only the jury and the parties will view the material at trial.
    


            An attorney representing a media coalition advocating for public access to the exhibits spoke in court to object to the sealing of any evidence.
    


            The judge said he'd wait to rule until the parties file written responses to the coalition's motion on the docket.
    


            Two of the lead lawyers in the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial have recognizable last names, but they stand on their own.
    


            Teny Geragos, Diddy's attorney who delivered his opening statement, is the daughter of celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos, who has been in the courtroom over the past week. He told CNN he was a “helicopter dad” there to support his daughter (he is also a friend of Combs). Teny Geragos has spent most of her career as a defense lawyer and represented Keith Raniere, the founder of Nxivm who was convicted of sex trafficking.
    


            Across the aisle is Maurene Comey, a senior prosecutor on the all-female trial team. Comey is the daughter of Jim Comey, the former FBI director who also served as US attorney for the Southern District of New York (the same office that investigated Combs).
    


            Maurene Comey was a lead member of the team that successfully prosecutor Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell of sex trafficking.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is on the bench this morning for the trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            The prosecution and defense are going to address evidentiary issues before bringing in the jury to continue witness testimony this morning.
    


            Day two of the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial is getting underway, and first up we're expecting to hear from Daniel Phillip.
    


            Phillip is the prosecution's second witness. He testified he was paid to have sex with Cassie Ventura on several occasions on Monday.
    


            Today, he'll be back on the stand to continue testifying under cross-examination. Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson says he still has about an hour of cross-examination for Phillip.
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on the most serious counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
    


            As a reminder, here are some key takeaways from the first day of the trial.
    


            Cassie Ventura's attorney said she is “very ready” for today's proceedings in the trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            “She's very ready, she's confident,” Ventura's attorney Douglas Wigdor said as he arrived to the courthouse just after 8 a.m. ET. Ventura is expected to testify today.
    


            Marc Agnifilo, one of Combs' lead defense attorneys, was also seen arriving this morning.
    


            Cassie Ventura, the former girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs and one of his accusers, could take the stand today in the government's sex-trafficking case against the music mogul.
    


            Prosecutors indicated in court on Friday that they would call two witnesses before calling “Victim 1,” whose testimony will take up most of the first week. So far, the prosecution has called Los Angeles Police Officer Israel Florez and Daniel Phillip, a male revue manager, who will continue on the stand this morning.
    


Ventura, who is pregnant with her third child and due to deliver next month, is referred to as “Victim 1” in the indictment but has agreed to testify in her own name.
    


            Prosecutors allege Combs coerced her into having sex with male prostitutes, according to the indictment. Combs' attorneys have said all sex was consensual.
    


            Combs' defense team said in court they plan to argue that Ventura had a propensity for violence toward Combs during their relationship, which lasted approximately 11 years, from 2007 to 2018.
    


            Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs' trial began yesterday in New York, where he faces five counts, including one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.
    


            If convicted, he could face life in prison. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges.
    


Here's what to know from the opening statements and first witness testimonies:



Prosecution's opening statement: Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson said there was “another side” to Combs, the cultural icon, who “ran a criminal enterprise” with an inner circle of people who “helped him commit crimes and cover them up.” Here's what else she walked through:
    


Defense's opening argument: Defense attorney Teny Geragos said that while Combs takes full responsibility for his violent behavior, “domestic violence is not sex trafficking.” Here's what else Geragos said:
    


First witness testimony: Los Angeles Police Officer Israel Florez was a security official at the InterContinental Hotel in March 2016 when he got a call saying there was “a woman in distress.” Here's what he said on the stand:
    


Second witness testimony came from Daniel Phillip, who described his role as managing male strippers for women. Phillip will be back on the stand today. Here's what he said yesterday:

An improbable win in the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes should ease the pain","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/sport/dallas-mavericks-luka-doncic-cooper-flagg-analysis-spt","Tue, 13 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


Dallas Mavericks fans have spent the last few months in something akin to open rebellion against the team's front office after franchise icon Luka Dončić was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.
    


            On Monday, that all might have just become incredibly turbulent water under the bridge.
    


            The Mavs won the NBA lottery, getting the first pick in the draft and the chance to replace Dončić with Duke phenom Cooper Flagg. Going into the night with just a 1.8% shot of getting the No. 1 pick, the Mavericks might have just lucked into one of the all-time great draft shocks in sports history.
    


            Consider this: in the period after the deal, the Mavericks went 14-21, lost Anthony Davis – the main player they received in return for Dončić – for weeks due to injury in his first game with the team, lost talisman Kyrie Irving to a season-ending ACL injury and watched a slew of other players go down hurt. Davis returned as the Mavs tried to win a spot in the NBA playoffs through the play-in round but ultimately fell short.
    


            During that entire time, the fans demanded the dismissal of general manager Nico Harrison, the architect of the deal to send Dončić to the City of Angels, and pundits declared that the Mavericks had just made a potentially franchise killing move. Dončić is just 26 years old, led the team to the NBA Finals a season earlier, had been named All-NBA each year he had been in the league and was entering his prime. All reporting around the deal indicated that Dončić never planned to leave Dallas, and his emotional return to Texas indicated that the pain of the surprise move still lingers with him.
    


            All in all, it was shaping up to be a disaster of historic proportions. How far would the franchise sink after placing its hopes on the shoulders of an aging core of players who are frequently injured and watching the anticipated cornerstone of the franchise link up with LeBron James and the Lakers?

            Guess we'll never know.
    


            The impending arrival of Flagg – the widely-anticipated top pick in the draft unless Dallas and Harrison decide to shock the basketball world once again – means the Mavericks will replace Dončić with one of the game's brightest young talents.
    


            At Duke, Flagg sometimes looked like he was playing a different game than the opposition. There were few things he couldn't do, even though he was among the youngest players in the country; he didn't turn 18 until the season had already started. He averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.2 steals in 37 games for the Blue Devils, who lost in the men's Final Four to the University of Houston in the final minutes.
    


            His trophy case from his one year in the college game is staggering. He won the Naismith Award as college basketball's top player and won national player of the year by five of the six organizations that hand out the honor. He was the ACC player of the year, the ACC's rookie of the year, a consensus first-team all-American and was the East Region Outstanding Player as the Blue Devils steam rolled their way to the Final Four.
    


            “It's been a rough year as you all know,” Rolando Blackman, Mavericks ambassador and four-time NBA All-Star, said in an ESPN interview after the lottery. “We'll get a chance to move our franchise forward … It's really, really a great honor, and it's an important piece of the puzzle because we want to hoop down in Dallas.”
    


            Blackman said that Flagg “can hoop, he can play,” adding, “There's a lot of great players in that draft class … We will see how the guys get together and being able to make our team better which is exactly what we want to do.”
    


            An outstanding two-way player, Flagg will hope to fulfill Harrison's oft-repeated pledge in the wake of the Dončić trade: that defense wins championships. Dončić's relative lack of defensive prowess was the main reason that Harrison justified the trade publicly, although reports after the deal indicated there were questions about his fitness, commitment and disagreements with team personnel that helped drive a wedge between the Slovenian star and the Mavs.

            Dončić was absolutely beloved by the Mavericks fanbase – “He was ours,” Dallas fan John Tarrant told CNN Sports earlier this year. It's hard to imagine that Flagg will completely replace the 6-foot-6-inch, 230-pound, Dončić-shaped gap in the hearts of Mavs fans – at least right away.
    


            But his anticipated arrival in the Metroplex is likely to begin to quell one of the most tumultuous periods for any team in recent memory. It's enough to give a whole city a collective case of whiplash.
    


            And for Harrison – the source of the city's ire, the man who bears responsibility for the Dončić trade and became one of the most ridiculed executives in sports – it suddenly looks like an insane gamble might have paid off. If the Mavericks find themselves making a deep playoff run in a year or two, the embattled GM will likely be telling anyone within earshot: “I told you so!”
    


            Whether he'd deserve to do so is a fair question. He and his team entered Monday with a 1.8% chance of getting the top pick and got a lucky bounce which was so unlikely that online conspiracy theories were immediately created to explain it.
    


            There's no evidence of a conspiracy. Instead, it's just cemented something we already knew: the Dallas Mavericks' 2025 is going down as one of the most unlikely rollercoaster rides in sports history.
    


            Surely, Harrison is going to make the easy choice and take Flagg with the top pick. But after the last few months, it'd be hard to blame any Mavs fans for being on the edge of their seats until the teenage star's name is called by commissioner Adam Silver in Brooklyn next month.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is waging a trade war without getting approval from Congress: He declared a national emergency to slap import taxes — tariffs — on almost every country on earth.

The president is now facing at least seven lawsuits that argue he's gone too far and asserted power he does not have.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, which deals specifically with civil lawsuits involving international trade law, held the first hearing on the challenges Tuesday morning in New York. Five small businesses are asking the court to block the sweeping import taxes that Trump announced April 2 – “Liberation Day,'' he called it.

Declaring that the United States' huge and long-running trade deficits add up to a national emergency, Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEPPA) and rolled out 10% tariffs on many countries. He imposed higher– up to 50% -- “reciprocal'' tariffs on countries that sold more goods to the United States than the U.S. sold them. (Trump later suspended those higher tariffs for 90 days.)

Trump's tariffs rattled global markets and raised fears that they would disrupt commerce and slow U.S. and global economic growth.

Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the nonprofit Liberty Justice Center, said the president is exceeding the act's authority. “That statute doesn't actually say anything about giving the president the power to tariff,'' said Schwab, who is representing the small businesses. “It doesn't say the word tariff.''




In their complaint, the businesses also call Trump's emergency “a figment of his own imagination: trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency.'' The U.S. has, in fact, run a trade deficit – the gap between exports and imports – with the rest of the world for 49 straight years, through good times and bad.

But the Trump administration argues that courts approved President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEPPA.

The legal battle against Trump's tariffs has created unusual bedfellows, uniting states led by Democratic governors with libertarian groups – including the Liberty Justice Center – that often seek to overturn government regulation of businesses. A dozen states have filed suit against Trump's tariffs in the New York trade court. A hearing in that case is scheduled for May 21. 

Kathleen Claussen, a professor and trade-law expert at Georgetown Law, said Tuesday's hearing and another scheduled for the states' lawsuit in the coming weeks will likely set the tone for legal battles over tariffs to come. If the court agrees to block the tariffs under the emergency economic-powers act, the Trump administration will certainly appeal. “It strikes me probably this probably is something that has to be decided by the Supreme Court,” she said.

And if the cases do go to the Supreme Court, legal experts say, it's possible the justices will use conservative legal doctrines they cited to rein in government powers claimed by Democratic President Joe Biden administration to strike down or limit tariffs imposed by Trump, a Republican.

The U.S. Constitution gives the power to impose taxes — including tariffs — to Congress. But over the years lawmakers ceded power over trade policy to the White House, clearing the way for Trump's expansive use of tariffs. 

Some lawmakers now want to reclaim some of the authority they've given up. 

Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, for instance, have introduced legislation that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have 60 days to approve the tariffs. Otherwise, they would expire. 

But their proposal appears to stand little chance of becoming law, given most Republican lawmakers' deference to Trump and the president's veto power. “That train has left the station,'' said trade lawyer Warren Maruyama, who was general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in the administration of President George W. Bush.

For now, many American businesses are struggling to cope with Trump's tariffs, which have lifted America's average tariff to the highest level since 1934 — even after a trade truce with China was announced Monday, according to Yale University's Budget Lab. 

Victor Schwartz of New York City has spent the last 39 years building a business importing wine and spirits from small producers across the world. The tariffs are hitting his business hard. His customers want regional wines from around the world, so he can't just shift to American vintages. And the state requires him to post prices a month in advance so it's tough to keep up with Trump's ever-changing tariffs.

His business — V.O.S. Selections — is one of the five plaintiffs in Tuesday's hearing. “It's a race against time,” he said. “Will we get through it? I'm not sure exactly.”

The Minnesota Vikings get a double dip of international play in 2025 with trips to both Ireland and Britain as the NFL features a record seven overseas kickoffs this season, including forays into Germany and Spain.

The Vikings will play the Pittsburgh Steelers at Croke Park in Dublin on Sept. 28 in Ireland's first NFL regular season game, and then they'll fly over to London to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium a week later on Oct. 5.

“Our experiences in London have always been memorable, so to return in 2025 as the first team to play in back-to-back international games in different countries was something we could not pass up,” Vikings owner Mark Wilf said.

The Vikings are 8-0 in international games, including 4-0 in the regular season. The Vikings and Browns also played in London in 2017, the last time the Vikings were scheduled to visit Cleveland. That means they're going to go 24 years between trips to Cleveland, with the next on in 2033.

The matchups were revealed on Tuesday by the NFL, the second in a series of announcements of notable games on each of the league's broadcasters ahead of the full schedule release on Wednesday night.

That's also when the league will announce the Los Angeles Chargers' opponent and broadcast carrier for its first international game of the season in Brazil, on Sept. 5 at Corinthians Stadium in Sao Paulo. That's where the Philadelphia Eagles began their Super Bowl quest last year with a game against the Green Bay Packers on opening weekend.




In other international games, the Denver Broncos visit the New York Jets on Oct. 12 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London; the Los Angeles Rams visit the Jacksonville Jaguars a week later at Wembley Stadium in London; the Atlanta Falcons visit the Indianapolis Colts on Nov. 9 at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin; and the Washington Commanders visit the Miami Dolphins on Nov. 16 at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.

This marks the 14th game in London for the Jaguars, as part of the team's multi-year commitment to playing games in Britain. Overall, the NFL has played 39 regular season games in London.

The six international matchups that were announced will all be on NFL Network and streamed on NFL+.

The Colts-Falcons game in Berlin is the fifth regular season NFL game in Germany. Previous games have been played in Munich and Frankfurt.

Peter O'Reilly, NFL executive vice president of club business and league events, said the largest-ever slate of international games “underscores our collective commitment to global growth as we continue our journey to becoming a truly global sport.”

Also Tuesday, the NFL revealed on “Good Morning America” that the Super Bowl champion Eagles will play the Packers in Green Bay on Monday Night Football on Nov. 10. The rest of the MNF lineup will be announced Wednesday.

The Week 10 game at Lambeau Field pits the teams at the center of the tush push debate this offseason. Green Bay has proposed a ban on the Eagles' short-yardage tactic, calling for the NFL to outlaw the quarterback sneak where teammates push him from behind. The issue is expected to be debated at the league's spring meeting next week.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Democrats have long focused on immigration when courting Latino voters in states like Arizona, Nevada, New Jersey, and Florida, where generations of Mexican, Cuban and other Latin American immigrants have settled and gained permanent legal status. 

But Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election and the rightward shift of Latino voters have some liberals reconsidering traditional wisdom.

“People do care about it, but they don't vote on it. They vote on the economy,” said Patricia Campos-Medina, a labor activist who ran for the U.S. Senate last year in New Jersey and is now advising U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, one of the Democrats running for governor in next month's primary. 

Liberal strategists, organizers and some politicians are urging Democrats to focus on the economy in this year's elections rather than on immigration. Some argue a broad economic message would be more effective with the wide range of nationalities and experiences in the Latino community rather than customized efforts based on perceived cultural or political interests. 

Last year, Trump, a Republican, made inroads in heavily Puerto Rican areas of eastern Pennsylvania and turned South Texas' Rio Grande Valley while improving his numbers along Florida's Interstate 4 corridor. His message to Latinos focused heavily on the economy and border security.

“Latino operatives have been saying, ‘Don't treat us all as a monolith,'” said Tory Gavito, who co-founded Way to Win, a progressive group formed after Trump's 2016 win that recently conducted focus groups with Latinos who skipped the 2024 election. “They were pretty monolithic.”

Inflation was top of mind for nearly half of Latinos who voted last fall, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the 2024 electorate. About three-quarters of Latino Trump voters were very concerned about housing costs in their community, compared with about 6 in 10 white Trump voters.

“Where we fell short was failing to fully appreciate the bread-and-butter economic issues that were driving them,” said Tom Perez, a former Democratic National Committee chair who advised President Joe Biden. He is now co-chair of the American Bridge 21st Century, a group that does opposition research on Republicans. “Many folks felt like we were too focused on identity politics and not focused enough on the cost of eggs, the cost of gas, the cost of living.”

Alex Berrios, co-founder of the organizing group Mi Vecino, which mobilizes Latino voters in Florida, Arizona and Maine, said Democrats focused too much on using buzzwords and trying to micro-target specific nationalities. The result, he argues, left voters feeling as though the party's message was staged.

“It's like they were saying, ‘Let me get my Venezuelan script out,'” Berrios said. “No. The first thing is just be relatable.”

Chuck Rocha is a Democratic strategist who mobilized Latinos for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential bid in 2020 and for U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego last year and started a super political action committee, or PAC, to reach out to Latinos in key races. He argued that Democrats “mess up by bringing a policy book to a boxing match.”

“It's about three things: affordability, affordability, affordability,” he said. “Affordability is the only thing that they care about because that's what's hitting them in the face every day.”

New Jersey's primary for governor is an early test of the different Democratic points of view. Last year, Trump flipped two Hispanic-majority towns that he had lost by more than 30 and 50 percentage points in 2016. Democrat Kamala Harris won a traditionally blue state by just 6 percentage points, the closest presidential contest there since 2004.

Sherrill, who flipped a longtime Republican district in winning her House seat in 2018, has focused on her biography and her military service while also arguing she will stand up to Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk. One of her ads promises she will “drive down costs from health care to housing.”

Her campaign manager, Alex Ball, outlined during the weekend in a memo that one of its goals is meeting in person Hispanic voters from two suburban counties who have voted in three of the four past Democratic primaries. 

“There is a real risk of a Republican winning in November, but Mikie is the candidate who can win just like she has won tough elections before, even driving out a long-time Republican incumbent in a Trump district — something no one thought was possible,” Ball wrote. 

Meanwhile, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has frequently campaigned against U.S. immigration authorities' plans to open a detention facility in his city. The mayor was arrested by immigration authorities on Friday while demonstrating outside, with video of his detention and release spreading widely and leading to his competitors in the Democratic primary rallying to his side. 

A May AP-NORC poll found that 38% of Hispanic adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, which is roughly in line with U.S. adults overall. 

But there's growing unease as Trump's plans to revive manufacturing and reshape the global economy have been rolled out with constant changes, creating uncertainty and sparking concerns of prices rising and products disappearing from shelves. From January through March, the economy shrank for the first time in three years as businesses were disrupted by Trump's trade wars. Trump fired thousands of federal workers, with impacts felt outside of Washington.

The Libre Initiative, a Koch Network-affiliated conservative group, is running ads targeting Latinos in support of tax breaks approved during Trump's first term that may expire at year's end.

Daniel Garza, president of the group, acknowledged “nervousness” among Latino voters, with some wondering if maybe Trump took on too much and too fast. But Garza said that it's too soon to make a fair assessment of his second term, which began in January. 

He argues voters should wait and see how Trump negotiates trade and whether the Republican Party can pass his “big, beautiful bill” with both tax breaks and spending cuts and promises he made such as exempting tips, overtime and Social Security from taxation.

“My sense is that Latinos are a very patient lot,” he said. “Aguantamos mucho.”

That is Spanish for “We put up with a lot.”

The famous red carpet of Cannes Film Festival is rolled out at the Palais, ready to welcome stars for the 78th edition. (May 13)



























































CANNES, France (AP) — The 78th Cannes Film Festival opened Tuesday with expectations running high for what could be a banner edition.

All of the ingredients — an absurd number of stars, top-tier filmmakers, political intrigue — seem to be lined up for the French Riviera spectacular. Over the next 12 days, Cannes will play host to megawatt premieres including those of “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” Spike Lee's “Highest 2 Lowest” and Ari Aster's “Eddington.”

Things get underway Tuesday with an opening ceremony that drew Quentin Tarantino (who'll pay tribute to Western filmmaker George Sherman on Wednesday), Eva Longoria, Heidi Klum and others to Cannes' famous red carpet.

The opening day festivities included an honorary Palme d'Or for Robert De Niro, the opening night film, Amélie Bonnin's French romance “Leave One Day,” a three-film salute to Ukraine and the introduction of the jury that will decide the Palme d'Or, headed by Juliette Binoche. 

Cannes is coming off a 2024 festival that produced a number of eventual Oscar contenders, including “Emilia Pérez,” “The Substance,” “Flow” and the best picture winner, “Anora. That film's director, Sean Baker, returned Tuesday for the opening ceremony. (He's a producer on a film in the Cannes parallel section Critics Week.) 

Asked if he's feeling the pressure this time around, festival director Thierry Frémaux said the only kind of pressure he believes in is in beer. (Beer on tap in France is “bière à la pression.”)




“Indeed last year was a beautiful year,” Frémaux said Monday. “But at the very time when I was with (journalists) as the festival started, we didn't know if it was going to be a good year or not.”

Cannes is kicking off the same day Gérard Depardieu, one of France's most famous actors, was found guilty of having sexually assaulted two women on a 2021 film set. In one of France's most prominent #MeToo cases, Depardieu was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence. The 76-year-old has long been a regular presence at Cannes. 

This year's Cannes Film Festival, the premier international cinematic gathering, is also unspooling following U.S. President Donald Trump's call for tariffs on movies made overseas. While Frémaux expressed sympathy for the cause of strengthening local movie production, he said it was too soon to comment on the still-unformed plans.

“I don't know what to say, really, about that,” Binoche told reporters Tuesday when asked about the tariffs. “We can see that he's fighting and trying in many different ways to save America and save his ass.”

Along with Binoche, the other eight jurors include Halle Berry and Jeremy Strong, who was unable to attend Cannes last year for the premiere of his Trump film “The Apprentice.” Strong referenced that film, which led to his first Oscar nomination, in his comments on the American president Tuesday. 

“Truth is under assault,” said Strong. “Specifically at this temple of film, the role of film is increasingly critical because it can combat those forces in the entropy of truth, and can communicate truths, individual truths, human truths, societal truths, and affirm and celebrate our shared humanity.”

Jake Coyle has covered the Cannes Film Festival since 2012. To prepare for this year, he practiced eating crepes on the run and interviewed filmmakers on three continents who are in competition for Cannes' top honor, the Palme d'Or. 

Berry, responding to Cannes' new protocols on attire for the red carpet, said she had “an amazing dress” with a long train for the opening ceremony but will wear something else instead. Cannes has outlawed nudity and dresses with long trains for its evening premieres at the Palais. 

“I had to make a pivot,” said Berry. “But the nudity part, I do think is probably also a good rule.”

Cannes will follow up Tuesday's festivities with the return Wednesday of Tom Cruise. Three years after he brought “Top Gun: Maverick” to the festival, he's back with the latest “Mission: Impossible” movie.

Twenty-two films will vie for Cannes' top prize, the Palme d'Or, to be presented May 24. Those films include Wes Anderson's “The Phoenician Scheme,” Richard Linklater's “Nouvelle Vague,” Lynne Ramsay's “Die, My Love,” Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value,” Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind,” Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound,” Julia Ducournau's “Alpha” and Jafar Panahi's “A Simple Accident.”

In Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, three prominent actors are making their directorial debuts: Harris Dickinson (“Urchin”), Kristen Stewart (“The Chronology of Water”) and Scarlett Johansson (“Eleanor the Great”).

Geopolitics are likely to play a starring role at Cannes, which is beginning by screening three 2025 Ukraine documentaries: “Zelensky,” Bernard-Henri Lévy's “Notre Guerre” and The Associated Press-Frontline coproduction “2000 Meters to Andriivka,” by “20 Days in Mariupol” Oscar winner Mstyslav Chernov.

“This ‘Ukraine Day' is a reminder of the commitment of artists, authors and journalists to tell the story of this conflict in the heart of Europe,” the festival said in a statement.

On Tuesday, more than 350 filmmakers, actors and others in the film industry — including Richard Gere, Pedro Almodovar, Javier Bardem, Viggo Mortensen and Mark Ruffalo, published an open letter in the French newspaper Libération and in Variety calling on cinema institutions to more forcefully respond to what they called “genocide in Gaza.” 

ACID, a Cannes parallel section, includes the documentary “Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk.” It's about Fatma Hassona, a 25-year-old Palestinian photojournalist who was killed the day after the selection of the documentary was announced in April. 

“Why is it that cinema, a breeding ground for socially committed works, seems to be so indifferent to the horror of reality and the oppression suffered by our sisters and brothers?” the letter read.

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa will not attend an Arab League summit in Iraq this week and the country's delegation will be headed by the foreign minister, the president's office said Tuesday.

A short statement released by the office of President Ahmad al-Sharaa did not give a reason why he will not attend the summit but an invitation by the Iraqi government last month trigged sharp political divisions in Iraq. The summit is scheduled to be held in Baghdad on Saturday.

Al-Sharaa and his interim government in Syria have been scrambling to establish ties with countries across the Middle East in a bid to ease skepticism about his former ties to al-Qaida and to convince Washington to lift crippling economic sanctions on the battered country.

Attending the Arab Summit would have been a major symbolic diplomatic victory for Damascus as well, as Al-Sharaa struggles to deal with opponents in the countries, largely from non-Sunni Muslim minority groups, as he tries to exert state authority across Syria.

Al-Sharaa took power after leading a lightning rebel offensive that unseated his predecessor, Bashar Assad, in December. Since then, he has positioned himself as a statesman aiming to unite and rebuild his country after nearly 14 years of civil war, but his past as a Sunni Islamist militant has left many — including Shiite groups in Iraq — wary.

Formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, al-Sharaa joined the ranks of al-Qaida insurgents battling U.S. forces in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq.

During Syria's conflict that began in March 2011, several Iraqi Shiite militias fought alongside Assad's forces, making al-Sharaa a particularly sensitive figure for them.

The sheriff in New Mexico's most populous county is crediting his department's drone program for helping disarm two children and prevent what could have been a worse outcome. The Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office recently released drone footage showing a tense standoff in February with two young brothers — ages 7 and 9.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The sheriff in New Mexico's most populous county is crediting his department's drone program for helping disarm two children and prevent what could have been a worse outcome. 

The Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office recently released drone and body camera footage showing a tense standoff in February with two young brothers — ages 7 and 9. The deputies are heard repeatedly urging the boys to drop the gun. 

“Put it down, baby,” one of them says as other deputies say they need to keep talking to the boys. 

Deputies used a non-lethal round to distract the boys before moving in. At one point, Sheriff John Allen said one of the boys raised the gun and pulled the trigger, but it malfunctioned.

Allen said the drone provided a critical vantage point to help deputies assess the situation in real time, allowing them to safely and swiftly secure the area.

No charges have been filed. Authorities have instead been working since the standoff to get the family access to trauma therapy, medical services, behavioral support and even prepaid grocery cards. 

Prior to responding that day to a report of children playing with a loaded handgun, deputies had been called to the home at least 50 times for issues with the boys and their family.

Allen used the Feb. 16 incident as an example of the ongoing challenges law enforcement is facing. 

“This case illustrates the complex intersection of juvenile crime, mental health and public safety,” Allen said in a statement issued Thursday. “We are taking important steps to close service gaps and expand our ability to work with juveniles involved in firearms or violent crimes.”




New Mexico has had several cases of violence involving young suspects, including a fatal hit-and-run in Albuquerque and a shooting in Las Cruces in March that killed three and wounded 15 others. Prosecutors, law enforcement and Republican lawmakers have been asking Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to call a special legislative session to address the state's crime problem.

Independent Women's Forum economic policy director Patrice Onwuka on the GOP's hopes to pass the 'big, beautiful bill' and what to expect from upcoming inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

House Republicans are moving to put stricter work requirements on food stamps in a bid to cut government waste and find taxpayer savings for President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill.""

Cobbling the vast piece of legislation together takes coordination by 11 different House committees, each working on a portion of it under their panel's jurisdiction.

The portion released on Monday night would raise the upper age limit for work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), from certain able-bodied adults up to age 54 to those up to age 64.

Whereas the current rules exempt people with dependents under age 18, the new provision would now include SNAP recipients with children above age 7 who otherwise qualify for work requirements.

The House Agriculture Committee, which oversees federal food programs in addition to America's farmers, was tasked with finding $230 billion in spending cuts out of a sum total of $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion dollars – cuts that conservatives had demanded to offset the cost of Trump's other priorities.

""For far too long, the SNAP program has drifted from a bridge to support American households in need to a permanent destination riddled with bureaucratic inefficiencies, misplaced initiatives, and limited accountability,"" Committee Chairman Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., said in a statement.

""This portion of the One Big, Beautiful Bill restores the program's original intent, offering a temporary helping hand while encouraging work, cracking down on loopholes exploited by states, and protecting taxpayer dollars while supporting the hardworking men and women of American agriculture."" 

The legislation also would eventually have the states cover some SNAP costs. Currently, the federal government fully covers SNAP costs for all 50 states and half the states' administrative costs to run it.

The new bill would impose a 5% baseline benefit cost share for all states, beginning in 2028. States with higher rates of erroneous payments would pay more as well.

It would also lower the ""match rate"" for which the government reimburses states for those administrative costs, from 50% to 25%.

Fox News Digital first reported in late February that Republicans were looking to heighten work requirements for food stamps via reconciliation, when similar legislation was introduced by Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., a member of the Agriculture panel.

House and Senate Republicans are working on advancing Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process this year. 

Reconciliation allows the party controlling both houses of Congress and the White House to move a massive piece of legislation, provided it addresses budgetary matters like spending, taxes or the national debt.

It makes that possible by lowering the Senate's passage threshold from 60 votes to 51, lining up with the House's own simple majority threshold – meaning Democrats are completely sidelined in the process.

Trump wanted Republicans to craft a bill advancing his priorities on the border, immigration, taxes, energy, defense and raising the debt limit.

The House Agriculture Committee, along with two other top committees, are advancing their own portions of the bill on Tuesday.

When that is done, all 11 House committees that have crafted individual reconciliation pieces will put them together into a massive bill, identical versions of which must pass the House and Senate before reaching Trump's desk.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wants the House to finish its portion of the effort by Memorial Day.

Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier reflects on shifting relations in the Middle East since President Donald Trump's first visit to the region on 'Special Report.'

President Donald Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for his first major overseas trip since retaking office, hoping to secure major deals on trade and diplomatic breakthroughs across the Middle East. 

The president is now expected to meet with Syria's interim president on Wednesday, with some analysts predicting the meeting could result in a big diplomatic win for Trump.

""This is a historic opportunity, and it would be a shame if the U.S. lost it,"" Natasha Hall, senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Fox News Digital.

President Trump seems open to renewed relations with Syria, including the possibility of lifting crippling sanctions imposed under the previous regime of Bashar al-Assad.

""We may take them off of Syria, because we want to give them a fresh start,"" President Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.

The president added that ""we want to see if we can help them out"" and that a determination on Syria sanctions will be made at some point.

""Syria now, for the first time, has a government in power that is not only no longer reliant on Iran to survive but is quite hostile to Iran, and so that would be a big opportunity lost if the U.S. didn't step up,"" Hall added.

Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a non-profit helping to bring democracy to Syria, recently met with Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Damascus. 

Moustafa exclusively told Fox News Digital that the two spoke for over three hours about a potential breakthrough in U.S.-Syrian relations, which have been severed since 2011 following the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, which led to the deaths of over 500,000 people.

Moustafa and others are pushing for a meeting between al-Sharaa and President Trump during his visit to the Gulf this week. For Syria's new government, this will be their opportunity to persuade the new administration to do business with a country coming out of a devastating 14-year civil war and mend ties with a leader who was once aligned with the Islamic State and al Qaeda.

""Syria's objectives are quite clear on why they would want to meet President Trump in Saudi Arabia, to make headway on some of these core issues of cooperation and to alleviate any of the concerns the White House may have. And some of the things they've been trying to do is to show that they can be cooperative on intelligence issues, on business, and talking about companies seeking to do business in Syria,"" CSIS' Hall said.

SYRIA'S NEW REGIME HITS HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON OVER CLAIMS ITS FIGHTERS WERE EXECUTED

Yet others urge caution. ""Right now, Sharaa is not restricting political and civil liberties, but he's an authoritarian by nature."" former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told Fox News Digital.

Ford, who was the last U.S. ambassador in Damascus, was pulled from the embassy in October 2011 after the Syrian uprising turned violent. Ford led the effort to put al-Sharaa on the terrorist list in 2012 and said, although he is pragmatic, he is leading an extremely weak government.

""He doesn't control all of Syria yet. The government in Damascus that he leads is not very strong, and it will take time to reassert all of its authority over Syria,"" Ford said. 

Ford does not believe al-Sharaa will pursue terrorism as he did in the past, but while there have been some promising developments since taking power, the U.S. must keep its expectations relatively low.

""Syria is so weak, militarily and economically, with lots of internal political divisions. Therefore, it's not going to be in a position to sign huge arrangements with the U.S.,"" Ford cautioned.

A senior official in the Syrian Foreign Ministry told Fox News Digital that President al-Sharaa emphasizes ""that the new Free Syria seeks to establish a strong strategic relationship with the United States, one grounded in mutual interests and shared partnership.""

The senior official added that ""Damascus sees U.S. President Donald Trump as the leader most capable of achieving peace in the Middle East,"" noting that Syria hopes to become an active and influential ally to Washington on regional issues.

Moustafa also met with members of the National Security Council and conveyed the Syrian president's desire for a new partnership. 

The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.

The new Syrian leader has already shown a willingness to cooperate on some key issues important to the U.S. The new Syrian government has cooperated with U.S. intelligence agencies and foiled several ISIS plots to attack Damascus. Syrian intelligence services also arrested ISIS commander Abu al-Harith al-Iraqi in February.

Moustafa also said that al-Sharaa was worried about the massive buildup of Iranian-backed militias along the Iraqi side of the Syrian border. This is a worry for the U.S. as well as the Trump administration, he said, as it has been looking to reengage with Iran to curb its nuclear program.

In al-Sharaa's eyes, the deal of the century would bring peace to Syria and its neighbors, including Israel. Moustafa added the deal would keep China, Russia and Iran out and allow U.S. troops to go home in the right way.

Yet critics warn a potential deal with the United States is not without its obstacles.

Al-Sharaa led the Islamist rebel group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to victory over the Assad dictatorship in December. He had a $10 million bounty for his capture that was lifted in February amidst the administration's efforts to talk to the new Syrian government.

HTS is still a designated foreign terrorist organization, which complicates doing business in Syria.

""The question at hand is whether to believe that a change in behavior, following the fall of the regime, translates into a more permanent change in character, ideology, and governance,"" Caroline Rose, director of The New Lines Institute, told Fox News Digital.

Rose, who recently traveled to Syria, noted that while HTS has been incrementally breaking away from affiliations with terrorist organizations and has adopted some moderate elements over time, there are still doubts that this will ""stick,"" particularly with recent sectarian tensions.

""Skeptics of lifting restrictions on Syria immediately fear that any move could be too premature and could risk the U.S.' credibility among its regional counterparts,"" Rose added.

Since becoming president, al-Sharaa has formed a transitional government composed of close allies from the HTS rebel group and a mix of technocrats, former opposition leaders, civil society activists and even some former members of the Assad government. 

The temporary constitution signed by al-Sharaa in March guarantees basic freedoms such as freedoms of opinion, expression and the press. It also protects women's rights and promises equal rights for all Syrians regardless of ethnicity, religious sect or gender, yet it still leaves the country under Islamist rule during the transitional process.

There remain some concerns over the power concentrated in the hands of the president. The president can unilaterally declare a state of emergency and suspend basic rights if national security is threatened.

The vast powers granted to the executive in the new constitution is a reminder for many Syrians of the authoritarian past many suffered at the hands of the Assad regime for over 50 years.

Although there is a new sense of optimism within Syrian society about its future, civil peace and security remain elusive.

Deadly sectarian clashes in March launched by remnants of the former Assad regime in Syria's coastal region led to the deaths of 200 members of the security forces. Forces allied with the government and armed civilians responded with brute force. The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported that these groups were responsible for the deaths of at least 396 people.

Tensions have also escalated with Syria's Druze population as well, highlighting the delicate balance of Syria's complex ethnic divides and the new authority's ability to control various armed factions.

‘The Big Weekend Show' panel discusses the mainstream media's series of pieces on Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa.

On border security, support for Israel and diplomacy with President Donald Trump, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has bucked the Democratic Party on key issues since assuming office in 2022. 

A string of media reports emerged this month detailing Fetterman's alleged cognitive decline and waning support within the Democratic Party. A New York Magazine report sparked questions about Fetterman's mental stability. Subsequent reports by the Associated Press, detailing an outburst during a union meeting, and by Politico, which indicated he is losing traction among Pennsylvania Democrats, were slammed by several of his Capitol Hill colleagues as a coordinated smear campaign.

In an era of partisan politics, Fetterman has embraced bipartisanship with newly elected Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa. When McComrick was elected in November, the Pennsylvanians traded jabs for joint dinners as Fetterman built his reputation for being willing to reach across the aisle. Fetterman also met with Trump's controversial Cabinet picks and worked with Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., to pass the Laken Riley Act this year. 

While Fetterman, who suffered a stroke during his 2022 Senate campaign, shut down questions about his mental fitness amid the relentless reports, it's not the first time a Democrat has been targeted after falling out of line with the party. 

LEAKS TO MEDIA ABOUT FETTERMAN ARE A COORDINATED SMEAR CAMPAIGN, HILL COLLEAGUES SAY

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., faced the ire of the Democratic Party earlier this year when he joined Fetterman in voting to pass the Republicans' spending bill and avoid a government shutdown. Schumer, currently Senate minority leader, was slammed by progressive Democrats while the future of party leadership hangs in the balance. 

DEMOCRATIC SENATOR SAYS THERE ‘NEEDS TO BE SPACE' FOR FETTERMAN IN PARTY AS REPUBLICANS COME TO HIS DEFENSE

Former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., was once a Democrat but later registered as an independent. While she continued to caucus with her party, Sinema ruffled liberal feathers by opposing efforts to eliminate the filibuster rule and opposed former President Joe Biden's ""Build Back Better"" plan.

In 2022, Sinema said she was leaving the party, adding that ""nothing will change about my values or my behavior.""

Sinema became the first senator to switch parties since the late Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter – then Republican – famously announced that ""my change in party will enable me to be re-elected"" in 2009.

Soon after Sinema came now-former West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Long seen as a moderate thorn in the side of the increasingly liberal Democrats, Manchin often clashed with his former party on environmental issues, given the Mountain State's reliance on the fossil fuel industry.

Things came to a head in Charleston when then-Gov. Jim Justice held up his bulldog Babydog backward in the legislative chamber and told actress Bette Midler – who had trashed the state over one of Manchin's such votes – to ""kiss her heinie.""

Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard was once considered a rising star in the Democratic Party until her comments and behavior drew the ire of party elders like Hillary Clinton. The anti-interventionist Gabbard, who had appeared in the Moscow media, was anonymously slammed by Clinton in 2019 when she said that ""somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary"" was a ""favorite of the Russians."" An advisor later said Gabbard was the figure in question.

Since then, Gabbard has gone on to make a full partisan 180, becoming a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet.

During Rep. Nancy Pelosi's, D-Calif., historic speakership, another Democrat famously bucked the party and ultimately retired soon after trying to proverbially oust the queen.

North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler became disaffected by the liberal progression of the party and mounted an unsuccessful challenge to Pelosi's leadership role after Democrats suffered massive losses in the 2010 midterms.

Shuler, a former then-Washington Redskins quarterback, had been the leader of the moderate Blue Dog Democrat caucus when he took aim at the speakership.

Fetterman's office did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

FDNY Boxing Club head trainer Mike Reno and FDNY boxer James Gennari join ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss the second annual ‘Battle of the Badges,' a non-profit amateur boxing event where firefighters and police officers go head-to-head in the ring.

President Donald Trump criticized former President Joe Biden's administration on Monday for allowing ""lawlessness to permeate our country"" while announcing Peace Officers Memorial Day and police week.

Trump proclaimed Thursday as Peace Officers Memorial Day, continuing a 63-year tradition of honoring fallen officers on May 15. He also declared this week as National Police Week, beginning this past Sunday and going through Saturday.

""This week and always, we honor the courageous men and women serving in law enforcement and memorialize those who sacrificed their lives defending the thin blue line,"" he wrote in the proclamation.

In the presidential action, Trump also called out the Biden administration for its ""reckless, soft-on-crime policies,"" which he said made it harder for police officers to do their jobs.

""A nation in chaos ceases to be a citadel of liberty. Tragically, the previous administration allowed lawlessness to permeate our country, making it harder for our law enforcement officers to do their jobs,"" the president wrote in the order. ""Their reckless, soft-on-crime policies emboldened criminals and thugs; wreaked havoc on the sanctity of our homes, businesses, and public spaces; instilled fear; and jeopardized public trust.""

Trump continued by saying he is fulfilling the promises that he campaigned on to make America safe again, including taking authority at the border and ""restoring the rule of law in communities nationwide.""

He also said that under his administration, all available resources will be utilized to ensure that officers will be equipped and trained to be the best they can be, qualified officers will be retained and recruiting will focus ""on the basis of meritocracy.""

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW COPS WE HAVE THEIR BACKS 

Trump also called on Congress to codify his executive order mandating the death penalty for those who murder a police officer and to pass a bill enhancing protections for police officers.

Former President Joe Biden's advisers privately discussed Biden using a wheelchair if he won reelection in 2024.

According to the book Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios's Alex Thompson, scheduled for release on May 20, advisers were fully aware by 2023 of Biden's deteriorating health, which was even worse than believed by outsiders. Biden's physician, Kevin O'Connor, reportedly suggested he use a wheelchair if conditions worsen, something Biden's advisers believed would be political suicide if done before the election.

“Biden's physical deterioration — most apparent in his halting walk — had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election,” the authors wrote, according to an excerpt obtained by Axios.

“Given Biden's age, [his physician Kevin O'Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,” they wrote.

The book is based on interviews with over 200 people, mainly Democratic insiders with knowledge of events. Nearly all took place after the 2024 election.

The book also alleged that Biden aides lied about the reason for the president's awkward gait when they claimed throughout 2024 it was a result of him fracturing his foot in November 2020 and refusing to wear his walking boot past a certain point. The claim contradicted O'Connor's assessment in 2021 that “both small fractures of his foot are completely healed” and that “this injury has healed as expected.”

The primary reason for Biden's labored stride was “significant spinal arthritis,” a problem that led to aides changing his schedule.

The book revealed that Biden's infamous fall in June 2023 at the Air Force Academy, a fall mocked by President Donald Trump and his allies, was more severe than previously thought.

The authors wrote that Biden's aides constantly argued with O'Connor, who was demanding more time for Biden to rest. He often quipped that the then-president's aides were trying to kill him.

On physical deterioration, a Biden spokesperson who declined to be identified told Axios in a statement that Biden didn't require any special treatment for his gait and that it hadn't worsened.

“He was transparent about this, and it was far from ‘severe,'” according to the statement. “Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.”

“And so far,” it continued, “we are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite — he was a very effective president.”

However, other sections of the book allege that severe mental decline had been observed by aides since at least 2022. One senior aide who quit the White House over the belief that Biden shouldn't run for reelection told Tapper and Thompson, “We attempted to shield him from his own staff, so many people didn't realize the extent of the decline beginning in 2023,” according to the Guardian.

“I love Joe Biden. When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him. Still, it was a disservice to the country and to the party for his family and advisers to allow him to run again,” the aide added.

Other Democrats were less charitable.

BIDEN COMEBACK TOUR ISN'T HELPING THE DEMOCRATS

“It was an abomination. He stole an election from the Democratic Party; he stole it from the American people,” a prominent Democratic strategist said of the former president's drive to seek reelection.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was also heavily critical of Biden, warning him in a July visit to his Delaware home that if he lost to Trump, 50 years of “amazing, beautiful work goes out the window. But it's worse than that — you will go down in American history as one of the darkest figures.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Josh Hawley, drawing red line on Medicaid, is noncommittal on House's Trump megabill","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3408999/josh-hawley-drawing-red-line-medicaid-is-noncommittal-trump-megabill/","Tue, 13 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The Senate's loudest Republican defender of Medicaid is keeping his powder dry on the House GOP's “big, beautiful bill.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), whose support is crucial for Trump's legislative agenda but is contingent on preserving Medicaid, wants to see what House Republicans can muster with their thin majority first.

“Let's see what they actually pass,” Hawley told the Washington Examiner on Monday evening. “Let's see what it actually comes out to, what the details are. I'm against anything that's a cut.”

The proposal, which the House Energy and Commerce Committee will debate and possibly alter on Tuesday, includes $715 billion in cuts over the next decade to Medicaid and Obamacare. It's a significantly pared-back version of initial proposals to slash Medicaid benefits alone by more than $800 billion. The current version amounts to a compromise between swing-district centrists opposed to steep reductions and conservative fiscal hawks wanting to use reductions to help offset Trump's economic policies and tax cuts.

Still, the text includes de facto cuts that, if passed, would be sent to the Senate, where Hawley and other Senate Republicans are seeking to safeguard the government-subsidized health insurance program that covers some 80 million poor adults and children. The legislation is packaged in a so-called budget reconciliation bill that would only require a simple majority to pass the Senate.

Hawley described the “move away” from more drastic cuts previously floated by fiscal hawks as a positive sign. And he suggested stricter work requirements were acceptable. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's early analysis that 8.6 million people could lose coverage because of the various changes appeared to give Hawley pause.

“My position on that is, I'm against cutting Medicaid benefits, and specifically Medicaid benefits in the state of Missouri. So let's see where the House gets to on that,” he said.

The proposal includes work, education, or volunteer requirements of at least 80 hours per month for able-bodied beneficiaries; more frequent verification of income and residency eligibility; a freeze on an arrangement that allows states to boost federal Medicaid funding by taxing healthcare providers; and increasing co-payments by up to $35 for those above the federal poverty line.

Federal Medicaid spending has skyrocketed since the expansion of eligibility under former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Total Medicaid spending was $333 billion in fiscal 2008, before Obama became president, and jumped to $860 billion by 2023. The federal share of the costs also increased from 60% to 72% in that time frame, according to analysis from the Paragon Health Institute.

Democrats lambasted policies that they said would “eviscerate” the program.

“Republicans promised for months that they would protect Medicaid,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said. “But now Americans know the truth: Republicans never intended to keep that promise, and this confirms it.”

In a New York Times op-ed published Monday morning that appeared to be written in the days prior to the House GOP's bill release, Hawley penned a scathing rebuke warning his party that Medicaid cuts would be “morally wrong and politically suicidal.”

“Republicans need to open their eyes: Our voters support social insurance programs. More than that, our voters depend on those programs,” Hawley wrote. “And there's a reason for this that Republicans would do well to ponder. Our economy is increasingly unfriendly to working people and their families.”

With only three defectors to spare, Senate Republicans can't afford to lose Hawley. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) is opposed because he said the bill, which also deals with border security, taxes, and energy, failed to go far enough on spending cuts. Libertarian Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a deficit hawk, is an expected opponent. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) also conveyed hesitation.

HOUSE GOP ROLLS OUT MEDICAID PLAN COMPROMISE WITH STRICTER REQUIREMENTS

Centrist Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are also vital to win over, both having offered similar cautions as Hawley not to gut Medicaid.

Collins told the Washington Examiner on Monday evening she'd yet to examine the legislation. Murkowski was optimistic about the changes involving how states tax healthcare providers because she said Alaska likely wouldn't be affected.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday will hold its markup of the proposal, the first step to cementing the Medicaid changes into the “big beautiful bill” Congress seeks to complete by the Fourth of July.

President Donald Trump promised to declassify and release thousands of pages of documents related to the hottest topics in the Make America Great Again online world: Jeffrey Epstein files, President John F. Kennedy assassination secrets, Russiagate smoking guns, and more.

Months later, most of the records remain snarled in layers of bureaucracy, and the few that have been released have notably underwhelmed.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has repeatedly pledged to release the full trove of Epstein-related materials, has come under scrutiny after months of delays and mixed signals. On Feb. 21, Bondi declared on Fox News that the Epstein client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review,” sparking hopes for an imminent release.

More speculation began around the time Bondi was caught on a hidden camera on April 28 by James O'Keefe's media group casually discussing “tens of thousands” of Epstein videos at a restaurant. The viral clip, released publicly after Bondi made a similar comment to the press on May 7, further fueled MAGA-aligned skepticism, especially after Bondi's February document drop turned out to contain largely public or redacted information.

At the same time, congressional Republicans on multiple committees are still waiting on correspondence with the Department of Justice tied to politically charged investigations during the Biden administration — including records related to Trump-focused prosecutions, communications involving the FBI's handling of school board protests, and internal DOJ discussions about controversial memos from the previous administration targeting religious conservatives. The delays have added to the perception that the DOJ is moving too slowly to fulfill the administration's sweeping transparency pledge.

While rumors and allegations about Epstein's troves of illicit recordings have circulated online for years, no court records or investigations have ever confirmed the existence of Bondi's vaguely specified “tens of thousands” of abuse videos. Law enforcement has acknowledged seizing extensive troves of CDs, hard drives, and nude photographs from Epstein's properties, but no legal filings or case evidence to date have detailed the scale or contents of these materials beyond general references.

Around the time the undercover video was released last week, House Republicans, led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), began publicly pressing Bondi for answers.

In a May 8 letter co-signed by Reps. Tim Burchett (R-TN), Eric Burlison (R-MO), and Eli Crane (R-AZ), Luna demanded the DOJ release the complete Epstein files by May 16, with only minimal redactions to protect survivors. The letter also questioned whether internal or external actors are deliberately blocking the release and accused Bondi's office of stonewalling congressional oversight.

“The survivors of Jeffrey Epstein as well as the American people deserve to know who among the elite protected, enabled, or participated in Jeffrey Epstein's disgusting racket,” Luna said in a statement. “Our task force is demanding the full release of these files or a briefing on the status of the investigation. We work alongside the DOJ — not for it.”

Burchett told the Washington Examiner on Monday that he is so far “not very confident” the DOJ will meet the May 16 deadline set under Luna's letter.

“I think it goes much deeper than anybody really realizes,” he said. “I hope I'm pleasantly surprised, but I just think this thing is — there's a lot more to this than we know.”

Burchett also addressed Bondi's comments about the broad scope of child abuse material the government is sifting through. “These bastards, they generally do have tens of thousands [of files],” he said, citing his prior legislative work going after child predators in Tennessee and suggesting that he was not surprised by the high volume of videos Bondi claimed were in the government's possession.

The Tennessee lawmaker said he has more confidence in FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino's leadership but raised concerns about a lack of cohesion with DOJ leadership.

“I have full confidence in Dan Bongino. I really do. I just, my confidence in Ms. Bondi is waning,” he said. While Burchett said, “Bongino and [FBI Director] Kash [Patel] are together,” he noted the connection between the FBI and the attorney general has not been as “seamless” as he had hoped.

In response to an inquiry about the Republicans who cosigned the letter about the Epstein files, the White House told the Washington Examiner it stands firmly behind Bondi. 

“President Trump has full confidence in Attorney General Pam Bondi,” White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said. 

Huston noted that Bondi has “swiftly restored fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law,” contrasting her leadership with what she described as Biden's “corrupt DOJ” that “focused on weaponizing law enforcement against their political opponents and appeasing violent criminals.” 

Huston added that Bondi is fulfilling her mandate by “expelling rogue actors and rooting corruption out of our system.”

Bongino, in a lengthy post on May 10, defended the bureau's work and addressed criticism about the DOJ's transparency. His statement came one day after Luna's letter and the Washington Examiner‘s inquiry to the DOJ.

I'd like to update you on some things that I think are going well, and some things that we can, and will, do better. The workforce has been working overtime on task force operations to remove dangerous illegal aliens from the country. The work continues. The message is clear.…

“We're clearing information to Congress, and the public, as quickly as possible,” Bongino wrote. “In just the couple of months since we've sworn in we've responded to requests for information on the attack on Rep. [Steve Scalise (R-LA)] and members of Congress, the Nashville attack, Crossfire Hurricane, the COVID cover-up and more. We are working with the DOJ on the Epstein case and, as the AG stated, there are voluminous amounts of downloaded child sexual abuse material that we are dealing with.”

“There are also victim's statements that are entitled to specific protections,” Bongino added. “We need to do this correctly, but I do understand the public's desire to get the information out there.”

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has been closely monitoring the FBI's compliance with document requests. On Monday, he told the Washington Examiner he has maintained regular contact with the bureau to ensure full productions are made “without unnecessary redactions.”

Grassley expressed appreciation for Patel's efforts to “enhance the Bureau's transparency” and emphasized that the FBI “has a constitutional obligation to respond to congressional oversight,” calling transparency a key driver of accountability.

Meanwhile, House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) recently appeared on a popular right-wing podcast to air out his theories about the handling of the promised Epstein document release.

Speaking on Benny Johnson's show last week, Comer bluntly suggested the DOJ might not even have the files. “The attorney general does not have them or she would've turned them over,” Comer said, floating the possibility that “deep state actors” may have destroyed critical records before Trump returned to office.

Beyond Epstein, Republicans on multiple committees still await key Biden-era documents. These include records related to the DOJ's handling of Trump-focused prosecutions, FBI memos targeting religious conservatives, and communications tied to school board investigations that predate Trump's second term.

Burchett said those other investigations also deserve prompt responses. “All of the above,” he said when asked where he believes the DOJ is dragging its feet.

“It just takes so much time. And that's part of the problem the Trump administration's having — you've got two years to do all this stuff before the midterms,” Burchett said. “If Congress is slow to act, then it will never, will, never. We stand a chance of never seeing it pass.”

A separate Republican-backed congressional inquiry is seeking documents from the DOJ, FBI, and the National Archives and Records Administration related to the Biden administration's alleged political animus in bringing a pair of criminal cases against Trump ahead of the 2024 race.

A spokesperson for NARA, which is operated by acting Archivist and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, confirmed to the Washington Examiner last week it is working “as quickly as possible” to comply with a request in a letter from Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) concerning what the senators describe as the Arctic Frost investigation over alleged collusion between the Biden White House and the Biden DOJ over Trump's indictments. The letter included a May 14 deadline for a response.

“We are committed to full transparency as the Senate pursues this inquiry, and will make every effort to meet the Senators' requests,” the NARA spokesperson added.

With other congressional inquiries, such as the House Judiciary Committee's requests for documents related to the DOJ's communications with Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis, the FBI's anti-Catholic memo, and school board monitoring policies, began months ago and still have not yielded anything from the DOJ.

While some Republicans, such as Comer, have raised concerns that Biden-era holdovers might still influence document release delays, the DOJ has notably fired nearly a dozen prosecutors who worked under former special counsel Jack Smith. Those prosecutors were dismissed within weeks of Trump taking office, and key communications staff tied to Smith were replaced in recent weeks. The DOJ has also moved quickly to install political appointees across senior roles, consistent with standard departmental transitions.

GOLDMAN ACCUSES BONDI OF PREVENTING RELEASE OF EPSTEIN FILES, DEMANDS DOCUMENTS

Amid the slow progress of its transparency plans, the DOJ has sought to demonstrate aggressive action on other priorities aligned with the administration's law-and-order agenda. Last week, the DOJ announced one of the largest fentanyl trafficking busts in recent history, a nationwide sweep of child predator arrests under Operation Restoring Justice, and a new civil rights investigation into an anti-Catholic state law in Washington.

However, with key deadlines looming and Republican pressure mounting, the Trump DOJ faces a pivotal test of whether it can make good on its document release promises or whether internal inertia will erode one of the administration's signature political pledges.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Trump administration officials have welcomed the first batch of white South African refugees into the United States.

In the Feb. 7 executive order titled “Addressing the egregious actions of the Republic of South Africa,” President Donald Trump announced that “the United States shall promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation.”

Fifty-nine Afrikaner refugees of all ages arrived at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., on Monday, immediately being greeted by Trump administration officials. Afrikaners are South Africans who are the descendants of Dutch, Huguenot, and German settlers beginning in the mid-17th century.

“I want you all to know that you are really welcome here and that we respect what you have had to deal with these last few years,” Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told the American flag-waving refugees at the D.C. airport.

“I hope and I trust that the American people have very open hearts. We are a very accepting, we're a very friendly, welcoming people,” he continued, adding that he respected “what you had to deal with” and “the long tradition of your people.”

The State Department added in a post on X, “Today @DeputySecState welcomed the first group of Afrikaner refugees fleeing persecution from their native South Africa. We stand with these refugees, many of them farmers and former business owners, as they build a better future for themselves and their children here in the United States.”

Trump bemoaned the “genocide” taking place against Afrikaners in a Monday press conference, then critiqued the perceived failure of media outlets to cover the issue.

“It's a genocide that's taking place, that you people don't want to write about,” Trump told reporters when asked about the refugee program. “But it's a terrible thing that's taking place. And farmers are being killed.” 

“They happen to be white, but whether they're white or black makes no difference to me, but white farmers are being brutally killed, and their land is being confiscated in South Africa, and the newspapers and the media, television media, doesn't even talk about it. If it were the other way around, they talk about it, that would be the only story they talk about,” he added.

The acceptance of Afrikaner refugees found some critics in the U.S., such as Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH).

“The Administration must clarify why these individuals qualify for refugee status and resettlement in the U.S. and why they have been prioritized over refugees like Afghans, Burmese Rohingya and Sudanese who have fled their homes due to conflict and persecution,” she said in a Monday statement, saying the move was an effort to “rewrite history.”

Three refugee advocates protested near the airport's check-in counters as the refugees arrived, incensed that white South Africans were considered refugees.

“They're letting in these Afrikaners as ‘refugees,' while tens of thousands … that are actual refugees are not allowed to enter,” Laura Thompson Osuri, the executive director of Homes Without Borders, told USA Today. She was carrying a sign saying, “Afrikaners are not refugees.”

Afrikaners formed a rigid ethnic identity after settling in South Africa in the mid-1600s. They dominated the political and business elite of South Africa until the end of apartheid in 1994. Presently, many Afrikaner activists and observers believe the group is being purposefully subjected to violence from the black majority, with the government being complicit.

Attacks against white Afrikaner farmers are a highly controversial issue. The government doesn't keep statistics regarding the number of white farmers killed, but news of particularly brutal attacks has enraged many Afrikaners. Attacks on farms are often accompanied by extensive torture, rape, and mutilation.

The South African government has emphatically denied any bias against Afrikaners and holds that white farmers are only victims of a larger crime wave.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa assented on Jan. 23 to the Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, which allows the expropriation of land without compensation in some cases. Many, including the U.S. government, interpreted it as a move against the white minority, which controls most farmland in the country.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER SANCTIONING SOUTH AFRICA OVER TREATMENT OF AFRIKANERS, OFFERS REFUGE IN US

Trump's February executive order said the law enables “the government of South Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation. This Act follows countless government policies designed to dismantle equal opportunity in employment, education, and business, and hateful rhetoric and government actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.”

South African foreign minister Ronald Lamola hit back at the accusations once again on Monday, reaffirming his government's position that Boers are simply victims of a larger crime wave.

“There is no data at all that backs that there is persecution of white South Africans or white Afrikaners in particular who are farmers,” he said. “White farmers get affected by crime just like any other South Africans who do get affected by crime. So this is not factual, it is without basis.”

Beneath the surface of Medicaid's state-federal partnership lies a tangled web of financial sleight-of-hand that quietly drains federal coffers, shifts enormous costs from states to the federal government, and raises premiums on working people. 

To explain the issue, last month, Paragon Health Institute released a report titled “Addressing Medicaid Money Laundering.” The term “Medicaid money laundering” was coined by the Wall Street Journal in a 2008 editorial, but some criticize our use of the term and defend these “creative” financing arrangements. In doing so, critics use innocuous, often misleading terms and provide superficial descriptions that downplay the egregiousness of these schemes. To paraphrase famed radio announcer Paul Harvey, let's give you the rest of the story.

Since Medicaid's inception, the federal government has given states money for a portion of the program's costs, while states administer the program and shoulder the remaining cost. States pay just 10% for able-bodied adults without children. But when it comes to the most vulnerable — children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with disabilities — the state share can rise to as much as 50%, depending on the state. But states are sidestepping financial responsibility and laundering money from healthcare providers to maximize federal loot.

One mechanism for these practices is the “provider tax,” in which states tax providers, then later pay those funds back to those same providers through Medicaid. Those payments trigger funds from a federal match, which states and providers can split among themselves. 

Recognizing this was a major problem, Congress restricted provider taxes in 1991. These restrictions were intended to limit money laundering schemes driving federal spending. But states were still allowed to tax and return funds within a “safe harbor” cap of no more than 6% of a provider's patient revenue. Today, states and providers continue to use that safe harbor, as well as other new mechanisms, to siphon federal dollars.

Critics invoke the 6% cap as if it were a summary judgment acquitting these practices. However, supporters of “provider taxes” intentionally omit explanations on what the 6% safe harbor means, because to do so would expose how the practice undermines Medicaid's original structure. 

The Congressional Budget Office recently published a paper analyzing the effects of hypothetical policy changes, including “provider taxes.” However, the paper contains contradictory statements regarding the structure of these taxes and their potential limitations. To clarify, there is no federal limit on how much states can tax providers, and there is no policy being discussed that would limit the ability of states to tax providers.

The “safe harbor” basically means that as long as the tax is no more than 6% of an entity's revenue, the entity can be guaranteed to get all its money back. If the entity weren't guaranteed to get the money back, there would be no other logical reason why tax-exempt hospitals are fighting to keep paying these taxes. No one pays a tax knowing that when they pay it, they will get every dime back. This clearly does not meet the definition of a tax.

Paragon's paper highlighted California's use of Medicaid managed care taxes to pay for illegal immigrants. Critics of the paper correctly point out that it is illegal to use federal funds to support illegal immigrants. A closer examination of the California managed care tax shows how states can launder federal money to get around that prohibition.

California taxes insurance plans $1.75 per member per month for those with private insurance, but taxes insurance plans $182 per member per month for those in Medicaid plans — more than 100 times higher than private plan taxes. So, the state can most effectively target the windfall federal revenues raised through the scheme to Medicaid providers and insurers while holding commercial insurers virtually harmless. 

The scheme is simple. California taxed Medicaid plans $16.7 billion, and it then sent the money right back to the plans. The state then told the federal government: “This is money we spent on Medicaid, so give our federal match.” That match equals $9.5 billion. Thus, the insurance plans got their $16.7 billion back through higher payments, and California deposited the $9.5 billion from the federal government into its general fund. It is both a political and fiscal win for the Golden State, but a loss for federal taxpayers.

While it is illegal for states to use federal dollars to cover illegal immigrants in Medicaid, that ignores the clear money laundering occurring. In the criminal world, one launders money by moving it around in different accounts, thereby making “dirty” money look “clean.” This enables the use of funds in ways that would otherwise be illegal. Similarly, California moved money around and generated a clean $9.5 billion from the Treasury for its general fund. Since the state receives the money through financing schemes, it is now state money that can be used to cover illegal immigrants in the Medicaid program. Both the Wall Street Journal and Paragon have used the correct term, Medicaid money laundering, for this egregious practice.

Another program under scrutiny is state-directed payments: additional payments that states, using almost entirely federal money, direct Medicaid insurers to make to hospitals and other providers. Hospital lobbyists claim SDPs are a needed source of revenue for hospitals and want the story to end there. But there is much more to them, as states often pay hospitals two to three times the rate of Medicare for the same service under these schemes.

If the state paid its fair share of Medicaid services, few states would say they could afford to pay hospitals rates where they can make large profits through Medicaid. However, for able-bodied working-age adults, the state pays no more than 10% of the Medicaid cost. The hospitals, even those that would otherwise be tax-exempt, work with consultants to develop a provider “tax” on themselves, which the state gets to use toward its 10% share of spending. In essence, the state received $900 for every $100 it says it spent, even though none of that $100 was actual state spending.

As long as the tax is not more than 6% of its revenue, the hospital system can be guaranteed to get its money back. Meanwhile, the hospitals convince the legislature that increasing their reimbursement rates won't cost the state anything, and in some cases, states end up with more money in their general funds from the scheme. So, with permission from the Biden administration, the federal government is paying many hospitals two to three times more for Medicaid services than for services given to seniors on Medicare. And, while Medicaid payments are required to mirror those for Medicare through fee-for-service arrangements, this cap does not apply to payments funneled through insurance companies that run a Medicaid plan.

Raising these payments is a large reason why the amount of money the federal government is projected to pay for Medicaid beyond already assumed spending over the next 10 years increased by over $1.2 trillion during the Biden administration.

HOUSE GOP ROLLS OUT MEDICAID PLAN COMPROMISE WITH STRICTER REQUIREMENTS

As offensive to taxpayers as that scheme is, it also increases insurance premiums for everyone else who has private insurance. By tying Medicare rates to the average rate paid for the same service by commercial insurance, larger hospitals with dominant market share have an incentive to demand higher commercial rates because they will also get an increase in their Medicaid rates. Thus, these higher commercial rates lead to higher healthcare costs and premiums for everyone else.

Whether through California's laundering to fund illegal immigrant coverage or through creative tax schemes, states are laundering Medicaid dollars. And, now you have the rest of the story.

To figure out who will benefit most, doctors should consider a particularly toxic kind of fat.

Ever since the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk realized that GLP-1 drugs were useful for more than diabetes, doctors and researchers have struggled to answer a deceptively simple question: Who should be taking them? The medications are highly effective at inducing weight loss, and most Americans are overweight or have obesity. But GLP-1s are also expensive, not covered by most insurance, and designed to be taken for life—not to mention that they frequently give rise to nausea and a loss of appetite. Giving them to every overweight American clearly isn't appropriate.

Take President Donald Trump. During his first term, a scan showed signs of plaque buildup in his coronary arteries, which put him at risk of a heart attack. In 2020, his body mass index was just over the threshold for obesity. That combination would have made him a candidate for a GLP-1 drug, and indeed, throughout his 2024 campaign, people speculated that he was taking one. Then, last month, Trump's latest physical showed that he had dropped 20 pounds, moving him from obese to overweight. (Trump has never publicly said that he is on a GLP-1, and when reached for comment, the White House did not address questions about how the president had lost the weight. Trump is “in peak physical and mental condition,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told The Atlantic in an emailed statement.) The most revealing aspect of the president's medical report was the list of drugs he is taking, which includes a combination that amounts to what doctors call “intensive lipid-lowering therapy”—a treatment usually reserved for patients who are at significant risk of cardiac disease. As far as the president's health is concerned, his weight is no more important than the fact that he is on that drug regimen and that it seems to be working: His LDL (the “bad” cholesterol) has dropped dramatically in recent years.

Trump's example shows that doctors' and patients' primary goal should not be changes in weight alone, but changes in health. GLP-1 drugs can help a wide spectrum of people lose weight, but their risks are likely justified for only a smaller subset of Americans. To say whether the health benefits a person might gain from taking the drugs are worth the expense and likely gastrointestinal distress, physicians cannot rely on weight alone. The calculus can be life-and-death; nearly 1,000 deaths a day are linked to diet-related disease in the United States. To save lives and improve health, doctors, researchers, and politicians need to reckon with the true killer: not weight or size, but a particularly toxic kind of fat.

When humans eat too many calories—especially too many of the highly processed, rapidly absorbed carbohydrates that are so common in the modern diet—fat accumulates around the waist, surrounding and invading the liver, heart, and pancreas. Doctors call it visceral, central, or abdominal fat. It's more dangerous to health than fat that accumulates in places such as the arms and thighs because it leaks free fatty acids and other molecules into the body, generating inflammation, upending the metabolism, and wreaking havoc on our organs. Visceral fat is linked to cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, 13 types of cancer, and likely some forms of dementia, among other major chronic illnesses. Reduce visceral fat, and these conditions can be prevented or even, in certain cases, treated.

Read: The science behind Ozempic was wrong

Visceral fat is closely tied to two hallmarks of metabolic disease: high insulin levels and insulin resistance. Scientists haven't yet determined which comes first, visceral fat or elevated insulin, but they know that high insulin levels are part of a vicious cycle that promotes fat storage, visceral fat, and disease. As elevated insulin has become dramatically more common—by 2018, more than 40 percent of Americans had high insulin—so too has chronic disease. Six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have more.

GLP-1 drugs are remarkably effective at reducing visceral fat. In fact, that may be a large part of why GLP-1s so improve the metabolic health of people who take them. The strongest case for use of GLP-1s, then, is in people with excess visceral fat who have begun to suffer its consequences. The crucial problem for physicians is how to identify those people. BMI is a poor measure, but waist size is a good predictor of visceral fat, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Certain abnormalities in blood-lipid patterns can indicate the beginning of organ dysfunction.

And yet, the primary metric by which anti-obesity drugs are judged and distributed is weight. Originally, the FDA approved these medications for people with a BMI of 30 or above, or with a BMI of at least 27 and at least one weight-related ailment. But the agency has since quietly removed its references to BMI from the drugs' labels, which now simply state that the medications are for patients “with obesity” or those who are “overweight in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.” Without explicitly saying so, this change recognizes that BMI is not a good measure of body fat, nor of the visceral fat that causes the most harm. Yet the agency still requires that clinical trials of obesity drugs use BMI as a criterion for enrolling patients. When I go to obesity-medicine meetings, many of the physicians I speak with still use BMI as a guideline.

Read: BMI won't die

Over the past decade or so, awareness has grown among doctors and patients alike that BMI has limited utility as a health metric. It doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat. It doesn't account for how fat tends to be distributed differently on male and female bodies. These shortcomings are important when considering what a patient has to gain from a GLP-1 drug. People of South Asian heritage, for example, can develop insulin resistance at much lower BMIs than other populations. According to the American College of Cardiology, in terms of insulin resistance, a white person with a BMI of 30 can be metabolically equivalent to a South Asian person with a BMI of 23.9. Unfortunately, doctors do not have easy and reliable ways to measure insulin resistance directly. Developing a diagnostic test would go a long way in helping determine who should be treated with anti-obesity medications.

The United States is still deciding how exactly to approach GLP-1s. The Trump administration scrapped a Biden-administration proposal to cover anti-obesity medications under Medicare's Part D drug benefit, but it hasn't ruled out future coverage. Within the past year, the FDA has both expanded its eligibility guidelines for the drugs and declared that the drugs are no longer in shortage. That means that compounding pharmacies can no longer produce replicas of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound, which will reduce the availability of cheaper options but might also curb the risks associated with copycats. Plus, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have recently introduced new discount programs. Early data suggest that the drugs may be useful in treating fatty liver disease, heart failure, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases, which, I suspect, will lead even more people to take them.

If GLP-1s really do become more common in America, everyone who goes on them needs to understand that they are doing so without an endgame. GLP-1 drugs were approved under the premise that patients will stay on them for life, but so far, most people take them for less than a year, in large part because of their side effects, typically high cost, and lack of insurance coverage. Scientists do not have good data on whether and how to get off the drugs without regaining weight, whether they can be used safely and effectively on an intermittent basis, or how to adjust doses downward over the long term. The best way to find those answers is for the FDA to require pharmaceutical companies to gather the data. Letting the companies off the hook by assuming that people are going to be on these drugs forever would be a grave mistake.

Read: The Ozempic flip-flop

All of these unanswered questions only add to the urgency of determining who is most likely to benefit from GLP-1s, and who would be safer or healthier by sticking with lifestyle changes and other medications. GLP-1 drugs are not a panacea. They are one powerful tool to help control America's crisis of metabolic disease—one that we need to get right.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Trump is squandering one of his biggest 2024 electoral accomplishments.

by  Christian Paz

PHILADELPHIA — In September 2024, Sharita White made a desperate choice. After supporting Democrats in previous presidential election cycles, the 37-year-old Black Philadelphian decided she would cast her ballot for Donald Trump.

Her life during the Biden years had taken a frustrating turn: Her husband had died, she'd lost her job, and she was forced to move with her kids to a Philly neighborhood notorious for crime and fentanyl addiction. With a son with a chronic ailment, her tight food budget had been padded by pandemic stimulus checks. With those gone, and high inflation pushing up the cost of living, life felt drastically different.

“When Trump was in the chair, Black people was up, and I want Trump back in the chair because I've been struggling ever since he's been out of the chair,” she told me and Today, Explained producer Miles Bryan last fall in front of a cheesesteak shop where Republican operatives were campaigning for Black voters.

When November came, she joined millions of other Black, Latino, and young voters who broke with Democrats and cast their votes for Trump. Voters like Sharita White — disengaged, historically Democratic, and frustrated with the status quo — powered a historic red shift in Democratic strongholds across the country, helping Trump sweep Electoral College battlegrounds and win the popular vote.

But eight months later, White told us she feels even worse. “I just see things just keep rising and stuff, and things does not look like they're getting better and stuff,” she said when we caught up with her at her Northeast Philly home in May. “Because at this point, it's like nothing is getting better. And the economy is getting worse.”

She regrets her vote for Trump. And she's not alone.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

Across a range of polling averages and survey data, a similar picture is developing. Black, Latino, and young voters are turning sharply against him, reversing the gains he made throughout 2024 with traditionally Democratic voting groups.

Trump created a multiracial, working-class, Republican coalition. But just three and a half months into this presidency, that coalition looks like it's falling apart.

Trump was elected president in no small part because his campaign's unconventional wager paid off. His team bet that by focusing on the economy, inflation, and immigration — and by bringing that message to non-traditional media platforms and to places where Republicans typically struggle — they might activate a coalition of the disaffected.

It worked in November. But now, his perceived inability to deliver on this seems to be fueling the great unraveling of this coalition. Trump's overall job approval and personal favorability ratings have steadily dropped, largely because voters disapprove of and distrust his handling of the economy.

When Trump took office, he, and his agenda, had more support than in his first term. But voters wanted him to mainly focus on the economy, and more specifically, on inflation. 

By March, the public mood began to turn. Views of the economy, and Trump's stewardship of it, began to sour. Many voters, including those who joined his coalition in November, told pollsters that Trump was focusing on the wrong things. And when he announced his Liberation Day tariff scheme, jolting the stock market and threatening to raise prices, he seemed to lock in that sense.

That's why, since the start of his term, Trump has seen the sharpest drops in his job approval ratings among those cohorts of voters who swung hard for him in November: Latino voters (a roughly 13 percent drop), Black voters (a 9 percent drop), young voters (-23 percent), independents (-18), and moderates (-15), according to polls aggregated and analyzed by the former political pollster Adam Carlson.

Low-engagement voters — those people who don't pay a lot of attention to the news — swung hard for Trump in November. Now, they have similarly soured on Trump, swinging more than 30 points away from him since January, according to another set of averages calculated by the data journalist G. Elliott Morris.

And the least MAGA, less ideological Trump voters who turned out for him last year are also much more likely to disapprove of Trump today than they were in February. According to the most recent Pew Research Center study, Trump's standing among his voters who did not support him strongly has fallen by about 13 percentage points over the last three months. His support among his most enthusiastic supporters, meanwhile, has stayed steady — essentially unchanged at 96 percent (it was 99 percent in February).

These trends suggest real dissatisfaction among the electorate in general, but specifically a sharp shift among the newest members of the Republican coalition. They took a bet on Trump, believed his promises about making life more affordable and moderating perceived policy excesses of the Biden years, and feel duped, betrayed, or let down by an administration that seems to be taking a much more radical approach to their campaign promises than they expected.

And these voters aren't hard to find.

That sense of betrayal and confusion is palpable in the diverse places that swung hard for Trump last year. In North Philly, Jose, a 61-year-old retired Dominican American man who said he was a Democratic voter until last year, told us he feels like Trump's presidency so far has been a stab in the back.

Jose told us that Trump's economic pitch was more promising than the Biden years of Democratic governance. He flagged his frustrations with Biden's immigration policy, saying that Democrats “forgot that — here — they had people who needed work here too,” and instead let immigrants into the country and “let them take jobs from Americans.”

He had believed Trump would better wrangle inflation, while also enforcing immigration laws and deporting violent criminals. Jose said he's instead getting an administration that's forcing price hikes through trade wars, while rounding up nonviolent, hard-working immigrants.

“We voted for Trump and Trump betrayed us,” he said. “The truth is people voted for one thing: the economy. A good economy. And these tariffs are hiking everything up. … And he's kicking out hard workers and not touching the people who don't work, he's leaving them. How does that make sense?”

Young, first-time Trump voters on college campuses told us something similar: Perhaps they did agree with Trump's restrictionist stance on immigration; perhaps they did believe the government should be better with how it spends money and how federal grants are given out. But as they prepared to enter the job market after college, they were worried about affordability and job stability.

“I expected things to be a little different,” Nikita, a senior at Drexel University who voted for Trump, told us. “I'm just hoping for the future and hopefully some of these tariffs soon come to pass, as maybe just like a temporary thing.” He was supportive of Trump's border policies, but was anxious about the job and stock market. “He became president, but [the stock market] … doesn't look good as of right now.”

Talking with voters like Sharita White in the Kensington neighborhood, it's clear why so many voters last year were willing to give Trump another try. This part of the city, in the northeast, saw a spike in poverty, crime, and homelessness in the post-pandemic years. Drug use and dealing is a near-constant presence. 

And it also continued a trend in blue, Democratic cities, as multiracial and working-class neighborhoods continued to swing right. At this point, some number of voters have now, at different times, put their hopes in candidates of both major parties. But life doesn't seem to have changed for the better.

That's why, while talking to these voters, we heard a parallel emotion to their frustration with Trump. They're second-guessing their 2024 vote choices, but they don't necessarily say they would have swapped their vote for Kamala Harris. And they don't say they plan to vote Democratic in the future — or declare that Republicans have completely lost them either.

Some Philly residents told us they're still trusting the process. Nikita, and other college students we talked to, said they're willing to give Trump more time before turning on him completely. They like some of what he's doing, and think he can still get back on track.

Other first-time Trump voters said they wished they'd sat out the election entirely and plan to do so again. White, for example, said the last few cycles have made her lose faith in politics completely. “I'm going to be honest. I'm tired. I feel like at this point, my vote don't matter,” she said. “It's like, I can't do nothing to change anything. There was a time that Black people couldn't vote. There was the time women couldn't vote…but I feel like my vote don't matter.”

White's story, and those of the other disaffected Trump voters we talked to, should be a warning for both parties. Republicans stand to give up the gains they made last year and lose an opportunity to build a lasting, winning coalition, aided by national trends that are making voters of color and young voters less likely to stand by the Democratic Party.

But particularly ahead of midterm elections, when Democrats will have anti-incumbent energy on their side, it's possible for the party to misread Trump backlash as Democratic support. The same data that show soft Trump voters fleeing him also suggests that they aren't running back to the Democrats. Congressional Democrats, for example, are still struggling with a toxic brand name: they're running nearly even with Republicans in head-to-head polling, while one recent poll found only about 30 percent of voters view the Democratic Party favorably. And the party in general still hasn't fixed its communication problem, of reaching the kinds of voters Trump was able to reach last year.

Both parties have time to fix these problems before the next presidential election. But if 2024 showed anything, it's that these voters have the numbers and power to swing entire elections.

A movement fueled by conspiracy theories is starting conspiracy theories about its latest nominee.

by  Dylan Scott

The Make America Healthy Again movement's infiltration of federal health policy took another step forward last week when President Donald Trump nominated Dr. Casey Means, a “metabolic health evangelist” and an ally of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to be his surgeon general.

If confirmed by the Senate in the coming weeks, Means will hold one of the most visible public health roles in the country, and would be set to boost Kennedy's vision for remaking the nation's approach to health and wellness.

But who is Means? And where does she fit in the broader MAHA space?

Like Kennedy, she is an insider turned outsider: She graduated from Stanford Medical School but dropped out of her residency program in 2019 shortly before completing it because she came to view the health care system as “exploitative.” She's since pivoted to focus on personal wellness, challenging the health care establishment along the way. In doing so, she's found an eager audience, attracting hundreds of thousands of followers on social media. 

In 2019, she started a health tech company called Levels that marketed at-home glucose monitors. Means herself has pitched the devices as a general health tool not only for people with diabetes, for whom they were originally developed, but for everyone — even though research studies have found no benefit for those without the condition. Perhaps coincidentally, last month, Kennedy floated having the federal government cover the costs of such devices for some patients, rather than cover new weight-loss drugs, as one way to arrest the country's obesity crisis. 

Last year, Means published a bestselling book called Good Energy, co-authored with her brother Calley Means, that cemented her place as a MAHA champion who would take on the health care industrial complex.

In their book, the Meanses advance a theory of “metabolic dysfunction” — that Americans' bodies are bad at producing energy because of our poor diets and sedentary lifestyles, and which is the root cause of chronic diseases, including not only obesity and diabetes but even schizophrenia and depression. (Scientists have found that metabolism is central to the development of obesity and its associated diseases, but the underlying causes remain the subject of active research.) 

Good Energy paints a grand conspiracy that the food and medical industries have little motivation to prevent diseases from occurring because once a person becomes ill, they start using medical services and making money for health care providers.

Experts say Means's commentary on metabolism is often overly simplistic. She can also stray into sounding more like a spiritual guru than a medical doctor, prone to talking about “dark energy” and speculating that our brains may be more like receivers that tap into the divine. She appears to view people's ill health as a matter of spiritual disorder as much as a physical phenomenon.

“Humans are out of alignment with the Earth and depleting its life force,” she wrote last year. “And human bodies are now exhibiting signs of blocking the flow of energy through them. This is insulin resistance. We are the Earth.” 

To Means's public health critics, she is both anti-science — she frequently criticizes vaccines in her weekly newsletter — and fundamentally unqualified to be, as the surgeon general is often known, America's doctor. (Her medical license actually lapsed in 2019.) 

“Appointing Casey Means, a non-practicing doctor who has spent years peddling unproven ‘health interventions,' means a surgeon general that will put a fringe practitioner of unproven functional medicine in charge of educating the American people about their health and disease challenges,” Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University, told the New York Times.

But Kennedy says Means is “the perfect choice” for surgeon general — her unorthodoxy a feature, not a bug.

“Casey articulates better than any American the North Star of a country where we have eliminated diabetes, heart disease, and obesity through prioritizing metabolic health,” Kennedy wrote on X. “Casey will help me ensure American children will be less medicated and better fed — and significantly healthier — during the next four years. She will be the best Surgeon General in American history.”

The surgeon general, though not a policy-making role, has the influence to drive the national conversation on health and can draw attention to important changes in the nation's health. Vivek Murthy, President Joe Biden's surgeon general, released a widely covered report on the loneliness epidemic and called for cancer warnings on alcohol packaging during his tenure. Already Means has outlined what she'd like to see: less corporate influence in health and food, less ultraprocessed foods in the American diet, a reformed meatpacking industry, and more. 

Means's priorities are consistent with Kennedy's agenda, which is why it was so surprising when Means's nomination sparked outrage among some in the MAHA universe.

Not in the least. But before we get into why not, here's what's going on: Means's critics have gotten a lot of attention recently by portraying her as insufficiently committed to MAHA's various goals — particularly in her opposition to vaccines — and suggested that nebulous dark forces may be at work against the movement. 

As journalist Helena Bottemiller Evich wrote in her newsletter Food Fix, some anti-vaccine activists have come to believe an emphasis on food wellness has overtaken vaccine safety as Kennedy's primary focus, and Means's nomination exacerbated those tensions. According to the Washington Post, one anti-vax influencer said Means's appointment showed Kennedy was actually “powerless” within the Trump circle.

“I don't know if RFK very clearly lied to me, or what is going on,” Nicole Shanahan, who was Kennedy's vice presidential candidate during his presidential run, posted on X. “It has been clear in recent conversations that he is reporting to someone regularly who is controlling his decisions (and it isn't President Trump).” 

Shanahan, after speculating that Kennedy had come under somebody else's influence, called the Means siblings “aggressive and artificial.” Far-right commentator and internet personality Laura Loomer called Means “a Witch Doctor” and insisted Trump could not have selected her of his own accord.

But according to Trump, he picked Means because Kennedy recommended her for the position. 

So while the rift is eye-catching, it is probably better understood as interpersonal rivalries spilling into the open rather than any meaningful change in direction for Kennedy or the MAHA agenda he is implementing at HHS. Kennedy has nurtured a movement in which conspiracy theories are commonplace and now that he's disappointed some of his supporters by endorsing Means, they are seeing more conspiracies.

The MAHA movement encompasses everything from vaccine skepticism and elaborate theories of chronic disease to eliminating environmental toxins and eradicating corruption in the health system. Means may bring a particular focus on food and wellness to the surgeon general position, but if you look at his record so far, Kennedy has begun working aggressively across a wide range of issues.

In his first few months as health secretary, Kennedy has downplayed the efficacy of the measles shot in favor of alternative treatments amid the worst outbreak in decades. He has also ridiculed vaccine mRNA technology, calling into question a future Covid-19 vaccine for children. And he has launched a vaccine safety investigation and ordered a probe into autism's causes. 

At the same time, Kennedy has already sought voluntary commitments from food manufacturers to remove artificial dyes from their products and tried to crack down on more additives in ultraprocessed foods. Last week, the FDA and NIH launched yet another research initiative, this one on diet-related chronic disease, that aims to understand how certain foods affect metabolism, the cornerstone of Means's theory of our modern health problems.

All of this drama over Means's nomination does clarify some things about the MAHA movement: The coalition is reactive and conspiratorial, but its key figures are moving at stunning speed to remake the country's approach to health care. Tapping Means is another step in that direction; her nomination isn't a sign of MAHA fracturing — it's a sign of Kennedy doubling down.

MAHA's political potency, much like Trump's MAGA movement, is aided by its malleability: Make America Healthy Again could mean a lot of different things to different people, from hardcore anti-vaxxers to the kind of crunchy conservative wellness influencer that Means typifies. 

But while that ambiguity can be an asset in a campaign, it presents a challenge when governing. You have different constituencies who, while happy to be unified to win an election, are now pushing you to pick different personnel, to prioritize different issues, to frame issues in different terms. 

Even if you largely stick to the agenda you laid out in a campaign — as Kennedy has done so far — some members of your coalition are bound to feel alienated and start airing grievances in public.

﻿One company dominated the competition: Impossible Foods.

by  Kenny Torrella

Over the last decade, plant-based meat has gotten a lot more meaty.

Dozens of startups have launched in recent years to develop more realistic-tasting burgers, nuggets, and sausages as an alternative to factory farmed meat, which causes billions of animals to suffer terribly, pollutes our air and water, and accelerates climate change. 

For a time, the plant-based meat sector was on a major upswing: Retail sales doubled from 2017 to 2020. But since then, sales have continually declined. Recently published data found a seven percent drop in plant-based meat retail dollar sales from 2023 to 2024 and an 11 percent drop in the number of products sold.

To better understand what consumers really think about plant-based meat, a few months ago one organization conducted a huge blind taste test, which I recently covered:

In December and January, Nectar — a nonprofit that conducts research on “alternative protein,” such as plant-based meat — brought together nearly 2,700 people in a first- and largest-of-its-kind blind taste test. Without knowing which version they were tasting, the participants tried 122 plant-based meat products across 14 categories, like burgers, hot dogs, and bacon, alongside one animal meat “benchmark” product per category. Each product was tested by at least 100 participants, who then rated them on texture, flavor, appearance, and overall enjoyment on a 7-point scale from “dislike very much” to “like very much.”

Twenty of the plant-based products won Nectar's “Tasty award” — meaning that half or more of the participants rated them better than or equal to the animal-based counterpart (six of the 20 came from just one company: Impossible Foods). This suggests that some of consumers' preference for animal meat — or dislike of plant-based meat — is just in their head, an idea I explored in depth in April. 

The products were all served as part of a dish, like they'd be eaten in regular life — vegan meatballs were served with spaghetti, for example, and deli slices in a sandwich with fixings. While some of these products don't taste identical to meat when eaten on their own, when prepared in a meal, differences in taste become much less important.

If you want to give the top-performing products a try, continue on to learn where to find the 14 that are available in the US, what I think of them (at least, the ones I've tried), and a bit about the companies behind these standout plant-based meats. (The six award-winning plant-based meat products that are only available in Europe can be found at the end of the article.)

US plant-based meat companies have reliably churned out meat-free burgers for decades, in part because they're a beloved American staple, but also because ground beef is easier for food scientists to replicate than, say, a steak's complex fibrous structure. You can now find plant-based burgers at the vast majority of US grocery stores, and even at a lot of restaurants. Here are the companies that made the best burgers in Nectar's blind taste test:

I'll be honest: I've tried a lot of plant-based chicken nuggets, and I can't tell much of a difference between them (they all taste like, well, chicken). They're among the easiest foods to make plant-based because chicken nuggets are already highly processed and bear little resemblance to whole chicken meat. 

You can't go wrong with meat-free nuggs from the two Tasty award winners — Impossible Foods and MorningStar Farms — but I also recommend chicken nuggets from Beyond Meat and chicken tenders from Gardein.

A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

Plant-based breakfast sausage patties, like plant-based nuggets, all kind of taste the same to me. But blind taste testers have a preference for two companies' products: Impossible Foods and Gardein, a Canadian company that's launched a number of delicious plant-based meat products over the years, which are widely available in the US. 

I also like Impossible's ground sausage, which comes in a roll, giving you flexibility in how to use it.

The only plant-based meatballs and hot dogs to win a Tasty award are made by — you guessed it — Impossible Foods. Its hot dogs are even good enough for Joey Chestnut, the world's top-ranking competitive eater, who signed an endorsement deal with the company in 2024.

The list above only includes products available in the US, but a number of Nectar's winners appear to only be available in Europe:

While a blind taste test is the best measurement of a plant-based meat's quality, I also want to share some of my personal favorites — and those from friends and fellow Vox colleagues — that didn't win a Tasty award but deserve the limelight just as much:

If you can't find a product near you, or want to try something not widely available in the US, there are a number of online food retailers, like Vegan Essentials and Thrive Market, that carry specialty plant-based products. 

Nectar's blind taste test demonstrated that, overall, plant-based meat still has a long way to go to compete with animal meat on flavor, texture, price, and other attributes. But that so many of the plant-based products were rated just as good or better than their animal meat equivalents shows how far the industry has come in recent decades. 

In the years ahead, as the problems of our food system — animal cruelty, climate emissions, water pollution, and more — grow and worsen, its alternatives will improve. If we're lucky, they'll come to be seen less as substitutes and more as ethical, and tasty, options to satisfy humanity's desire for meat.

﻿What if we measured success in terms of how much good we do?

by  Sigal Samuel

We're told from a young age to achieve. Get good grades. Get into a good school. Get a good job. Be ambitious about earning a high salary or a high-status position. But many of us eventually find ourselves asking: What's the point of all this ambition? The fat salary or the fancy title…are those really meaningful measures of success?

There's another possibility: Instead of measuring our success in terms of fame or fortune, we could measure it in terms of how much good we do for others. And we could get super ambitious about using our lives to do a gargantuan amount of good.

That's the message of Moral Ambition, a new book by historian and author Rutger Bregman. He wants us to stop wasting our talents on meaningless work and start devoting ourselves to solving the world's biggest problems, like malaria and pandemics and climate change.

I recently got the chance to talk to Bregman on The Gray Area, Vox's philosophically-minded podcast. I invited him on the show because I find his message inspiring — and, to be honest, because I also had some questions about it. I want to dedicate myself to work that feels meaningful, but I'm not sure work that helps the greatest number of people is the only way to do that. Moral optimization — the effort to mathematically quantify moral goodness so that we can then maximize it — is, in my experience, agonizing and ultimately counterproductive. 

I also noticed that Bregman's “moral ambition” has a lot in common with effective altruism (EA), the movement that's all about using reason and evidence to do the most good possible. After the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried, the EA crypto billionaire who was convicted of fraud in 2023, EA suffered a major reputational blow. I wondered: Is Bregman just trying to rescue the EA baby from the bathwater? (Disclosure: In 2022, Future Perfect was awarded a one-time $200,000 grant from Building a Stronger Future, a family foundation run by Sam and Gabe Bankman-Fried. Future Perfect has returned the balance of the grant and is no longer pursuing this project.)

So in our conversation, I talked to Bregman about all the different things that can make our lives feel meaningful, and asked: Are some objectively better than others? And how is moral ambition different from ideas that came before it, like effective altruism?

This interview has been edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. 

Why should people be morally ambitious?

My whole career, I've been fascinated with the waste of talent that's going on in modern economies. There's this one study from two Dutch economists and they estimate that around 25 percent of all workers think that their own job is socially meaningless, or at least doubt the value of their job.

That is just insane to me. I mean, this is five times the unemployment rate. And we're talking about people who often have excellent resumes, who went to very nice universities. Harvard is an interesting case in point: 45 percent of Harvard graduates end up in consultancy or finance. I'm not saying all of that is totally socially useless, but I do wonder whether that is the best allocation of talent. [Note: In 2020, 45 percent of Harvard graduating seniors entering the workforce went into consulting and finance. Among the class of 2024, the number was 34 percent.]

We face some pretty big problems out there, whether it's the threat of the next pandemic that may be just around the corner, terrible diseases like malaria and tuberculosis killing millions of people, the problem with democracy breaking down. I mean, the list goes on and on. And so I've always been frustrated by this enormous waste of talent. If we're going to have a career anyway, we might as well do a lot of good with it.

What role does personal passion play in this? You write in the book, “Don't start out by asking, what's my passion? Ask instead, how can I contribute most? And then choose the role that suits you best. Don't forget, your talents are but a means to an end.”

I think “follow your passion” is probably the worst career advice out there. At the School for Moral Ambition, an organization I co-founded, we deeply believe in the Gandalf-Frodo model of changing the world. Frodo didn't follow his passion. Gandalf never asked him, “What's your passion, Frodo?” He said, “Look, this really needs to be done, you've got to throw the ring into the mountain.” If Frodo would have followed his passion, he would have probably been a gardener having a life full of second breakfasts and being pretty comfortable in the Shire. And then the orcs would have turned up and murdered everyone he ever loved. 

So the point here is, find yourself some wise old wizard, a Gandalf. Figure out what some of the most pressing issues that we face as a species are. And ask yourself, how can I make a difference? And then you will find out that you can become very passionate about it.

In your book, there's a Venn diagram with three circles. The first is labeled “sizable.” The second is “solvable.” And the third is “sorely overlooked.” And in the middle, where they all overlap, it says “moral ambition.” 

I wonder about the “sizable” part of that. Does moral ambition always have to be about scale? I'm a journalist now, but before that I was a novelist. And I didn't care how many people my work impacted. My feeling was: If my novel deeply moves just one reader and helps them feel less alone or more understood, I will be happy. Are you telling me I shouldn't be happy with that? 

I think there is absolutely a place for, as the French say, art pour l'art — art for the sake of art itself. I don't want to let everything succumb to a utilitarian calculus. But I do think it's better to help a lot of people than just a few people. On the margins, I think in the world today, we need much more moral ambition than we currently have.

When I was reading your book, I kept thinking of the philosopher Susan Wolf, who has this great essay called “Moral Saints.” She argues that you shouldn't try to be a moral saint — someone who tries to make all their actions as morally good as possible. 

She writes, “If the moral saint is devoting all his time to feeding the hungry or healing the sick or raising money for Oxfam, then necessarily he is not reading Victorian novels, playing the oboe or improving his backhand. A life in which none of these possible aspects of character are developed may seem to be a life strangely barren.” How do you square that with your urge to be morally ambitious?

We are living in a world where a huge amount of people have a career that they consider socially meaningless and then they spend the rest of their time swiping TikTok. That's the reality, right? I really don't think that there's a big danger of people reading my book and moving all the way in the other direction.

There's only one community I know of where this has become a problem. It's the effective altruism community. In a way, moral ambition could be seen as effective altruism for normies.

Let's talk about that. I'm not an effective altruist, but I am a journalist who has reported a lot on EA, so I'm curious where you stand on this. You talk about EA in the book and you echo a lot of its core ideas. Your call to prioritize causes that are sizable, solvable, and sorely overlooked is a rephrase of EA's call to prioritize the “important, tractable, and neglected.” And then there's this idea that you shouldn't just be trying to do good, you should try to do the most good possible. So is being morally ambitious different from being an effective altruist?

So, I wouldn't say the most good. I would say, you should do a lot of good — which is different, right? That's not about being perfect, but just being ambitious. 

Effective altruism is a movement that I admire quite a bit. I think there's a lot we can learn from them. And there are also quite a few things that I don't really like about them. 

What I really like about them is their moral seriousness. I come from the political left, and if there's one thing that's often quite annoying about lefties it's that they preach a lot, but they do little. For example, I think it's pretty easy to make the case that donating to charity is one of the most effective things you can do. But very few of my progressive leftist friends donate anything. So I really like the moral seriousness of the EAs. Go to EA conferences and you will meet quite a few people who have donated kidneys to random strangers, which is pretty impressive.

The main thing I dislike is where the motivation comes from. One of the founding fathers of effective altruism was the philosopher Peter Singer, who has a thought experiment of the child drowning in the shallow pond…

That's the thought experiment where Singer says, if you see a kid drowning in a shallow pond, and you could save this kid without putting your own life in danger, but you will ruin your expensive clothes, should you do it? Yes, obviously. And by analogy, if we have money, we could easily save the lives of people in developing countries, so we should donate it instead of spending it on frivolous stuff.

Yes. I never really liked the thought experiment because it always felt like a form of moral blackmail to me. It's like, now I'm suddenly supposed to see drowning children everywhere. Like, this microphone is way too expensive, I could have donated that money to some charity in Malawi! It's a totally inhuman way of looking at life. It just doesn't resonate with me at all. 

But there are quite a few people who instantly thought, “Yes, that is true.” They said, “Let's build a movement together.” And I do really like that. I see EAs as very weird, but pretty impressive. 

Let's pick up on that weirdness. In your book, you straight up tell readers, “Join a cult — or start your own. Regardless, you can't be afraid to come across as weird if you want to make a difference. Every milestone of civilization was first seen as the crazy idea of some subculture.” But how do you think about the downsides of being in a cult?

A cult is a group of thoughtful, committed citizens who want to change the world, and they have some shared beliefs that make them very weird to the rest of society. Sometimes that's exactly what's necessary. To give you one simple example, in a world that doesn't really seem to care about animals all that much, it's easy to become disillusioned. But when you join a safe space of ambitious do-gooders, you can suddenly get this feeling of, “Hey, I'm not the only one! There are other people who deeply care about animals as well. And I can do much more than I'm currently doing.” So it can have a radicalizing effect. 

Now, I totally acknowledge that there are signs of dangers here. You can become too dogmatic, and you can be quite hostile to people who don't share all your beliefs. I just want to recognize that if you look at some of these great movements of history — the abolitionists, the suffragettes — they had cultish aspects. They were, in a way, a little bit like a cult.

Do you have any advice for people on how to avoid the downside — that you can become deaf to criticism from the outside?

Yes. Don't let it suck up your whole life. When I hear about all these EAs living in group houses, you know, they're probably taking things too far. I think it helps if you're a normie in other respects of your life. It gives you a certain groundedness and stability.

In general, it's super important to surround yourself with people who are critical of your work, who don't take you too seriously, who can laugh at you or see your foolishness and call it out — and still be a good friend.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Everyone hates Qatar's reported luxury plane gift to Trump — even the MAGA faithful","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-qatar-luxury-jet-maga-republicans-reaction-pushback-2025-5","Tue, 13 May 2025 16:16:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump may soon be receiving a luxury jet from Qatar, and even some of MAGA's most faithful are against it.

Multiple outlets on Sunday reported that the Qatari royal family is preparing to give the Trump administration a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, to be used as Air Force One in Trump's second term before being donated to his presidential library. Though the exact value of the specific jet in question — which is 13 years old, ABC News reported — isn't clear, a new 747-8 jumbo jet fetches a whopping $400 million.

Frequent Trump critics such as Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont have criticized the gift, but in a notable break, some of Trump's most ardent MAGA loyalists have also criticized the potential plane deal.

""I love President Trump. I would take a bullet for him,"" Laura Loomer, a conservative activist and longtime Trump ally, wrote on X on Sunday. ""But, I have to call a spade a spade. We cannot accept a $400 million 'gift' from jihadists in suits.""

""This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true. I'm so disappointed,"" she added.

Trump all but confirmed the news in a Truth Social post on Sunday.

""So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane. Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA,"" Trump wrote.

Meanwhile, Qatar's media attaché to the US, Ali Al-Ansari, told BI in a statement that the transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is ""currently under consideration."" The matter ""remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,"" Al-Ansari said.

Some other Trump supporters echoed Loomer's concerns.

Mark Levin, a radio host and Trump backer, took to X to accuse Qatar of spreading ""anti-American"" propaganda.

""Their jet and all the other things they are buying in our country does not provide them with the cover they seek,"" he wrote on the social media platform.

He later wrote ""Ditto"" in response to Loomer's post.

Conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro also weighed in on the controversy during a Monday episode of his self-titled podcast.

""Taking sacks of goodies from people who support Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood, al-Jazeera, all the rest, that's not America first. Like, please define America first in a way that says you should take sacks of cash from the Qatari royals who are behind al-Jazeera,"" he said, adding, ""If you want President Trump to succeed, this kind of skeezy stuff needs to stop.""

There's been little pushback among GOP lawmakers — for now at least.

But Rep. Warren Davidson, a conservative Republican from Ohio, seemingly alluded to the situation on X without specifically naming Trump.

""I recall trying to rally support for a thorough investigation of the Clinton Foundation,"" he wrote. ""It seemed odd that a Secretary of State / Senator / First Lady / Presidential candidate could collect hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign governments with no corruption. The appearance of corruption alone screams, 'Bad idea!'""

He continued: ""My views have not changed. At a minimum, 'Bad idea!'""

And on Fox News, Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky questioned the legality of the Trump administration accepting the Qatari plane, saying it's ""not worth the appearance of impropriety.""

Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott, a fervent Trump supporter, also voiced his concern about the safety of Trump flying on a plane from a country that has helped fund the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The news of the plane came ahead of Trump's planned visit to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates this week.

Legal experts told Business Insider the reported gift raises both ethical and constitutional concerns.

""Outside of the legal context, it is fair to ask whether the acceptance of this gift could give rise to an apparent conflict of interest or corruption,"" Jessica Levinson, a law professor and the director of the Public Service Institute at Loyola Law School, told BI.

The gift could also be a potential violation of the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause, which prohibits government officials from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign parties without consent from Congress.

Trump again defended the move on Monday, telling reporters the jet wouldn't be a gift to him personally, but to the Department of Defense.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House counsel David Warrington determined that gifting the jet would be ""legally permissible"" if it is transferred to Trump's presidential library before the end of his second term, ABC News said.

In 2019, during Trump's first term, Bondi lobbied on behalf of the Qatari government.

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement to BI: ""Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump's Administration is committed to full transparency.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","A retirement travel dream, deferred","https://www.businessinsider.com/retirees-planned-travel-retirement-too-late-expensive-2025-5","Tue, 13 May 2025 15:27:00 GMT","

They planned to spend their golden years traveling the world. Instead, they're spending their retirement cutting corners and finding creative ways to afford any trips at all.

Traveling wasn't unusual for Jim Laabs, a 72-year-old retiree from the Midwest. As a former regional sales director, Laabs spent 65% to 70% of his time on the road in the US and Canada.

Later in his career, his partner would join him. But as they approached retirement, they wanted to take it slower — and wondered if they could afford to be snowbirds for about five months a year in Southern California or Arizona, both states that are ""almost guaranteed"" to have warm weather during the winter, he told Business Insider.

When Laabs retired in 2022, they tested the concept for a month, spending roughly $5,000 on a 28-day stay at a two-bedroom home a short walk from Huntington Beach in Southern California.

But with costs rising each year, the couple has downgraded to cheaper accommodations and reduced their vacation days. He said it hasn't made much of a dent in their travel expenditures.

This year, they spent $3,100 for a one-bedroom suite in Phoenix, around 62% of what they spent on accommodation back in 2022, but this time for only a nine-day stay.

Laabs isn't alone in having to cut back on travel plans in retirement because of rising costs.

Business Insider spoke to several retirees and people planning for retirement who are reconsidering their dream to travel during retirement, whether that's cutting back or scrapping plans altogether.

In an AARP survey late last year of Americans who'd expressed an interested in traveling for pleasure in 2025, about 70% of respondents ages 50 and older said they were planning trips this year. But on average, those respondents weren't expecting to spend more on their trips than they did in 2024, and cost was the most commonly cited travel barrier among them.

Laabs and his partner have an annual travel budget of around $7,000.

He said it can already be ""a little bit of a challenge to cover"" their travel budget despite having what he describes as a ""comfortable, but not exorbitant"" retirement pot and receiving double what the average American gets for Social Security, since he began working young and retired at 69.

""We're going to live our life, and if we can make it work financially to do a week or two of cold weather to get out of the area, then we'll do that,"" he said. But travel ""would be one of the first things to go"" if they had to tighten up their budget.

Retirement was going to be Patty Sorell's chance to travel.

As a small-business owner in Boston, she would often work weekends and holidays running her balloon shop, so she didn't have time to go on vacation.

""I knew I wanted travel to be part of my life plan,"" the 62-year-old said. ""Something that happens when you own your own business is you hustle all the time, and when a job comes along, you take it because you don't know when the next job is going to come along.""

As she approached retirement in 2022, she invested in an RV to take more short-haul trips across the country. When she fully retired, though, she knew she wanted to travel internationally.

""Of course, I think everybody would love the fantasy of getting out and being a tourist more than they are,"" she said. ""Not all of us can do it, people have financial obligations, familial obligations. I thought I was going to be great, but I'm only 'pretty good' in terms of financials.""

More than a year into retirement, her fantasy is colliding with reality. Her travel funds for the next few years, which she describes as her ""fun money,"" are in the stock market.

""That's the stuff I want to make sure doesn't dip or crash, and that's what makes me nervous right now,"" Sorell said, referring to the stock market's wild swings in response to changing US policy on tariffs and the war in Ukraine.

""I can't pull my money out either, because pulling it out when it's down is the worst thing you can do,"" Sorell said.

Financial planners agree that investors shouldn't panic during downturns and exit the market at a loss.

In an annual Gallup survey last year, 62% of US adults reported having money invested in the stock market through mutual funds, individual stocks, or retirement funds — and older people hold the vast majority of those equities. An analysis of Federal Reserve data by Rosenberg Research released last year found that Americans 55 and older own about 80% of the US stock market.

Amid the wild market fluctuations this year, many retirees like Sorell and people nearing retirement are left wondering where they'll be left financially.

""One of the few things I can cut down on is travel,"" Sorell said. ""I'm not going to cut it out, but I can cut it down.""

Jake Falcon, the founder of Falcon Wealth Advisors, said that people who need money for bills, living expenses, or travel in the next five to 10 years should avoid parking that money in the stock market because volatility could affect those short-term goals.

He added that people shouldn't get too frustrated by the current economic environment because it will inevitably change.

For retirees who are feeling stretched but still want to travel, he recommended getting creative and looking off the beaten path.

Jeff Mayernik and his wife, Sandra, who both worked in real estate until 2023 and 2024, respectively, did just that when health issues prompted them to examine the age at which they could retire.

When doing the math and looking at savings, home equity, and future Social Security income, they discovered that at 59, they could retire within a year. Still, it came with a catch — they wouldn't be retiring in a fixed place.

""There are 100 countries where we can stay 90 days at a time, so let's go see them,"" Jeff, 61, said. ""We put together a plan, sold everything we owned, and hit the road with a couple of backpacks and a little suitcase.""

The couple sold all their belongings and a 5-acre property in Oregon that included three outbuildings. They set a spending target of around $40,000 a year, which includes all travel expenses as well as general expenditures such as insurance and cellphone costs.

""Year one, we went over budget,"" Sandra, 61, said. ""Year two, we'll be closer. We've learned some things, obviously, but it was less expensive than just living in a place somewhere in Oregon and not traveling.""

They decide which country to visit next based on affordability.

""We looked at Italy and went, 'Hmm, yeah, not this year for sure,'"" Jeff said. ""And so we put two months in Albania because the weather is similar, and it's a lot less expensive to rent a place for two months than it would be literally anywhere in Italy.""

Jeff said they plan to travel for at least two years before committing to a place to retire permanently — somewhere with a reasonable cost of living.

Kari Lemay, a 58-year-old corporate marketing executive, quit her job to travel the world with her retired partner, Bill, who is 70. They rely on their savings, investments, and income from a travel blog to fund trips, but increasing costs are eating away at their travel budget.

They're now downsizing to continue funding their trips by selling their five-bedroom house in Minnesota to buy a one-bedroom condo instead.

""My insurance is going up, my taxes are going up, therefore my mortgage payment — because it includes those things — is going up, and we're not even here that much,"" Lemay said.

Both Lemay and the Mayerniks run monetized travel blogs, AchieveYourBucketList and TheMobileRetiree, respectively. Lemay hopes her earnings from the blog will provide her with additional funds to travel for longer, especially since her retirement fund isn't as large as her partner's.

Having an income during retirement is one of the best things retirees who want to travel extensively can do, said William Gogolak, an assistant professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University who teaches courses on financial investing and analysis.

Those in their 40s or 50s who are planning to travel in retirement should start thinking about a part of their career they might be able to parlay into consulting work later in life, he said.

Some people nearing retirement age have begun to shift or delay their travel plans as they examine their finances more closely.

Suki Eleuterio and her partner, who initially bonded over their love of travel, have viewed their 401(k)s as their ticket to traveling the world once their two children, both under the age of 10, have flown the nest.

""Traveling with kids is very different than traveling as a couple,"" Eleuterio said. ""We tried to do the Disney thing a few years ago … that was very stressful. I did not feel that that was an adequate vacation for us as a couple, but I think the kids had a wonderful time. ""

""I'm looking forward to when we can also just travel just the two of us again,"" she said.

Eleuterio and her partner are both in their 40s and envisioned island-hopping in the Caribbean and eating like locals in Europe in their 60s, following in the footsteps of her partner's grandparents, who were ""big travelers"" and did much of the same as they got older.

Yet getting to check places off their travel wish list, hanging on a wall in their home, feels further and further away.

The couple has just a ""little nest egg"" after they used a large portion of their savings to buy a house in 2022, after nearly two decades of renting. That, combined with her partner losing their job late last year, means they're spending more cautiously and saving less.

As their debt creeps up and with the future of Social Security in doubt, Eleuterio said they wonder what their retirement will actually look like — ""Will we just be forced to keep working and working to pay off all the bills?""

As a result, the age at which they plan to retire keeps getting pushed back, Eleuterio said. Retiring in their late 50s or early 60s doesn't feel as attainable as it might have 10 years ago.

""It makes me think about, maybe, we should travel now a little bit, and get some of those things checked off our bucket list now, even if we do it with kids,"" Eleuterio said.

""What if it's actually about living your life now versus living your life later?"" she added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Bill Gates just taught Elon Musk an important lesson: Speed kills","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-bill-gates-leadership-lesson-international-aid-doge-2025-5","Tue, 13 May 2025 08:17:00 GMT","

What the spat between Elon Musk and Bill Gates reveals about ""efficiency.""

In one corner is the bespectacled tortoise, Bill Gates. In the other, the chainsaw-wielding hare, Elon Musk. Each has a very different idea about what it means to give back.

Gates plans to ramp up his foundation's charitable giving to causes like public health and education over the next two decades, whereas Musk has used the White House DOGE office to nearly halt the flow of US foreign aid spending in a blink and dismantle the US Agency for International Development, which he has called a ""criminal organization.""

To be sure, these billionaires have very different mandates — Musk to cut government spending, and Gates to eradicate preventable diseases and spend down his vast fortune. But as Gates opens up his wallet even more, he's also squaring off with Musk. Gates is using a prolonged road map compared with Musk's move-fast-and-break-things tech ethos that had him vowing to cut $2 trillion in government spending by employing methods from a startup playbook.

""Tech innovation works when a new widget disrupts the market for the old one,"" Michael Morris, a professor at the Columbia Business School, tells me in an email. ""Development programs work best when there is continuity, steadiness, predictability, assurance."" He says Gates' approach shows ""maturity in thinking through the problem."" That's a shift from when Gates was considered a sometimes combative and arrogant leader at Microsoft, even if he was heralded as a brilliant innovator. The Gates Foundation has been criticized, too, for lacking transparency and for some of its spending priorities. ""These days Gates looks like a sage compared to Musk and compared to the administration,"" Morris says.

Gates last week announced plans to unwind the Gates Foundation in the next 20 years, bringing the philanthropic effort to a close sooner than expected. But instead of cutting spending, he's increasing it: The foundation plans to distribute $9 billion in 2026, and Gates hopes the foundation will double the $100 billion it has given away since its founding in 2000 and donate another $200 billion to public health and education causes by December 31, 2045.

Meanwhile, in a matter of days DOGE pulled the rug out from under the USAID earlier this year. Funding was first disrupted, leading to confusion and chaos, and now more than 80% of USAID's tens of billions of dollars in contractual commitments have been cut. Organizations across the world that depended on money from the US have been scrambling to try to carry out their missions, which include providing emergency food to malnourished kids and medication for HIV prevention and treatment.

President Donald Trump set Musk loose to curtail the federal government's spending and waste via DOGE. In a move that many constitutional scholars say went beyond the administration's authority by circumventing Congress, the administration focused on slashing costs now, regardless of the long-term impact on the world's most vulnerable people. Gates' plan is different: It shortens the initial foundation's closure timeline with the intent of solving problems more quickly and rendering itself obsolete.

Part of the stark contrast between Musk and Gates stems from their different approaches to ""efficiency."" With DOGE, Musk has embodied the chainsaw approach that tech startups worship — focusing on being lean and doing more with less under a founder-mode-style leader. That doesn't necessarily translate well in government: Management experts previously told me they viewed DOGE's rollout as ""clumsy,"" ""wrongheaded,"" and full of ""political recklessness.""

The Gates Foundation's idea of efficiency is to provide humanitarian aid by using the data-driven mentality of the tech industry alongside expertise from organizations that work directly with people in need. When it comes to giving back, Fatema Sumar, an adjunct lecturer in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School, says Gates' effort ""is a replicable model of data-driven, country-aligned long-term philanthropy that others could follow, and so far, few do.""

It's no coincidence that the influx of funding comes as governments pull back, and Gates paired his announcement with jabs at Musk. ""He's the one who cut the USAID budget,"" Gates told The New York Times, saying Musk had put it ""in the wood chipper."" When the interviewer noted that Musk had attached himself to the Giving Pledge, a concept initiated by Gates and Warren Buffett 15 years ago to encourage wealthy people to donate the majority of their assets to charity, Gates said: ""The Giving Pledge — an unusual aspect of it that you can wait until you die and still fulfill it. So who knows? He could go on to be a great philanthropist. In the meantime, the world's richest man has been involved in the deaths of the world's poorest children.""

The two have been feuding over philanthropy for years. Walter Isaacson wrote in his biography of Musk that Gates visited Musk in 2022 and tried to convince him to give away more of his money. Musk told Gates that most philanthropy was ""bullshit,"" and that Gates could do more for the climate if he invested in Tesla stock, which Gates had shorted. Musk later told Isaacson that Gates was ""categorically insane.""

Over the past 25 years, money from the Gates Foundation has helped reduce the spread of preventable diseases, including HIV and tuberculosis, worldwide. The foundation estimates it has saved 82 million lives. DOGE's vision is one in which the problems of other countries don't fall on the shoulders of the US. Researchers from Boston University estimated that tens of thousands of people may have already died from tuberculosis or AIDS since USAID funding was disrupted. Gates' fortune allows him to fill gaps left behind by the US government. ""Much like Harvard's endowment empowers them to fight back on the attack on universities, Gates' endowment enables him to step in and provide some needed services that USAID had been providing,"" Morris says.

More money now rather than later is a more ambitious approach. Gates described to the Times how AI tools will bolster the foundation's goals to improve healthcare, education, and agriculture. ""Given that I have these resources, what can we achieve? It makes a big difference to take the money and spend it now versus later,"" he said.

A century ago, the world's richest men gave birth to modern philanthropy by setting up charitable foundations that still exist, including the Rockefeller Foundation and two dozen organizations that bear Andrew Carnegie's name. Today's tech billionaires, the modern equivalent of the industrialist titans, have the opportunity to make an even bigger impact, thanks to rapid advances in medicine and technology — but few have. Gates himself has said that his foundation can't assume the philanthropic responsibilities of governments alone.

""Gates, like Carnegie and Rockefeller a century ago, defines an era,"" Sumar says. ""But today's tech giants haven't matched yet his global ambition, and the world can't afford more people on the sidelines right now.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","$6 billion Commure was just ordered to stop selling a hot healthtech product in its latest legal challenge","https://www.businessinsider.com/6-billion-commure-ordered-stop-selling-healthtech-product-lawsuit-strongline-2025-5","Tue, 13 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

$6 billion healthcare startup Commure has been ordered to stop making one of its most historically successful products in a legal face-off with the tech's creators.

Commure, the startup cofounded by General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja and incubated by the VC firm, has been embroiled in legal turmoil for over a year with the makers of its former workplace safety tech, Strongline.

Canopy Works created the technology behind Strongline, a wearable panic button for hospital staff that was once Commure's best-selling product. Canopy severed its ties with Commure in 2023, after which Commure released an ""upgrade"" to Strongline called Strongline Pro.

Canopy alleged in a lawsuit against Commure in the Northern District of California that Commure's Strongline Pro was a derivative of Canopy's Strongline, which violated the companies' contract. Now, a federal district court has sided with Canopy and ordered Commure to stop selling Strongline Pro.

The court's preliminary injunction, filed on April 25 in the Northern District of California and made public Friday afternoon, prohibits Commure from distributing or marketing Strongline Pro to new customers, at least while the underlying breach of contract case proceeds.

It's a big win for Canopy, which says it's lost business as hospital customers ""upgrade"" from Canopy's Strongline to Commure's Strongline Pro. Strongline's business was Commure's sole growing revenue source at the time of its $6 billion merger with fellow General Catalyst portfolio company Athelas, as Business Insider reported in September. It's unclear how much revenue Strongline Pro now contributes to Commure or how much that revenue could be affected by the court order.

""This injunction validates the years of dedicated R&D and significant investment Canopy has poured into its unique healthcare safety platform,"" A Canopy spokesperson said in a statement to BI. ""This ruling provides certainty for our customers, confirming they are partnered with the creator of this technology and can trust the integrity and performance of the Canopy system safeguarding their employees.""

Commure has asked the court to delay the injunction's enforcement. In a statement to BI, Commure SVP and General Manager Dan Warner said he expects the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the injunction, adding that ""the law and facts are firmly on Commure's side,"" and that Commure developed Strongline Pro entirely in-house.

For its part, Commure has expanded well beyond its workplace safety product in the past year. The startup has signaled its intentions to dig deeper into healthcare AI following its acquisition of revenue cycle management company Athelas, buying ambient scribing company Augmedix in July 2024 for $139 million in cash, and scooping up another General Catalyst portfolio company, AI-powered care coordination platform Memora Health, in December.

General Catalyst is also closing a deal to buy Akron, Ohio-based health system Summa Health. The firm has said it plans to integrate healthcare technology into the hospitals' operations, an endeavor that would likely include Commure's tech.

Commure and Canopy created their first agreement to make Commure a reseller of Canopy's technology in 2019.

In 2022, Commure bought the rights to white-label and sell Strongline's wearable panic buttons for hospital staff. Canopy Works, then known as SMP Labs, remained a separate company and retained ownership of the intellectual property.

Tensions quickly escalated after the acquisition. In late 2022, Commure sued Canopy when the company tried to terminate its partnership with Commure. Canopy had cited delayed payments as a reason for breaking away from the startup.

That lawsuit was dismissed and later settled, but the damage was done. By December 2023, Canopy spun out for good as a new company to sell its safety technology directly to health systems.

Commure moved quickly to rebuild its workplace safety business, launching Strongline Pro just days after Canopy's debut. Commure positioned Strongline Pro as a successor to the original Strongline product, although filings with federal regulators showed substantial similarities between the two devices, per BI's September reporting.

Commure holds that ""Strongline Pro was developed independently by Commure without using any information from Canopy,"" per the Friday injunction.

After Canopy's exodus, Commure filed a lawsuit against Canopy in April 2024, alleging that Commure had contributed to the development of Strongline's original concept and that Canopy had violated its contractual obligations to provide its tech to Commure through the end of the year. Commure also raised concerns about alleged security vulnerabilities in Canopy's technology.

As ordered in the injunction, existing Strongline Pro customers can continue to use Strongline Pro, but Commure cannot upgrade those systems or contract with new Strongline Pro customers.

In his statement to BI, Commure's Warner also referenced a prior civil decision in which he said a judge ruled that a Canopy employee, who previously worked at Commure, had misappropriated Commure's confidential information for Canopy's benefit. Warner said the ruling ""confirms that Commure, not Canopy, is the party harmed in this dispute."" BI could not independently review the filing as it has not been made public.

A Canopy spokesperson said in response that the arbitration was a separate issue with one of Commure's former employees that is ""completely unrelated to the ongoing litigation with Canopy.""

The irreverent animation factory once cranked out hits, talent and profits. But with David Zaslav's retreat from streaming kids programming, the future of the network is in question.

One night in August, a group of animators headed out on foot through the streets of Burbank, California, cloaked in Mission: Impossible-style black outfits. At about 10 p.m., the crew arrived at its destination, a deserted office disconcertingly close to the neighborhood police station. For decades, the building had served as the bustling studio of Cartoon Network, which, like much of the cable universe, has fallen on challenging times. Until recently, the facility was a place where young animators daydreamed of launching their creations into the world. Now it sat empty and foreboding—another reminder of the grisly cost cuts that had been sweeping through Cartoon Network's parent company, Warner Bros.

Chip Wars:

The Trump administration is preparing to announce a deal granting Saudi Arabia more access to advanced semiconductors, paving the way for increased data center capacity in the Gulf nation despite concerns from some US officials about its ties to China, according to people familiar with the matter. 

The agreement would boost Saudi Arabia's ability to buy chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which are considered the gold standard for training and running artificial intelligence models, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential conversations. President Donald Trump is in Riyadh Tuesday, kicking off a broader Middle East trip, and he could announce the deal as soon as this week.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

The U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria, President Donald Trump announced Tuesday.

""I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,"" Trump told a packed auditorium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the first appearance of his four-day visit to the Middle East.

""In Syria, which has seen so much misery and death, there is a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace. That's what we want to see,"" he said in a wide-ranging speech that focused on his own time in office and U.S. relations with the Middle East.

""In Syria, they've had their share of travesty, war, killing many years. That's why my administration has already taken the first steps toward restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in more than a decade,"" Trump said.

Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979. Additional U.S. sanctions were imposed on the country in 2004 and again in 2011, after the regime of then-President Bashar Assad launched a brutal crackdown on anti-government uprisings.

In the roughly 14 years since, the country has been devastated by civil war, sectarian violence and brutal terrorists attacks, including the Islamic State takeover of parts of the country in 2014 and subsequent Western-led bombing campaign to eradicate the extremist group.

The toppling of the Assad regime during a shock offensive by anti-Assad militia groups in December of 2024 stunned the global community, and brought about the prospect of a new beginning for the devastated country. Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa — a former al-Qaeda member who describes himself as reformed — currently leads the country's transitional government.

The sanctions on Syria were ""brutal and crippling,"" Trump said, suggesting that they no longer served an important function. ""Now, it's their time to shine,"" he said of the country. ""We're taking them all off.""

""So I say, Good luck Syria. Show us something very special, like they've done, frankly, in Saudi Arabia.""

Microsoft on Tuesday said that it's laying off 3% of employees across all levels, teams and geographies.

""We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.

The company reported better-than-expected results, with $25.8 billion in quarterly net income, and an upbeat forecast in late April.

Microsoft had 228,000 employees worldwide at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees.

It's likely Microsoft's largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said.

One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said. In January Amazon announced that it was getting rid of some employees after noticing ""unnecessary layers"" in its organization.

Last week cybersecurity software provider CrowdStrike announced it would lay off 5% of its workforce.

In January, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts that the company would make sales execution changes after the company delivered slower growth than expected in Azure cloud revenue that wasn't tied to artificial intelligence. Performance in AI cloud growth outdid internal projections.

""How do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?"" Nadella said. ""At a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don't keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation.""

On Monday, Microsoft shares ended trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July.

ESPN's new streaming application, featuring everything the sports media arm of Disney has to offer, will cost $29.99 per month.

The service, which will take the ESPN name, as CNBC reported last week, will be heavily discounted when bundled with Disney's other streaming services, Disney+ and Hulu. The three services, with ads, will cost $35.99 per month when purchased together.

For users who sign up at the time of ESPN's launch this fall, the price of that bundle will fall to $29.99 per month for the first 12 months. In other words, ESPN customers will effectively get Disney+ and Hulu for free for the first year.

An annual subscription to the ESPN streaming service will cost $299.99. 

""Our priority is looking at the 60 million households on the sidelines,"" ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said Monday during a media event. 

The ESPN application will include all of the network's live games; programming on other ESPN cable networks such as ESPN2 and the SEC Network; ESPN on ABC; fantasy products; new betting tie-ins; studio programming; documentaries; and more.

The new service differs from ESPN's current streaming product ESPN+, which does not include some of the most-watched live games (such as the full slate of ""Monday Night Football"") that currently air on traditional pay TV.

ESPN+ will remain a less expensive offering for consumers, functioning as the entry tier for ESPN customers who don't want the entire service. However, Pitaro added the company will prioritize upgrading current ESPN+ subscribers to the all-access service. 

ESPN+ costs $11.99 per month and can be bundled with Disney+ and Hulu for $16.99 per month with commercials.

As CNBC reported last week, Pitaro decided to name the application ""ESPN"" to simplify what has become a cluttered streaming world, filled with different media products that can be bundled with other services at different price points.

Later this year, ESPN's mobile application will be reimagined and act as the gateway to the all-access service on smart TVs and devices. The revamped app, which will include new features such as a personalized ""SportsCenter,"" will be available to all users — not just those who purchase ESPN's $29.99 direct-to-consumer product.

Pay TV subscribers who already get ESPN will automatically be able to authenticate into the new app to get the digital bells and whistles that are not available through cable TV.

Customers who purchase ESPN outside of the cable bundle will also receive ESPN+.

Disclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.

Elon Musk said Saudi Arabia has approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use in the region, speaking at an investment forum during a White House-led trip to the kingdom on Tuesday.

Starlink is the satellite internet service owned and operated by Musk's aerospace and defense contractor, SpaceX.

SpaceX recently began offering its Starlink hardware for free outside the U.S. in a bid to win new subscribers.

Musk also briefly discussed his other business ambitions in the region, promising to bring Tesla robotaxis to Saudi Arabia at an unspecified date.

""I think it would be very exciting to have autonomous vehicles here in the kingdom, indeed, if you're amenable,"" Musk said.

Musk also said he showed several of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots, now in development, to Trump and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. 

Tesla has been telling investors for years that self-driving cars and humanoid robots are the key to its future profits.

Tesla's Optimus is not yet in production and competition abounds in humanoid robotics.

The Tuesday event featured President Donald Trump and U.S. tech executives from companies involved in artificial intelligence, defense and semiconductor manufacturing.

At the same event, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the U.S. chipmaker will sell over 18,000 of its latest artificial intelligence chips to Saudi Arabian company Humain.

The Trump and tech executives' visit to Saudi Arabia comes as the White House works to strike trade deals following the President's sweeping, and ever-changing, trade and tariff policies.

Trump received a lavish welcome from the oil power, and secured a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the U.S. on Tuesday. He also agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, the White House said in a statement.

In addition to his collection of companies, Musk has been a key adviser to Trump, running the Department of Government Efficiency, an initiative where he has steeply slashed jobs, regulations, funding and other resources at federal agencies, including those tasked with oversight of his businesses.

Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding Company and the private office of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal own a stake in Elon Musk's newest major venture, xAI, which he recently merged with X (formerly Twitter).

In 2022, when Musk led a leveraged buyout of the social network now known as X, Senate Democrats had called for investigations into Saudi Arabia's role in that deal citing national security concerns.

Nvidia will sell more than 18,000 of its latest artificial intelligence chips to Saudi company Humain, CEO Jensen Huang announced Tuesday.

The announcement was made as part of a White House-led trip to the region that includes President Donald Trump and other top CEOs.

The cutting-edge Blackwell chips will be used in data centers totaling 500 megawatts in Saudi Arabia, according to remarks at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh on Tuesday. Nvidia said its first deployment will use its GB300 Blackwell chips, which are among Nvidia's most advanced AI chips at the moment, and which were only officially announced earlier this year.

Tuesday's announcement underscores the importance of Nvidia's chips as a bargaining tool for the Trump administration as countries around the world clamor for the devices, which are used to train and deploy advanced AI software such as ChatGPT.

""I am so delighted to be here to help celebrate the grand opening, the beginning of Humain,"" Huang said. ""It is an incredible vision, indeed, that Saudi Arabia should build the AI infrastructure of your nation so that you could participate and help shape the future of this incredibly transformative technology.""

Nvidia shares rose more than 5% in trading on Tuesday.

Last week, the Department of Commerce said that it was going to scrap what it called President Joe Biden's rule, and implement a ""much simpler rule."" Nvidia has also been required to seek an export license for its AI chips since 2023 because of national security concerns. 

Humain will be owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and will work on developing AI models as well as building data center infrastructure, according to a press release. Humain's plans eventually include deploying ""several hundred thousand"" Nvidia graphics processing units.

""Saudi Arabia is rich with energy, transforming the energy through this giant versions of these Nvidia AI supercomputers, which are essentially AI factories,"" Huang said.

AMD said on Tuesday that it would also supply chips to Humain as part of a deal to build 500 megawatts of AI capacity. AMD said that Humain has committed $10 billion to the project. AMD stock rose 4% during trading on Tuesday. 

Trump praised Huang for appearing at the event on Tuesday, contrasting him with Apple CEO Tim Cook, who wasn't in attendance. Apple declined to comment. 

""Thank you very much, Jensen,"" Trump said. ""I mean, Tim Cook isn't here, but you are.""

In this article

WARREN, Mich. — General Motors expects to pioneer a new ""groundbreaking"" EV battery technology that the automaker says will reduce costs and boost profitability of its largest electric SUVs and trucks.

GM is targeting the new batteries and chemistry inside them — called lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cells — to be used in full-size electric vehicles such as its Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ beginning in 2028.

The new batteries use more-prevalent, less-expensive minerals like manganese instead of larger amounts of cobalt and nickel that are currently used in EV batteries from GM and other automakers.

Different EV battery chemistries impact everything from the range and safety of EVs to energy efficiency and charging capabilities, among other needs.

""LMR unlocks the premium range and performance at an affordable cost,"" said Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, during a media event at the automaker's tech and design campus in suburban Detroit. ""It's a game-changing battery for electric trucks.""

GM's first-to-market expectations come after crosstown rival Ford Motor earlier this month announced its intention to launch what it similarly called ""game-changing"" LMR batteries before 2030.

LMR batteries have been around for decades, but they've historically offered a far shorter lifespan, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at auto advisory firm Telemetry.

It's a problem GM believes it has solved with its LMR batteries, which are being developed in partnership with LG Energy Solution.

Ultium Cells, a GM and LG Energy Solution joint venture, plans to start commercial production of LMR prismatic cells in the U.S. by 2028, with preproduction expected to begin at an LG Energy Solution facility by late 2027.

Prismatic cells references the form, or shape, of the square battery cells. They've historically been used in hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius, followed more recently by EVs.

GM, for several years, has been using rectangular ""pouch"" cells in the U.S., while also also utilizing cylindric cells in China. GM says it first started researching manganese-rich lithium-ion battery cells in 2015, accelerating the technology development in recent years.

GM expects the new prismatic LMR batteries and supporting technologies to cut hundreds of pounds from its large EVs. The new battery packs will have 50% fewer parts as well as a significant reduction in the number of modules, or cell cases, inside the vehicles' battery packs, GM said.

For EVs, battery cells are typically combined into battery modules, which are then installed in battery packs that get integrated into a vehicle.

Kelty said the LMR batteries will be supplemental to GM's current pouch cell batteries, formerly known as Ultium, as well as upcoming LFP — lithium iron phosphate — prismatic battery cells that are expected to be used in smaller, entry-level EVs.

""We're going through a massive growth phase in our EV side of the business,"" Kelty said, noting that GM has surpassed Tesla as the top EV battery manufacturer in North America. ""We're really building a electrification powerhouse.""

GM expects the LMR prismatic battery cells to have 33% higher energy density, providing addition miles of range, compared with the best-performing LFP cells, but at a comparable cost.  

Kelty declined to discuss the specific cost of the batteries, commonly measured in dollars per kilowatt-hour, or kWh, but confirmed the company achieved a cost reduction of $60 per kilowatt-hour last year.

The average cost of battery packs for EVs dropped 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour in 2024, according to a BloombergNEF battery price survey released in December.

Abuelsamid, a former engineer turned analyst, estimates GM's packs with LMR prismatic batteries are likely around a cost of $80 to $90 per kWh. That compares with at least $125 per kWh for GM's current batteries, he said.

GM declined to disclose whether vehicles with LMR batteries will be profitable upon launch. The Detroit automaker said nearly 50% of its current EVs in the first quarter were variable profit positive, meaning they generated enough revenue to cover their production costs.

Kelty described LMR as the ""next step"" in GM's EV plans. The automaker has sunk billions of dollars into electrification as part of an ongoing, yet scaled back, plan under GM CEO Mary Barra.

In 2021, Barra said GM would exclusively offer EVs by 2035, investing $35 billion between 2020 and 2025. The company has since said customer demand — which has been slower than expected — will dictate its EV plans. It also has not disclosed its total EV investment thus far.

GM believes the LMR batteries will assist in lowering barriers for consumer adoption of EVs. Most notably, concerns around cost and range. Other hurdles, such as charging infrastructure and consumer education, remain.

GM aims to offer more than 400 miles of range in an electric truck while achieving significant battery pack cost savings compared with today's EVs.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff pause gives Temu and Shein a temporary window of opportunity to restock U.S.-based warehouses and re-evaluate their supply chain management, experts and insiders say.

On Monday, the U.S. and China agreed to lower tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days. The agreement included a so-called ""de minimis"" rule relaxation, effective May 14, which will see low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China now be taxed at a tariff rate of 54%, down from 120% prior.

Previous tariff rates had driven price hikes for U.S. consumers on Shein's platforms. Meanwhile, Temu halted shipments directly from China altogether, leading to some disruptions in fulfilling its U.S. orders. 

But the recent tariff cut has given them a chance to ramp up shipments from China and restock their warehouses and fulfill existing orders, supply chain experts say. 

""In the short term, [Temu and Shein] are definitely going to increase their shipment volume to the U.S.,"" said Anand Kumar, associate director of research at Coresight Research, adding that it will also help the companies reassess their long-term strategy. 

According to Jason Wong, who works in product logistics for Temu in Hong Kong, his company stalled shipments from China after the end of the ""de minimis"" exemption and relied on U.S. stockpiles to fulfil orders.

Under the latest tariff policy, Wong anticipates that bulk shipments subject to the 30% tariff rate will resume to the U.S., replenishing these stockpiles.

""[The] 30% is still high, but compared to 125%, 30% is basically nothing,"" he added.

The tariffs situation nevertheless remains more complicated for small-value packages under ""de minimis.""

The latest policy update retains a $100 flat fee per postal item, while scrapping a previously planned hike to $200 starting June, according to an executive order released by the White House on Monday.

According to Wong, for Temu to resume its small value shipments from China to the U.S., the tariffs still need to be relaxed further — something he expects will happen eventually. 

Shein has not said that it is ending direct shipments from China. However, it says on its platform that ""tariffs are included in the price you pay."" 

The reduction on tariffs of low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China could therefore result in the easing of some prices, said Coresight's Kumar.

In anticipation of changes to the ""de minimis"" exemption, Shein has also expanded its supply chains, building manufacturing operations in countries such as Turkey, Mexico and Brazil. It also reportedly plans to shift production to Vietnam.

Shein and Temu did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.

On May 2, Trump ended the ""de minimis"" exemption policy, which analysts had criticized as hurting local businesses and disguising illicit fentanyl trade. 

The small-package tariff exemption had helped Temu and Shein's maintain budget prices on the merchandise they shipped directly from China.

The U.S. government had briefly suspended the exemption in February before reinstating the provision days later, as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a spate of low-value packages.

U.S. rivals like Amazon, on whose platform many third-party sellers offload products sourced or assembled by Chinese manufacturers, are also expected to ramp up shipments during the 90-day window, trade experts said.

""All the companies are just going to scramble to get everything they can into the country as quickly as they can,"" said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consultancy firm Tidalwave Solution. ""Everybody's in the same boat.""

LONDON — European countries are preparing new sanctions on Russia despite a potential direct meeting for peace talks between Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, three sources told CNBC.

Ambassadors from the 27 EU member states are due to meet Wednesday to discuss what is likely to become the 17th package of measures against the Russian economy since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the sources said.

The package includes sanctions on a wider list of vessels that make up Russia's shadow fleet transporting Moscow's oil barrels — historically the backbone of Russia's revenues — as well as on individuals and companies that are deemed to be supporting the Kremlin's war in Ukraine. The measures could still be altered over the coming days.

European foreign affairs ministers are expected to greenlight the new sanctions next week, the sources noted.

One EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of discussions, told CNBC that, as of Monday, four member states still had ""study reserves"" on the list of measures — meaning they are still discussing the sanctions with their respective domestic administrations.

The same EU official said: ""Though Hungary is always a wildcard, it seems pretty much a done deal.""

CNBC has reached out to the Kremlin for comment. 

Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Hungary's spokesperson Zoltán Kovács reiterated the general view in Budapest that ""sanctions do not work.""

However, he signaled that, as long as the 17th package of sanctions does not include measures that would impact Hungary's energy sources, Budapest would likely have no issue approving it.

""We have always been sticking together with European colleagues,"" he said.

Hungary has often criticized EU measures against Russia, but has so far approved all of the sanctions.

EU sanctions must be endorsed unanimously, according to the bloc's policies. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has close ties with Moscow, in contrast to the majority of EU heads of state.

Separately, the Financial Times on Tuesday reported that the EU is preparing ways to overcome a potential veto, now or later, from Hungary on new measures toward Russia. One of the potential steps would be to move large portions of the sanctions, including 200 billion euros ($222 billion) in frozen Russian state assets, to a different legal basis.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, told CNBC on Tuesday that it would not comment on this report.

The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, who leads conversations within the EU on new sanctions on Russia, reportedly told reporters last week that the bloc has alternatives if Hungary decides to use its veto power, according to the Kyiv Independent.

A second EU official, who also did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic, confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday that discussions have taken place among member states ""for a while"" on how to protect the frozen Russian assets as part of the broader measures against Moscow. The EU has been using the proceeds from these assets to support Ukraine financially.

A third source, who also chose to remain anonymous, told CNBC that the European Commission has been considering how to overcome potential vetoes from Hungary. The same official said it seems unlikely that Hungary would oppose the 17th package of sanctions.

The first EU official quoted above confirmed to CNBC that the work on the 17th package of sanctions takes place regardless of potential talks between Putin and Zelenskyy later this week.

The Ukrainian president challenged his Russian counterpart to meet in person in Istanbul on Thursday, with White House leader Donald Trump, who has been attempting to broker peace between the warring nations, on Monday saying he might also attend.

Paula Pinho, spokesperson for the European Commission, said at a briefing Tuesday that the EU is looking into further possible sanctions beyond the latest package in case Russia does not agree and hold a ceasefire.

Prices have eased amid a slowing economy, but that might not last as new tariffs take effect.

Inflation rose 0.2% in April, for a year-over-year rate of 2.3%, which is slightly less than forecasted and coming in just below March's 2.4% pace, per Consumer Price Index data released Tuesday. The CPI tracks average monthly price changes for the goods and services Americans commonly buy.

Core inflation, a measure that strips out volatile food and energy prices and is viewed as a better gauge of underlying inflation trends, remained at 2.8%.

Both inflation rates are above the Federal Reserve's overall target of 2% — a sign that inflation is cooling but not fully under control.

Even so, costs have seemingly leveled out as the economy shows signs of slowing. Airfare prices have dipped, gas prices are easing, and used car prices continue to fall, per April's CPI data. While slowing prices is a relief for consumers, the trend may not last.

A new round of tariffs on most imports began raising costs for businesses in April. While some measures have been paused — including a Monday hold on additional tariffs for Chinese goods — many are now in effect, including a 10% baseline tariff on most countries.

For now, the full impact on consumer prices appears to be delayed. Many companies stocked up on goods earlier this year in anticipation of tariffs, hoping to avoid price hikes and supply disruptions. That buildup is helping cushion near-term price increases, according to recent guidance by RBC.

""Not all inventories will turn over immediately, so April is not capturing all of the price changes that may already be working their way through the system,"" says Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate. ""May and June data will be better reflections of the decisions businesses have made in light of both their higher costs and the most recently rolled out trade policies.""

Because of the lag in how tariffs affect prices, April's lower inflation reading is ""the calm before the storm,"" says Christopher Naghibi, chief operating officer at First Foundation Bank.

While many analysts expect inflation to rise in the months ahead, frequent changes in trade policy have added uncertainty to the forecasts. That said, businesses are expecting 3.9% inflation over the next year, according to a recent survey from the Cleveland Fed.

Accelerating inflation would create new uncertainty for the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates elevated in an effort to curb price growth by discouraging borrowing and spending. But if prices rise again, rate cuts could be delayed. That means borrowing costs would stay higher for longer.

Japanese auto giant Honda missed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings estimates as operating profit plunged 76%, with the company bracing for the full impact of U.S. tariffs.

Here are Honda's results compared with mean estimates from LSEG:

Honda's fourth quarter ends March 31.

For its financial year ended in March, revenue came in at 21.69 trillion yen, compared with the average estimate of 21.63 trillion yen from LSEG and marking a 6.2% rise year on year.

Operating profit fell 12.2% to 1.21 trillion yen, against the average LSEG estimate of 1.41 trillion yen.

Net profit for its full year declined 24.5% to 835.84 billion.

While its motorcycle business achieved record high sales volume and operating profit, Honda's automobile business saw a drop in sales, mainly in China and Southeast Asia.

Hybrid electric vehicle sales in North America, however, expanded due to higher EV incentives in the region.

Honda's results come amid trade tensions with the U.S., which has slapped a 25% tariff on foreign automobile imports.

In March, Honda had reportedly decided to produce its next-generation Civic hybrid in the U.S. state of Indiana, instead of Mexico, to avoid potential tariffs on one of its top-selling car models, Reuters reported.

According to U.S. car marketplace CarPro, Asian automakers made up six of the top eight automakers in the U.S. by sales volume in 2024, with Honda in fourth place.

In its earnings release, Honda had downgraded almost every financial metric for its current fiscal year ending in March 2026, compared with its latest full-year results. Its full-year operating profit is projected to fall almost 59% to 500 billion yen. Honda's projected net profit saw an even deeper cut at 70.1% lower, plunging to 250 billion yen, while revenue is expected to slip 6.4% to 20.3 trillion yen.

Japan's second-biggest automaker explained that the impact of tariff policies worldwide would be very significant on its business, with the frequent revisions making it difficult to formulate an outlook.

""Moving forward, we will carefully assess the impact of tariff policies and expand recovery measures while aiming for further growth in operating profit,"" the company said in its presentation.

Honda also changed its dividend policy from a dividend payout ratio to a ""dividend on equity,"" forecasting an increase of 2 yen per share to 70 yen per share for its current fiscal year.

Back in February, Honda and rival Nissan terminated talks over a $60 billion merger, which would have created the world's third-largest automaker by sales volume.

Nissan also reported its fourth-quarter results, with operating profit plunging by nearly 94% to 5.8 billion yen, while revenue remained flat.

The company swung to a net loss of 676 billion yen ($4.5 billion) in the fourth quarter, compared with a 101.3 billion profit in the same period the year before.

For the full year, operating profit plummeted by almost 88% year on year to 69.8 billion yen, with the company attributing it to a decrease in sales volume, an increase in sales incentives and inflation. Revenue for the full year came in nearly flat.

Nissan also announced a plan to save 500 billion yen over the next few years. Among the measures undertaken would be a headcount reduction of 20,000 workers and consolidating its production plants to 10 from 17 by March 2028.

TEGERNSEE, Germany — Top German business leaders, economists and politicians descended onto a small, picturesque Bavarian town situated next to the iconic Tegernsee lake last week to share their hopes and discuss what's at stake for the new government.

Buoyed by recent positive market sentiment for Europe's largest economy, attendees at the summit were united in their call for the new administration to step up and honour campaign promises. Any missteps would likely not be tolerated, with some business leaders warning the government cannot allow itself a ""lazy summer.""

Despite rain and low hanging clouds providing a somewhat dreary backdrop to the event, which has been dubbed the ""Davos of Germany,"" the promise of new beginnings enveloped the summit and the atmosphere was buzzing with excitement for potential changes the newly-appointed Chancellor Friedrich Merz could initiate.

Big expectations for the government were commonplace, with concerns about Germany's struggling economy and recent political turmoil seemingly having faded into the background.

The German DAX index is currently up over 18% since the beginning of this year, frequently hitting record highs in recent months. The German economy has however been in stagnation territory for over two years now, with tensions over economic, fiscal and budget policy in the previous ruling coalition and its eventual breakup continuing to weigh on expectations.

""There are very high hopes now on the new government,"" Patrick Trutwein, chief risk officer and chief operating officer at the IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, said during a panel moderated by CNBC's Annette Weisbach.

He said he was feeling positive about Germany's future considering the announcement of the major fiscal package enshrined in Germany's constitution, as well as further potential reforms ahead and ""an economy that's pretty robust and can build on its own ... productivity and competencies.""

Matthias Voelkel, CEO of Boerse Stuttgart Group, was among those feeling hopeful.

""If we look ahead and if they [the new government] do the right thing, I'm optimistic,"" he told CNBC.

Audi CEO Gernot Döllner meanwhile said in a fireside chat that he was hopeful that the new government would ""send an impulse into the German economy.""

The mood was also upbeat in Germany's auto sector, which has long been struggling with competition from China, pressures from the transition to electric vehicles and has recently been hit by U.S. tariffs.

""The Germans are back,"" Hildegard Müller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, told CNBC's Weisbach Friday. ""We are competitive,"" she added.

But amid the positive buzz, it was clear that observers are keeping a close eye on the governments every move.

""This new government in Germany cannot allow itself a political lazy summer, I'm sorry, they've got to work and they've got to work hard,"" said Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, chairman of Spitzberg Partners and former German politician.

Or as Veronika Grimm, member of the German Council of Economic Experts, told CNBC: ""A lot lies ahead for the government.""

Overal the message was clear: Germany needs to get its act together.

Alexander Horn, general manager of Eli Lilly's Germany arm — Lilly Germany — said the business strongly welcomes the new government's goals, but won't tolerate any caveats.

""Specifically we expect that the declarations of intent that are in the coalition agreement will be implemented quickly, speed plays an enormously big role,"" he said during a panel, according to a CNBC translation.

Boerse Stuttgart Group's Voelkel indicated his optimism relied on action from the government, saying he was looking for moves towards ""less bureaucracy, less anti-growth regulation, more innovation and particularly strengthening investment.""

The newly minted German government has set itself many of these points as policy goals, making promises to boost the country's economy, reduce bureaucracy and boost innovation and investment during the election campaign and in its coalition agreement.

""This country needs an economic turnaround. After two years of recessions the previous government had to announce again [a] zero growth year for 2025 and we really have to work on this,"" German economy minister Katherina Reiche told CNBC on the sidelines of the summit.

          / CBS News
        

A bitcoin mining firm backed by President Trump's son Eric will go public this year, the company announced Monday, deepening the Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency.

American Bitcoin — which lists Eric Trump as its co-founder and has its roots in a company backed by Donald Trump Jr. — is merging with the publicly-traded Gryphon Digital Mining. The all-stock transaction will allow the firm backed by the Trump brothers to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The merger is expected to close as early as the third quarter of this year.

The company's goals, according to an overview posted Monday, are to mine new bitcoin ""below market cost"" and to build up a reserve of the cryptocurrency.

""Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market,"" Eric Trump said in a statement.

American Bitcoin was launched in March, with crypto mining firm Hut 8 owning a majority stake. At the time, the company said it ""aims to become the world's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner."" It's the successor to American Data Centers, a venture backed by Eric Trump, his older brother Donald Trump Jr. and publicly traded Dominari Holdings.

Crypto mining also has a stamp of approval from Eric and Donald Trump Jr.'s father. The president pledged to make the United States a ""bitcoin mining powerhouse"" last year.

Mining is an essential part of how bitcoin operates. The currency isn't centralized, and instead relies on independent actors — known as miners — who carry out complicated math problems to verify bitcoin transactions and list them on a public ledger known as a blockchain. As a reward for this work, miners earn units of bitcoin for crunching the numbers successfully.

The value of a bitcoin stands at around $102,000, and the reward for mining decreases over time as the number of bitcoin in circulation increases, making mining a lucrative endeavor. 

But mining is controversial because it's extremely energy-intensive, with miners operating gigantic data centers filled with server racks that carry out the mathematical operations necessary to mine. A team from Cambridge University estimates bitcoin uses about 187.9 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, more than the entire country of Egypt.

The Trump brothers' foray into bitcoin mining marks the family's latest crypto venture. The president and his two eldest sons are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, which got a multi-billion dollar boost earlier this month from an Abu Dhabi-based firm, and Mr. Trump launched a highly volatile ""meme coin"" called $TRUMP in January.

Crypto investments make up about $2.9 billion of the family's net worth, one report estimates.

The Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency has drawn criticism for conflicts of interest. Last week, Senate Democrats blocked a crypto regulation bill from moving forward and pushed for it to include new limits on elected officials participating in some types of crypto ventures, with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accusing Mr. Trump of ""crypto corruption.""

The White House has pushed back on the criticism. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said last week Mr. Trump's ""assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin Price Forecast: Overbought RSI Indicates BTC Could Hit $140,000","https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-price-forecast-overbought-rsi-indicates-btc-could-hit-140000-heres-why-1518729","Tue, 13 May 2025 15:01:00 GMT","

The top crypto has seen gains of 23.3% during this period and its yearly performance swung to positive territory as a result.

Trading volumes have been quite high lately with $76 billion worth of BTC exchanging hands on May 7 along with $60+ billion flowing through the system on both May 8 and yesterday.

Open interest (OI) for BTC futures has now increased to its highest level since January 21. Interestingly, this was the date when Bitcoin reached its all-time high this year and then started a strong descent to a yearly low of $76,000 just a few months later.

When OI is at such high levels, a strong pullback typically occurs as market participants prompt a long squeeze to flush out excess leverage and gather enough liquidity to push the price higher.

Back in January, macroeconomic conditions were actually not unfavorable. However, the market was also taking a breather after a strong post-election rally that pushed BTC to its current all-time high.

Can a strong downtrend begin in the next few days? Let's look at Bitcoin's price action and historical patterns.

We have been keeping track of Bitcoin's price action in relation to its 21-day and 200-day EMAs, as a bullish crossover between the two indicators has resulted in big gains for the top crypto just a few months later.

The first time it happened in the time period covered by the chart, the price rose from around $27,000 to $72,000.

Meanwhile, the next instance that a ‘golden cross' occurred, the price rallied from $60,000 to $106,000, which is BTC's current all-time high.

However, it is worth noting that there have been some false positives along the way. These are bullish crossovers that don't end up propelling BTC to higher highs.

In a previous article, we shared a bullish price target of $140,000 if this turns out to be one of those crossovers that push BTC to new all-time highs. However, two other scenarios can still unfold where the outcome will be different.

The first is a weak crossover. This is a scenario where the rally does not manage to gain enough strength to push BTC to higher highs.

Interestingly, every time this happened, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) failed to reach overbought levels.

In contrast, the ‘golden crosses' that ended up propelling BTC to higher highs were followed by a strong push in the RSI to overbought territory.

In the case of our latest rally, this has already been the case as the RSI currently sits at 71 – meaning that the uptrend has gained strong momentum.

The second scenario that may result in a failed push to new ATHs is a post-overbought pullback. However, this is not necessarily bearish. In fact, it is often the necessary move that the market needs to make to raise enough liquidity to keep the rally going.

The most relevant support in all of these bullish scenarios has been the 200-day EMA. The price has only dropped below this marker one time in the instances that have pushed BTC to new all-time highs.

Hence, as long as the price stays above that threshold – or the price action pulls a bear trap, as it happened once – BTC will remain on track to reach this long-term target of $140,000 per token.

Ethereum rallied nearly 40% last week, climbing from around $1,800 to $2,500, as risk appetite returned to digital assets amid easing trade tensions and a major network upgrade. 

The rally has drawn renewed interest in Ethereum, though analysts say further gains may depend on stronger fundamentals.

U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of constructive talks with China, alongside a limited trade agreement with the U.K., helped drive macro optimism, lifting traditional equities on Monday. 

The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq posted their largest one-day gains in months, led by strength in tech and industrial stocks.

Digital assets, however, failed to sustain recent momentum. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana all declined on the day, with analysts pointing to profit-taking after last week's sharp rebound.

“There can be no doubt that the recent rebound in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana reflects renewed market optimism,” James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, told Decrypt.

“However, I do believe this could be a hollow rebound, as it is based on sentiment and the political moves of a single man,” he added. “Anyone who is serious about crypto would prefer that fundamentals are the driving force.”

That skepticism is being echoed in ETF flows. While Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded $600 million in net inflows last week, Ethereum ETFs saw $55 million in outflows. 

“The scale and strength of the price recovery, combined with modest outflows from Ethereum ETFs, suggest that crypto-native investors, rather than institutional inflows, have primarily driven the surge,” Matteo Greco, research analyst at Fineqia International, told Decrypt.

Ethereum's Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, has been a significant catalyst driving renewed interest in the world's second-largest crypto, analysts say.

The upgrade, among many other quality of life updates, improved staking limits and wallet usability.

“The ETH Pectra upgrade went live without issues, increasing confidence in Ethereum's ability to scale and paving the way for further institutional adoption,” Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive.xyz, told Decrypt.

Derive's models now assign a 20% probability that Ethereum will surpass $4,000 by Christmas, up from 9% last week. Volatility metrics also suggest the asset could remain more reactive than Bitcoin in the months ahead.

Still, Toledano noted: “Without sustained institutional momentum and further clarity on regulation, we may see consolidation before any new all-time highs are tested.”

In our previous update, we showed that per the Elliott Wave (EW) Principle, Ethereum (ETH) was completing the red Wave-c (W-c) as part of the large black W-4. See Figure 1 below. In this case, the 4th wave is, in EW terms, a running flat where the red W-c failed to go below the red W-a. Besides, from a technical pattern perspective, we also showed Ethereum is most likely forming a Bull flag pattern (black dotted lines). The flagpole was the rally from the 2020 low to the 2021 ATH. The flag is the sideways 4th wave pattern, and a breakout can then target $6100+.



Zooming in on the path since the December 2023 high, we were tracking a final wave lower for the completion of the red W-c to ideally around $1085, where the green W-5 would equal the length of the green W-1, measured from the green W-4 high: green dotted arrow. Moreover, that level was the 2.618x extension of W-1 measured from W-2. However, the bears could not push the price of Ether lower, and we were left with a failed 5th wave. This is why we stated,

“However, if ETH moves above at least the 50-d SMAs, the DT line, and $2093 without making a lower low first, we must consider the four-month-long downtrend complete and look towards the low $6000s over the next several months. As such, there's an increasingly favorable risk/reward setup in the making for those who would like to have exposure to Ethereum, contingent on holding above its 2019 high at $356.”



Yes, we don't sweat the small stuff as it prevents one from seeing the forest for the trees. Knowing that a larger correction is completing, and will be followed by a >400% gain, is much more important than focusing on the last few percentage points lower.

In our last update, ETH was in a strong downtrend. What a difference a month makes, as it is now in an uptrend:

The only obstacle in its way is the (red) 200-d SMA. However, based on our preferred short- and long-term EW counts and the rally's current strength, we view it as a temporary roadblock.

Thus, Ethereum failed to reach the ideal downside target of $1085, but the price levels we set out to watch gave us ample warning that the downtrend had ended. Besides, the risk/reward was heavily skewed towards reward. Moreover, the daily chart has flipped from bearish to bullish. ETH has therefore most likely wrapped up the more significant (black) 4th wave and is ready to embark on a multi-month five-wave move to at least $6100+.

Uniswap price falls for a third consecutive day after hitting its highest level in over two months. Open Interest also retreats but remains close to levels last seen in January.

The altcoin market has become difficult to navigate during Bitcoin's (BTC) bull cycle, with fragmented narratives, isolated rallies, liquidity crunches and colossal token unlocks.

XRP hits $2.65, but pares gains amid a crypto rally fuelled by a US-China trade deal. Under Paul Atkins's leadership, the SEC will develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets.

The cryptocurrency market has experienced a sharp downturn in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations surpassing $730 million, according to Coinglass data, as Bitcoin dipped below the $102,000 mark. 

Bitcoin price stabilizes around $103,000 on Friday after rallying nearly 10% this week. Risk-on sentiment prevails as Trump announced a trade deal with the UK and ahead of the meeting with China this weekend.

CryptoPunks Have New Home as Nonprofit Acquires Ethereum NFT IP From Yuga Labs

digital art

The Infinite Node Foundation, a newly established nonprofit endowment, announced Tuesday that it has acquired the IP of influential Ethereum NFT collection CryptoPunks from previous owner and Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs.

The Foundation, which announced a $25 million grant in April “to build the future of digital art,” will now steward the 10,000-piece Punks collection first created by Larva Labs in 2017, while Yuga Labs shifts back to its “apeish roots.”

CryptoPunks General Manager Natalie Stone told Decrypt that financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed. Stone will shift over from Yuga Labs to the Infinite Node Foundation, aka NODE, to serve as an advisor.

We are excited to announce CryptoPunks have found a permanent home at The Infinite Node Foundation. @nodefnd is a non-profit committed to the preservation and expansion of contemporary digital art.@larvalabs founders & artists Matt Hall & John Watkinson are returning to join… pic.twitter.com/0E2gk0RuyD

— CryptoPunks (@cryptopunksnfts) May 13, 2025



“CryptoPunks sparked a cultural movement that blended code, community, and commerce,” said Node Foundation Chair Micky Malka in a statement. “By pairing museum-grade conservation with an evergreen endowment, we intend to future-proof this landmark work and make it easier than ever for scholars, curators, and collectors to engage with it.”

The nonprofit's stewardship will focus on three core components: preservation, community, and expansion—aiming to maintain the collection's longevity, while developing new ways in which the pixel profile picture collection can be “studied, exhibited, and understood.”

The collection first changed hands in 2022 when Yuga Labs acquired the IP from original creator Larva Labs, alongside its Meebits companion collection (Yuga sold off the Meebits IP this February to a new startup).

“When Yuga acquired CryptoPunks' IP, it wasn't just about ownership—it was about honoring a cultural icon we believed in,” said Yuga Labs CEO and co-founder Wylie Aronow in a statement. “We've worked to elevate and protect their legacy, but we always knew Punks needed a permanent home built for preservation. Seeing that vision come to life with the NODE Foundation feels like a full-circle moment. They are best positioned to protect the Punks legacy.”

Aronow will join Art Blocks founder Erick Calderon and original CryptoPunks creators creators Matt Hall and John Watkinson of Larva Labs on an advisory board helping the Infinite Node Foundation to achieve its goals.

“The Punks were created to be truly decentralized, and have become a defining example of digital permanence and online network effects,"" Hall and Watkinson said in a statement. “The NODE Foundation was created to explain and promote these ideas as a new art medium, and are the perfect long-term home for the Punks.”

In collaboration with Hall and Watkinson, the Foundation's first move will be to host a major exhibition of the entire collection at its exhibition space in Palo Alto, California. 

The CryptoPunks price floor, or the lowest listed value of an asset on the marketplace, is up more than 19% on the week. It has jumped 74% in U.S. dollar denominations to $123,086 as the price of Ethereum has climbed nearly 45% over the same timeframe. 

Arguably the most prominent NFT collection of all time, and an inspiration to many collections that followed (including the Bored Apes), CryptoPunks trading volume has eclipsed more than $3 billion lifetime since its creation in 2017, according to data from Punks.wtf. The NFTs were originally given away via a free claim.

This week brought a wave of momentum across the altcoin market, fueled by Bitcoin's strength and growing optimism around macro developments like the recent U.S.-U.K. trade deal. The total altcoin market cap—including Ethereum—briefly surged more than 17% before cooling off late Friday, now sitting at $1.16 trillion. Here's a look at the five top-performing altcoins that led the charge.

The strong performances from altcoins this week highlight renewed confidence in the broader crypto market, but that excitement should be balanced with caution. Many of these assets remain well below their all-time highs—some still down over 70%.

Rather than reacting to short-term percentage spikes, investors would be wise to evaluate real-world utility, tokenomics, and long-term viability. Timing and patience remain key. Stick to your plan, manage your exposure, and remember: solid entries often come after the hype fades.

The altcoin market has become difficult to navigate during Bitcoin's (BTC) bull cycle, with fragmented narratives, isolated rallies, liquidity crunches and colossal token unlocks. However, in recent weeks, the altcoin market has signalled the potential for a major turnaround, accentuated by a sharp drop in the Bitcoin dominance. 

A recent K33 Research report states, ""a broad-based altseason is unlikely for now, as capital is concentrating into selective winners rather than lifting all tokens indiscriminately."" In other words, select crypto projects could rally extensively. At the same time, altcoins that do not exemplify real-world utility and market fit products or even those that fail to attract users could miss the altcoin season.

Altcoin season refers to a period in the crypto market when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperform Bitcoin, supported by prominent rallies across the board. The altcoin season begins when 75% of the top 50 coins, excluding stablecoins and asset-backed tokens, outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. According to Blockchaincenter.net, just 10 of the top 50 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This indicates that while early signs of an altcoin season are emerging, a full-fledged rally is likely still some way off.

Based on the altcoin market capitalization chart, a golden cross pattern is coming into play, exacerbating the dream for a full-fledged altcoin season. This pattern occurs when a short-term moving average, for example, 50-day, crosses above a long-term moving average, such as the 200-day, thus signaling a high probability of the market moving into a substantial uptrend.

As observed on the chart below shared by crypto analyst and investor OxNobler on X, a golden cross is coming into play for the first time since 2021. Following the pattern, altcoins experienced broad-based rallies, with the altcoin market capitalization springing up to $1.67 trillion from slightly below $150 billion. If history repeats, the golden cross could usher in a major rally across the altcoin market for the first time in four years.

Bitcoin's price has sustained strong bullish momentum since the April 7 tariff-triggered crash low of $74,508 to $105,819 on Monday, demonstrating renewed strength driven by macro tailwinds, including easing trade and tariff tensions, and the dovish Federal Reserve's (Fed) stance on the policy informing decisions on interest rates. The bounce back aligns with broader risk-on sentiment that has seen Bitcoin outperform equities.

""Capital rotation into Bitcoin appears sustained, as reflected in the realised cap, reaching a new all-time high and ETF inflows exceeding $920 million over the past two weeks. On-chain data also confirms a significant drop in coins held at a loss, with over 3 million BTC returning to profit,"" the latest Bitfinex Alpha report stated.

Bitcoin upholds a solid technical structure, reinforced by surging spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) inflows and institutional interest. Short-term drawbacks will likely be absorbed quickly as investors buy the dip, potentially resulting in a sustained leg up to fresh highs.

BTC/USDT daily chart 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), representing BTC's market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap, sharply dropped to 62.2% from the May 7 peak of 65.37%. The decline occurred following a market-wide rally on risk-on sentiment due to progressive trade talks between the United States (US) and China. 

A decline in Bitcoin dominance often signals an altcoin season because capital flows from BTC into altcoins. The capital rotation, in turn, drives altcoin rallies. In 2021, Bitcoin dominance peaked at 73.62% before correcting, boosting altcoin rallies. As BTC.D expands, the buzz across the market is that a reversal could be imminent, with the altcoin season likely to start thereafter.

BTC.D weekly chart

The ETH/BTC ratio has persistently plummeted from the December 2022 peak of 0.0881, reflecting a heavy altcoin market compared to the strong tailwinds on Bitcoin. Historically, this trading pair has been viewed as a bellwether indicator for altcoins' performance, with a persistent downtrend suggesting that widespread rallies in altcoins are a pipe dream, at least in the short term.

ETH/BTC weekly chart 

However, a massive rally in Ethereum (ETH) from the April 7 low of $1,385 to highs around $2,621 triggered a reversal in the ETH/BTC trading pair after testing 0.0176, a level last tested in December 2019. The ratio currently stands at 0.0239, reflecting a 26.4% increase, portraying Ethereum's growing strength relative to Bitcoin. 

Meanwhile, ETH/USD exchanges hands at $2,460 at the time of writing, reflecting changing dynamics in the market and the need for traders to respond to price movements and developments in the broader market with speed and accuracy.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

Brave Wallet, the crypto wallet integrated into the privacy-focused Brave web browser, will soon support the Cardano blockchain, allowing users to send, receive and swap ADA ADA$0.81796 and Cardano-native assets directly.

The move comes as Brave deepens its multichain functionality beyond existing support for networks like Ethereum and Solana, according to a release from Input Output (IO), which develops applications for and supports the Cardano network. 

Once the integration is complete, users will be able to access Cardano governance features, sign transactions and manage assets without relying on third-party browser extensions.

Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IO, described the rollout as part of a broader effort to support secure and private on-chain participation. He emphasized its relevance as Cardano enters the Voltaire era, a phase focused on decentralized governance.

Brave Wallet's upcoming support also lays the groundwork for future work involving Midnight, IO's privacy-focused blockchain project built around confidential smart contracts and data protection.

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson explores the possibility of developing a privacy-enabled stablecoin on the Cardano network. 

Speaking in a recent interview on the Conversations with Leaders podcast, Hoskinson hinted at plans to develop a privacy stablecoin on Cardano. According to him, traditional stablecoins have the inherent flaw of publicizing every transaction on the blockchain, making them traceable. 

He asserted that some users may not be comfortable with traditional stablecoins due to their lack of privacy. Therefore, he suggested that users might want a privacy-enabled stablecoin that keeps their purchases discreet. 

Notably, the Cardano founder proposed an initiative he termed ‘selective disclosure and season freeze regime' for stablecoins. He suggested that these solutions would enable users to shield their stablecoin-related transactions, including counterparties and amounts, from the public. 

Despite this, regulators can still access these transactions through a regulatory directive or court order. However, it will not sabotage the privacy model of the stablecoins. 

Further, Hoskinson echoed his support for privacy stablecoins with selective disclosure, adding that Cardano might be the first blockchain to roll out one. 

Thanks to its privacy-focused sidechain, Midnight, Cardano could become one of the first blockchains to launch a stablecoin that keeps users' transactions private. 

The stablecoin market has grown tremendously over the years, boasting a valuation of $245.61 billion. Most of the leading stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, are currently available on blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Solana. 

Cardano also supports a handful of stablecoins, like DJED, USDA, and USDM. According to data from DeFiLlama, stablecoins on the Cardano network have a combined market cap of $31.69 million. 

At the moment, transactions involving these stablecoins, including those on Cardano and Ethereum, are visible on the blockchain. 

Hoskinson believes some users might not be comfortable with this lack of privacy, so he is considering introducing a privacy-enabled stablecoin with selective disclosure functionality. 

Meanwhile, regulators have remained cautious about privacy-focused projects like Monero and Zcash. Although these projects have tried to balance regulatory demands with user privacy, multiple crypto exchanges, including Binance and OKX, have delisted them from their platforms. 

The EU recently prohibited exchanges and custodial platforms from engaging with privacy-focused tokens and anonymous wallets starting July 1, 2027. 

In the United States, lawmakers failed to pass the highly anticipated stablecoin regulation, the GENIUS Act, due to financial stability concerns. Despite this regulatory bottleneck, Hoskinson believes a privacy-enabled stablecoin on Cardano is possible.

LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - FOX5 learned new information about a kidnapping and crypto-robbery in November last year.

Three teenagers are accused of kidnapping a man at gunpoint after he returned home from hosting a crypto event in downtown Las Vegas. They were identified as Belaf Mohamed Ashraf, Austin Jay Fletcher and Hassan Elsama Hassan by Las Vegas Metro Police.

The teens are accused of forcing the victim to hand over his passwords and abandoning him in the desert. Police say they stole $4 million in cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens.

The teens then took the victim to a remote desert area in Arizona, about 26 miles away from the state border where he was released. 

The victim told police he walked five miles to the nearest gas station and called police. The suspects were arrested and are now being tried as adults.

﻿Yuga Labs says a digital art foundation is a better steward for CryptoPunks

﻿Yuga Labs says a digital art foundation is a better steward for CryptoPunks

by  Jess Weatherbed

It would seem that the money-making days for CryptoPunks, one of the oldest and most valuable NFT brands, are well and truly over. After acquiring the non-fungible token collection from Larva Labs in 2022, Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs is now selling CryptoPunks to Infinite Node Foundation — a non-profit focused on preserving digital art.

CryptoPunks, alongside brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoKitties, is frequently credited for kicking off the NFT craze in 2021. Several tokens have been sold for millions, including one in 2022 that was purchased for more than $23 million worth of Ethereum cryptocurrency, but the sales charts have largely stagnated since. 

Details for the purchase are slim. CryptoPunks general manager Natalie Stone told The Verge that the terms of the deal won't be disclosed, and that the brand will be stewarded by the Node Foundation, with no plans to integrate the CryptoPunks token collection into the gamified Otherside metaverse that Yuga Labs is developing. “Yuga is still one of the biggest holders of Punks, and like all other CryptoPunks NFT holders, will retain the right to its CryptoPunks characters under the IP license,” said Stone.

It was also never clear how much Yuga Labs spent to acquire CryptoPunks in its heyday, but being sold to a non-profit is probably not a good sign for, well, profitability. Now that NFT's are a shambling shadow of their former glory, the focus is turning to making CryptoPunks relevant in the mainstream art industry.

“We've worked to elevate and protect their legacy, but we always knew Punks needed a permanent home built for preservation,” Yuga Labs co-founder Wylie Aronow said in the announcement release. “Seeing that vision come to life with the Node Foundation feels like a full-circle moment. They are best positioned to protect the Punks legacy.”

Node Foundation chair Micky Malka said that “CryptoPunks sparked a cultural movement,” and that the non-profit intends to “future-proof this landmark work” and make it more accessible for scholars, curators, and collectors to engage with. Node is planning to showcase all 10,000 CryptoPunks tokens at the foundation's permanent exhibition space in Palo Alto, and in the “Infinite Images: The Art of Algorithms” exhibit at the Toledo Museum of Art.

Stock Analysis

 If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues.  Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed.  Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return.    Although, when we looked at ICO Group (HKG:1460), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.    

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

 If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.  To calculate this metric for ICO Group, this is the formula: 

 Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 

0.062 = HK$39m ÷ (HK$961m - HK$339m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).

 Thus, ICO Group has an ROCE of 6.2%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 6.1%, it's still a low return by itself.

 While the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above.  If you want to delve into the historical earnings , check out these free graphs detailing revenue and cash flow performance of ICO Group. 

 The returns on capital haven't changed much for ICO Group in recent years.   The company has employed 47% more capital in the last  five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 6.2%.   This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.   

 Another point to note, we noticed the company has increased current liabilities over the last  five years. This is intriguing because if current liabilities hadn't increased to 35% of total assets, this reported ROCE would probably be less than6.2% because total capital employed would be higher.The 6.2% ROCE could be even lower if current liabilities weren't 35% of total assets, because the the formula would show a larger base of total capital employed.  With that in mind, just be wary if this ratio increases in the future, because if it gets particularly high, this brings with it some new elements of risk.    

 In conclusion, ICO Group has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased.         And in the last  five years, the stock has given away 37% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon.    Therefore based on the analysis done in this article, we don't think ICO Group has the makings of a multi-bagger.    

 ICO Group does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.

Home | Brit | GB News failed to comply with data request from Narinder Kaur, says ICO

GB News have been told to conduct an internal review after the UK's data watchdog ruled the channel broke the law, by failing to hand over personal information to broadcaster and social commentator Narinder Kaur.

52-year-old Kaur, a former regular commentator on GB News, submitted a Subject Access Request (SAR) in March 2024, a legal process where organisations have to disclose the personal data they hold on an individual. Under UK data protection law, GB News had one month to respond. Instead, the channel stalled for months. Despite acknowledging receipt of the request, it failed to provide a full response altogether.

Following an official complaint, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has now ruled that GB News “failed to comply with its data protection obligations.”

The ICO has given the broadcaster 14 calendar days to issue a full response to Kaur and told GB News to carry out a full internal review into how and why the failure happened.

Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), organisations that breach data protection laws can face enforcement action from the ICO. This can include mandatory audits, enforcement notices and risk financial penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of a company's annual global turnover, whichever is greater.

Speaking after the ruling, Narinder Kaur said: “GB News thought they could shout me down and ignore me. It seems they thought the rules didn't apply to them. Everybody has the right to their information.

I exercised my rights and I am pleased to see the ICO has confirmed GB News were in the wrong. For a broadcaster that claims to care about free speech, their internal culture says otherwise.”

Kaur, who first rose to fame on ‘Big Brother' in 2001 and now regularly appears on ITV's ‘Good Morning Britain' and Channel 5's ‘Jeremy Vine', was a familiar face across GB News programmes, including ‘Farage', ‘Jacob Rees-Mogg's State of the Nation' and ‘The Camilla Tominey Show'.

Governor Hobbs rejected the pro-crypto bills, citing market volatility and financial risks to state funds.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

On May 12, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs rejected three crypto-friendly bills, Senate Bills 1373, 1024, and 1095.

The bills aimed to expand the government's role in digital asset adoption while opposing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

At the same time, the governor signed a new law, House Bill 2387, that introduces tighter rules for crypto ATM operations in the state.

The moves reflect the governor's cautious approach to integrating digital assets into the state's regulatory landscape.

Senate Bill 1373, which proposed using confiscated digital assets to fund a reserve account, was rejected over concerns about exposing state finances to volatile assets.

Hobbs pointed out that current laws allow limited use of such funds without risking the general fund.

According to her:

“Current volatility in cryptocurrency markets does not make a prudent fit for general fund dollars. I have already signed legislation this session which allows the state to utilize cryptocurrency without placing general fund dollars at risk, which is the responsible path to take.”

The governor also blocked Senate Bill 1024, which would have allowed crypto payments for fines and other state-imposed charges.

Although the bill included third-party payment providers as intermediaries, Hobbs argued the measure still left the state vulnerable.

She emphasized that legislators from both parties shared this concern, noting that:

“While this bill would allow State agencies to enter into agreements to protect the State from risks associated with cryptocurrency, legislators on both sides of the aisle acknowledged it still leaves the door open for too much risk.”

On the issue of CBDCs, Hobbs vetoed Senate Bill 1095, which aimed to ban their use preemptively.

The governor dismissed the bill as unnecessary, noting that no such digital currency currently exists in the US.

Despite the vetoes, Governor Hobbs signed House Bill 2387, establishing clear rules for state crypto ATM operations.

The legislation requires kiosk operators to display multilingual fraud alerts, issue receipts with wallet addresses, and provide transaction hashes. ATM operators must also deploy blockchain analytics to identify suspicious activity involving their machines.

The law also limits daily transactions at crypto kiosks to $2,000 for new customers and $10,500 for existing ones. Meanwhile, the bill noted:

“If a new customer as defined in subsection l, paragraph 7 of this section has been fraudulently induced to engage in a cryptocurrency kiosk transaction, the cryptocurrency kiosk operator shall issue a full refund for the fraudulently induced cryptocurrency kiosk transaction, including any fees charged in association with the transaction.”

In addition, the operators must offer round-the-clock customer service and maintain full compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) requirements.

A bitcoin mining firm backed by President Trump's son Eric will go public this year, the company announced Monday, deepening the Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency.

American Bitcoin — which lists Eric Trump as its co-founder and has its roots in a company backed by Donald Trump Jr. — is merging with the publicly-traded Gryphon Digital Mining. The all-stock transaction will allow the firm backed by the Trump brothers to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The merger is expected to close as early as the third quarter of this year.

The company's goals, according to an overview posted Monday, are to mine new bitcoin ""below market cost"" and to build up a reserve of the cryptocurrency.

""Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market,"" Eric Trump said in a statement.

American Bitcoin was launched in March, with crypto mining firm Hut 8 owning a majority stake. At the time, the company said it ""aims to become the world's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner."" It's the successor to American Data Centers, a venture backed by Eric Trump, his older brother Donald Trump Jr. and publicly traded Dominari Holdings.

Crypto mining also has a stamp of approval from Eric and Donald Trump Jr.'s father. The president pledged to make the United States a ""bitcoin mining powerhouse"" last year.

Mining is an essential part of how bitcoin operates. The currency isn't centralized, and instead relies on independent actors — known as miners — who carry out complicated math problems to verify bitcoin transactions and list them on a public ledger known as a blockchain. As a reward for this work, miners earn units of bitcoin for crunching the numbers successfully.

The value of a bitcoin stands at around $102,000, and the reward for mining decreases over time as the number of bitcoin in circulation increases, making mining a lucrative endeavor. 

But mining is controversial because it's extremely energy-intensive, with miners operating gigantic data centers filled with server racks that carry out the mathematical operations necessary to mine. A team from Cambridge University estimates bitcoin uses about 187.9 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, more than the entire country of Egypt.

The Trump brothers' foray into bitcoin mining marks the family's latest crypto venture. The president and his two eldest sons are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, which got a multi-billion dollar boost earlier this month from an Abu Dhabi-based firm, and Mr. Trump launched a highly volatile ""meme coin"" called $TRUMP in January.

Crypto investments make up about $2.9 billion of the family's net worth, one report estimates.

The Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency has drawn criticism for conflicts of interest. Last week, Senate Democrats blocked a crypto regulation bill from moving forward and pushed for it to include new limits on elected officials participating in some types of crypto ventures, with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accusing Mr. Trump of ""crypto corruption.""

The White House has pushed back on the criticism. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said last week Mr. Trump's ""assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.""

Meta is about to redefine the rules of the game with stablecoins, but will it succeed where Diem failed? Will social networks soon awaken to a new digital era?

Have you ever dreamed of a world where your likes on social networks could be transformed into stable digital currency? Well, Meta seems to want to turn this dream into reality. After the tumultuous adventure of Diem, the company is taking on a new challenge with stablecoins. So, are we on the eve of a revolution in the world of social networks or is it simply another digital mirage? Let's dive together into this fascinating adventure that could reshape the contours of our online life.

After the noticeable failure of Diem, its cryptocurrency project abandoned in 2022, Meta is not giving up. The social media giant is now targeting the stablecoin market. The goal? Integrating these digital currencies into its flagship applications: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. So, a simple announcement or a genuine revolution to come?

This is not the first time Meta dives into the world of cryptocurrencies. In 2019, Libra (later renamed Diem) promised a global digital currency. The idea? Facilitate payments and democratize access to the global financial system. But criticism, strict regulations, and the disengagement of actors like Visa and Mastercard buried this ambitious project.

At the time, Mark Zuckerberg encountered much greater resistance than anticipated. Indeed, regulators feared that this currency would escape all control, creating risks for the global economy.

Today, Meta is focusing on another approach: stablecoins. Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, stablecoins are backed by solid assets (such as the dollar or the euro), thus offering valuable stability. This characteristic makes them particularly attractive for digital transactions.

Meta plans to integrate them directly into its platforms to allow its users to make fast and fee-free transactions. Imagine paying for an NFT artwork on Instagram or sending money via WhatsApp!

To successfully carry out this new project, Meta seems to be playing the card of strategic alliances. Discussions are underway with major players in the sector such as Circle or Tether, famous for their popular stablecoins, USDC and USDT. The recent recruitment of Ginger Baker, a recognized crypto expert, also shows that Meta is taking this turn very seriously.

These initiatives are part of a broader trend in the digital market. Giants such as Standard Chartered and Fidelity are also exploring the uses of stablecoins, confirming their potential.

If Meta manages to overcome the technical and regulatory challenges, the synergy between stablecoins and social networks could be a real game changer. These cryptos would offer:

But the bet is risky. Regulators, still wary of the Diem adventure, will closely monitor this new attempt. Furthermore, market volatility in the crypto market could play an important role in the adoption (or not) of these stable currencies on such popular platforms.

With this relaunch, Meta hopes to restore its reputation in the crypto field while transforming its social applications into even richer ecosystems. It remains to be seen whether this attempt will bear fruit or if the tumultuous history of Diem will come back to haunt this new chapter.

              Highlights            



                        Institutional adoption of digital assets is rising, but mainstream financial players are hesitant due to unresolved issues around risk exposure, accountability and lack of control within decentralized systems.                      


                        Traditional finance demands robust risk management, yet public blockchains and smart contracts often lack the safeguards, recourse and regulatory clarity needed for institutions to operate at scale with confidence.                      


                        Infrastructure providers are embedding risk frameworks, and regulatory efforts are advancing, but until risk becomes transparent, manageable and assignable, digital assets will struggle to move beyond their current limitations.                      

For digital assets to fulfill their promise of providing real-time, borderless, programmable finance, the blockchains powering them must become mature enough for institutional use.

Institutional adoption of digital assets like cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities is increasingly seen as inevitable. Yet, despite growing interest, risk remains an obstacle.

Unlike the early days of crypto, where anonymity and privacy reigned supreme, the new wave of adoption is being led by highly regulated institutions. Banks, asset managers and payment processors must know who bears the liability when things go wrong.

Cracking that code could help unlock the future of payments.

As the traditional financial sector grapples with the core question of risk across the blockchain, crypto is continuing its linear journey toward mainstream adoption.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins said Monday (May 12) that the commission must consider regulatory changes to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. The same day, Deutsche Bank analysts claimed in a statement to PYMNTS that regulation in the United States “could cement stablecoin legitimacy in 2025.”

It was also reported Monday that Citi predicted that new regulatory efforts promoting the integration of dollar-pegged coins into the mainstream economy might soon make the stablecoin market surpass the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem.

These are not blockchain businesses harbored in the Bahamas or tied to another offshore haven; they're some of the world's largest and most regulated financial institutions.

Still, at the core of crypto's institutional future remains the risk of exposure without control. In traditional finance, firms have well-established risk management frameworks. They understand their counterparty risks, leverage positions and operational vulnerabilities. But digital assets — especially those on public chains — break that model.

“Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS in April.

“Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable in using stablecoins at scale,” he added.

Transactions may settle instantly across blockchains, but recourse is minimal. Smart contracts execute automatically, regardless of intent or context. While blockchain forensics have come a long way, they are still retroactive tools that are frequently more reactive than they are preventative. There's often no clear path to indemnity when a smart contract fails or when money is stolen via a protocol exploit, which means that traditional players are being asked to take on new risks without any of the traditional controls.

Infrastructure providers are working to embed risk management into the fabric of digital asset platforms. Custodians are improving insurance coverage. Chain analytics firms are helping institutions monitor wallet activity and flag suspicious transactions in real time.

“This isn't about replacing existing systems,” FV Bank CEO Miles Paschini told PYMNTS in January. “It's about providing an additional option. Where stablecoins offer superior benefits, customers will naturally gravitate toward them.”

“As more banks integrate blockchain capabilities, customers will have greater choice in transferring value,” he added.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Blockchain's Benefits for Regulated Industries” found that blockchain technology has numerous potential benefits to serve the unique needs of regulated industries, including finance.

However, the sector's maturation could ultimately mean embracing risk not as a deterrent, but as a design challenge. It may mean developing systems where transparency is matched by accountability, and where innovation is underpinned by trust.

Even so, risk is not just a matter of auditability or reserve backing. It's about systemic accountability. To do that, the industry must make risk visible, manageable and assignable.

Until then, the digital asset revolution could remain stuck in a holding pattern.

A bitcoin mining venture with ties to US President Donald Trump's family announced on Monday, May 12, that it is all set to become a publicly traded company.

American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency firm backed by President Trump's sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq after its all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining that is set to close by the third quarter of 2025, according to an investor presentation posted on its website.

The merged entity will trade under the symbol ‘ABTC'. The US president's two eldest sons will own about 98 per cent of the new entity along with existing shareholders of American Bitcoin. The other 2 per cent will belong to existing shareholders of Gryphon. Eric Trump is also listed as a co-founder and member of the  management team at American Bitcoin.

Taking American Bitcoin public is the latest move by the Trump family to expand its growing crypto empire. Experts have warned that these crypto ventures could lead to overt conflicts of interest within the Trump administration.

For instance, American Bitcoin could become a vehicle for investors looking to curry favour from President Trump. However, the company has said that existing shareholders of American Bitcoin will own a majority stake. Trump is also facing backlash for planning to accept a $400 million luxury jumbo jet as a gift from Qatar's ruling family to be used as the official US presidential plane, Air Force One.

Meanwhile, the American Bitcoin announcement did not elicit much of a reaction in the crypto market as bitcoin continued to trade flat at around $104,000, according to CoinMarketCap.

In February this year, investment firm Dominari Holdings announced the creation of a new venture called American Data Centers to develop computing infrastructure for the AI industry. Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr are investors of American Data Centers, while Eric Trump is a member of the advisory board of Dominari Holdings.

Then, the two Trumps partnered with an energy infrastructure company called Hut 8 to establish a new venture called American Bitcoin, with the more immediate objective of creating a large stockpile of cryptocurrency by mining bitcoins.

“Every single sophisticated country is using their excess power to mine bitcoin […] We won the space race. We better win the crypto race,” Eric Trump was quoted as saying by CNBC. 

“From the start, we've backed our conviction in Bitcoin, personally and through our businesses. But simply buying Bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity,” Donald Trump Jr was quoted as saying by The New York Times.

The terms of the deal dictated that Hut 8 would control 80 per cent of American Bitcoin while the 20 per cent stake would belong to Trump-backed American Data Centers. The initial announcement also named Eric Trump as a co-founder of American Bitcoin and said he would serve as the chief strategy officer of the new crypto mining venture.

Gryphon Digital Mining is now acquiring American Bitcoin via a reverse triangular merger in a 100 per cent stock-for-stock transaction, according to an investor presentation posted on its website. Gryphon is a US-based venture that aims to establish a presence in bitcoin mining as well as AI by investing in data centres and low-cost energy assets, as per its website.

The proposed merger with Gryphon carves out American Bitcoin from Hut 8′s broader energy and AI infrastructure platform in order to separate the bitcoin mining operations and potentially unlock new capital.

“The Gryphon team is pleased to offer our stockholders the opportunity to participate in what we believe will be the next era of public Bitcoin mining through this combination. American Bitcoin brings together an outstanding leadership team and a clear strategy to build a premier institution in this fast-evolving industry,” Steve Gutterman, Chief Executive Officer of Gryphon, said.

“Taking American Bitcoin public is a critical step toward scaling the business at the pace and magnitude we envision. Time-to-market was a critical factor, and this transaction enables an efficient path to public markets by combining with an entity that is structurally aligned with American Bitcoin's mining-focused launch strategy,” Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut, said.

While fiat currency is printed by a central bank, new bitcoins are generated by verifying transactions on the blockchain. This process is known as bitcoin mining. It is a branch of the crypto industry and requires large amounts of energy that are consumed by mining machines to process bitcoin transactions.

Bitcoin mining is also one of the most criticised features of the crypto industry as it is energy-intensive. In the early days of cryptocurrency, bitcoin transactions could be processed and verified by anyone capable of running a computer programme. In return, they earned new bitcoins as a reward.

However, when there was a boom in the crypto industry, the amount of computing power required for mining bitcoins also surged. Today, the process of mining bitcoins is carried out by publicly traded companies like Hut 8 which owns several data centres packed with servers.

These operations are considered to be harmful for the environment as each bitcoin transaction is said to generate carbon emissions equivalent to driving a gasoline-powered car between 1,600 and 2,600 kilometres, according to a report by the London School of Economics. Bitcoin mining farms have also been linked to an increase in noise pollution.

During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump and his sons launched a crypto company called World Liberty Financial that offers two types of digital currencies. It has launched so-called governance tokens with the symbol WLFI.

Governance tokens cannot be traded. Instead, they give token holders the right to vote on changes to the project's underlying code and to signal their opinion on its direction and plans. The largest holder of WLFI is Abu Dhabi-based crypto firm DWF which bought $25 million worth of the tokens issued by the Trump family-controlled venture, according to a report by Reuters.

World Liberty Financial also unveiled its own stablecoin last week. Besides this, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched their own sets of memecoins on the eve of the presidential swearing-in ceremony in January this year.

More recently, Trump announced that top holders of the $TRUMP memecoin would have the opportunity to attend a private dinner with him.","{'href': 'https://indianexpress.com', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}","cryptocurrency"

A sharp pullback in crypto markets late Monday triggered over $500 million in long liquidations, erasing earlier gains as bitcoin (BTC) slipped from weekend highs and traders reacted to de-escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.



Coinglass data shows more than $530 million worth of long positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours — with nearly $200 million coming from bitcoin-tracked futures and $170 million from ether (ETH) products.Liquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is, when they don't have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.Majors bore the brunt of the drop, with dogecoin (DOGE) and cardano (ADA) each falling as much as 7%, and solana (SOL), xrp (XRP) and BNB Chain's BNB losing between 5%–6%.



The liquidations marked a reversal from last week's euphoric rally, which had seen ETH gain 40% and major altcoins push double-digit percentage gains in a wave of short squeezes. That move had triggered over $1 billion in short liquidations — the highest since 2021 — and sent bitcoin briefly past $104,000 before momentum faded.



Markets turned lower during U.S. trading hours Monday after reports of a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China, with the removal of several mutual levies and both pledging renewed trade cooperation.



While easing tensions supported equities, the development may have tempered the risk-on narrative that had fueled crypto's breakout over the past week.

Futures open interest across major exchanges also fell by more than $1.2 billion, suggesting a sharp deleveraging as long traders were forced to exit positions, Coinglass data showed.



Analysts caution that while the near-term flush may reset frothy sentiment, with eyes on the next Fed meeting in June.



“Right now macro concerns are driving the market and the next Fed decision and outlook remarks in June will likely be the key factor in driving Bitcoin past its previous all-time high,” Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.“This would stimulate lending and investment in the US economy and hopefully drive growth, avoiding the recession investors are apprehensive about,” Mei added.

Animoca Brands, a Web3 investment company, is planning a public listing in New York, seeking to capture the ""unique moment"" offered by the Trump administration's approach to digital asset regulation, executive chairman Yat Siu told the Financial Times.

An announcement on plans to list could be made soon, Yat Siu said in an interview, according to the Financial Times. 

Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. crypto regulatory landscape was littered with lawsuits and enforcement actions against prominent crypto companies such as crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. These have been dropped this year in a signal of the more friendly approach to the digital asset industry by the Trump administration.

“If the U.S. didn't do what they did with the regulators [under Biden], we probably would have competitors in the U.S.,"" Siu said. ""It's a unique moment in time. I feel like it would be one heck of a wasted opportunity if we didn't at least try.""

The Hong Kong-based company has been a prominent investor in the Web3 industry for a number of years, having risen to prominence during the non-fungible token (NFT) boom of 2021. Its investments include blockchain game Axie Infinity, NFT marketplace OpenSea and Kraken.

Kraken is itself considering selling shares to the public for the first time in the U.S. next year.

Beyond investments in NFTs and GameFi projects, Animoca Brands' most recent financial report showed a pivot towards its advisory service, which covers token advisory, tokenomics, marketing, listing advisory, node operation and trading services.

Animoca holds $293 million in cash and stablecoins, $538 million in digital assets, and $2.9 billion in off-balance-sheet token reserves on its balance sheet, according to its latest report.

The company did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.

 Bitcoin's hodler entities are more active than ever as a record 14 million BTC gain ""illiquid supply"" status, with whales still accumulating above $100,000. 

Key points:

Bitcoin has seen its largest 30-day illiquid supply increase of the current bull market.

Illiquid supply now stands at 14 million BTC, more than ever before.

Whales are still accumulating as the price returns to six figures.

Bitcoin (BTC) investors are turning the BTC supply more illiquid than at any point in its history

Data from onchain analytics platform Glassnode shows that Bitcoin's “illiquid supply” has reached a record 14 million BTC.

Bitcoin is increasingly finding its way into the hands of entities that do not sell what they acquire.

Glassnode, which charts the portion of the BTC supply owned by so-called “illiquid entities,” reveals that this has reached levels not seen during the current bull market.

An entity is considered illiquid if the ratio between its cumulative BTC inflows and outflows is below a certain value.

“This ratio yields a number L between zero and one, with larger values indicating higher liquidity,” it explained in a dedicated guide.

Illiquid supply stood at just over 14 million BTC this week, with the 30-day rolling increase coming in at 180,000 BTC, its largest jump since December 2022.

At the time, the previous bear market was coming to an end, with BTC/USD declining 77% to hit long-term lows of just above $15,000 in the process.

As Cointelegraph continues to report, this bull cycle stands out in terms of investment trends thanks to increasing institutional participation.

Corporate treasuries, such as that of business intelligence firm Strategy, have combined with the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to make Bitcoin a mainstream investment target.

Onchain data likewise shows that Bitcoin whales have accumulated throughout the recent BTC price rebound. Only retail investors appear to be panicking.

“Bitcoin's key whale & shark tier (holding 10-10K BTC) have now accumulated 83,105 more BTC in the past 30 days,” research firm Santiment reported in an X post this week.

 XRP whale flow data mirrors patterns from 2024, which preceded the price to rally from under $0.50 to over $3.50 in a span of several months. 

Key takeaways:

XRP price has risen 55% since April and is now flashing bullish continuation signals.

Whale flows have flipped positive for the first time since November 2024, historically signaling trend reversals.

A falling wedge breakout projects 40% gains ahead, but $2.80 may act as interim resistance.

XRP (XRP) has bounced by more than 55% since forming a local bottom at around $1.61 in April. It now signals a further price surge owing to bullish technical patterns and onchain data. 

XRP whale wallets (addresses holding large amounts of XRP) have been aggressively reducing their holdings since November 2024, according to data resource CryptoQuant. 

The trend pushed net flows deep into negative territory, preceding the sharp correction in XRP's price from above $3.55 to under $2.00.

As of mid-May 2025, however, the trend has reversed. 

Whale outflows have been slowing down, turning the 90-day moving average of net flows positive. In the past, most instances where whale flows turned positive after a prolonged negative trend has marked major bottoms or trend reversals. 

A notable example is XRP's rally from around $0.43 in July 2024 to $3.55 in January 2025, or around 400% gains, which began as whale outflows slowed and eventually flipped to net inflows.

XRP price technicals show it breaking out of a multimonth falling wedge pattern on the 3-day chart, typically viewed as a bullish reversal setup. 

The wedge, formed between December 2024 and early May 2025, had been compressing price action while volume declined, a classic sign of accumulation.

The breakout occurred in early May near the $2.25 level, just above the 50-period exponential moving average (EMA), which now acts as key support. Based on the wedge's height, the breakout projects a price target near $3.45, around 40% above current levels.

XRP's relative strength index (RSI) also supports the bullish case, bouncing back above 57 and showing renewed buying momentum.

The move may not be a straight shot to the target, however. Analyst Mags highlights a key resistance near $2.80 that could temporarily cap XRP's upside. 

In the near term, XRP may consolidate above its 50-day EMA, particularly as whale inflows often signal the start of an accumulation phase before a stronger price breakout.

“The pace of outflows is slowing, and the bars are curling upward,” wrote Kripto Mavsimi, an analyst associated with CryptoQuant, adding:

Such a base-building period would be a healthy development if consistent with how previous whale-driven rallies have unfolded.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bitcoin volatility falls below S&P 500 and Nasdaq in rare shift — Galaxy","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-volatility-falls-below-sp500-nasdaq-galaxy-digital","Tue, 13 May 2025 11:53:01 GMT","

 Galaxy Digital says Bitcoin's volatility dropped below that of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, marking a rare shift as institutional demand for BTC increases. 

Bitcoin defied expectations in April, delivering double-digit gains while posting lower volatility than major traditional assets.

According to analysts at Galaxy Digital, Bitcoin's (BTC) realized volatility over the past 10 trading sessions dropped to 43.86, lower than the S&P 500's 47.29 and the Nasdaq 100's 51.26 — an unusual “positioning for a digital asset traditionally known for its outsized volatility.”

The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled.

The Nasdaq Composite is flat, the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell nearly 4%, and even gold (typically a safe haven) briefly hit $3,500 per ounce before pulling back to a 5.75% gain, Galaxy Digital analysts wrote in a May 12 note.

However, they noted that Bitcoin surged 11% over the same period, reinforcing its evolving role as a macro hedge amid geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty.

The analysts noted that Bitcoin still maintains elevated 30-day correlations with major indexes, around 0.62 with the S&P and 0.64 with the Nasdaq. However, its beta has declined, signaling that investors may be treating it less as a high-risk asset and more as a long-term allocation.

“Bitcoin as a non-sovereign asset means an investor doesn't need the full faith or tax basis of a nation to support the integrity of the asset,” said Chris Rhine, head of liquid active strategies at Galaxy.

Galaxy said that the recent investor behavior mirrors what was observed during the 2018–2019 US-China trade tensions when Bitcoin rallied amid rising global uncertainty.

Hank Huang, CEO of Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that surging ETF inflows and Strategy's ongoing Bitcoin purchases are helping reshape Bitcoin into a digital version of gold, less tied to equities.

“As institutions deepen liquidity, volatility drops, making Bitcoin a cornerstone for portfolios,” Huang added.

Meanwhile, Galaxy's OTC trading desk said the market posture is “tactically cautious but structurally constructive,” marked by disciplined leverage and low hedging stress.

With 95% of Bitcoin's total supply already mined and growing interest from institutions, ETFs and even governments, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a digital store of value.

“Bitcoin's supply and demand dynamics are solidifying its place as a mature digital store of value,” said Ian Kolman, co-portfolio manager at Galaxy.

On April 25, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's head of thematics and active ETFs, said there has been a long-term trend in which countries have been reducing their reliance on dollar-based reserves in favor of assets like gold and, increasingly, Bitcoin.

He noted that geopolitical fragmentation is fueling demand for uncorrelated assets, with Bitcoin increasingly viewed alongside gold as a safe-haven asset.

How Trump's National Weather Service Cuts Could Cost Lives

Weather experts warn that staff cuts at the National Weather Service that have been made by the Trump administration are a danger to public safety as tornadoes, hurricanes and heat loom this spring and summer

Just more than 100 years ago, on March 18, 1925, a tornado slashed across the U.S. Midwest with no warning at all and killed 695 people—a massive number for a single outbreak. Today those in a twister's path get a take-cover notice eight to 18 minutes before a strike on average. And as recently as 1992, what looked like a minor tropical disturbance intensified with shocking speed into Hurricane Andrew. There was little time to prepare for the storm, and much of the resulting property damage in South Florida was massive. But by last year, forecasters could give several days' warning that the then approaching storms Helene and Milton were likely to abruptly morph into monsters.

Such improvements have cumulatively saved thousands of lives and likely hundreds of billions of dollars across the U.S. And they happened only through concerted federal government investment in studying weather events, improving computer forecast models, and making continent- and ocean-spanning efforts to collect the data that make those forecasts possible. Now meteorology experts are urgently warning that the Trump administration's staff firings and funding cuts at the National Weather Service (and its parent, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) threaten to disrupt these crucial operations and turn back the clock on forecasting.

“Our worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life,” wrote five former NWS directors from both Democratic and Republican administrations in an open letter on May 2.

Ultimately, storm experts say, disruption caused by existing and proposed cuts will hit multiple fronts. An understaffed and underfunded NWS could mean that a tornado warning doesn't come in time, that a hurricane forecast is off just enough so that the wrong coastal areas are evacuated or that flights are less likely to be routed around turbulence. “The net result is going to be massive economic harm,” said climate scientist Daniel Swain during one of his regular talks hosted on YouTube. “As we break these things, eventually it will become painfully and unignorably obvious what we've broken and how important it was. And it's going to be unbelievably expensive in the scramble to try and get it back—and we might not be able to get it back.”

For the past 20 years, a little more than 4,000 NWS staff members have put together 24-7 forecasts for the country's approximately 300 million people every day of the year. “We have [a more] efficient level of [staff compared] to the number of people we're serving than any other country in the world by two orders of magnitude,” says Louis Uccellini, who was NWS director from 2013 to 2022 and signed the open letter.

The NWS punches above its economic weight, too: it costs the average American about $4 per year. “It's a cup of coffee,” says JoAnn Becker, president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization, a union that represents the NWS and several NOAA offices. With one third of the U.S. economy—from farming to trucking to tourism—being sensitive to weather and climate, the NWS provides an overall benefit of $100 billion to the economy. This is roughly 10 times what the service costs to run, according to an American Meteorological Society white paper. Recent improvements to hurricane forecasts alone have saved up to $5 billion for each hurricane that hit the U.S. since 2007, according to a report by the National Bureau of Economic Research—a nonpartisan, nonprofit economic research organization. In comparison, the NWS's entire budget for 2024 was less than $1.4 billion.

With the growing number of disasters that cost the country $1 billion or more in damages, weather experts have advocated for increasing the agency's staff and budget. “NOAA is a $12-billion agency trapped in a $5-and-a-half-billion budget,” said Craig McLean, then acting chief scientist of NOAA, in testimony to Congress three years ago.

Even before President Donald Trump took office, the NWS was already about 5 percent below the staffing level the service has considered adequate as it scrambled to catch up to a spate of retirements. After the NWS's first wave of firings and early retirements under the Trump administration, staffing at the service's 122 field offices across the country has dropped to a 19 percent vacancy rate. Fifty-two offices are now considered “critically understaffed,” meaning a shortage of more than 20 percent. Some branches are down by more than 40 percent. “We're small offices,” Becker says. Each weather forecast office has about 25 to 30 people. “When you're down four people, it starts to hurt,” she adds. “There comes a point where you don't have enough people to cover everything.”

The lack of noticeable degradations in forecast quality so far is “because of the valiant efforts of the people who remain in these now critically understaffed roles in field offices,” Swain said in his recent video. “But the cracks are really now starting to show.”

One of the most noticeable effects of the staffing shortage has been the sharp reductions—and even cancellations—of the weather balloon launches that are supposed to happen twice a day at every forecast office across the country. These launches all happen at the same time to give forecasters a three-dimensional snapshot of the atmosphere. Those data are then fed into weather models and are crucial to making sure the models start with the most accurate possible information. This is particularly true during tornado outbreaks or prior to a hurricane landfall. For the former, forecasters need to understand the atmospheric patterns that influence an outbreak to better pinpoint where tornadoes might spin up. And understanding atmospheric patterns over the country is critical to forecasting where a hurricane will make landfall. The lack of balloon launches “is going to degrade weather forecasts to some extent,” Swain said in his video. “And the effects may not be obvious until there's a major tornado outbreak or hurricane landfall downwind that doesn't go so well.”

The suspensions and cancellations might be somewhat less worrisome if they were evenly spread out, but they are largely clustered in the center of the country—right upwind from Tornado Alley. The fact that a function as essential as balloon launches is being cut is a clear sign of how much staff are feeling the crunch, Swain said.

Another concern regards forecasting equipment, such as the nation's Doppler radar system, which is the only tool that forecasters can use to spot tornadoes inside storms systems, allowing for better warnings. Staffing cuts and spending freezes mean that if any radars or other equipment go down, offices may not have the staff or money to repair them, Becker and others say.

Experts are also concerned about the firings of two of NOAA's Hurricane Hunters—members of the crew that flies aircraft, crammed with state-of-the-art equipment, into the middle of tropical storms and hurricanes to gather data. Research has shown that including these data clearly makes hurricane forecasts more accurate and reliable. Diminished crews mean some flights could be cancelled, leaving coastal communities more vulnerable to approaching storms.

The NWS also issues specific aviation, shipping and space weather forecasts—all under threat from the current and proposed cuts.

Some of the NWS offices will become so short-staffed that they may have to operate part-time, the agency's former directors warned in their open letter. This could include making fewer highly tailored forecasts, as well as performing less outreach on social media and to local officials and emergency managers. Such outreach has been a major goal of the NWS to make sure communities are better prepared before extreme weather hits. The forecasters in the NWS offices are “community experts” who have close working relationships with emergency managers, school districts and other local decision-makers, Becker says. Without those proactive efforts, “you're basically watching the storm,” Uccellini says.

Being down so many people means “you have to cut corners—and cutting corners is dangerous with lives and property at stake,” says Jeff Masters, a writer at Yale Climate Connections and a former Hurricane Hunter at NOAA. Uccellini likens what is happening to stretching a rubber band: “You can stretch and stretch it, and then it breaks,” he says. “And when it breaks, you can't put it back together again.”

Neither artificial intelligence forecasts nor private weather companies will be able to fill in the gap; both rely on the data NOAA collects. Without robust NOAA data collection, “the Weather Channel, Accuweather ... will be unable to function as they have,” says Rick Spinrad, who served as NOAA administrator from 2021 to 2025.

People across the vast weather community, from individual meteorologists to professional societies such as the American Meteorological Society and the National Weather Association, have all expressed alarm about the cuts to NOAA and the NWS and have urged the Trump administration to reverse course. Industries that depend on weather and climate data, such as the insurance industry, have also spoken out. The Union of Concerned Scientists has also sent congressional leaders an open letter to urge them to reinstate NOAA's staffing and funding that has been signed by more than 3,300 scientists and other experts.

Morale is extremely low in offices across the NWS, according to Swain's video and to Uccellini and many others who know current employees at the agency. Funding cuts are forcing many employees to bring in their own toilet paper and soap. There is also “an extreme culture of fear” Swain said in his video, with “threatening and demeaning communications” from agency leaders that have called employees “lazy” and “low productivity.”

“Our worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life."" —Five former NWS directors in a May 2 open letter

In their open letter, the former NWS directors contradicted this characterization, speaking of the dedication of the agency's employees: “They will often sleep in weather forecast offices to make sure poor weather conditions don't stop them from being on time for their shifts to do their critical work. They stay at their stations during hurricanes, tornadoes and other severe storms, even when extreme weather affects their own families.”

The implemented and proposed cuts indicate that those making them have little understanding of how the service works and have not taken time to look for actual inefficiencies, Spinrad and Masters say. Swain and others have concurred. Instead, Spinrad says, the Trump administration has made “easy” cuts such as firing “probationary” employees (those who were newly hired or recently promoted, making them easier to fire). This approach “is trying to use a chainsaw instead of a scalpel to fix the patient” in terms of addressing bureaucratic inefficiencies, Masters says.

In response to a detailed list of questions regarding the cuts, the concerns others have expressed about their ramifications and the Trump administration's willingness to abide by any budget set by Congress from Scientific American, the NWS's press office wrote, “The National Weather Service is adjusting some services due to temporary staffing changes at our local forecast offices throughout the country in order to best meet the needs of the public, our partners and stakeholders in each office's local area. These adjustments are also temporary and we will continue to fulfill our core mission of providing life-saving forecasts, warnings, and decision support services.”

“In an era of climate change causing increased extreme weather, we should be spending more on NOAA and the National Weather Service, not less,” Masters says. “This is a very poor way to spend our tax dollars.”

California Told Companies to Label Toxic Chemicals. Instead They're Quietly Dropping Them

Businesses are making moves to avoid consumer warning labels, and the effects reach far beyond California

Requiring warning labels on products with potentially toxic ingredients can obviously help keep them out of a careful consumer's shopping cart. But a recent study shows that these “right-to-know” laws may also halt such formulations long before they hit the shelves or are released into the air—and can even protect people outside a law's geographic range.

One of the most significant such laws ever passed in the U.S., California's Proposition 65, requires businesses to post a warning when chemical exposures, whether through product ingredients or air emissions, exceed a safe standard. For the recent study, published in Environmental Science & Technology, researchers interviewed business leaders and found that California's rule has caused many companies to reformulate their products by reducing amounts of flagged ingredients to safer levels—or by dropping them entirely.

The interviews covered dozens of industries such as cleaning products, electronics and home improvement. They included top-earning brands across all sectors as well as leading green cleaning brands—although the companies remain anonymous in the study, says lead author Jennifer Ohayon, a scientist at the nonprofit research organization Silent Spring Institute.

Ohayon and her colleagues found that companies commonly replaced the warning-requiring ingredients altogether, in part to avoid possible litigation. Michael Freund is a lawyer who spent decades representing groups aiming to stop toxic chemical emissions; he says the California proposition's incentives can help fill a key gap. In the cases he worked on, “every one of those companies had permits that allowed them to do what they were doing,” he says. “And that's where Prop 65 comes into play.”

Although the 1986 law is specific to California, the study results suggest its effects cross state borders as manufacturers reformulate their products nationally. A parallel study published last year by the Silent Spring Institute backs this idea up with data. That study looked at levels of 37 chemicals in blood and urine samples among both Californians and non-Californians. Of the chemicals, 26 were listed in Prop 65, and samples from before and after listing were available for 11 of those, which allowed for a comparison. For most of the chemicals, levels in people's bodies decreased after listing—both in California residents and across the nation.

Megan Schwarzman, a researcher involved in both studies, says sample data exist for only a tiny fraction of the 900 Prop 65 chemicals. In a metaphorical game of Twister, the researchers had to figure out what publicly available data could be matched to Prop 65 chemicals because “the data weren't collected for that purpose,” Schwarzman says. Monitoring all listed chemicals over time in future work would show any patterns much more clearly.

The new study notes that Prop 65 is sometimes criticized for leaving Californians “over-warned” and “under-informed.” But the research so far suggests that regardless of consumer effects, the policy has guided at least some businesses' choices—raising the bar for everyone.

Ultraweak biophotons largely caused by metabolic processes could play a key role in noninvasive health testing.

“You're glowing” is a well-known complimentary phrase meant to convey a perceived level of health, happiness, or other biological condition—pregnancies often inspire the platitude, for example. But in reality, humans (along with all other living things) truly do emit a glow largely caused by an organism's metabolic and cellular processes. 

This glow, in scientific parlance, is created by what are known as biophotons (or ultraweak photons). Scientists have studied them for decades, probing their changes due to age, gender, health, and many other factors. Now, scientists from the University of Calgary have analyzed the emissions of these photons in mice before and after death, showing how they quickly dim as a result of an organism's passing. The results of the study were published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. 

“The fact that ultraweak photon emission is a real thing is undeniable at this point,” University of Calgary's Dan Oblak, the senior author of the study, told New Scientist. “This really shows that this is not just an imperfection or caused by other biological processes. It's really something that comes from all living things.”

To capture this process in real time, Oblak and his team captured two one-hour exposures using advanced digital cameras capable of capturing individual photons emitted from four mice. Before both sessions of observation, the live and dead mice were given a 30-minute dark acclimation period before imaging. The results show a clear distinction between ultraweak photon emissions (UPEs) between the live and dead mice, with lingering emissions corresponding to areas of high metabolic activity in the mouse before death. 

“While the live mice emit robust UPE, likely indicative of ongoing biological processes and cellular activity, the dead mice's UPE emission is nearly extinguished, with only a few remaining ‘bright spots', which correspond to ‘brighter spots' in living mice, reflecting the cessation of metabolic and energy variation,” the authors wrote. 

Of course, these photon emissions are not exclusive to the animal kingdom, so Oblak and his team used a similar process to analyze UPEs in a plant—specifically, an umbrella tree (Heptapleurum arboricola). They tested the emission of biophotons due to plant injury, as well as the application of certain chemicals like alcohol (isopropanol), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and benzocaine. In both instances, the plant appeared to increase its biophoton emission, which could have a particularly profound application for observing the health of the world's forests. 

“The intensity of UPE from plants is influenced by temperature, where higher temperature causes higher UPE […]. Moreover, UPE may be used as an indicator of injury effects in plants, where the injured parts emit more photons,” the authors wrote. “The investigation of UPE from plants may be used as a simple method for non-invasive monitoring of health abnormality and plant growth under different environmental conditions for plant biology and agricultural practices.”

As New Scientist notes, previous studies have similarly captured the disparate “glowing” effect in living cells (and even individual body parts), but never an entire animal organism as examined in this study. Further refinement of these analytical tools could help scientists use biophotons as a non-invasive means of monitoring human health and determining if your “glow” is really as healthy as it looks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Combinations of chronic illnesses could double risk of depression","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250513112158.htm","Tue, 13 May 2025 16:57:21 GMT","

People with multiple long-term physical health conditions are at a significantly greater risk of developing depression, a study shows.

Researchers found that some combinations of illnesses -- particularly cardiometabolic ones like diabetes and heart disease -- could more than double the likelihood of a future depression diagnosis.

With multimorbidity -- when patients live with two or more chronic conditions -- continuing to put pressure on an already stretched healthcare system, experts say the findings highlight the need for integrated care models that address both mental and physical health.

Researchers from the University of Edinburgh used data from more than 142,000 people in the UK Biobank study to examine how physical illnesses interact to influence the risk of depression -- a condition that often goes underdiagnosed in people managing long-term physical diseases.

Participants were aged 37-73 years and had at least one chronic physical condition but no history of depression.

Scientists used statistical clustering techniques to group individuals by their physical illness profiles and tracked how these clusters related to later diagnoses of depression.

One group, which included people experiencing the highest rates of physical illness also showed the highest risk of developing depression. This group had no single dominant illness, but rather a complex mix of issues.

People with both heart disease and diabetes were also found to be at high risk, as were those with chronic lung conditions like asthma or COPD -- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Liver and bowel conditions also showed a noticeable link to depression in both men and women.

Women with joint and bone problems, such as arthritis, were particularly affected, but this pattern was not as prominent for men.

In the highest-risk groups, about one in 12 people developed depression over the next 10 years, compared with about one in 25 people without physical conditions.

While the biological burden of illness may play a role, researchers say social and systemic factors could also help explain why physical multimorbidity leads to worse mental health outcomes.

Lauren DeLong, lead author and PhD student at the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics, said: ""We saw clear associations between physical health conditions and the development of depression, but this study is only the beginning. We hope our findings inspire other researchers to investigate and untangle the links between physical and mental health conditions.""

Bruce Guthrie, Professor of General Practice at the University of Edinburgh's Advanced Care Research Centre, said: ""Healthcare often treats physical and mental health as completely different things, but this study shows that we need to get better at anticipating and managing depression in people with physical illness.""

Professor Mike Lewis, NIHR's Scientific Director of Innovation, said: ""Harnessing the power of data to understand the impact of chronic conditions is going to transform the way we treat patients in the future. NIHR's research in this area is helping to paint a full picture of what patients are dealing with, rather than just focusing on one health condition at a time.""

When you reach out your hand to grasp an object like a bottle, you generally don't need to know the bottle's exact position in space to pick it up successfully. But as EPFL researcher Kai Junge explains, if you want to make a robot that can pick up a bottle, you must know everything about the surrounding environment very precisely.

""As humans, we don't really need too much external information to grasp an object, and we believe that's because of the compliant -- or soft -- interactions that happen at the interface between an object and a human hand,"" says Junge, a PhD student in the School of Engineering's Computational Robot Design & Fabrication (CREATE) Lab, led by Josie Hughes. ""This compliance is what we are interested in exploring for robots.""

In robotics, compliant materials are those that deform, bend, and squish. In the case of the CREATE Lab's robotic ADAPT hand (Adaptive Dexterous Anthropomorphic Programmable sTiffness), the compliant materials are relatively simple: strips of silicone wrapped around a mechanical wrist and fingers, plus spring-loaded joints, combined with a bendable robotic arm. But this strategically distributed compliance is what allows the device to pick up a wide variety of objects using ""self-organized"" grasps that emerge automatically, rather than being programmed.

In a series of experiments, the ADAPT hand, which can be controlled remotely, was able to pick up 24 objects with a success rate of 93%, using self-organized grasps that mimicked a natural human grasp with a direct similarity of 68%. The research has been published in Nature Communications Engineering.

'Bottom-up' robotic intelligence

While a traditional robotic hand would need a motor to actuate each joint, the ADAPT hand has only 12 motors, housed in the wrist, for its 20 joints. The rest of the mechanical control comes from springs, which can be made stiffer or looser to tune the hand's compliance, and from the silicone 'skin', which can also be added or removed.

As for software, the ADAPT hand is programmed to move through just four general waypoints, or positions, to lift an object. Any further adaptations required to complete the task occur without additional programming or feedback; in robotics, this is called 'open loop' control. For example, when the team programmed the robot to use a certain motion, it was able to adapt its grasp pose to various objects ranging from a single bolt to a banana. The researchers analyzed this extreme robustness -- thanks to the robot's spatially distributed compliance -- with over 300 grasps and compared them against a rigid version of the hand.

""Developing robots that can perform interactions or tasks that humans do automatically is a lot harder than most people expect,"" Junge says. ""That's why we are interested in exploiting this distributed mechanical intelligence of different body parts like skin, muscles, and joints, as opposed to the top-down intelligence of the brain.""

Balancing compliance and control

Junge emphasizes that the goal of the ADAPT study was not necessarily to create a robotic hand that can grasp like a human, but to show for the first time how much a robot can achieve through compliance alone.

Now that this has been demonstrated systematically, the EPFL team is building on the potential of compliance by re-integrating elements of closed-loop control into the ADAPT hand, including sensory feedback -- via the addition of pressure sensors to the silicone skin -- and artificial intelligence. This synergistic approach could lead to robots that combine compliance's robustness to uncertainty, and the precision of closed-loop control.

""A better understanding of the advantages of compliant robots could greatly improve the integration of robotic systems into highly unpredictable environments, or into environments designed for humans,"" Junge summarizes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists film the heart forming in 3D earlier than ever before","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250513112256.htm","Tue, 13 May 2025 17:03:46 GMT","

Researchers at UCL and the Francis Crick Institute have, for the first time, identified the origin of cardiac cells using 3D images of a heart forming in real-time, inside a living mouse embryo.

For the study, published in The EMBO Journal, the teamused a technique called advanced light-sheet microscopy on a specially engineered mouse model. This is a method where a thin sheet of light is used to illuminate and take detailed pictures of tiny samples, creating clear 3D images without causing any damage to living tissue.

By doing this, they were able to track individual cells as they moved and divided over the course of two days -- from a critical stage of development known as gastrulation through to the point where the primitive heart begins to take shape. This allowed the researchers to identify the cellular origins of the heart.

Gastrulation is the process by which cells begin to specialise and organise into the body's primary structures, including the heart. In humans, this occurs during the second week of pregnancy.

The study's findings could revolutionise how scientists understand and treat congenital heart defects, the researchers say.

Senior author Dr Kenzo Ivanovitch (UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and British Heart Foundation Intermediate Research Fellow) said: ""This is the first time we've been able to watch heart cells this closely, for this long, during mammalian development. We first had to reliably grow the embryos in a dish over long periods, from a few hours to a few days, and what we found was totally unexpected.""

Using fluorescent markers, the team tagged heart muscle cells (called cardiomyocytes) causing them to glow in distinct colours. Combined with light-sheet microscopy, this innovation allowed the researchers to create a detailed time-lapse video.

Snapshots were captured every two minutes over 40 hours, producing images with unprecedented spatial resolution.

The resulting footage showed how cells move, divide, and form the first parts of an embryo, like the heart. Each glowing cardiomyocyte could then be tracked back to earlier cells, allowing scientists to create a family tree of the cells. This helped them see exactly when and where the first cells that only make the heart appeared in the embryo.

At the very earliest stages, embryonic cells were multipotent (capable of becoming various cell types). These included not only heart cells but also others such as endocardial cells, a type of cell that lines the inner surfaces of blood vessels and heart chambers.

However, the researchers found that early during gastrulation (typically within the first four to five hours, after the first cell division), cells contributing solely to the heart emerge rapidly and behave in highly organised ways.

Rather than moving randomly, they follow distinct paths -- almost as if they already know where they are going and what role they will play, whether contributing to the ventricles (the heart's pumping chambers) or the atria (where blood enters the heart from the body and lungs).

Dr Ivanovitch said: ""Our findings demonstrate that cardiac fate determination and directional cell movement may be regulated much earlier in the embryo than current models suggest.

""This fundamentally changes our understanding of cardiac development by showing that what appears to be chaotic cell migration is actually governed by hidden patterns that ensure proper heart formation.""

Lead author, PhD candidate Shayma Abukar (UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and UCL Institute for Cardiovascular Science) said: ""We are now working to understand the signals that coordinate this complex choreography of cell movements during early heart development.

""The heart doesn't come from a single group of cells, it forms from a coalition of distinct cell groups that appear at different times and places during gastrulation.""

The insights from the study could revolutionise how scientists understand and treat congenital heart defects, which affect nearly one in 100 babies. The findings could also accelerate progress in growing heart tissue in the lab for use in regenerative medicine.

Dr Ivanovitch said: ""In the future, we hope this work will help uncover new mechanisms of organ formation. This will inform design principles to precisely program tissue patterns and shapes for tissue engineering.""

The research was supported by the British Heart Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Growth before photosynthesis: How trees regulate their water balance","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250513112306.htm","Tue, 13 May 2025 17:16:31 GMT","

In order for trees to grow, they need to control their water balance meticulously. A study by the University of Basel shows how trees react to drought -- and revises previous perceptions.

Plants have small pores on the underside of their leaves, known as stomata. When the sun rises, these pores open and the plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which they need, in addition to sunlight and water, for photosynthesis. At the same time, water evaporates through the open stomata; for a tree, this may be several hundred liters per day.

When water is scarce, plants can close their stomata and thus prevent it from evaporating too much water. The fact that plants have this protective mechanism at their disposal is nothing new. Until now, however, it has not been clear when this closure occurs and what the trigger was.Researchers at the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Basel have provided new findings in the scientific journal Nature Plants. Most of the measurement data comes from the University of Basel's forest laboratory in Hölstein, in the canton of Basel-Landschaft, where a crane makes it possible to study processes in the crowns of mature trees.

A balancing act within the canopy

The evaporation of water through the stomata is a passive process during CO2 absorption. Water loss is therefore the price a plant pays for photosynthesis. By closing the stomata, it can stop evaporation, but then it cannot photosynthesize.

""When it comes to plants, researchers have traditionally focused on photosynthesis. So it was previously assumed that trees treated this process as a priority and therefore kept the stomata open for as long as possible to absorb CO2, only closing them when there was no other option,"" explains study leader Professor Ansgar Kahmen.

When water evaporates through the stomata, negative pressure is created within the cells and the xylem (i.e. the woody tissue that transports water up from the roots). This suction pulls water up from the roots, via the xylem, into the growth layer of the trunk and into the tree crown. There it replaces the water that has been released into the atmosphere.

Preventing the system from collapsing

It usually takes trees all night to replace the water lost during the day. During this time, the stomata are closed and the plant cells fill up with water. This creates the turgor pressure on the cell walls that is necessary for the elongation growth of the cells. Trees therefore grow at night.

If the soil is dry, there is no water to fully replenish their water reserves. As a result, the water saturation in the cells is too low and the turgor pressure remains low. This inhibits tree growth even in intermediately dry conditions. With increasing levels of drought, the suction in the cells and vascular pathways becomes stronger and stronger until at some point the water columns in the woody tissue break. This results in air bubbles, known as embolisms. ""When this happens, irreparable damage occurs, the water transport system collapses and the plant eventually dies,"" says Ansgar Kahmen.

Water supply in the tree is key

It used to be assumed that, in order to maintain photosynthesis for as long as possible, trees would close their stomata only shortly before the onset of these embolisms. The new study now shows that the stomata remain closed at an earlier point in time, namely when water absorption at night has become difficult. ""For the first time, we were able to show that a tree does not even open its stomata in the morning if it cannot absorb enough water overnight,"" says Kahmen. This means that the tree forgoes photosynthesis in favor of growth.

According to Kahmen, this prioritization makes sense: If the plant stops growing due to a shortage of water, then, no matter how much photosynthesis it carries out, it will not be able to use the resulting products. ""So the aim is not to optimize photosynthesis and maintain it for as long as possible, but to use the products of photosynthesis as efficiently as possible for growth,"" says the plant physiologist.

Carbon cycle and climate models

The findings could also influence calculations relating to carbon sequestration by forests. When the stomata are open for shorter periods during drought than previously expected, the trees absorb less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ""Climate models that assume a certain growth in carbon storage volume would therefore have to be adapted,"" says lead author Richard L. Peters, a former postdoc at the University of Basel and now professor at the Technical University of Munich. Particularly in the context of climate change, which is leading to warmer and, above all, drier summers in countries including Switzerland, carbon uptake could change more dramatically than previously assumed.

""What is remarkable is that our early stomatal closure observations apply to all tree species, whether deciduous or coniferous. How well a tree species copes with drought therefore cannot be solely determined by the process of stomata closure"" says Peters.

Metrics details

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) affects ~1% of children and adults and is partly caused by genetic factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis combining 53,660 OCD cases and 2,044,417 controls and identified 30 independent genome-wide significant loci. Gene-based approaches identified 249 potential effector genes for OCD, with 25 of these classified as the most likely causal candidates, including WDR6, DALRD3 and CTNND1 and multiple genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. We estimated that ~11,500 genetic variants explained 90% of OCD genetic heritability. OCD genetic risk was associated with excitatory neurons in the hippocampus and the cortex, along with D1 and D2 type dopamine receptor-containing medium spiny neurons. OCD genetic risk was shared with 65 of 112 additional phenotypes, including all the psychiatric disorders we examined. In particular, OCD shared genetic risk with anxiety, depression, anorexia nervosa and Tourette syndrome and was negatively associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, educational attainment and body mass index.

OCD is a chronic psychiatric disorder that affects 1–3% of the population1 and is characterized by obsessions and compulsions that vary in type and severity and over time. OCD is responsible for profound personal and societal costs2, including increased risk of suicide3 and overall mortality4. OCD is moderately heritable; twin-based heritability estimates range between 27% and 47% in adults and between 45% and 65% in children5,6,7,8, with SNP-based heritability estimates between 28% and 37%9,10,11.

Two earlier OCD GWAS meta-analyses, both containing a subset of the data included in this analysis12,13, showed SNP-based heritabilities of 8.5% (assuming a 3% population prevalence) and 16% (assuming a 2% population prevalence). The first GWAS (ncases = 14,140, ncontrols = 562,117)12 found one genome-wide significant locus associated with OCD, while the second (ncases = 37,015, ncontrols = 948,616)13 identified 15 independent genome-wide significant loci. As with other complex traits, increased sample sizes are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying genetic etiology of OCD and its genetic relationships with related disorders.

The current study combines data from the two unpublished OCD GWASs described above and includes additional cohorts (~9,000 cases). This results in one of the largest and most well-powered GWAS of OCD so far, with a ~20-fold increase of OCD cases compared to the previously published OCD GWASs10. Based on the results from the meta-analysis, we conducted secondary analyses, including positional and functional fine-mapping of SNPs and genes, structural equation modeling to examine possible genetic differences in sample ascertainment across cohorts, protein and transcriptome-wide association analyses, single-cell enrichment and genetic correlations with other traits (Supplementary Fig. 1). Our results provide more detailed insight into the genetic underpinnings and biology of OCD.

We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of 28 OCD case–control cohorts of European ancestry, comprising 53,660 cases and 2,044,417 controls (effective sample size, ~210,000 individuals). Ascertainment of cases varied across cohorts: OCD diagnosis was determined (1) by a healthcare professional in a clinical setting (18 cohorts, n = 9,089 cases), (2) from health records or biobanks (seven cohorts, n = 9,138 cases), (3) in a clinical setting or from health records with the additional characteristic that all OCD cases were primarily collected for another psychiatric disorder (three cohorts, n = 5,266 cases) or (4) by self-reported diagnosis in a consumer-based setting (23andMe, Inc., n = 30,167 cases). Cohort details, including phenotypic assessment, quality control and individual cohort GWAS analyses, are described in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Table 1. We identified 30 independent (defined in Supplementary Note 3) loci among the 1,672 SNPs that exceeded the genome-wide threshold for significance (\(P < 5{\times 10}^{-8}\); Manhattan plot in Fig. 1, regional association plots and forest plots in Supplementary Figs. 2–31 and a list of all independent genome-wide significant SNPs in Table 1 with additional details in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The independence of the 30 lead SNPs was subsequently validated using conditional and joint analysis (GCTA-COJO)14 (Supplementary Table 4). Analysis of the X chromosome, conducted in a subset of the data for which this information was available (23andMe), yielded no significant associations (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 37e). Of the 15 genome-wide significant loci previously reported in preprints12,13, 13 were genome-wide significant in the current GWAS, with the remaining two showing suggestive significance (\(P=5.23{\times 10}^{-8}\,{\rm{and}}\,{P}=2.2{\times 10}^{-7}\); Supplementary Table 5). Using MiXeR15, we estimated that approximately 11,500 (standard error of the effect estimate (s.e.) = 607) causal variants account for 90% of the OCD SNP-based heritability.

The y axis represents −log10 (P values) (two sided, not adjusted for multiple testing) for the association of variants with OCD using an inverse-variance-weighted fixed-effects model (ncases = 53,660 and ncontrols = 2,044,417). The x axis shows chromosomes 1–22. The horizontal red line represents the threshold for genome-wide significance (\(P=5\times {10}^{-8})\). Index variants of genome-wide significant loci are highlighted as green diamonds.

No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed across individual cohorts for the 30 genome-wide significant loci, as assessed with Cochran's Q-test (Supplementary Fig. 32), the I2 statistic and the genomic structural equation modeling (GenomicSEM) \({Q}_{{\rm{SNP}}}\) statistic16 (Supplementary Table 2). Genome-wide analyses of samples grouped by clinical, comorbid, biobank and 23andMe information (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figs. 33–37) showed evidence that sample ascertainment impacted results at a genome-wide scale, although not beyond what is observed with closely related psychiatric disorders17,18. We observed moderate to high genetic correlations across the subgroups (between 0.63, s.e. = 0.11 for biobanks and comorbid information and 0.92, s.e. = 0.07 for 23andMe and comorbid information; Supplementary Table 7) and a satisfactory fit for a one-factor GenomicSEM model (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 39). A common factor GWAS based on the one-factor GenomicSEM model resulted in 20 significant loci, all of which were also significant in the primary GWAS (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 40; analysis details in Supplementary Note 5). SNP heritability (assuming a 1% population prevalence) was 6.7% (s.e. = 0.3%), with slightly higher estimates for the clinical (\({h}_{{\rm{SNP}}}^{2}\) = 16.4%, s.e. = 1.5%) and comorbid (\({h}_{{\rm{SNP}}}^{2}\) = 13.3%, s.e. = 1.7%) subgroups (Supplementary Table 1).

We prioritized putative risk genes for OCD using six positional and functional QTL gene-based mapping approaches. Positional mapping was performed with mBAT-combo19. Functional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping was performed with transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS)20, using PsychENCODE gene expression weights21, and summary-based Mendelian randomization (SMR)22 using the whole-blood eQTLGen23 and MetaBrain24 datasets. Functional protein QTL mapping was done using a protein-wide association study (PWAS) of human brain protein expression panels25. Finally, we used the psychiatric omnilocus prioritization score (PsyOPS)26, which combines positional mapping with biological annotations, to further prioritize risk genes within genome-wide significant loci. We identified 207 significant genes (Bonferroni correction, P < 2.67 × 10−6) with mBAT-combo and 24 genes using TWAS (P < 4.76 × 10−6), 14 of which were conditionally independent. The SMR–eQTLGen analysis identified 39 significant risk genes (P < 4.28 × 10−6), and the SMR–MetaBrain analysis identified 14 risk genes (P < 9.23 × 10−6). The PWAS identified three significant genes (P < 3.39 × 10−5), while PsyOPS prioritized 29 genes. In total, 251 genes were significantly associated with OCD through at least one gene-based approach, and 48 were implicated by at least two methods (Methods, Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Tables 9–14).

From the 48 genes implicated by at least two approaches, we prioritized likely causal genes for OCD using colocalization (TWAS-COLOC)27,28 and SMR–heterogeneity in dependent instruments (SMR-HEIDI)22 tests. Colocalization was used to identify significant TWAS associations for which the underlying GWAS and eQTL summary statistics are likely to share a single causal variant. Similarly, HEIDI was used to select SMR associations for which the same causal variant affects gene expression and trait variation. Of the 48 genes implicated by at least two gene-based tests, 25 were also significant in either the TWAS-COLOC or the SMR-HEIDI tests, suggesting causality (Fig. 2a). Only 2 of these 25 genes were prioritized by both TWAS-COLOC and SMR-HEIDI: WDR6 (WD repeat domain 6) and DALRD3 (DALR anticodon binding domain-containing 3). Another gene of interest, CTNND1 (catenin δ1), was implicated by three of our five approaches (multivariate set-based association test (mBAT-combo), TWAS, PWAS) and showed evidence for colocalization. Only three genes were implicated in the PWAS; of these, CTNND1 was the only gene also implicated in the TWAS. In the PWAS, downregulation of CTNND1 protein expression in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was significantly associated with OCD risk (\(Z=-4.49,P=7.11\times {10}^{-6}\); Supplementary Table 13), consistent with the downregulation of CTNND1 gene expression in the prefrontal cortex seen in the TWAS (\(Z=-6.86,P=6.90\times {10}^{-12};\) Supplementary Table 10). For a discussion of the overlap between the gene findings with rare coding variants in OCD, see Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Note 7.

After mapping significantly associated SNPs from the GWAS meta-analysis to likely causal genes, we explored which tissues or cell types showed enriched gene expression of OCD-associated genetic signals using a previously described approach29 on published human gene expression datasets from bulk tissue RNA-seq data from the Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the adult mouse central and peripheral nervous systems30. We found enrichment of OCD GWAS signals in six of 13 human brain tissue types in GTEx but no enrichment in human peripheral tissues (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 15). In the adult mouse central and peripheral nervous systems, we found enrichment of OCD GWAS signals in 41 of 166 tested specific single cell types using the MAGMA gene set enrichment test (Supplementary Table 16). When summarizing results of individual single cell types into groups of cell types defined by the same region or tissue and cell type, nine of 35 were enriched for OCD GWAS signals (top 20 shown in Fig. 2c). Strong enrichment of OCD GWAS signal was especially observed in excitatory neurons of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex as well as in D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs).

Using phenome-wide association analysis, we examined whether the 30 independent OCD-associated loci identified by our GWAS meta-analysis have previously been associated with other phenotypes (see Supplementary Tables 17a–d for lookups in four, partially overlapping GWAS databanks and Table 1 for highlighted associations). We found that 22 of the 30 loci were associated with other phenotypes, including schizophrenia (seven loci), depression and major depressive disorder (two loci), bipolar disorder (one locus), neuroticism (seven loci), educational attainment (seven loci) and body fat mass or body mass index (eight loci).

We further used bivariate linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC)31 to investigate the extent of genetic correlations between OCD and 112 previously published GWASs encompassing psychiatric, substance use and neurological phenotypes, among others (Fig. 3). We found that 65 phenotypes were significantly correlated with OCD after correcting for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg32 procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at a threshold of 0.05. OCD was significantly positively correlated with all tested psychiatric phenotypes; the highest correlations were with anxiety (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.70\)), depression (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.60\)), anorexia nervosa (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.52\)), Tourette syndrome (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.47\)) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; \({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.48\)). Significant positive genetic correlations were also obtained for neuroticism (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.53\)), in particular for the worry subcluster (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.64\)), and all individual items in the worry subcluster, with slightly lower estimates for the depressive subcluster (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.35\)). Suicide attempt (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.40\)), history of childhood maltreatment (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.37\)) and tiredness (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.36\)) were also notable for strong positive associations with OCD. Of the assessed neurological disorders, OCD was only significantly correlated with migraine (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=0.15\)). Some autoimmune disorders, such as Crohn's disease (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=-0.13\)), ulcerative colitis (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=-0.14\)) and inflammatory bowel disease (\({r}_{\rm{G}}=-0.14\)), showed negative correlations with OCD (see Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 18 for all genetic correlation estimates, 95% confidence intervals and P values, Supplementary Note 6 for a more in-depth discussion of all significant genetic correlations and Supplementary Table 19 and Supplementary Figs. 41 and 42 for subgroup-specific genetic correlation estimates).

This includes psychiatric, substance use, cognition–socioeconomic status (SES), personality, psychological, neurological, autoimmune, cardiovascular (cardiovasc.), anthropomorphic–diet, fertility and other phenotypes. References and sample sizes of the corresponding summary statistics of the GWAS studies can be found in Supplementary Table 18.

The OCD GWAS reported here, comprising over 53,000 cases, identified 30 independent genome-wide significant loci. Common SNPs explained 6.7% of the variation in OCD risk in our meta-analysis (LDSC with an assumed population prevalence of 1%), a significant reduction from the 28% reported previously10. However, differences in the assumed population prevalence (where a lower assumed prevalence for LDSC heritability calculation results in a lower heritability estimate) and an increase in sample heterogeneity likely contributed to this discrepancy. The reduction in SNP heritability is in line with previous observations for closely related psychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)33,34 or depression17,35,36,37, where expanding the phenotype definition increased genetic heterogeneity, potentially accounting for the observed decrease in SNP heritability. This aligns with the fact that heritability estimates for more homogeneous OCD subgroups were higher: 16.4% for the clinically ascertained subgroup and 13.3% for the comorbid subgroup (Supplementary Note 10). The current estimates are comparable to those of other psychiatric and substance use disorders, with SNP heritability estimates ranging between 9% and 28%38.

The most significant SNP (rs78587207 (\(P=5.28\times 1{0}^{-12}\))) identified in the GWAS is located on chr11q12.1 and has been previously associated with several traits, including neuropsychiatric phenotypes39 such as depressive symptoms40 and neuroticism40. Gene-based analyses identified four putative causal genes within this locus. The closest gene to rs78587207 is CTNND1, which encodes the cell adhesion molecule p120 catenin. This gene was associated with OCD using three gene-based tests (mBAT-combo, TWAS and PWAS), and we found strong evidence for colocalization of the TWAS signal for CTNND1 in the dlPFC. The dlPFC has been consistently implicated in the neural circuitry of OCD as well as in compulsivity more broadly as part of the cortico–striatal–thalamo–cortical circuitry41,42. The protein product of CTNND1 is a regulator of cell–cell adhesion43 and has a crucial role in gene transcription, Rho GTPase activity and cytoskeletal organization44,45,46. Other credible causal genes in the locus include CLP1 (cleavage factor polyribonucleotide kinase subunit 1), TMX2 (thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 2) and ZDHHC5 (zinc finger DHHC type palmitoyltransferase 5). Rare genetic mutations in CLP1 are associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 10, a very rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by brain atrophy and delayed myelination resulting in intellectual disability47. TMX2 is associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders with microcephaly, cortical malformations, spasticity and congenital nervous system abnormalities48. ZDHHC5 is broadly expressed in the brain, including the frontal cortex. ZDHHC5 has not been implicated in brain development but has been linked to lung acinar adenocarcinoma and lung papillary adenocarcinoma in prior studies49.

Our finding that approximately 11,500 (s.e. = 607) causal variants account for 90% of the SNP-based heritability of OCD suggests that OCD is more polygenic than other complex traits such as height (ncausal = 4,000), schizophrenia (ncausal = 9,600) and ADHD (ncausal = 5,600) but less polygenic than major depression (ncausal = 14,500) and educational attainment (ncausal = 13,200)50.

We identified a total of 25 credible causal genes based on robust evidence using multiple positional and functionally informed gene-based approaches. Notably, DLGAP1, which has been previously implicated in OCD pathogenesis10,51, was not identified in either the GWAS or in the gene-based analyses. Of the 25 genes that were implicated, 15 were within 6.5 kb of a SNP that surpassed genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis. In addition to the four genes discussed above, several others are of particular interest, including WDR6 and DALRD3, which had the strongest evidence from the gene-based analyses. These genes lie in a gene-rich region on chr3p21.31, which, in addition to harboring multiple genome-wide significant SNPs, has been previously associated with a broad range of psychiatric disorders and related traits, including schizophrenia39, well-being52 and the worry subcluster of neuroticism53.

WDR6 is broadly expressed in the brain, particularly the hypothalamus. Its protein product is involved in cell growth arrest54, and recent studies have implicated it in anorexia nervosa55 and Parkinson's disease56. DALRD3 is located on chromosome 3 in the same region as WDR6. DALRD3, when fully disrupted, is implicated in a form of epileptic encephalopathy with associated developmental delay57. Finally, a third gene in the 3p21 locus, CELSR3 (cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G type receptor 3), encodes a protocadherin that is highly expressed in the developing basal ganglia58. Multiple loss-of-function mutations in CELSR3 have been associated with Tourette syndrome59,60, which co-occurs with OCD in 10–20% of patients.

Four other genes identified through these analyses are located in the MHC locus, a region on chromosome 6 that has a major role in the adaptive immune system and has been repeatedly linked to major psychiatric disorders61. The newly identified MHC association for OCD is noteworthy given evidence linking OCD with autoimmune disorders62,63,64. Genetic pleiotropy may underlie this connection, with variants predisposing individuals to both autoimmune conditions and OCD65. Furthermore, some OCD subtypes, such as pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcus and pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, may have autoimmune origins66,67. Nevertheless, we were surprised to discover several negative genetic correlations between OCD and autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease in our analyses, suggesting that there is heterogeneity (and perhaps pleiotropy) in the genetic relationships between autoimmune disorders and OCD.

Tissue and cell type enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of OCD SNP heritability in several tissues and cell types, with the strongest enrichment in excitatory neurons of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex and in dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)-positive and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R)-positive MSNs in the striatum. These findings are in line with traditional neural circuitry models of OCD, which focus on frontal cortical–striatal pathways68,69. These findings are consistent with and build on previous work linking various neuronal cell types to psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes70.

Interestingly, the frontal and anterior cingulate cortices, which were enriched in our tissue-based analyses, as well as the hippocampus and the striatum, which were implicated in our cell type-based analyses, are among the regions that are consistently implicated in neuroimaging studies of OCD41,71,72,73. Enrichment in MSNs in the striatum is consistent with their role in the observed aberrant circuitry in OCD, where the D1 MSNs project to the globus pallidus interna and the substantia nigra in the direct pathway and the D2 type MSNs project to the globus pallidus externa in the indirect pathway74. However, MSNs are also enriched in major depressive disorder75, schizophrenia76 and intelligence77, suggesting that the observed enrichment is not specific for OCD.

Our analyses of the shared genetic risk between OCD and other psychiatric disorders provides further insights into the etiology of OCD. In line with previous observations38,78, OCD was significantly genetically correlated with multiple psychiatric disorders and traits. The strongest genetic correlations were observed for anxiety disorders, depression and anorexia nervosa, all of which are highly comorbid with OCD79. This aligns with previous findings from cross-disorder analyses suggesting a shared genetic susceptibility among most psychiatric disorders38,80,81. A notable exception is our finding that risk variants for OCD are protective for alcohol dependence82, which is at odds with epidemiological evidence strongly linking OCD and alcohol-related disorders83 but in line with a recent paper79 reporting a lower-than-expected lifetime comorbidity of substance use disorders in OCD. The observed pattern of correlations with other phenotypes can be thought of as falling into two categories: compulsivity–impulsivity and rumination–worry–neuroticism. In both categories, the patterns of genetic correlations appear to follow a gradient across disorders and traits. For example, in the compulsivity–impulsivity category, strong positive correlations are seen with anorexia nervosa and Tourette syndrome, which are disorders with strong compulsive features, with less positive associations seen with ADHD and negative correlations with alcohol dependence and risk-taking behaviors, which are all phenotypes characterized by impulsivity. A similar gradient is observed for the rumination–worry–neuroticism-related phenotypes, with strong positive correlations with anxiety and other ruminative phenotypes such as worry, transitioning to less strong correlations with individual depression-related items.

This study marks the transition from the flat (sample-building) phase of SNP discovery described for GWAS84 (Supplementary Fig. 20), where few to no genome-wide significant loci are identified10,12,51,85, to the linear phase of SNP discovery, where even relatively small increases in sample size identify additional genome-wide significant loci18. The strengths of the current study therefore include the marked increase in the number of OCD cases and the rigorous analytic methods, including two multivariate approaches (multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG) and GenomicSEM) to control for potential overlapping study participants and to examine potential heterogeneity between the multiple ascertainment approaches. Potential weaknesses include the inability to document comorbid psychiatric disorders in the majority of cases that were not ascertained from clinical collections or electronic registries, the lack of inclusion of non-European ancestries and the limited availability of sex chromosome data. Owing to the nature of our study, imputation references used in the different cohorts were heterogeneous and did not allow for confident analysis of rare variant associations. Future larger-scale sequencing studies that are currently underway will be needed to identify associations in this allele frequency spectrum. We also note that the genetic correlation analyses are impacted by residual heterogeneity in genetic signals owing to the employment of heterogeneous ascertainment strategies.

In summary, this work substantially advances the field of OCD genetics by identifying new OCD genetic risk loci and multiple credible candidate causal genes, including those expressed in brain regions and cell types previously implicated in OCD86. We have also shown that OCD is highly polygenic in nature, with many variants implicated not only in OCD but also in commonly comorbid disorders or traits, in particular, anxiety, neuroticism, anorexia nervosa and depression. The observation that common variants explain only a modest amount of the phenotypic variation in OCD suggests that other types of genetic variation may also contribute to the etiology of OCD. Notably, whole-exome-sequencing studies have suggested that a substantial proportion of OCD cases (22%) may be influenced by rare de novo coding variants87, especially in genes that are intolerant to loss of function88. Similarly, rare potentially damaging copy number variations represent part of the risk architecture for OCD9. These findings emphasize the need for a comprehensive exploration of the contribution of both common and rare genetic factors as well as their interplay to OCD risk. Finally, with the implication of the MHC complex, we provide additional evidence for potential shared genetic influences underlying both OCD and increased liability to autoimmune processes, although the directionality of those relationships remains to be definitively elucidated. In addition to continuing to increase sample sizes, future studies will require ancestrally diverse samples to further facilitate the discovery of additional OCD risk variants. Similarly, sex-specific analyses and additional clinical phenotyping will allow for the further elucidation of genetic and clinical relationships between OCD and co-occurring disorders. Finally, with the emergence of drug databases describing the relations between drugs and molecular phenotypes89, our results may be useful for drug repurposing (that is, identifying existing drugs targeting OCD risk genes), leading to new opportunities to find more effective treatments.

All relevant ethics approvals have been obtained by the respective cohort's institutions, and a list of all respective approvals can be found in Supplementary Note 2.

We analyzed genomic data from 28 OCD case–control cohorts including 53,660 OCD cases and 2,044,417 controls of European ancestry. Supplementary Table 1 provides an overview of the individual cohorts. A subset of the cases and controls have been included in previous studies10,51,85 and preprints12,13, as described in Supplementary Note 2. Among all included individuals, 323 cases were part of a parent–proband trio; in these cases, parents were used as pseudocontrols. A total of 20,427 cases met DSM-5 (ref. 93) or ICD-10 (https://icd.who.int/) criteria for OCD as assessed by a healthcare professional or derived from (electronic) health records, while the remaining 32,233 cases were based on self-reported OCD diagnosis (23andMe, AGDS and parts of UKBB). Cohort-specific sample and analytic details can be found in Supplementary Note 2. Data collections were approved by the relevant institutional review boards at all participating sites, and all participants provided written informed consent.

First, the data of each participating cohort were analyzed individually (see Supplementary Note 2 for details). Genetic data were imputed using either the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC)94 or 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 reference panels95. The resulting GWAS summary statistics were then harmonized before a conjoint meta-analysis of all autosomes was conducted. Each summary statistic dataset was transformed to the ‘daner' file format following RICOPILI96 specifications. All variants had to meet the following criteria for inclusion: minor allele frequency (MAF) > 1% in cases and controls, INFO score > 0.8 and <1.2. If the effect measure, P value or s.e. was missing or was out of bounds (infinite), the SNP was removed. Once cleaned summary statistics were produced, all datasets were aligned to the HRC reference panel. If variants were reported on different strands, they were flipped to the orientation in the HRC reference. Furthermore, strand-ambiguous A/T and C/G SNPs were removed if their MAF was >0.4. In the case that A/T and C/G SNPs showed a MAF < 0.4, allele frequencies were compared to frequencies in the HRC reference. If an allele frequency match was found, that is, minor alleles were the same in the summary statistics and the HRC reference, the same strand orientation was assumed. If an allele mismatch was found, that is, the allele had a frequency > 0.5 in the HRC reference, it was assumed that alleles were reported on different strands, and alleles were flipped subsequently. Marker names were uniformly switched to those present in the HRC reference. If a variant did not overlap with the variants in the HRC reference, it was removed.

Inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis was conducted on 28 European cohorts using METAL97. Weighting was based on standard error primarily to account for the large case–control imbalances in cohorts that used linear mixed model approaches in their primary GWAS. Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q statistic and the I2 statistic98,99 (see Supplementary Note 5 for details). The genomic control factor lambda (λ) was calculated for each individual GWAS and for the overall meta-analysis to identify residual population stratification or systematic technical artifacts. GWAS summary statistics were subjected to LDSC analyses on high-quality common SNPs (INFO score > 0.9) to examine the LDSC intercept to distinguish polygenicity from other types of inflation and to estimate the genetic heritability from the meta-analysis and genetic correlations between cohorts. The genomic inflation factor λ was estimated at 1.330 with a λ1000 of 1.033, while the LDSC intercept was 1.0155 (s.e. = 0.0085), indicating that the inflation was mostly due to polygenic signal and unlikely to be substantially confounded by population structure. The genome-wide significance threshold for the GWAS was set at a P value of \(5.0\times 1{0}^{-8}\). The 23andMe data included information on the X chromosome; as this information was not present for all other cohorts, analysis of the X chromosome was only conducted in this subcohort (see Supplementary Note 4 for details).

We further conducted GWAS meta-analyses on the following four subgroups, defined by differences in their sample ascertainment: (1) clinical OCD cases diagnosed by a healthcare professional in a clinical setting (ncases = 9,089, ncontrols = 21,077; including IOCDF, IOCDF_trio, EPOC, NORDiC-nor, NORDiC-swe, EGOS, OCGAS, OCGAS-ab, OCGAS-gh, OCGAS-nes, Psych_Broad, WWF, MVP, Michigan/Toronto IGS, YalePenn, Chop, CoGa), (2) comorbid individuals who were primarily ascertained for another comorbid psychiatric disorder (ncases = 5,266, ncontrols = 43,760; AGDS, iPSYCH), (3) biobank data from large-scale biobanks or registries with ICD or DSM codes (ncases = 9,138, ncontrols = 1,049,776; BioVU, EstBB, FinnGen, HUNT, MoBa, UKBB) or (4) 23andMe data (ncases = 30,167, ncontrols = 929,804). While these groups are not exclusive (for example, diagnoses in health records were originally given in a clinical setting or comorbid cases were also assessed in a clinical setting or derived from health records), we defined these groups by the cohort's primary characteristic. We also conducted one meta-analysis including all clinical, comorbid and biobank subgroups, while excluding the 23andMe data, resulting in 23,493 cases and 1,114,613 controls. As 23andMe is the only consumer-based dataset, we intended to compare this dataset to all others.

We applied MiXeR version 1.3 (ref. 15) to quantify the polygenicity of OCD (that is, estimate the total number of trait-influencing genetic variants). MiXeR fits a Gaussian mixture model assuming that common genetic effects on a trait are a mixture of causal variants and noncausal variants. Polygenicity is reported as the number of causal variants that explain 90% of SNP heritability of OCD (to avoid extrapolating model parameters into the area of infinitesimally small effects).

We performed a conditional and joint analysis (GCTA-COJO)14 to identify independent signals within significant OCD loci. This approach performs a conditional and joint analysis on the basis of conditional P values before calculating the joint effects of all selected SNPs. We used the stepwise model selection procedure to select independently associated SNPs. The linkage disequilibrium reference sample was created from 73,005 individuals from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute genetic epidemiology cohort. The distance assumed for complete linkage disequilibrium was 10 Mb, and we used the default P-value threshold of \(5\times {10}^{-8}\) to define a genome-wide significant hit.

We used MTAG100 to conduct multivariable GWAS analyses, reporting GWAS results for each of the ascertainment-specific subgroups. Through this approach, we aimed to address potential concerns about heterogeneity in genetic liability for individual subgroups following different ascertainment strategies. MTAG is a multi-trait analysis that is usually used to combine different but related traits into one meta-analysis by leveraging the shared heritability among the different traits and thereby gaining power. In this case, our aim was to generate ascertainment-specific estimates, while boosting power by leveraging the high shared heritability between the subgroups. The MTAG analysis resulted in four different GWAS summary statistics, one for each subgroup (clinical, comorbid, biobanks, 23andMe). We performed maxFDR analyses to approximate the upper bound on the FDR of MTAG results.

Similarly, we used GenomicSEM16 to model the joint genetic architecture of the four subgroups. First, we ran a common factor model without individual SNP effects, following the tutorial ‘Models without individual SNP effects' on the GenomicSEM GitHub website (Code availability). Second, we ran a multivariate GWAS of the common factor (see Supplementary Note 5 for details). We specified the model using unit variance identification, for which the latent factor variance is fixed to 1 and the loadings of the traits are estimated freely. This ensures that we capture how much of each subgroup contributes to the latent factor. GenomicSEM also generates \({Q}_{{\rm{SNP}}}\) values, which indicate possible heterogeneous effects across the subgroups. The \({Q}_{{\rm{SNP}}}\) statistic is mathematically similar to the Q statistic from standard meta-analysis and is a \({ X}^{2}\)-distributed test statistic, with larger values indexing a violation of the null hypothesis that the SNP acts entirely through the common factor.

The proportion of the phenotypic variance that could be explained by the aggregated effect of all included SNPs (SNP-based heritability, \({h}_{{\rm{SNP}}}^{2}\)) was estimated using LDSC31. The analysis was performed using precomputed linkage disequilibrium scores from samples restricted to European ancestry in the 1000 Genomes Project95, filtered for SNPs included in the HapMap 3 reference panel101. SNP heritability was estimated based on the slope of the LDSC, with heritability on the liability scale calculated assuming a 1% population prevalence of OCD1. To omit a downward bias in our estimates of liability-scale heritability, following Grotzinger et al.102, we accounted for varying levels of ascertainment across cohorts in our meta-analysis by summing the effective sample sizes across the contributing cohorts and using that as the input sample size for LDSC. For conversion to the liability scale (1%), the sample prevalence was then specified as 0.5. The SNP heritability was calculated for the whole OCD sample as well as for ascertainment-specific subgroups.

We used cross-trait LDSC31, a method that computes genetic correlations between GWASs without bias from ancestry differences or sample overlap to calculate genetic correlations between the primary OCD meta-analysis and other phenotypes of interest. The selection of traits was based on phenotypic relevance and/or prior report of a genetic relationship with OCD. The genetic correlation between traits was based on the estimated slope from the regression of the product of Z scores from two GWASs on the linkage disequilibrium score and represents the genetic covariation between two traits based on all polygenic effects captured by the included SNPs. The genome-wide linkage disequilibrium information used by these methods was based on European populations from the HapMap 3 reference panel101, and GWAS summary statistics were filtered to only include SNPs that were part of the 1,290,028 HapMap 3 SNPs.

To ensure the internal consistency of the datasets included in our meta-analysis, we calculated genetic correlations between all cohorts we considered to have a sample size large enough for LDSC (effective sample size of ≥1,000) and between the four ascertainment-specific subgroups.

We further calculated genetic correlations between OCD and 112 other disorders and traits. The source studies of the GWAS summary statistics can be found in Supplementary Table 18. As a follow-up, we also calculated genetic correlations between the 112 phenotypes and each ascertainment-specific subcohort and compared the genetic correlation patterns between the four groups. For all cross-phenotype genetic correlation analyses, we adjusted P values for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to control for the FDR (<0.05).

To match the significant SNPs to the genes for which they likely influence function, we conducted a series of positional and functional gene-mapping analyses. The positional mapping employed MBAT-combo19, while the functional mapping tested whether genetic variants associated with OCD were also associated with differential expression of nearby genes (within a 1-Mb window) using (1) TWAS20 using PsychENCODE data and included colocalization with COLOC27,28, and (2) SMR22 using whole-blood eQTL information and brain tissues from MetaBrain, alongside the HEIDI test, which tests for heterogeneity in GWAS signal and eQTL association. Furthermore, a PWAS was conducted. As a final step, genes within each locus were prioritized using PsyOPS26, which integrates both positional and functional information. The details of each method are described below.

A gene-based analysis was conducted using mBAT-combo19 within GCTA version 1.94.1 (ref. 14). The European subsample (n = 503 individuals) from phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project95 was used as the linkage disequilibrium reference panel with the fastBAT default linkage disequilibrium cutoff of 0.9 applied. After filtering SNPs with MAF > 0.01, there were 6,629,124 SNPs for analysis in our sample. A gene list consisting of 19,899 protein-coding genes was used to map the base pair position of genes using genome build hg19 (see Supplementary Note 7 for details).

We used TWAS FUSION20 to perform a TWAS of OCD. We used brain gene expression weights from the PsychENCODE103 and linkage disequilibrium information from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 (ref. 95). TWAS FUSION uses reference linkage disequilibrium and reference gene expression panels with GWAS summary statistics to estimate the association between gene expression and OCD risk. These data were processed with the test statistics from the OCD GWAS to estimate the expression–GWAS association statistic. We corrected for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction.

We performed colocalization analyses using the COLOC R function27,28 implemented in TWAS FUSION. Colocalization is a Bayesian method used to calculate the posterior probabilities (PP) that individual lead SNPs within a significant TWAS locus are (1) independent (for example, two causal SNPs in linkage disequilibrium, one affecting transcription and one affecting OCD; PP3) or (2) share the same associated variant (for example, a single causal SNP affects both transcription and OCD (PP4)). We also performed a conditional analysis to determine whether identified associations represented independent associations. This was performed using the FUSION software, which jointly estimates the effect of all significant features within each locus by using residual SNP associations with OCD after accounting for the predicted expression of other features.

SMR22 was performed using default settings and eQTL meta-analysis summary statistics from European populations for whole blood from eQTLGen23 and all five nervous system tissues from MetaBrain (basal ganglia, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus and spinal cord)104. The HEIDI test was performed alongside SMR to test for effect size heterogeneity between the GWAS and eQTL summary statistics. Both SMR and TWAS have a number of important assumptions and limitations, which we discuss in Supplementary Note 9.

We used the gene prioritization method PsyOPS26 to rank genes within genome-wide significant loci. This supervised approach integrates biological annotations on mutational intolerance, brain-specific expression and involvement in neurodevelopmental disorder for genes within significant loci. Genes with the top PsyOPS score within each locus were used for further gene prioritization (Gene prioritization). In the instance where two genes in the same locus had the same PsyOPS score, the gene nearest the index SNP was prioritized.

We performed a PWAS using protein expression data from human brain samples. Human brain proteome reference weight data were obtained using the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and the Banner Sun Health Research Institute (Banner) study. The ROS/MAP proteomes were generated from the dlPFC of 376 participants of European ancestry and included 1,476 proteins with significant SNP-based heritability (P < 0.01). The Banner PWAS weights were generated from 152 individuals of European ancestry and included 1,147 proteins with significant SNP-based heritability. The PWAS was performed using the TWAS FUSION software20 with linkage disequilibrium reference information from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 (ref. 95). We corrected for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction.

We created a list of prioritized genes using both gene-based tests and colocalization–HEIDI filters. Results from each gene-based test were first restricted to protein-coding genes with unique gene identifiers based on the release from GENCODE (version 40) for hg19. The following criteria were then used to prioritize genes: (1) a significant (Bonferroni-corrected) association from at least two gene-based tests (mBAT-combo, TWAS FUSION, SMR or PsyOPS) and (2) evidence of colocalization (COLOC PP4 > 0.8) and/or significant SMR association with HEIDI P > 0.05. Joint–conditional tests of association and significant PWAS associations were used as ancillary approaches to further annotate the prioritized gene list.

An analysis of tissue and cell type enrichment of OCD GWAS association signals was conducted using MAGMA (version 1.08)105 and partitioned LDSC106. We used the previously described approach29 to determine gene expression specificity in bulk tissue RNA-seq data from 37 tissues in GTEx (version 8) and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from 19 regions in the mouse central and peripheral nervous systems30. The analysis was limited to protein-coding genes with 1:1 orthologs between mice and humans. Gene expression in each tissue or cell type was calculated relative to total expression across all tissues or cell types. Enrichment analysis was performed on genes with the top 10% specificity values in each tissue or cell type, as previously defined29.

To evaluate the enrichment of tissue- and cell type-specific genes in OCD genetic association signals, we applied MAGMA and partitioned LDSC. We restricted the analysis to summary statistics for SNPs with a high INFO score (>0.6) and frequency in the entire cohort (MAF > 0.01). Using MAGMA (version 1.08), we tested whether genes with the top 10% specificity in a tissue or cell type showed enrichment in gene-level genetic associations for OCD, with the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 European sample genotypes serving as the linkage disequilibrium reference panel. We used standard gene boundaries (35 kb upstream of the transcription start site to 10 kb downstream of the transcription stop site). Partitioned LDSC was used to examine whether SNPs within 100-kb regions of the top 10% specifically expressed genes were enriched for SNP-based heritability for OCD. All results were corrected for multiple testing with an FDR threshold of 0.05.

Multiple resources were used to identify previously reported associations of our 30 significant SNPs with other phenotypes. We used the IEU Open GWAS project92, PheWAS analysis of GWAS ATLAS52 and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog91 and identified credible SNPs through CAUSALdb90. CAUSALdb estimates causal probabilities of all genetic variants in GWAS significant loci using three state-of-the-art fine-mapping tools including PAINTOR, CAVIARBF and FINEMAP107,108,109,110. We used default settings for our CAUSALdb queries.

We performed a lookup of SNPs identified to be significantly associated with OCD-related phenotypes in previous GWASs. Note that this is not an independent replication, as previous studies partially overlap with the cohorts included in this GWAS.

We performed a bidirectional lookup, assessing (1) whether gene findings from our GWAS showed evidence for rare variant involvement and (2) vice versa, whether findings from rare variant testing showed evidence of common variant association in our GWAS.

First, we comprehensively assessed the overlap between 251 genes that we highlighted in our study as carrying common risk variation for OCD (Supplementary Table 14) and current gene-based summary statistics from OCD exome-sequencing data. We used data from Halvorsen et al.88 because it is the largest published exome-sequencing study of OCD presently. The supplementary materials from that paper include de novo variant calls from 771 case trios and 1,911 controls (supplementary table 14 in ref. 88). We compared the burden of de novo variants, partitioned by variant annotation (synonymous, missense, loss of function) in trio cases versus trio controls within these 251 GWAS-prioritized genes. As described previously88, we only included de novo variants that were in loci well covered in both case and control data (In_Jointly_Covered_Loci==TRUE). We also excluded all calls from quartet samples in ref. 88 (Cohort!=“OCD_JHU_quartets”). For each of the four variant annotation classes, we compared the proportion of cases that had at least one qualifying de novo variant to the proportion of controls using a two-sided Fisher's exact test.

Second, as Halvorsen et al.88 describe an overall excess of loss-of-function variants in OCD cases relative to controls specifically within loss-of-function intolerant genes (supplementary table 13 in ref. 88), we analyzed the overlap between those genes and our GWAS-derived genes. We looked up 200 genes with a probability of loss-of-function intolerance > 0.995 (derived from ref. 111) and effect size estimate > 1. We further tested for a difference in the proportion of these pLI > 0.995 genes with effect size estimate > 1 versus ≤1 within the set of genes highlighted in the OCD GWAS (n = 251) versus outside this set using a two-sided Fisher's exact test.

Metrics details

Synchrotron techniques can probe battery materials and devices at unprecedented scales of time and space, providing in-depth mechanistic understanding. However, the lack of standardization in synchrotron measurements and analyses can lead to biased interpretations of data and results. Here, we propose possible strategies to address the reliability, representativeness and reproducibility issues of synchrotron characterizations in battery research.

Metrics details

Anionic polymerizations of vinyl monomers are powerful synthetic platforms for making well-defined materials. However, these reactions are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, require the use of highly purified reagents, must be run at low temperatures, and use hazardous and difficult-to-handle alkyl lithium initiators. Together, these drawbacks limit the practicality of these polymerizations and impede their widespread usage. On this basis, the development of a user-friendly anionic polymerization process for methacrylates is a grand challenge. Here we report an anionic polymerization of methacrylates mediated by CO2 that can be run at elevated temperatures and uses an easy-to-handle solid initiator. The reversible addition of CO2 to the enolate chain end efficiently tempers the reactivity of the anion, giving polymers with narrow molar mass distributions and excellent molecular weight targeting at elevated temperatures.

Metrics details

Naturally occurring hydrogen accumulations could be an important source of clean hydrogen for hard-to-abate industry use and energy, but societally important reserves have yet to be proven. In this Review, we explore the conditions that enable the development of natural hydrogen resources in the geological subsurface, by examining the processes of hydrogen generation, migration, accumulation and preservation. Natural hydrogen is generated within the continental crust by two key mechanisms, water–rock reactions where Fe2+, dominantly in ultramafic rocks, is oxidized to Fe3+, and by radiolysis of water via radioactive elements U, Th and K found in upper-crustal rocks. These two generation reactions operate on very different timescales, ranging from thousands to millions of years for water–rock reactions in highly fractured rocks, to tens to hundreds of millions of years for water-limited water–rock and radiolysis reactions. Different globally widespread terrane types have the potential for hydrogen accumulations: continental margin ophiolite complexes, alkaline granite terranes, large igneous provinces, and Archaean greenstone belts and tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite granitic batholiths. Exploitation of natural hydrogen would have a low-carbon footprint, but continental systems do not provide a regenerating system on decadal to centennial timescales, and should not be considered a renewable resource. Calculating hydrogen generation by water–rock reactions is subject to more uncertainty than radiolysis reactions, but improving these estimates should be a priority for future research.

Over the past billion years, the Archaean crust alone has generated volumes of hydrogen energy equivalent to ca 170,000 years of present-day societal oil use. However, it is not known how much of this hydrogen has been preserved in societally relevant accumulations.

Natural hydrogen accumulation requires a source rock, water within the source rock, transport and a trap to retain the hydrogen. The generation and preservation of a gas phase is essential for economic recovery.

Gas accumulations of high-purity (>90%) hydrogen are known to occur (such as the Bourakebougou reserve found in Mali), but hydrogen mixed with helium, nitrogen and other gases are predicted in many settings.

Helium, readily detected in near-surface fluids, provides a critical analogue to hydrogen, and can illustrate regional controls on deep gas release, transport and gas-phase formation.

A basic understanding of the geological controls of hydrogen generation by radiolytic and water–rock reaction pathways exists and enables exploration to find the most prospective regions.

The mantle is not a source of hydrogen gas found in the crust or near surface, as mantle-derived hydrogen is most stable as water at pressures and temperatures shallower than ca. 90 km depth.

Achieving net-zero emissions requires an urgent transition from fossil fuel use. Hydrogen manufactured from coal and natural gas, for example, generated 2.4% of global CO2 emissions (900 Mt) in 2022. The need for hydrogen is hard to abate because of its use as a chemical feedstock for the production of ammonia, methanol and in metal refining1,2. Indeed, fertilizer produced from ammonia contributes to feeding half of the global population3. Low-carbon hydrogen production technologies are available, but their high cost has hampered deployment. For example, hydrogen production from the electrolysis of water uses energy from renewable sources (termed ‘green hydrogen'). Green hydrogen has low CO2 emissions (0.3 kg CO2 kg−1 H2) but the cost is high, up to US$2.5–6.5 kg−1 H2 (Fig. 1). These costs are more than double the fossil fuel-based hydrogen production technologies (‘black' or ‘grey' hydrogen; US$1.0–2.7 kg−1 H2), even with the additional cost of carbon capture and storage to off-set the emissions (‘blue hydrogen'; US$1.5–4.0 kg−1 H2)1,4,5 (Fig. 1). A low-carbon energy carrier, hydrogen can support the increased use of renewables and provide a suitable fuel alternative for other ‘hard-to-abate' sectors across industry and transport. Demand for clean hydrogen could increase from 90 Mt in 2022 to 540 Mt in a net-zero world by 2050 (refs. 2,6).

The cost of green hydrogen from renewable energy sources is expected to decrease by 2050 because of economy of scale and technology efficiencies. The cost and carbon footprint of natural hydrogen will be dependant on the production quality of the gas reservoir and hydrogen purity. The value of co-produced gases such as helium, found in some types of natural hydrogen system, are not included in these estimates1,4,5. The cost and carbon footprint of natural hydrogen would make it a highly competitive source of hydrogen. CCS, carbon capture and storage.

In addition to industrial production, a substantial mass of hydrogen is generated naturally in the Earth's crust through chemical and radioactive processes7 (Box 1). Chemical processes include oxidation of iron-bearing minerals via water–rock reactions in ultramafic rocks, and radioactive processes include radiolysis of water via the radioactive elements U, Th and K that are found in all rocks, and at higher concentrations in granites and some sediments. The Precambrian continental crust hydrogen generation rate alone is between 0.36 and 2.27 × 1011 moles H2 yr−1 (ref. 7). Over the past billion years, this production is enough to supply the energy equivalent to 170,000 years of present-day societal oil use. However, most of this hydrogen would have been consumed in the subsurface or escaped to the atmosphere. Establishing how much hydrogen has been preserved in the crust and is accessible for economic exploitation remains highly uncertain8.

Although the occurrence of natural hydrogen has been reported globally through the last half of the twentieth century7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, the measurement of natural gases in different environments for hydrogen has not been routine. Nevertheless, miners throughout history have encountered explosive gas (now known to be hydrogen) in mafic and ultramafic rocks, which is the source of the eternal flames of the Chimaera ophiolite, Turkey18,19.The potential of natural hydrogen as an economic resource has been stimulated by reports of the Bourakebougou gas field in Mali in 2018, which produces hydrogen with >97% purity, although production volume data remain limited20,21. As such, natural hydrogen accumulations could be globally widespread, but the lack of consistent hydrogen sampling and measurement limits current understanding of their distribution and magnitude.

Given the minimal energy inputs required, the extraction of high-purity natural hydrogen from geological accumulations is expected to have a low-carbon footprint5, starting at ~0.4 kg CO2 kg−1 H2 and increasing with the presence of co-produced methane (for example, a gas field containing 75% H2 and 22.5% CH4 will emit 1.5 kg CO2 kg−1 H2; ref. 5). Although there are no peer-reviewed cost estimates for natural hydrogen production so far, stated values are often given as US$~0.5–1  kg−1 H2 (ref. 22), but are expected to vary depending on gas purity, flow rates, depth and the size of gas field. Therefore, if notable natural hydrogen accumulations were discovered, natural hydrogen could serve as a commercially competitive, low-carbon hydrogen source that would contribute to the energy transition.

In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of the processes that control natural hydrogen systems, including the principal natural H2 sources and their geological characteristics, the source residence time and concentrations, the mechanisms and timescales controlling primary and secondary migration, the processes of hydrogen entrapment and the preservation of hydrogen in geological structures. We focus on hydrogen generation in the continental crust and compare and contrast production from radiolytic sources with production from water–rock reactions. We do not consider subaerial volcanoes or associated active hydrothermal systems, which vent dilute H2 directly to the atmosphere. As the information on organic hydrogen sources and sinks remains nascent23,24,25,26, we focus on inorganic hydrogen in the crust. Finally, we provide an overview of the different terrane types that contain all of the key hydrogen system elements, and summarize the knowledge gaps that, if closed, might accelerate discovery of societally substantial hydrogen accumulations.

Water–rock reactions

H2 generation occurs during water–rock hydration reactions when ferrous iron Fe(II) is oxidized by the water to ferric iron Fe(III). Mafic and ultramafic common rock examples are basalt and peridotite, respectively. Hydrogen from water is incorporated into the hydrated mineral structure (for example, serpentinite minerals, see figure) and a fraction is converted to form H2. Reactions characterized by the greatest oxidation of iron and minimal hydrogen incorporation into the mineral structure are associated with the highest potential H2 yields32,33,34,36.

Radiolytic sources

Radiolytic H2 is produced when ionizing α, β and γ particles dissociate water molecules. Both oxidizing and reducing agents are generated within 10−6 s, such as e−aq, H*, HO*, HO2*, OH−, H3O+, H2O2 and H2. Rapid reaction of the oxidizing agents with dissolved species within the water phase or proximal mineral surfaces preserves the H2 produced12,13,71. Radiolytic H2 production in the subsurface increases with increased water distribution (high rock fracture and/or porosity), the concentration and siting of radioelements within the rock assemblage, and the age of the pore fluids7,64,66,73. Higher concentrations of radioelements can be found in some granites and redox-fluid-enriched sandstones and shales.

Not the mantle

The notion that the mantle could supply infinite renewable reduced gases to the continents has found popular speculation, again. Mantle-derived sources of methane and hydrogen as potential economic resources were popularized in the 1970s and 1980s199,200. The ‘Thomas Gold hypothesis' sought to explain the presence of methane and hydrogen in crystalline rocks. Current understanding refutes this hypothesis, and instead it is understood that oxygen fugacity controls the speciation of hydrogen and carbon in the mantle, with hydrogen being stable as water at pressures and temperatures shallower than ca. 90 km depth86,104. Many of the previously proposed sites of ‘mantle-derived' gases have also since been demonstrated to have no resolvable mantle input, which adds further evidence against the speculation of ‘perennial renewable' mantle-derived gases14,201,202.

There are abundant observations of hydrogen in crustal fluids from a variety of geological settings7,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,27,28,29,30. Various continental-scale hydrogen generation rates have been compiled7,17. The hydrogen generation rate from the Precambrian continental crust is estimated to range between 0.36 and 2.27 × 1011 moles H2 yr−1 (ref. 7). On combustion with O2, 1.0 × 1011 moles H2 generates 286 × 1011 kJ or 7.9 × 109 kWh (7.9 TWh). This energy production is equivalent to that produced by 6.8 × 105 tonnes of oil, or 0.017% of the crude oil produced globally in 2022 (ref. 31). Even before taking into consideration the proportion of natural hydrogen generation that might be recoverable8, the estimated 0.017% value indicates that natural regeneration of hydrogen on an anthropogenic timescale is unlikely to be substantial . However, over the last 1 billion years, the Precambrian continental crust alone could have generated hydrogen from water–rock and radiolysis reactions with the equivalent energy of 170,000 years of 2022 societal oil use. Although most of this hydrogen is not recoverable, the continental settings and the key processes that enable accumulation and preservation of a portion of this inorganic hydrogen are discussed.

Rocks containing Fe-rich olivine (fayalite) and orthopyroxene such as peridotite are favourable for H2 generation and associated with formation of magnetite32,33. However, the iron content alone does not control the H2 yield and the distribution of Fe(II) and Fe(III) across different mineral phases has an important role34. Formation of secondary minerals such as andradite garnet, cronstedtite and haematite enhance H2 yields34,35,36. By contrast, in clinopyroxene-rich ultramafics (pyroxinites), more iron is stabilized in reaction products such as Fe(II)-serpentine, brucite and chlorite, instead of promoting the formation of magnetite and H232,37. H2 yields predicted by thermodynamic models typically increase with temperature and peak at 300 °C, after which they decrease32,33,34,37 (Fig. 2). The influence of temperature on H2 yields from mafic rocks remains underexplored, as well as the influence of specific mineralogies and sediment types36,38,39,40. Although mafic rocks are rich in iron, modelled H2 yields are 10–100 times lower than that of peridotite, owing to the partitioning of iron into chlorite rather than magnetite34,41,42.

a, Estimates of peak hydrogen generation in ultramafic rocks at ca 300 °C at different pressures and constant water to rock ratios (w:r) = 1, based on results from experiments and thermodynamical models (data from refs. 32,33,34,36). Note that ref. 36, which uses an expanded thermodynamic database and more complex reactant mineralogy, predicts higher yields at low temperatures. Generated hydrogen is not sensitive to pressure. b, Hydrogen generation could be substantially greater at lower water to rock ratios (w:r) appropriate for crustal systems (w:r ~0.01) and over a range of temperatures (data from ref. 32). Similar observations are also reported in ref. 34. The agreement across different laboratories and approaches indicates that hydrogen generation at high temperatures and high water:rock ratios are well constrained for ultramafic rocks, but more data is required for lower temperatures, low water:rock ratios and other rock systems.

Estimates of H2 yields follow the assumption that iron oxidation and consequent H2 generation is accurately represented as a thermodynamic equilibrium. Laboratory and natural sample observations indicate that serpentinization processes are more complex, incorporating multiple reaction steps and kinetic factors40,43. Low-temperature oxidation of Fe(II)-containing minerals to Fe(III) minerals (such as ferrihydrite, goethite, lepidocrocite and haematite) also generates H235,40,44,45,46,47. Although quantifying these secondary reactions poses a substantial challenge, it implies that rocks with a more mafic composition, particularly in low-temperature settings9,35,40, could have a substantially greater capacity for H2 generation than previously recognized. Low-temperature oxidation reactions with minerals bearing a proportion of Fe(II) extends the potential for calculating hydrogen generation from mafic systems to sedimentary iron-rich formations. Banded iron formations preserve evidence for mineral oxidation from ferrous silicate to ferric iron oxi-hydroxides and from ferrous and ferric oxides (magnetite) to exclusively ferric oxides (maghemite, haematite and goethite), although reaction kinetics and efficiency of H2 generation remain to be determined48,49.

Identification of the controls on rates of reaction have similarly been focused so far on oceanic lithosphere settings such as mid-ocean ridges, passive margins or subduction zones43,50,51. In these settings, processes operating within open fracture systems promote grain boundary reactions propagated by the auto-fracturing caused by hydrated mineral volume change52,53,54,55.

Reducing conditions in fluids enhance H2 generation. As redox potential is often related to the water:rock (w:r) ratio, as the proportion of rock increases, the system transitions from an oxidant-abundant to oxidant-limited state34. Dissolved H2 concentrations increase exponentially with decreasing w:r ratios32,34 (Fig. 3), and are enhanced by strongly alkaline conditions56. Yet the commonly used thermodynamic databases are incomplete for fluid compositions associated with low w:r ratios57. Importantly, another knowledge gap exists because the lowest modelled w:r ratios in the literature are equivalent to 37% bulk porosity32,34. In the continental basement settings, crystalline rock porosity is ~1% (refs. 58,59). H2 reaction yields in the continental crust could be substantially higher (Fig. 2), despite lower reactions rates. Higher H2 reaction yields could counterbalance, to some extent, the observation that increased salinity can reduce hydrogen yield and rate51,60,61, and that less water volume is available for reaction.

a, The idealized crystalline basement water fracture and/or porosity as a function of depth is given by Φ  = 1.6e(−z/4.8) where Φ is porosity as a unit fraction and z is the depth from surface in metres58. b, The calculated hydrogen generation depth profile for a rock column of 1 km2 surface area and 15 km depth from water radiolysis (blue line) and water–rock reactions (yellow line) using the porosity profile from panel a. Radiolytic hydrogen production over 500 Ma is calculated following the method in refs. 12,13, using the average crustal concentrations of radioelements62, rock density of 2.7 g cm−3 and is produced in proportion to the water available in the pore space. Calculating hydrogen produced from water–rock reactions assumes a geothermal gradient of 25 °C km−1, and temperature-dependent H2 yields at water:rock (w:r) ratios of 0.2 for a harzburgite rock composition32. The w:r generated assumes total reaction of the one pore fluid water column (panel a) and reflects a combination of water availability and temperature-controlled generation efficiency. The water–rock reaction hydrogen volume does not take into account either when the hydrogen is generated or the potential for subsequent water recharge. Hydrogen generation rates for lower w:r ratios (for example, appropriate for basement rocks) are probably greater per unit volume of water than for higher w:r ratios (for example, that might correspond to mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems), but production will be capped by the total consumption of water by the rock.

With this complexity, it is clear that accurate hydrogen generation rate and yield predictions require additional thermodynamic data to encompass a wider range of mineralogy and the low temperature, low porosity of continental settings. An approximation can, nonetheless, be estimated by calculating the hydrogen reaction yield at different depths in the crystalline basement for ultramafic rocks assuming water availability for reaction is controlled by the porosity (Fig. 3). Such calculations provide a reference using a fixed water–rock system with rock remaining unreacted. The addition of more water would increase hydrogen generation, illustrating how the reference system provides a conservative starting point for applying mineralogical and environment scaling to determine terrane hydrogen generation potential.

The primary sources of ionizing radioactivity (alpha (α), beta (β) and gamma (γ) radiation) in the subsurface are from the decay chains of uranium (238U and 235U), thorium (232Th) and potassium (40K). Radioelements are ubiquitous in the upper crust62, with higher concentrations in igneous and felsic metamorphic rocks and sedimentary systems where trace elements can be concentrated by secondary fluid migration and precipitation63,64. Radiolysis is a substantial source of H2 in Precambrian terranes7,12,13, U-enriched terranes65, deep-sea sediments38,66,67 and fractured basalts68.

Alpha particles are highly ionizing but can only penetrate up to 40 µm in fluids and minerals. Beta and gamma particles have relatively lower energy but longer travel distances69. The siting of target water molecules relative to the radioelements is therefore important for understanding radiolytic yields. Smaller grains or minerals70, and narrow fractures68 where water is in close proximity to the radioelements are more favourable for higher H2 yields71. Radiolysis can also generate H2 through the release of hydrogen atoms within the lattice of hydrated minerals72. Overall, higher bulk porosity and associated water budget in the crystalline basement is favourable for higher H2 yields64,65,73. Different sediment slurries have been shown to enhance the generation of H2 by increasing the efficiency of α and γ absorption, whereas minerals such as clays, silicates, sulfides and zeolites can efficiently react with and remove oxidizing products of the radiolysis, such as H2O2, which would otherwise react with the stabilized H238,74. The impact of fluid composition, the distribution of water and radioactive elements on micro to macro scales, as well as the role of various minerals in influencing travel distances of radioactive particles are research gaps limiting more accurate H2 generation estimates in different geological environments.

As α-particles stabilize to form 4He, there is a proportional relationship between 4He and radiolytic hydrogen generation and the pore-space environment7,65,73 (Fig. 3). Predicted radiolytic 4He:H2 ratios are observed in H2-rich gases when the full mass balance between 4He, H2 and CH4 is considered, assuming the methane to be derived from radiolytic hydrogen. Examples include deep mines across the Fennoscandian Shield, Canadian Shield and South Africa7,73, and a South African gas field where stable isotope evidence is used to show that the CH4 is derived from radiolytic hydrogen that has been taken up by methanogens65. The latter has an estimated reserve of 40–299 BCF (CH4) and a best-estimate prospective resource of 1,278 BCF (CH4)75. This system illustrates the potential for substantial H2 generation and accumulation by radiolysis alone65, but also the risk of H2 chemical reactivity and bioavailability.

The radiolytic hydrogen produced in the continental crust containing average U + Th + K concentrations with porosity decreasing as a function of depth over a 500 Ma period is compared with generation by water–rock reactions in rock with a similar porosity profile (Fig. 3). Doing so illustrates the importance of the time-integrated porosity distribution for radiolytic hydrogen generation with depth. Similar to the water–rock calculation, this approach provides a starting point for scaling and determining terrane hydrogen generation potential with appropriate U + Th + K and porosity history.

Mantle-derived 3He is a powerful tracer of, and proxy for, mantle-derived volatiles in crustal fluids76,77,78. In all the crystalline sites globally for which large concentrations of hydrogen have been reported, including the Canadian Shield, the Fennoscandian Shield, the gold mines of South Africa and Yilgarn craton Australia, noble gas investigations have ruled out any substantial mantle-derived H2 contributions7,10,79,80,81,82,83,84.

Hydrogen speciation within Earth's mantle is well understood. Oxygen fugacity is strongly controlled by pressure. At pressures <3 GPa (90 km depth in the mantle) the oxygen fugacity of the mantle results in molecular H2O and carbon dioxide dominating the major volcanic gases85,86. Concentration estimates in the upper mantle range from 250 to 800 ppm H2O, with the variance representing subduction recycling heterogeneity87,88,89,90,91. The deeper mantle (>200 km depth) has an equivalent H2O concentration range of 250–1,100 ppm (ref. 92), but because of the higher pressure and resulting lower oxygen fugacity, both molecular hydrogen and CH4 form the primary H species86,93,94,95. There is no evidence that these species are preserved on ascent to the near surface in ocean islands or mantle-plume volcanism.

Continental volcanic gas emissions reflect the same oxidation state as mid-ocean ridges across compositionally diverse eruptive styles (for example, carbonatites96). Continental gas compositions are independent of mantle origin (for example, mantle plumes, back arc volcanism or rifting), but can be overprinted by subduction related volatiles either directly or from accumulation in the deeper lithosphere97,98. The continental mantle-3He flux is well established and has a median value of 270 mol 3He yr−1. With a mantle 3He/H molar ratio of 1.14 × 10−10, mantle-3He will be accompanied by 2.4 × 1012 mol mantle H yr−1 (2.4 × 106 tonne H yr−1)78,97,99,100,101,102,103.

Although the absence of 3He can rule out a mantle hydrogen contribution, the presence of 3He does not provide information about the oxidation state of any associated hydrogen. Substantive H2 from the mantle is highly unlikely. The mantle hydrogen is delivered to the continental crust in its oxidized form as mineral hydroxyl or water, not molecular hydrogen. It is incumbent on any economic claims that include substantial mantle hydrogen as a source (Box 1) to provide quantitative observational evidence to support such speculation8,104.

Water within rock pore spaces or fractures provides both the source of the molecular hydrogen and defines limits on the timing and amount of hydrogen that can be generated by water–rock and radiolytic reactions in crystalline rock. Rates of water–rock reactions can be varied, with both kinetics and the availability of water providing rate-limiting steps, and the latter is determined by the existing water-filled porosity and the recharge rate. Timescales range from thousands to millions of years for water–rock reactions in highly fractured rocks, but can extend to tens to hundreds of millions of years for water-limited water–rock reactions. The radiolytic source of hydrogen is determined by the time-integrated water-filled porosity, local U + Th + K concentrations and time. The timescales for substantive radiolytic hydrogen generation is tens to hundreds of millions of years, and similar to water-limited water–rock reactions. In this section, the distribution of water in the continental crust, the timescales of hydrogen production by different production mechanisms, and the conditions that might result in H2 release and gas-phase accumulation in accessible geological traps are discussed.

The mass and distribution of liquid water in the crystalline continental crust below 2 km depth represents a large (30–45%) but under-investigated component of the global hydrosphere83,105,106,107,108,109. The Precambrian basement, about 72% of the continental crust by area, contains >8.5 million km3 liquid water83. This volume is ca. 40% of the water occupying the pore space and fracture porosity of the crust83,107.

The are few assessments of crystalline crust-fracture porosity59,74,80,83,110,111,112,113,114,115. An exponential expression originally derived for sedimentary basins of decreasing porosity with depth (Φ = 1.6e(−z/4.8) ref. 58), is consistent with the limited crystalline crust fracture-porosity. The porosity relationship provides a pragmatic reference for extrapolation to depths of 10–15 km, where the transition from brittle to ductile behaviour occurs. Application of the porosity relationship with depth to hydrogen generation for any specific terrane will encompass large variance owing to local rock properties and burial history64,105.

Porosity is assumed to be water filled and hence representative of the static mass of liquid water within a volume of rock at a point in time105. The permeability of the crystalline crust is a measure of the ability of water to flux and recharge through that volume. Like porosity, observation-based permeability estimates are few in deep-crystalline rocks116,117,118,119. One assessment was made by considering the water residence ages derived from radiogenic noble gas accumulations in fracture fluids59. Others have used the fluid flux required to replicate observed temperature distributions in hydrothermal systems116 or the time-integrated fluid flux required to precipitate observed mineralization117,118,119.

Although permeability estimates have been fitted, like porosity, to an exponential decrease with depth, the noble gas residence data between 1 and 3 km do not differentiate between an exponential decrease versus a constant value over this depth range59. At 2 km depth, the permeability range of the various studies covers nearly five orders of magnitude, from log permeability of −15 to −20 m2 (refs. 59,116,118,119). The range, in part, reflects the representative elemental volumes considered and techniques employed, as well as natural variance in different crystalline terrane105.

This permeability range also illustrates the complexity of the relationship between hydrogen resource accumulation and porosity permeability. Hydrogen generation potential increases with increased water-filled porosity of the source rock due to increased surfaces and water volumes available for reaction, whether water–rock or radiolytic (Fig. 2). In the case of water–rock reactions if the static porosity is low, a high permeability is required to replenish the reactive water supply. In contrast, low permeability is required to trap and build up the hydrogen generated. End-member examples are seen in surface-exposed ophiolites, which have relatively high permeability and water supply, but newer hydrogen is lost to the surface due to high hydrogen flux82. These contrast with deep fracture fluids in low-permeability systems, which have been isolated from the hydrogeological system, sometimes on Ma to Ga timescales79. The latter provides an environment in which to build up hydrogen from both water–rock and radiolysis, but in which heterogeneous and disconnected fracture porosity is not ideal for resource accumulation64,73. The porosity–permeability evolution is therefore key to both the timescale of the hydrogen generation and the ability of the source rock to retain the gas59,83,84,107,120. In the case of ophiolites, low-permeability trapping might occur internally or from trap configurations in overlying sedimentary rocks16. Hydrogen generated in crystalline basement systems requires transport and accumulation of the gas to reservoirs, such as overlying sedimentary basin formations121,122,123.

A sweet spot can be envisaged, different for each system. Too open (like many surface-exposed ophiolites), and there is too much potential for hydrogen loss both from transport and mixing, but also loss to microbial communities themselves stimulated by younger water ingress (for example, the Beatrix mine, South Africa124). Too ‘tight' (for example, Kidd Creek, Canada79) and there might be substantial hydrogen, but the extremely low permeability will make detection and exploitation difficult. The facility and ability of a system to accumulate hydrogen must be met29.

The accumulation of radiogenic and inert noble gases such as 4He, 21Ne, 40Ar, 86Kr and 136Xe from U, Th and K decay can be used to determine the mean residence age of fluids. An assumption of efficient transfer of the radiogenic noble gases from the mineral lattice into the fluid space is usually made. Coherent radiogenic isotopic compositional variance from predicted generation ratios can identify whether there has been substantial diffusive gas loss or advection73,78,79,80,84,113,114,125,126,127,128,129. Although results are sensitive to mineral release efficiency, the German Deep Drilling Project found that between 81% and 96% of helium generated in the 384 Ma since rock formation had been released from the minerals down to 7 km depth130.

The Kidd Creek Observatory, Canadian Shield, provides an example of isolation, with hydrogen-rich fracture fluids sampled to 2.9 km below the surface showing mean residence ages on a 1–2 Ga timescale79,83. Fracture fluids from two mines in the Sudbury Impact Crater, Canadian Shield, sampled at 1.4 and 1.7 km below the surface, have mean residence ages of 0.5 Ga and 0.3 Ga, respectively, possibly reflecting regional fracturing of the system caused by the meteorite impact at 1.8 Ga and deeper penetration of younger fluids into the crust83,84. Neither Kidd Creek nor Sudbury samples show evidence of substantial diffusive gas loss or gain, the corollary being that any hydrogen generated in the rock in that time has remained proximal to its source.

The Witwatersrand Basin, South Africa, was also perturbed by a large impact event, at 2.02 Ga. Fluids down to 3 km depth, many hydrogen rich, show variance in age. Some fracture fluids are interpreted as water that recharged from the surface up to 100 Ma years ago113,114,126. The less saline waters show δ18O and δ2H on or near to the global mean water line, consistent with variable mixing of palaeometeoric waters but with little evidence for substantial diffusive loss or gain131. Fluids from the Moab Khotsong gold and uranium mine record heavy noble gas (Kr and Xe) mean residence ages of up to 1.2 Ga, but with extensive (ca. 80%) diffusive loss of the light noble gases and hydrogen84. The Witwatersrand Moab Khotsong fluids show that Ga-age crystalline basement fluids are not only found in the Canadian Precambrian Shield, but are probably global in occurrence.

Fluids recovered from the 2.5 km Outokumpu deep borehole from the Precambrian Fennoscandian Shield in Finland record fluid residence ages from 20–50 Ma (ref. 80). These match well a regional estimate of 40 Ma fluid residence-age derived from fitting a diffusion profile to 4He water concentrations in 34 boreholes with samples recovered between 200 and 1,000 m depth more regionally, and 100% 4He mineral release assumed132.

The fluids supplying major hydrogen seeps from surface-exposed ophiolites are relatively modern, consistent with their shallow hydrogeological setting (for example, Chimera, Turkey18; Samail, Oman82; Tablelands, Canada; and Cedars and Aqua de Ney, USA133). 4He groundwater ages available from the Samail ophiolite, Oman, place the oldest fluids in the 20–220 Ka range134. Evidence for hydrogen accumulation has also been developed for the Bulqizë ophiolite, Albania16, but no observations yet exist to place limits on the gas residence age.

It is tempting to rank entire shield environments in order of regional permeability and associated mean residence age of deep fluids. There are certainly events such as the Witwatersrand impact at 2.02 Ga, or Sudbury Basin impact at 1.8 Ga, which will have had a regional effect on the architecture of the regional basement rocks84. We can speculate how a terrane might develop more interconnected fracture networks and elevated permeability (for example, the Fennoscandian Shield), how fluid flow responds to regional tectonic stress-fracture and fault propagation11,59,105,120,135 or, for example, the detail of foliation-induced anisotropy and regional stress fracturing. Yet the number of case studies on only three continents remain few, and more observational constraints are needed.

Helium serves as a tool for understanding the regional release mechanisms and flux of hydrogen and other deeper crustal gases such as nitrogen123,125,136. Formed in crystalline systems through radioactive decay, helium (4He) is often co-produced with hydrogen from the same source rock region. In contrast, helium is not consumed by chemical or biological processing and provides a clear resolvable signal in near-surface crustal fluids78. With similar physical characteristics, such as solubility and diffusivity, helium provides a relevant proxy for understanding hydrogen source-rock retention, expulsion and transport efficiencies.

The theoretical steady-state crustal helium flux provides a useful reference and is predicated on the rate of release of helium to the surface being equivalent to the rate of whole-crustal radiogenic 4He generation. From average continental U and Th concentrations, the steady-state helium generation rate is 1.47 × 10−6 mol 4He m−2 yr−1 (2.81 × 1010 atoms 4He m−2 s−1)137,138. This value is indistinguishable from the observed global log-normal mean surface flux of 2.2 × 10−6 mol 4He m−2 yr−1 (4.18 × 1010 atoms 4He m−2 s−1)139 (Fig. 4). This includes 4He data from n = 271 Precambrian Shield lakes from Saskatchewan (n = 101) and Labrador (n = 170), which provide an average degassing flux across two shield environments, also indistinguishable from the steady-state reference139.

Crustal helium flux versus mantle helium flux (data from ref. 139) can be used as a proxy for understanding the processes controlling regional basement hydrogen release to the near surface. A broad trend of increasing crustal 4He flux with mantle volatile flux measured in groundwater and lake samples is associated with rifting (‘tectonic strain', shaded blue region) and associated with regional thermal perturbations. Helium flux measured from volcanic crater lakes and calderas shows additional focusing of the mantle ‘volcanic' helium flux (shaded red region), two to three orders of magnitude greater than would otherwise be predicted from groundwater and lakes in tectonic regions. Data compiled by ref. 139, with the addition of data for Taiwan101; Yellowstone147; and East Marengo Basin (EMB), California142. The dashed line is the log-normal mean continental degassing flux (4.18 × 1010 4He atoms  m−2 s–1), which lies within uncertainty of the rate at which helium is generated in the continental crust (‘steady state')139. The correlation between the average global flux and generation rate shows that continental crust loses its gas, on average, as fast as it is generated. Regions of high tectonic strain, shown by the presence of mantle helium, show degassing fluxes higher than ‘steady state', probably caused by more efficient release of crustal gases accumulated during periods of quiescence.

Globally the surface helium flux is too great to occur via diffusion alone from the deeper crust, and an advective and episodic transport mechanism is required125. This point is reflected in the high flux variance78,125,139,140,141,142. Low helium flux is observed in several stable tectonic settings, such as the Molasse Basin143,144 and the Great Lakes145. Higher fluxes are found correlated with rock deformation and seismicity146, high heat flow or volcanic caldera such as Yellowstone, crater lakes or intrusions139,147,148; and with basement faults (San Andreas Fault, California100; East Texas Basin149; Irpina Fault, Italy150; and Four Corner Region USA148,151) (Fig. 4). These systems are additional indications that the magnitude and migration pathways for hydrogen and helium produced within the crystalline continental crust, and the accumulation potential, can be predicted from the local geological context.

A key component in assessing accumulation potential is the ability of the system to generate a free gas phase. It is not usually commercially feasible to recover fully dissolved gas owing to the large volumes of water that need to be produced. For a gas phase to form, the gas concentration in the groundwater must exceed the solubility limit or ‘bubble point', in turn controlled by the groundwater temperature, pressure, salinity and mixture of gases123. Gas-phase formation can also concentrate the gas through buoyancy migration into geological trapping structures. Processes applied to hydrocarbon gas field integrity, such as reservoir porosity and the gas column height that can be sustained by the seal considering pore throat size, capillary threshold and gas buoyancy, then provide a critical assessment of resource target capacity152.

For hydrogen released from its source, the gas flux, timescale and system architecture become important in generating and preserving a gas phase. For example, in the Western Canadian Williston basin, a flux of N2 and 4He averaging steady state from the basement can generate a free gas phase in the lithology overlying the basement at ca. 150 Ma despite substantial loss (>94%) from diffusion through the sealing strata. It is evident from the models that it is the retardation of the diffusional gas flux by the whole sedimentary column that generates the observed helium-rich gas fields in this example, rather than consideration of a single sealing unit123.

To generalize, systems with high flux require the least competent sealing architecture (for example, Tanzanian East African Rift122 and Bourakebougou gas field, Mali20,21). In contrast, seals such as salt or evaporite lithologies are particularly effective for low-flux helium and hydrogen systems (for example, Paradox basin, USA153). Effective seals account for the hydrogen and helium gas field discoveries in the tectonically quiescent Amadeus Basin, Australia27,154. The identification of the trade-off between gas release rate from the basement, or flux, and the overlying quality of the sealing system enables the development of a range of exploration concepts, tailoring hydrogen generation rates and location in the crust to transport style (diffusion versus advection) and gas-phase accumulations in different geological terrane.

Hydrogen originates and accumulates throughout the Earth's continental crust in a variety of tectono-stratigraphic settings. The hydrogen system requires four conditions: hydrogen sources, accumulation within the source rocks or migration of hydrogen into a reservoir, a sealed trap, and preservation by isolation from microbial and reactive elements. There is a wide geological variety, both in time and space, of inorganic hydrogen systems (Fig. 5). Whereas the basic elements of the natural hydrogen systems have remained constant through time, the tectono-stratigraphic setting of those same systems has changed as the Earth has cooled and tectonic behaviour changed155,156,157,158. These hydrogen systems have a globally widespread distribution today (Fig. 6). In this section, the common hydrogen systems and their evolution through time are discussed in chronological order from the Archaean to the Phanerozoic (Fig. 5).

a–j, Geological terrane settings where potential commercial natural hydrogen systems could be found (letters in circles): ophiolite water–rock source (a), with migration into overlying clastic reservoirs within rift structures (b); radiogenic granites with radiolysis source (c), trapped in salt basin structures (d); flood basalt and water–rock source (e), trapped in clastic sediments near salt and inversion structures (f); radiogenic granites with radiolysis source (g), trapped within fractured granite (h); and ultramafic water–rock source (i), trapped in overlying carbonate and clastic rocks and sill traps (j). The source rock and trap pairs illustrated across different terrane form only exemplar hydrogen systems, with different permutations providing more possibilities, especially at terrane boundaries. TTG, tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite.

Hydrogen-potential terranes (described in Fig. 5) are widely distributed across all continents. The extent of sedimentary basins (yellow), including those containing evaporitic facies (pink), are shown to highlight regions that could contain potential trap structures. Examples of each terrane type with known notable hydrogen accumulations are circled in black: Oman, Ophiolite Complex; Australia, Amadeus Basin (an alkaline granite complex); USA, mid-continental rift (a large igneous province); Mali, tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) and/or greenstone belt. Distribution data are from ophiolites194, large igneous provinces195, basement terrane196, sedimentary basins197 and evaporite basins198. Most of the continents contain widespread coverage of the terrane types that might contain hydrogen systems, and have hydrogen accumulation potential. The regional details of generation, migration, trapping and preservation are required to determine whether commercial accumulations are viable within these terrane.

Archaean greenstone belts occupy large volumes of continental cratons. Frequently deformed, the ultramafic and mafic volcanic greenstone assemblages, interleaved with tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) batholiths, again deformed to varying degrees, represent two very different but connected sources of hydrogen. The extrusive ultramafic and mafic rocks of the greenstone belts are susceptible to water–rock reactions (Fig. 5i). In contrast the potassium lean, grey TTG gneisses have sufficient proportions of U and Th to generate widespread and long-lived hydrogen by radiolysis (Fig. 5g). Together, both rock assemblages have been, and continue to be, important potential sources of natural hydrogen10,80,120,159.

Trapping configurations for hydrogen formed in these tectonic environments require either an overlying sedimentary basin cover (Fig. 5j) or ‘within basement' trapping (Fig. 5g,h). The former occurs as sedimentary basins within cratons160 and, more commonly, sedimentary basins developed at cratonic margins. Upon cratons, sedimentary basins tend to be either a shallow cover or the reflection of deep-basin formation within a craton that can be considered a craton margin121,123,136.

Most craton margins are defined by sedimentary basins or deformed metasedimentary basins younger than the underlying craton. Where these margins are transitional, rather than abrupt edges, there is extensive scope for clastic and carbonate reservoirs and seal combinations (Fig. 5d,f). This scope is demonstrated in the Mali Bourakebougou hydrogen field on the West African craton20,152. In this case the preservation of a hydrogen charge or presence of an active charge are the key risk factors. In contrast to shallow systems, the potential for generating and trapping hydrogen within the greenstones or fractured TTG batholiths depends on the local porosity–permeability evolution. To extend the identification of hydrogen-rich fracture fluids in mining locations to explore for targets distal to those locations in the basement rocks represents one of the major technology challenges of hydrogen exploration in these settings.

Large igneous provinces (LIPs) are large volumes (~106 km3) of dominantly mafic igneous rocks that occur periodically in the continental crust from the Mesoproterozoic onwards (Fig. 5). They were initially regarded solely as extrusive, continental flood basalts and intrusive gabbros161,162, but increasingly a silicic aspect has been recognized163. Such large volumes of mafic rock are a potential source of water–rock hydration and the creation of large volumes of hydrogen (Fig. 2a). Their origin is driven by sublithospheric processes such as mantle plumes and time-equivalent rifting164,165.

The interest in LIPs for hydrogen exploration is largely with continental flood basalts that offer a very large source of hydrogen (Fig. 5e) beneath overlying sedimentary rock formations that could act as reservoir, seal and trap (Fig. 5f). The pace and intensity of the water–rock reaction is controlled by the temperature and the rock surface area accessible to the water. It is feasible that fine-grained, low-permeability, sedimentary layers within the basaltic flows could also act as seals, but their exploration would be technologically challenging from both an imaging and drill testing perspective. The United States mid-continental rift with extensive basalt infill formed at 1.1 Ga has received much attention with three wells (called Scot#1, Heins#1 and Sue Duroche#2) showing high hydrogen, but with limited flow, on the proximal (65 km) Nemeha High structure166,167,168,169,170,171.

These are a widespread feature of the continental crust that have developed since the palaeo-Proterozoic and reflect a process of hydrogen generation purely from crustal-derived radiogenic granites12,13,172. The connection between the radioactive decay of K, U and Th and the presence of water results in the radiolysis of water (Box 1). Of the many complexities arising from this process, the controls on the molecular generation of H2 is reasonably well understood.

The hydrogen produced by this process is substantial owing to the great time frame in which it has been active. Its residence time within fractured granites has proven to be large. The exploration challenge then is understanding the migration, trapping and preservation of such long-accumulated volumes of H2. The trapping could occur in sealed zones of fractured granites (Fig. 5c) or in overlying sedimentary basins (Fig. 5d) (for example, Mt Kitty hydrogen discovery well, Amadeus Basin, Australia27,173).

Ophiolites are a tectonic signature of collisional and convergent plate tectonics174 (Figs. 5 and 6). They comprise large slices of mafic and ultramafic rock suites originally of marine origin, emplaced upon, beneath and within continental crust (Fig. 5a). The subsequent hydration of olivine and pyroxene rich ultramafic and mafic rocks is well described as serpentinization, releasing large volumes of hydrogen (Box 1). The large volumes of associated mafic rock occurring as gabbro, dolerite dykes and basalts experience similar hydration and are also a source of hydrogen.

Large ophiolite complexes, mostly preserved from the last 500 Ma of Earth's history, are distributed along continental and palaeo-continental margins such as the Tethyan-collisional belt and its eastwards extension into the Himalayas and the active margins of the Pacific Ocean. Exploration for the H2 generated from these belts requires extensive hydration and the association of a reservoir and trapping configuration. Ophiolites exposed at the surface are not obviously prospective, as fracturing typically creates somewhat more ‘open' systems11,84,105. However, others are covered by sedimentary rocks or trap hydrogen internally to make these ophiolites a potentially relevant commercial source of hydrogen16 (Fig. 5b).

Preservation of a hydrogen reservoir falls into three categories: physical preservation of the gas within the trap, including trap competence over time; chemical sinks or dilution; and biological consumption. Although hydrogen is more mobile relative than, for example, methane, hydrogen diffusion, solubility and other physiochemical characteristics provide for well-constrained gas behaviour. Within traps in sedimentary rocks there is a trade-off between seal quality, flux, and gas residence or preservation. For higher hydrogen fluxes, approaches familiar to the hydrocarbon industry are appropriate to determine reservoir and seal competence in geologically contemporary (up to tens of million years ago) accumulations152.

Helium provides an analogue to assess hydrogen residence and trapping efficiency in higher-permeability sedimentary traps in low-flux settings. In these environments, diffusional loss, dissolution into the groundwater and risk of lateral flushing must be considered when gas-phase development can take tens to hundreds of million years ago123,136,153. Hydrogen residence within some source-rock trapping environments is possible on Ga timescales79,83,84. Within systems that have faster generation rates and rely on traps in sedimentary rocks, analogy with hydrocarbon trapping is useful where the risk of reservoir and trap failure from regional changes (for example, faulting, uplift, flushing and pore-space loss) increases with time. In these cases, as with petroleum systems, the newer the accumulation, the more likely hydrogen will be preserved175.

Reactive gases such as hydrogen are impacted by chemical and biological sinks in the source rocks and reservoirs, as well as the near surface159,176,177. Investigations into the nature of methane and hydrogen in crystalline basement settings have demonstrated that increasing microbiological activity in the subsurface creates a major increase in the ratio of biotic–abiotic methane, and a correlated decrease in the hydrogen accumulations that reflects the loss of hydrogen to subsurface metabolic activity11,124,176,178. These shifts are typically correlated with deeper penetration of younger groundwaters such as more hydrogeologically open systems11,74,105,131,179. Subsurface microbial communities, such as those which reduce sulfate and methanogens, consume hydrogen, ultimately converting it back to water or methane180,181,182.

The rates of such metabolic activity at depth remain a subject of active investigation, but are typically thought to be substantially lower than in the near-surface biosphere183,184,185. Where microbial activity is not limited, degradation of gas within a reservoir can be on a decadal timescale186,187. In the case of the Welkom, Virginia gas field, South Africa, microbial processing probably accounts for the loss of hydrogen to methane in the shallow (<1 km) methane, helium and nitrogen dominated system65. Yet at only slightly greater depths, there are many proximal mines that report both high fluid residence (up to 168 Ma) and substantial hydrogen in fracture fluids84,113,114,126. Neither depth nor age are the main controls, but rather the degree of penetration of younger palaeometeoric fluids114,179 or, conversely, isolation of much older groundwaters in more hydrogeologically closed systems11,84,105.

Abiotic reactions are also important. Hydrogen that is exposed to subsurface unsaturated hydrocarbons will be lost to those systems188, accounting for the limited co-occurrence of hydrogen with long-chain hydrocarbons. Pyrite in the presence of H2 can be reduced to pyrrhotite at temperatures >90 °C, whereas sulfate can be reduced to H2S by thermochemical sulfate reduction189,190. It has been suggested that H2 might only be preserved on geological timescales within a narrow temperature window ranging from 100 to 200 °C where abiotic reactions remain kinetically limited, but above that favoured by microbes191. Evidence from ancient hydrogen-bearing mine fluids at lower temperatures, however, point to a wider but admittedly still poorly defined preservation window73,79,84,105.

Overall, within any hydrogen system tens of million years old, reservoir competency factors already familiar to the hydrocarbon industry enable a physical preservation and volumetric assessment. Hydrogen loss through diffusion-controlled processes and the dissolution of the gas phase into the groundwater remain the key preservation risks in older (tens to hundreds of million years old) hydrogen systems. Microbial consumption intersects with dissolution risk, with biological hydrogen loss enhanced by surface-water contact. Although preservation of hydrogen from inorganic reactions favours lower temperatures, the mineralogy of target systems can be used to mitigate this risk. Together, these can be used in developing a coherent exploration strategy for accumulation preservation.

The two dominant processes creating natural hydrogen gas in the continental crust are water–rock reactions with iron-bearing minerals, and radiolysis of water from the natural decay of uranium, thorium and potassium7. The Precambrian crust alone has generated hydrogen volumes over the last billion years equivalent to approximately 170,000 years of present-day societal oil use. However, defining how much natural hydrogen has been preserved and is accessible remains highly uncertain8. For example, gas-phase formation and accumulation with preservation from dissolution (redissolving), diffusional, microbial or chemical loss remain key risk factors. The Earth's mantle does not contribute substantial H2 mass to the tectonically quiescent continental crust. Continental systems do not provide a regenerating hydrogen system on anthropogenic timescales — therefore, natural hydrogen should not be considered as a renewable resource. The production of natural hydrogen from geological accumulations will have a low-carbon footprint5, but notable knowledge gaps need to be closed to accelerate the discovery of societally important natural hydrogen accumulations.

With this Review, we provide the foundations of a geological framework for natural hydrogen exploration, with a particular focus on continental systems. Natural hydrogen generation and trapping requires a source rock, water and a trap with integrity to retain the hydrogen. Indeed, a stable tectonic context could be the best environment suited to the formation of material radiolytic or slowly generated hydrogen because of the long-geological timescales required to accumulate hydrogen in these settings. We conclude that although large accumulations of hydrogen are feasible, it is likely that very high concentrations of hydrogen (such as that found in Mali) will be exceptional. Gas concentrations should not nevertheless be conflated with the quantity of natural hydrogen. Mixed resources involving helium, nitrogen and other gases could contain substantive hydrogen. A better understanding of the timing of water–rock reactions and hydrogen preservation will be key to finding economically extractable volumes of hydrogen.

For exploration to be successful, predicting the amount and timing of hydrogen generated will be critical. Calculating the generative capacity of potential hydrogen source rocks from radiolytic sources is reasonably well developed, with field examples matching theory, and scaling a function of radio-element enrichment, porosity and age12,13,38,65,83. The hydrogen generated by water–rock reactions is subject to more uncertainty, but with enough information to provide basic information for exploration. Critical uncertainties for hydrogen produced by water–rock reactions include identification of how much water has been exposed to a lithology, how much rock has reacted, the mineralogy of the rock and the timing of hydrogen generation. The latter is controlled by both water availability and kinetics. Estimating the water–rock hydrogen potential of different terrane is currently limited by a lack of suitable thermodynamic data to calculate accurate volumes of hydrogen generated for low water–rock ratios and low temperatures relevant to the crystalline continental crust, in addition to data for only a limited range of lithologies beyond ultramafic mineral assemblage9,36,82. Notably, this absence is because much previous work has focused on mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems with high water–rock ratios and fast reaction kinetics. New investigations focusing on low water:rock ratio systems and rock types representative across different crustal-source rock types are now needed. These investigations will include cross-calibration of field and laboratory observations with thermodynamic and reaction-kinetic modelling across relevant continental systems. Scaling the laboratory and modelling results to field application will probably present the greatest technical challenges.

Play- or system-level predictions of terrane porosity and permeability, tectonic controls on source timescales, and fault, lithology or lateral controls on migration pathways are also essential for determining exploration potential. For example, hydrogen-rich fluid residence times within some source rocks can be on the order of 100 million-year to billion-year timescales. By contrast, regional deep gas fluxes derived from helium analyses show crust release rates in many regions where the continental crust is releasing gases to the near surface at the same rate they are being generated (‘steady state'). In other regions, tectonic activity releases a pulse of deep continental gas over tens of million years ago, that has accumulated in the deeper crust over hundreds of millions of years.

Geophysical detection of the magnitude and location of rock hydration through density contrast, resistivity channels or magnetic change caused by magnetite mineral formation will be important for system-level understanding191,192,193. The trapping efficiency of hydrogen in relatively high flux environments conforms to well-understood gas behaviour in porous media. Quantifying hydrogen accumulations and retainment in geological trap structures filled over longer timescales (10s to >100 Myr) requires development of appropriate models that consider the impact the entire lithological column has on diffusive gradients and multigas systems rather than single-seal trapping efficiency123,136. Recognition of the temporal elements that can operate on timescales much longer than typical hydrocarbon systems requires a cultural change in exploration approaches. We need to better take into account the role of basement deep-water history and transport controls to the near surface, diffusion, gas phase formation and groundwater flow in key hydrogen play types.

Substantial work remains to better understand the risk of both abiotic and microbiological hydrogen sinks. Assessing abiotic risk will probably form part of the same field, laboratory and modelling efforts discussed above, with focus on continental water:rock ratios and mineralogy. By contrast, assessing microbial risk, while clearly identifying low temperatures and contact with shallow groundwater, has more work to do when considering, for example, nutrient limits and how this may map onto accumulation targets in different terrane. Fusing geological data to understand and forecast the geochemical and geomicrobiological variables discussed here is the route to understanding the exploration risk and to rank different exploration opportunities. This data fusion will help to quantify and predict the discovery of economic, natural hydrogen accumulations. That predictability will be proportional to the technology and, in particular, the quality of geology, geophysics and geochemistry applied to the search, and the economic and regulatory environment that defines hydrogen exploration landscapes.

General Motors is bringing in potentially groundbreaking new battery tech that not only has 30 percent more energy density at the existing production cost for cells but also would circumvent China's stranglehold on intellectual property for EV batteries. The company even claims this new type of battery pack could lower the cost of its electric SUVs so they're comparable to their gasoline counterparts.

The news came today as GM has announced it will use lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery cells in its largest electric vehicles, the full-size trucks and SUVs sold by Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac. They are to be produced by Ultium Cells, its joint-venture battery company with LG Energy Solutions. The first such cells will come from a pilot line in 2027, with full volume production in 2028 at a plant it hasn't disclosed.

The new cells are in the prismatic format, versus Ultium's current pouch cells, which use a nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum chemistry. Those cells, in large standardized modules, power GM's entire current EV lineup, from the compact Chevrolet Equinox EV up to the GMC Hummer EV.

The new prismatic cells appear even larger than Ultium's pouch cells, though GM did not provide dimensions. They will be housed in modules that, overall, have 50 percent fewer parts than their predecessors. That may prevent delays like those that delayed volume production of its Ultium modules by 12 to 18 months, pushing deliveries of several models from late 2022 to early 2024.

A full-size prototype GM LMR battery cell. GM has apparently prototyped 300 full-size LMR cells to crack the code on the new chemistry that offers up a third more energy density at no extra production cost.

Crucially, GM claims its Ultium battery engineers have created a chemistry that provides one-third greater energy density than comparable lithium iron-phosphate (LFP)—at a comparable cell cost. China owns virtually all the intellectual property around LFP chemistry, which costs less in materials than NMCA because it uses none of those metals. The trade-off for lower cost is lower energy density by volume.

The earliest NMC cells used roughly equal thirds of nickel, manganese, and cobalt. GM's current “high-nickel” Ultium cells swapped out much of that cobalt for nickel while adding aluminum. They use roughly 5 percent cobalt and 10 percent manganese, said GM battery engineer Andy Oury, with the rest being nickel and aluminum.

The LMR cells, however, substitute manganese—which is cheaper and more globally plentiful—for some of the pricier nickel and virtually all of the cobalt. They are, Oury said, 60 to 70 percent manganese, 30 to 40 percent nickel, and only up to 2 percent cobalt.

The new chemistry, in a second type of cell, will also use a new module format. Standardized Ultium NMCA modules for every vehicle were the right solution for GM to launch its current lineup of 12 different EV models, its execs said. Going forward, the company envisions using different chemistries for different purposes: NMCA for high-performance and its most capable models, now LMR for long range at lower cost, and LFP for its least expensive models.

If LMR chemistry actually produces a cell that costs as little to make as LFP with greater energy density, that could be a game changer—including for North American competitiveness against China in the critical sphere of battery development and production.

“LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions to expand customer choice in the truck and full-size SUV markets,” said Kurt Kelty, GM's vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability. It will, he said, “advance American battery innovation and create jobs well into the future.”

A battery technician at the General Motors Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren, Michigan, takes a chemistry slurry sample.

Specifically, LMR packs will lower the cost of some full-size EV truck and SUV models to bring their prices closer to those of their gasoline counterparts. That's crucial to boosting sales of the full-size EV models, which have not reached the same volumes and market penetrations as those of GM's compact and midsize EV crossovers.

GM has said little about its plans for cells using the third chemistry, lithium-iron phosphate. However, the upcoming 2026 Chevrolet Bolt EV—a reboot of the compact hatchback that was its first and only battery-electric model from 2017 through 2022—has long been expected to use LFP cells to keep its price close to the $30,000 level of earlier models. Expect more details within weeks or months.

Hiring Kelty was a coup for GM, given his previous 11-year tenure as Tesla's battery czar—and 15 years before that with Japanese cell maker Panasonic. He told WIRED he arrived at GM with “some preconceptions” about what directions the company should take for its cells going forward. He was, he said, initially resistant to the idea of using LMR cell chemistry, but GM's battery engineers had worked on developing the chemistry since 2015—and persisted in their advocacy.

LMR's clear advantages, Kelty said, ultimately brought him around. Its cell partner LG Energy Solutions brought its own portfolio of more than 200 LMR patents dating back to 2010 to the table, and this week's announcement is the result.

LMR is not yet an industry-standard term for the battery chemistry; following the formats of the other two, it should really be LMN, for lithium-manganese-nickel. Regardless of name, GM hopes to be the first to bring it to market in volume. Ford used the same term and beat GM to the punch on the PR front when Charles Poon, its global director of electrified propulsion engineering, published a LinkedIn post in late April.

That post said Ford had developed “a game-changing battery chemistry that will lead to enhanced safety, lower cost, and industry-leading energy density” it was working to integrate into Ford electric vehicles “within this decade.” GM's LMR announcement, while later, specified the year 2028.

Square has a new way for merchants to take your money: a new handheld device.

The payment company's little white pucks, touchscreen terminals, and portable wedges already crowd the world of contactless point-of-sale payments; you've probably swiped or tapped on a Square gadget countless times at cafés, retail stores, and farmer's markets.

The slick new phone-like handset is meant for servers, sellers, or anyone working in customer service to carry around and use to collect payments or put in orders. It is called, wait for it, Square Handheld. It costs $399 and is available now.

Square says more than 4 million sellers already use its hardware and services in their businesses—point-of-sale terminals, payment processors, and inventory management tools that aim to keep a business running. (Square takes a cut of the transactions for its trouble.)

In April, Square announced it was smashing all of its various services into a single point-of-sale app. The Square Handheld is another effort to further synergize those capabilities, packing everything into a slim device that can also process payments directly via a card reader.

Servers at restaurants can take a table's order by tapping on the screen.

Square is operated by Block, the financial tech company that also runs CashApp and AfterPay. Thomas Templeton, Block's head of hardware, says the effort behind the Square Handheld was to make a device that would both integrate with the service's software and inventory management systems and be easy to carry around. Portable barcode scanners can be big and bulky, or connected with a wire that can make moving them around a hassle. This little fella is wireless and has the familiar look and feel of a chunky smartphone.

“Portability is getting more important,” Templeton says.

The Square handheld is half an inch thick, weighs less than three quarters of a pound, and connects wirelessly to the Square system. So a server can carry around the device in their pocket, pull it out to take an order, then send that order to the kitchen without having to go back and plug the order into another computer.

“People are used to their phones and their iPads or computers,” Templeton says. “When they go to work, there's no reason they have to have a degraded experience after they clock in. They're used to consumer electronics and that experience and UI and design. There's no reason to sacrifice.”

The Handheld has a barcode scanner on the top, a 16-megapixel camera on the back for taking pictures, and all the payment capabilities found in the Square app inside. Square has partnered with Belkin to offer cases in seven different colors, which merchants can buy for an extra $39 each. The device is meant to appeal to a broad range of businesses—not only the smaller ones Square has historically catered to, but also bigger box stores who might want to use the Handheld's barcode scanner to tackle inventory management.

Workers can use the barcode scanner to track inventory.

“We built it for the needs of everybody,” Templeton “And I think one of the big things that we see is that smaller businesses want the same tools and same functionality as bigger businesses, but people don't design for them.”

I ask about other potential features, maybe something more futuristic like technologies seen elsewhere in the world that can use biometric data like fingerprints or face recognition to confirm payments. Templeton grimaces.

“We're constantly looking at different technologies and how we can save sellers time. But there's nothing imminent on the horizon on biometrics,” Templeton says. “I'm personally not a fan of facial recognition or scanning eyeballs, just from a privacy perspective.”

Templeton says there may be a future for AI on the device, perhaps through features to recognize an item that isn't logged in the inventory or a chatbot-esque feature to suggest different dishes based on the current weather or other circumstances. The handheld is not quite there yet, though it will be able to receive updates in the future.

“I do think AI is an interesting space,” Templeton says “From a hardware perspective, it's powered, it's very powerful. It can do tons of stuff and it's future proof. And that's an area that we're looking into a lot and I'm really excited about.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How to Use Apple Maps on the Web","https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-apple-maps-on-the-web/","Tue, 13 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The boundaries of Apple's walled garden aren't as well defined as they used to be; Apple Maps is the latest app to break out. It has taken a while—the app launched in 2012—but you can now use Apple Maps on the web. You can load it up in a browser on Windows PCs, Macs, iPads, and even in an Android phone's mobile browser.

Right now, the Apple Maps web app has a beta label attached to it, which means it's a work in progress. Expect more features and better performance over time. (You can't yet sign in with your Apple ID, for example.) You also need a compatible browser, and that means Safari, Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

Despite its beta status, there's already a lot you can do with Apple Maps on the web, including looking up places, getting directions to specific places, and accessing guides to popular cities and other destinations.

We don't yet have the ability to sign into Apple Maps on the web, so you'll be starting fresh every time you open it in your browser, and you will not see links to your past searches or your saved places, for example. Click the arrow icon (in the top right) to jump to your current location, based on what location your browser is reporting.

The map icon just above the arrow lets you choose the map view: Standard, Satellite, or a Hybrid combination of the two. There's also a compass icon just below. Click and drag on the compass to change the orientation of the map, or click once to go back to the default (where north is directly up). In the lower right corner you've got zoom controls, and you can also zoom in and out by pinching your touchscreen or trackpad or by using the scroll wheel on your mouse.

There's a navigation pane on the left you can show and hide using the icon in the very top left corner, and this gets you access to the key three parts of Apple Maps on the web: Search, Guides, and Directions. Search is simple enough: Just type in what you're looking for. You'll also see quick links to find restaurants, bars, gas stations, and other destinations in the map area you're currently looking at.

With some of the larger and more well known cities in the world, an information panel pops up with more details about the place. This might include photos of landmarks as well as historical information pulled from Wikipedia. Major roads and sights worth seeing will be labeled on the map with these city overviews.

Click on any label on the map for more details—the business hours or the contact details for a coffee shop, for example. Depending on what's selected, you might see photos of the place and reviews left by other people. (These reviews are typically sourced from other websites, such as Tripadvisor.) To share a place with someone else, click the share icon at the top of the info panel (the arrow and square), and you can pick a contact or app.

Whenever you've got a place selected on the map, you get a Directions link you can click on. The next panel prompts you for a starting location—click inside the box and enter a start point, or choose My Location—and you can switch between driving and walking directions at the top. (Cycling and public transit directions aren't yet supported.)

As usual with Apple Maps, you sometimes get a choice of routes, which may include the fastest route as well as a suggested route, which is typically the most fuel efficient or the easiest to navigate. Use the Now and Avoid dropdown menus to change your departure time and avoid tolls and freeways, if you need to, and click on any route for more information.

Unless you're propping up your laptop on your car's dashboard (which we don't recommend), you're not going to be using Apple Maps on the web for the actual turn-by-turn navigation, so there's no way to actually start working your way through these directions. You can also get to the same interface via the Directions link on the side panel rather than selecting a destination first.

As with the dedicated Apple Maps apps for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, you can access a series of travel guides on the web. Click Guides on the side panel to start searching. These are sourced from all over the internet and cover all kinds of topics—from the best ancient wonders of the world to the best acoustic music spots in London.

You can drill down by location or by topic, like music or sports for example. You can also find guides for many larger cities just by searching for them on the map. The guides will appear in the information card that pops up; featured guides will appear first, and you can click More to see a bigger selection. It's a great way of exploring a new (or old) place, though the number of places covered by guides remains limited.

I've been reviewing smartphones for a decade, and it's rare for a new device to wow me. But that was the only word that came out of my mouth after I picked up Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge. This is the company's ultra-thin smartphone, and it's shockingly lean and lightweight.

Samsung unraveled the full details about the Edge today through a virtual Galaxy Unpacked event, after first teasing the device during the launch of the Galaxy S25 series in January. Preorders are also live, starting at $1,100, with official sales kicking off on May 30. That puts the Galaxy S25 Edge at $100 more than the Galaxy S25+ and $200 less than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Samsung says this pricing includes the uncertainty on tariffs, so there may be a realm where the phone could have come in under $1,000 before the exorbitant China tariffs.

Here's everything you need to know.

The Galaxy S25 Edge is on the left, and the Galaxy S25 is on the right.

Samsung says it's been wanting to make an ultrathin phone for some time, but it's only now able to achieve this feat without compromising on core features. Various phone makers over the years have dabbled in this space to earn the title of “World's Thinnest Phone”—even earlier this year, we saw a concept device from Tecno that claimed to be a mere 5.75 mm thick.

The Galaxy S25 Edge comes very close, measuring 5.8 mm and weighing just 163 grams. For context, the iPhone 16 is 7.8 mm thick and weighs 170 grams—the difference might not sound like much, but remember that the iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch screen; the Edge has a 6.7-inch display, so you're getting far more screen. Compared to the same-sized Galaxy S25+, the Edge is 1.5 mm thinner and 27 grams lighter.

It's hard to convey how impressively lightweight and thin it feels without trying it yourself. And you can—Samsung says the Edge will be paired with a new, lighter security bracket at retailers like Best Buy and carrier stores, so interested buyers can get a better sense of the phone without a bulky thing in the way.

The phone's edges are so thin that it might affect how you hold it for a long period, because there's just not much for your fingers to grab. Time will tell. But once the wonder of the thinness fades away, you'll start wondering about battery life. The S25 Edge has a 3,900-mAh battery capacity, 100 mAh less than what's in the smaller Galaxy S25. It's a laughably small capacity compared to similar-sized phones these days.

Still, Samsung says it's done a lot of work to optimize the display's power, and with the efficiency of the 3-nanometer Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset inside, you should get “all-day” battery life. This run time supposedly outlasted the Galaxy S24 but fell short of the S25 in Samsung's tests. With average use, you can probably eke out a day, but power users may have to tote along a battery pack. Nothing like slimming a phone down, then forcing you to carry around a portable charger.

It's worth noting that Samsung isn't using silicon-carbon battery technology, which offers denser batteries in a thinner design found in new devices like the OnePlus 13.

This is the big question: Do you want a thin phone? Or a slightly thicker phone with a beefier battery that could last two days? I'd bet most people will say the latter. Samsung says its research found that people who bought its Ultra phones found the phone too big and heavy, but didn't want to downsize to the Galaxy S25+ or S25, as they didn't want to lose out on some features. Opting for the Edge means they'll have a feature-rich phone, but with the worst battery life in the entire Galaxy S25 lineup. It's a little perplexing. The Edge doesn't even support the fast charging speeds of the S25 Ultra, tapping out at 25 watts wired and 15 watts wireless.

The S25 Edge has a titanium frame, just like the Ultra, to keep it lightweight. It also employs Corning's new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, which is similar to what's on the Ultra, minus the anti-reflective coating used to reduce glare. That allows the glass to be a little thinner on the Edge.

The Galaxy S25 Edge is on the bottom, and the Galaxy S25 is on top.

The other area where things are different is the cameras. Instead of the usual triple-camera setup on most Samsung flagship phones of the last few years, you get a dual-camera system. It's led by a 200-megapixel primary camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide, with a 12-megapixel selfie camera. There's no telephoto zoom camera, but you can get “optical-like” image quality at 2X zoom, going up to 10X with AI-enhanced zoom.

All the cameras have autofocus, so you can use macro mode for close-up shots with the ultrawide, and even the selfie camera has a wider field of view, so more people can fit in the frame. Samsung is quick to point out that you're getting many of the features available on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, from 4K 120 frames-per-second video recording—unavailable on the S25+ and S25—to the ability to shoot in Log format for greater control in the editing room.

Much of the other specs match up with the Galaxy S25 series, including 256 GB of starting storage, 12 GB of RAM, and the Qi2 Ready wireless charging system. This phone can also take advantage of all the same Galaxy AI features and will receive seven years of software updates.

As much as Samsung says it's not compromising with the Galaxy S25 Edge, it still is. There's no third or fourth zoom camera here, and battery life likely won't match up to similar-sized peers. Still, if you prefer big phones but hate the associated weight and heft, you now have a new option from Samsung's lineup.

It'll be interesting to see how the Galaxy S25 Edge fares ahead of Apple's iPhone September event, where the iPhone maker is rumored to unveil a new kind of iPhone: the iPhone 17 Air. Leaks suggest it'll be 5.5 mm thick, one-upping Samsung. Holding the iPhone 17 Air will likely be just as astonishing, but get ready to be disappointed with its battery stats.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Android 16 Is Getting a Facelift, and Gemini Is Rolling Onto More Google Platforms","https://www.wired.com/story/android-16-gemini-new-features/","Tue, 13 May 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

Google I/O is on May 20, but the annual developer conference will be so jam-packed with announcements that Google is opening the valve to release some news early. Today, during a virtual event dubbed The Android Show, the company showed off several features coming to the Android 16, starting with a fresh redesign.

Here's everything new coming to Google's mobile operating system. Some of these features will arrive first on Pixel phones later this summer—presumably Google's Pixel 10 series—but most will be a part of the big annual Android update, which is expected to arrive earlier than usual this year, in June.

Also be sure to read our overview of the use of on-device artificial intelligence to power Android's new scam detection features.

Android is getting a facelift with a new design language called Material 3 Expressive, and the emphasis this time is on personalization.

The last major redesign was four years ago when Material 3 debuted. That said, Google says this isn't “Material 4,"" and Material 3 Expressive isn't a new version of the system. Expressive is the “most researched update,"" through 46 studies with more than 18,000 participants.

Google claims the expressive language sprinkled throughout the operating system is preferred by people of all ages, scoring high on attributes like playfulness, energy, creativity, and friendliness. Crucially, Google claims that “users are more likely to switch to products that use M3 Expressive components and techniques.” That's important when recent surveys have shown that 87 percent of teens own iPhones with no plans to switch.

There are fresh animations that will feel more responsive, like how swiping a notification away from the notification drawer will feel springy with haptic feedback, and the notifications above and below will react to that action. You can expect subtle animation changes when you dismiss an app in the Recents menu, play around with the volume slider, or even when you bring down the quick settings shade—you'll see a blur effect over your home screen.

Fonts and typography are more emphasized, and Android 16 has more dynamic color themes, giving you more control over the operating system's look, even in supported apps. Much of it is functional too—Google's letting you squeeze more settings into the Quick Settings drawer, so you can quickly access tools like the Flashlight or Do Not Disturb mode.

Android 16 also takes a cue from Apple's Live Activities features, pinning ongoing notifications from apps like DoorDash, Uber, or Google Maps on the lock screen so you don't have to keep hopping into the app to check. They'll stay on the screen even when the phone goes into standby mode.

These design updates extend to Wear OS 6 as well, catering to round smartwatch displays like those on the Pixel Watch 3. Dynamic color theming lets you customize the watch's operating system to match your outfit, not just the watch face. Google says the animations are fluid while offering more depth, and buttons hug the display to make them more space-efficient and easily tappable. It's not just design changes in the wearable operating system update—power and performance optimizations mean existing devices that get the update will see a 10 percent battery boost.

Apple is also expected to introduce a major redesign to its phone, tablet, and Mac operating systems during its WWDC developer conference on June 9.

Google Assistant is officially going away, replaced by Google's souped-up Gemini chatbot. The main news ahead of Google I/O is that Gemini will replace Assistant on more platforms beyond just Android phones. In the coming months, Gemini will be the default voice assistant in Wear OS 6, Android Auto, cars with Google Built-in, Google TV, and Android XR.

In the car is where Gemini might shine the most. You won't have to be as precise with requests—important when you should be focused on driving—and those requests can be more open-ended than ever. “Gemini can find you a charging station on the way to the post office that's also near a park, so that you can go for a walk before your errands while your car is charging.” It also supports Gemini Live, so you can have a free-flowing back-and-forth conversation with the assistant in the car.

On Wear OS, you'll be able to ask Gemini to remember things on your behalf, and since Gemini can connect directly to apps, you can ask specific details about an email a friend sent and get the answer on the watch. Gemini on platforms like Wear OS and Android Auto uses the same models as what's on Android phones and will require an internet connection. There will be limited offline capabilities, but the company says it's still “exploring the best way to bring an offline experience.”

Google has made a name for itself with its call protection features that help fend off robocalls and scams on its Pixel phones. That blocking prowess is making its way further into native Android. For example, if you're on a call on any phone running Android 16 with somebody who isn't in your contacts list, the phone will now block specific actions like disabling Google Play Protect, app sideloading, and granting accessibility permissions—actions that can help scammers access sensitive data stored on your phone.

There are some screen-sharing security upgrades as well. If you're on the phone with someone and sharing your screen with them, Android will prompt you to stop sharing when the call ends. Google's also piloting in-call protections for banking apps starting in the UK—you'll get a warning when you open a banking app while screen sharing and on the phone.

Google says its on-device Scam Detection tech in the Google Messages texting app can now spot more text scams, from crypto to toll road scams. The company says it is using on-device AI to accomplish this. Within Google Messages, there's also a new Key Verifier tool so you and the other party can verify each other using public encryption keys, by scanning a QR code or number comparison in the Google Contacts app.

Android 16 will have stronger factory reset protections, restricting all functions for devices reset without the owner's authorization. And one-time passcodes will be hidden from your lock screen in high-risk environments, like when you're not connected to Wi-Fi and haven't recently unlocked your phone.

The last big new change is for Google's Find My Devices app—it's getting a rebrand to “Find Hub.” Google has been slow to catch up to the capabilities of Apple's expansive Find My network, which not only allows hardware owners to find lost devices, but also allows family and friends to share their location with each other.

In 2024, Google added some major updates that allowed offline devices and select phones with dead batteries to be tracked, and widened support to third-party trackers. More importantly, every Android phone can now help anonymously search for other people's missing gadgets, much like how Apple's system works.

So the Find Hub name change makes sense—the app is no longer just for your devices, as loved ones can share their location so you can make sure they got home fine. Google says more third-party tracker support is on the way, from an integration with Peak to find lost skis, to upcoming ultra-wideband support with the Moto Tag from Motorola. Later this year, Find Hub will integrate satellite connectivity on compatible devices, and you'll be able to share your Bluetooth tracker's location with select airlines in 2026, a feature available with AirTags and iPhones.

8/10

Of all Sony's Bravia home theater gear for 2025, the new Theater System 6 (not to be confused with the new Theater Bar 6) is the strangest. Part soundbar, part home theater in a box (HTB), the System 6 eschews the status quo of single-bar solutions with fancy Dolby Atmos speakers and networking features for a callback to budget home theaters of yesteryear.

The system's collection of 5.1 surround components includes a beefy subwoofer, two tall and musical surround speakers, and a small center soundbar that performs much better than you'd expect based on its thin frame and mundane design. The whole setup runs through the tubby sub, including all inputs and an amplifier box that acts as a bridge for the wired surround speakers.

The mostly wired configuration feels more Vizio than Sony, while its layout evokes '90s A/V vibes. Without Wi-Fi, the System 6 is a pain to update and misses out on modern extras like smart assistants and Apple AirPlay, but features like Sony's virtual 3D surround engine and controller app give you more to work with than vintage plug-and-play solutions. Most importantly, the System 6's cinematic oomph is a blast for movies, gaming, and everything in between.

The System 6 may be all-in-one, but it's still something of a bear to set up, starting with lugging the massive L-shaped box into your TV room. Flipping open the side reveals a sprawling collection of components, including five main pieces, dual power cables, and flat-wire cables for connecting the surrounds and main bar. It's all pretty intuitive, but you'll want to block out some solid setup time. Props to Sony for including the same attachable soundbar feet found in its flagship Bravia Theater 9 to help it sit above TV stands

Running everything through the 25-pound subwoofer is one of the System 6's big quirks, but it makes sense in the grander scheme. The sub is the system's anchor in more ways than one, offering serious thunder from its 15-inch tall cabinet, the lone LED display, and an input hub for optical, 3.5-mm analog (a rarity these days), and HDMI eARC. Unfortunately, there's no spare HDMI input to connect a game console or other video sources directly.

The Bravia Connect app walks you through the main setup, including ensuring the system properly reads your TV over HDMI eARC to control power and volume with your TV remote. Newer Bravia TV owners can also control some settings from the TV directly. The System 6 has its own remote, but the twix-like wand is only good for basic adjustments, with the app offering deeper settings like adjusting the velocity and distance of each component based on your sitting position.

The surround speakers are agnostic until plugged into the little amp box (which connects to the sub wirelessly), and they've plenty of wire for most rooms. While running cables seems less convenient than wireless surrounds, the need for only one power input for the amp box made things simpler for my room, which doesn't have ideal plug placement for powered surrounds. The app makes it easy to balance the well-matched components, adjust settings, or swap to Bluetooth streaming once you've paired your phone.

I wish I could say the same for updating the firmware, but Sony makes it oddly difficult. Not long after setup, the app notified me of an update to fix a short audio delay when starting a show or movie and minor lip sync issues (which I didn't notice). Instead of an app-based update, Sony continues the old-school theme, making you download a zip file onto a USB drive and follow multiple steps. After three unsuccessful tries, I gave up. Newer units will ship with the latest software, but this doesn't exactly bode well for future updates.

Setting aside the frustrations of firmware failure, the System 6 was mostly a joy. It has taut detail, foundational bass, and surprisingly adept surround speakers. Even as 3D audio formats like Dolby Atmos increasingly monopolize the home theater conversation, the System 6 affirms the importance of real surround speakers over virtual ones. While upfiring speakers can be very effective with the right content, most effects remain at the front, sides, and back of the theater, or home theater, as the case may be.

The System 6 does a bang-up job immersing you in sound with fluid handoff between the bar and surrounds, and burly power from the sub that brings every explosion, gunshot, roaring engine, or rhythmic soundtrack home. The sub is the de facto leader and most impressive puzzle piece. It's not as musical or articulate as the fancy Sonos Sub 4, sometimes getting too boomy, but turning it down a few notches worked wonders in my room.

The sub blends well with the bar, which takes on the upper register with notable panache for its size. You'll hear some excellent touch to dialog and subtler effects, especially in the middle of the sound. The bar isn't particularly lyrical or precise toward the top of the frequency spectrum, but it's well tuned and serves its job admirably at the system's center.

The System 6 doesn't fully eschew 3D audio. It supports virtually every major sound format, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and clicking the Soundfield button on the remote or app with supported content notably changes the vibe. The surround speakers push the sound forward to virtually mimic “sound objects” for a more spherical sound. You won't hear pointed overhead effects like with true upfiring speakers, but it's a nice option. You can even see the format change from 5.1 or 7.1 to Dolby Atmos or DTS:X with Soundfield engaged.

I don't recommend using it for regular surround or stereo content, especially music, which is the System 6's weak point. Streaming from your phone sounds good for most genres, but like a lot of surround configurations, the system is at its best when fed cinematic content, even if it's just the laugh track in a sitcom or a well-mixed sporting event.

While watching a golf tournament in 5.1, I was almost shocked at the near visceral recreation of the course's atmospheric din, especially the singing bird near the production microphones that seemed to take up residency behind my couch. I had a similarly transportative experience playing the new co-op game Split Fiction, which served up a feast of potent effects, immersive environments, and traceable enemies to help my wife and me navigate the landscape.

Sony's System 6 is more of a hassle than many of the best soundbars, and I'm still annoyed by my firmware failures. Conversely, for its nearly $800 cost, you could get a more traditional home theater setup, like this one from Klipsch. Still, the System 6 is more convenient and compact than multi-speaker setups, filling its own niche with thrilling cinematics in a fun and approachable package. Sometimes it pays to zig when everybody else zags. If you are after an aesthetic and great-sounding system for your living room, it's worth considering.

Google on Tuesday unveiled its new Android design language, Material 3 Expressive, at the Android Show ahead of Google I/O. The update is designed to make your phone more customizable and fluid, the tech giant says.

Material 3 Expressive brings new springy animations that Google says will make your phone feel more fluid. For example, when you dismiss a notification, you will see a detach transition and feel a haptic rumble. You will see similar sorts of animation and feel haptics when you're doing things like dismissing an app in your recent apps screen, fidgeting with the volume slider, or flinging down the shade.

The update also subtly blurs the background to provide a sense of depth so you can stay in context when navigating your phone.

“In 2021 we launched Material You as a big leap in design that focused around a user's identity with experiences like dynamic color theming,” said Mindy Brooks, VP, Product and UX, Android Platform, in a briefing with reporters. “Now we're building off the principles of Material You to bring our latest design update called Material 3 Expressive. Material 3 Expressive is an expansion of new components and capabilities designed to add emotion to product UIs, providing a more premium and engaging experience that is easier to use and creates a little more joy in key moments.”

Android is also getting updated dynamic color themes and emphasized typography to allow users to customize their phone to their style and preferences. Plus, these visual customizations will be applied across Google apps, such as Google Photos and Gmail. 

In addition, you can now customize Quick Settings to add more of your favorite actions, such as Flashlight and Do Not Disturb. 

Android's new Live Updates feature will also help you easily track progress notifications from select apps. For example, if you place an Uber Eats order, you will start to see a glanceable Live Update to see the real-time progress of your order. The feature is similar to iOS's Live Activities feature.

“We're introducing Live Updates as a new feature that will highlight what you need to know so you can stay focused on what you care about,” Brooks said. “We've all been there. You've placed an order, and you're trying to pay attention to conversations around the table. With glanceable live updates, you can easily track your order and get back to real life. These real time updates from your favorite delivery, rideshare, and navigation apps are coming as part of the redesign later this year.”

All of these new design improvements will first come to Pixel devices later this year with Android 16.

As for Wear OS watches, Material 3 Expressive's design is more fluid with scrolling animations that trace the circular display. Just like on phones, the new design language will bring a sense of depth.

Plus, Google is updating daily experiences like using the pin pad and controlling media with motion and responsive feedback. There will also be smoother transitions, along with dynamic color-theming to the watch so that the theme you choose for your watch face applies to the device. 

“We are excited to announce that we are bringing color theming to the watch,” Brooks said. “Now, the theme you choose for your watch face can theme the entire system in Google Apps so you can make it your own. And when it comes to getting things done, glanceability is one of the most important considerations for watch we've created a system of buttons that truly hug the display, making them that much more tappable and space efficient using an underlying polar grid.”

Tiles are also going to be more engaging, making it easier to get quick access to information or actions, such as texting your favorite contacts or starting a workout.

These changes will be rolling out to the Pixel Watch first later this year with Wear OS 6.

Check out how to watch the livestream and more from Google I/O.

Hasan Piker, one of the most popular left-wing political creators in the U.S., says he was detained and questioned at the Chicago O'Hare Airport upon returning to the U.S. after a trip to France.

In a stream in which he addressed the experience, Piker claims that he was questioned about his views on Trump, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.

Piker has been outwardly critical of President Donald Trump and the U.S.'s ongoing support of the Israeli military, and he said it was clear to him that the Customs and Border Protection agent knew who he was. 

“He kept saying stuff like, ‘Do you like Hamas?'” Piker said in a video. “I kept repeating the same statement over and over again… I am on the side of civilians. I want the endless bloodshed to end. I am a pacifist.”

Piker said he felt that the agent who interviewed him was trying to get him to say something incriminating, and that the agent was aware of his online presence. Though Piker is a U.S. citizen, he was concerned about being jailed at the border for his political speech, since some U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained amid Trump's crackdown on immigration.

According to NBC News, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official said that, in recounting his story online, Piker is “lying for likes.”

“Claims that his political beliefs triggered the inspection are baseless,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. “Our officers are following the law, not agendas. Upon entering the country, this individual was referred for further inspection — a routine, lawful process that occurs daily, and can apply for any traveler. Once his inspection was complete, he was promptly released.”

Piker has pushed back against DHS's response.

On X, Piker wrote: “the dhs response is so funny cus they're not even disputing that it happened, they're omitting the insane questions that were asked, & instead claiming that i wasn't targeted for my political beliefs. why'd y'all ask me about trump, israel, houthis, hamas and my twitch bans then?”

Apple on Tuesday announced a range of accessibility features coming to its devices later this year.

New Accessibility Nutrition Labels will provide more detailed information for apps and games on the App Store, while a new Braille Access tool will turn the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro into a braille notetaker.

Additional enhancements include Accessibility Reader, a system-wide reading mode designed with accessibility in mind; a new Apple TV accessibility app, Assistive Access; shareable accessibility settings; and updates to Live Listen, Background Sounds, Personal Voice, and Vehicle Motion Cues.

The upgrades arrive as Apple partners with the startup Synchron to help disabled users navigate its software. The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is also developing a new protocol, Switch Control, to enable people to control their iPhones as well as other devices with neural signals captured by brain implants.

An email notification system used by U.S. federal and state government departments to alert residents to important information has been used to send scam emails, TechCrunch has learned.

The U.S. state of Indiana said Tuesday that it is “aware of fraudulent messages purportedly sent by state agencies” to residents about unpaid tolls. TechCrunch has seen one email message sent from an Indiana government department that claimed the recipient had an outstanding toll balance, and contained a disguised link that redirected to a malicious site.

A statement from the Indiana Office of Technology said it was “working with the company that was used to deliver those messages to stop any further communication.” 

Indiana said a contractor's account was hacked and used to send the scam messages. The state said it was not aware of “any current state systems” being compromised, but did not rule out an earlier breach.

The statement said that the contract with the unspecified company, which TechCrunch has learned is govtech giant Granicus, ended in December 2024, but the state claimed that the company “did not remove the state's account.” 

When reached for comment, Granicus spokesperson Sharon Rushen told TechCrunch: “We are aware of the recent malicious emails sent via GovDelivery from Indiana's government domain.” The company confirmed the breach was caused by a compromised user account, but did not comment on Indiana's claims.

“Granicus systems themselves were not breached,” said Rushen. When asked, the company said it does have the technical means to determine how many individuals received the malicious emails, but did not immediately provide a figure of those affected.

Fake toll messages are an increasingly common scam, as the Federal Trade Commission warned in January. The scam involves sending text messages and emails that claim the recipients owe money to tolling agencies across the United States. By targeting email systems used by governments to notify the public, scammers are hoping victims will be more likely to open official-looking emails.

A person who received the scam message shared the email with TechCrunch. The scam email was sent from an official Indiana government email address associated with the state's Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates responses and alerts in the event of a natural disaster or other emergency events. The email claimed the recipient had unpaid tolls in Texas, and that “failure to pay may result in penalties or vehicle registration holds.”

The scam email contained a link, which appears as an official govdelivery.com web address, but when clicked redirects to a malicious site impersonating the website of Texas' Department of Transport's road toll collection service, TxTag. 

The scam website attempted to trick users into turning over their personal information, such as their name, phone number, home address, and their credit card details. The site (and another clone site hosted on a similar domain) appeared to be offline as of Tuesday morning on the U.S. east coast.

A spokesperson for the Indiana government did not immediately comment.

In a bid to make its AI DJ feel more interactive, Spotify is updating the feature to allow users to request music or change the mood of a playlist using voice commands. The company is rolling out this feature, initially only supported in English, in over 60 markets for its Premium subscribers.

Previously, users could only listen to the AI DJ play songs with added commentary in between certain tracks. Now, the feature is becoming interactive.

Users can tell the AI DJ to change the mood or genre, or have it play tracks from specific artists.

To use the AI DJ, you can type in “DJ” in the search bar, then hold the DJ button on the bottom right to make requests through voice commands. If you want to change the feel of the playlist without making a specific request, you can quickly press the DJ button.

Spotify first launched the AI DJ feature in February 2023 in the U.S. and Canada. The company later rolled it out globally in August 2023. Last year, the music streaming company added support for a Spanish-speaking AI DJ.

The company's other big AI feature lets users create playlists using text prompts.

The courts have been captured and politicized heavily. Clearance Thomas should be expelled for emoluments. Kavanaugh also for lying on the stand.Congress has a bare majority for republicans. So getting impeachments for actual crimes by republicans is a non-starter.POTUS and executive branch can run roughshod, and order all sorts of illegal actions. Congress won't impeach. And they can pardon anybody underneath them. Musk is a perfect example - no clearance, yet somehow 'legally' is destroying sections of government that was investigating him. And given a complete pass. Its also how ICE can kidnap and traffick people, all the while flaunting disobeidance from a federal judge.This is a coup by the oligarchy against the people. And aside violent uprisings (of which I do not condone), there's not much at all we can do.

Look at Orbán, Erdogan, and similar new authoritarians, the coup is a slow grinding of every facet of democracy: grind the press, grind the judiciary, throw a new law into the mix made up by your cronies in the parliament/Congress, keep grinding at the foundations of democracy over decades and you get a shell of institutions that used to be the foundation of a democratic state being re-purposed to push the agenda of the dictator.The veneer of institutions is the point, it's to make you have exactly this reaction:> I genuinely don't understand how this can be a coup when all three branches agree.Because you are expecting an overt coup, not a slow moving covert one.

When the Court overturned Chevron, it did not “return law‑making to Congress” as some claim, it didn't give Congress any more power than it already had. It instead shifted final interpretive power from expert agencies to federal judges. Congress still writes broad statutes and still relies on agencies to fill in technical details only now those rules are more vulnerable to litigation and inherently more fragile.Comparing that process to Elon Musk's influence misses the mark. Agencies are public, transparent, and (at least theoretically) answerable to elected branches; Musk is a private supplier whose market dominance lets him set terms with little democratic oversight. One is statutory delegation, the other is private leverage with clear and obvious conflicts of interest.Treating them as equivalent flattens important distinctions and obscures the real accountability gaps in each scenario.

It wasn't a mechanism called the Chevron deference, it was law, as determined by the Supreme Court in ""Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council"".The deference was on the part of the courts deferring to executive regulators when there was ambiguity, since the regulators were experts in a given field and the courts were generally legal experts. Not Congress.That was overturned in  Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo.""non-elected, life-long positioned government employees"" so, you mean, federal employees. Nothing about it is ""life-long"", you made that up. They could quit, change jobs, or be fired.And ""criminals"" is false. It applied to civil statutes, not criminal ones. It goes on.

I'm curious to what degree the narrative will once again be recuperated by the Democrats to  obscure the class origins of these policies - the expansion of power of the corporate-government machine.  The Dems have been successfully playing ping pong with the Republicans for many years without addressing our society's structural failures because they don't want to upset their monied masters.

  The court decided in 1984 that judges should defer to federal agencies in interpreting ambiguous parts of statutes.

Again, scientists are human and will do things for personal gain. There are mechanisms being implemented in science funding that are meant to try and curb this behavior. NIH intramural research now require the use of electronic lab notebooks, which greatly reduce the ability to doctor data post-experiment. There is also a push for scientific preregistration, which helps to prevent p-hacking and hypothesis modification.But saying that all funding towards a scientific dead-end due to misdirection by individual researchers is proof of fraud in government funding doesn't compute.

which fraud? please elaborate





In my experience, industry can be vastly better funded, but the industry labs are internal and perhaps very hard to find.

To just point out a few items:> Astronomy* Medical imaging has been revolutionized by advances made by astronomers, both in hardware and software. I'll give CT scans as just one of the examples of direct transfer of knowledge/tools from astronomy to medicine.* Security scanning (eg. scanners in airports) is another example of direct transfer. The technology comes directly from astronomy and, in fact, an astronomer from the Space Telescope Science Institute, a govt. funded basic research institution, holds one of the main patents for this technology.> Mathematics* Riemann's work on non-euclidean geometry was a purely intellectual exercise for many years, until Einstein was able to make practical use of it to describe spacetime curvature. The resulting theory of general relativity underpins many things, but a direct example I'll give is GPS. It simply wouldn't work without the theoretical framework built on math that originally had no practical application.

>[Chemistry]? Such as? What benefits do you expect to see?Everything around us is made up of ""molecules,"" assemblages of parts called atoms. Since it's not possible to manipulate the molecules directly in sufficient numbers (one pound of plastic is made of 2000000000000000000000 individual molecules), we have to assemble molecules en masse by subjecting them to processes that cause each step to happen to all of them at once. How does that work?Let's say you have a molecule. Its structure will have exposed parts, and some bonds will be weaker than others. If you want to replace a part with another part (one step in the assembly of the final product), you might go about it by letting another molecule come along that has a greater affinity to bond with the location of the part you want to replace, and also has a tendency to be in turn itself replaced with the part you want to add. How can you know which molecule to use for this? You could run a computer simulation, apply a rule of thumb, or look it up in a book. In order to write the simulations, deduce the correct rules of thumb and write the books, scientists need to try a lot of combinations of molecules to see what parts swap with what other parts when they're mixed, and then think very hard about what's happening and why it is happening. This practice is known as, ""chemistry.""Once a lot of the rules for a certain molecule are mapped out, engineers with an application in mind can go to the library and ask, ""what sequence of steps will take me from available molecules to a molecule I can sell in a way that succeeds very often?"" This is called, ""industrial chemistry."" If there was no library and no knowledge in it, industrial chemistry would be impossible. That is the relationship between science and engineering.

There are huge parts of physics which are only publicly funded. Results are often spun out into companies, but there is no institution that can fund experiments that require timelines of multiple decades (even things like fusion power is nearly completely government funds)And those are the only two parts where I actually have some competence. So yeah.. I wouldn't buy

Right, defense can and has funded research for its own purposes, and sometimes those purposes can find wider commercial application (like the internet). That's all great, national defense is one of the government's primary purposes.> There are huge parts of physics which are only publicly funded.Yes, and? Is this an argument that they cannot be funded in other ways, or an argument that the parts of physics that cannot be funded in any other way ought to be publicly funded? There's just this blanket assumption that this is true but it simply doesn't follow.For instance, the newest super collider project that some people are pushing for completely misses the opportunity cost of not funding other projects that could be far more impactful, like wakefield accelerators, which would reduce the size and cost of particle accelerators by orders of magnitude.

I was a PhD student in machine learning during the first Trump administration, and even then things were on very shaky grounds. The Muslim ban alone hit really hard, and was a boon for research institutions outside the US. (Look at Canada's Google Brain branch, for instance.)But, until recently, there was still the plausibility that the whole Trump thing was a flash in the pan. When Trump lost in 2020, there was a sigh of relief that science would continue in the US.This is on top of plummeting educational attainment in the US and the as-of-yet uncertain ramifications of students widespread reliance on LLMs.It is very difficult to imagine a path of returning to the good reputation we had in science.

However, deep scientific cultural do roots exist here and won't be stamped out by some fearmongering. The entire western world is under populist pressure right now, not just here. So even if you imagine someone moving out and studying in a different country, it's not a guarantee they will find stability there either.

Will the rest of the world absorb the scientists in the US? Probably not, that is honestly their mistake and missed opportunity, but all the same probably not. Fine, so you're right? Scientists just stick it out? No.The best scientists will definitely leave. Those are the very ones we always wanted to attract. They could have always left, but didn't because the US was the best place for them. Now they leave. Everyone else will try and leave or leave for industry. Even if you only lose 20% of your scientist to other countries and sectors where they are no longer doing productive scientific work, that is a massive blow to progress.Worst case scenario is China wakes up from its xenophobia and uses this opportunity to replay the US science strategy. Suddenly 20-50% of US scientists can leave for China.

You state that ""hiccup won't stop or even slow down science in the US. All it will do is take government out of the equation."" I disagree and I would suspect most scientists reading that statement would also disagree. I too have seen many bright people turning away from the US because of this. I am personally certain that these policies will significantly slow down science in the US.After all, when David Hilbert was asked in 1934 ""How is mathematics at Göttingen, now that it is free from the Jewish influence?"", he replied “There is no mathematics in Göttingen, anymore”.

The middle-class professional scientist is an invention of post-war governments to create an engine of progress.Pre-war science was a gentleman's hobby, funded by the bored rich. Corporations largely do not perform any basic science and simply reap ideas sown by academics and bring those ideas to market. Without government funding of basic science the engine of progress stops. No new discoveries or new scientists, at least not in the US.

Yet the conspiracy theorists, such as yourself, never talk about these cases. It's always ""they lied about masks"" or ""vaccines cause autism"", the later of which is thoroughly debunked and caused exactly by academic dishonesty! Yet, instead of seeing the scientist who actually did severe harm to the world (the crackpot who lied in their research about vaccines) you take it at face value.

Under Obama, a team of US scientists working internationally (including in China) detected SARSv1 early enough to stop it from becoming a pandemic.  That team had blocked other pandemics over the years.Trump fired that team early in his first term, preventing the US from running the early response to COVID in China.Here is a list of current epidemics the US is either intentionally not responding to, or where the response stopped working since Trump got in office:- Measles- Avian Flu- Tuberculosis- Screw wormAt least one of those is going to hit the US hard in the short term, and Trump's intentional sabotage of our public health infrastructure will be to blame.

To expect that every effort will succeed and be perfect is just naive. What matters is that the system has a mechanism to self-evaluate its results and change the consensus. Which it did. Which means it works. We means we shouldn't burn it down.


reply



I was reacting to the idea that the NIH and NSF academic ethics requirements are that critical self correction mechanism, or they that these institutions were responsible for pushing back and overturning the Aβ hypothesis. In reality, it is the opposite. Grant funding is gate held by review panels staffed by leading researchers in the field, and therefore bias towards the current dogma. I don't know if there is a better way, but it's inherently tied to the status quo.Edit: to be clear on my biases, I spent about 10 years trying to get funding for non Aβ research, and continually shut down by Grant review panels staffed by prominent supporters and authors on the hypothesis.

you think it's bleak that one's research now has to be profitable rather than being subsidized by people paying taxes?


reply



I honestly don't understand why people don't get this - Government is not supposed to be ""profitable"". The whole reason to collect taxes is for good of the society. It sounds like your view is that rural towns, which are already in crisis, should be left to rot away because it isn't ""profitable"". The callous and lack of empathy is seriously astounding.


reply



There are infinitely many things that are marginally good for society and finitely many resources to accomplish them. Spending on irreplicable research has an opportunity cost that most taxpayers wouldn't choose. Framing it as empathy to forcibly take their income and subsidize lofty science is ironic.


reply



The connection between new knowledge and profit is often indirect and cannot be clearly predicted beforehand. And, why must something be profitable in order to justify it? Are there no valid outcomes other than profit?


reply



Because if it isn't profitable then it needs to be subsidized to continue. Given the replication crisis I don't think it's most people's priority to use part of their paycheck for this.

This is a fair question.For one thing, the US dominance in science has allowed us to dominate many profitable products and new industries that were derived from that science. I'm not sure I believe the commonly-given estimate that every $1 spent on basic research yields $8-20 in economic return, but I do believe that the return has been positive.If other countries become the preferred target for the best and the brightest scientists then the US is unlikely to continue to dominate new research-dependent industries as we did for the last ~4 generations.I don't necessarily think this is bad for the world -- concentrating too much wealth, talent, and power in one country has had corrosive effects. But this decline may ultimately be bad for the average US resident, even if their taxes go down.> other than funneling billions to arms industry?As someone who has worked on several military research projects, for better or worse my sense so far is that US military research budgets will be the only ones to come out of this administration largely unscathed.

Of course, in modern monetary theory GDP growth is one of the major factors keeping sovereign debt manageable [1], and NSF funding of about $9B [2] is about 0.2% of the national budget, and that money that is invested in basic research is generally found to significantly contribute to that economic growth [3], there are few ways I can think of to make the debt situation worse than to cut basic research.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation[3] https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/NEW-SfN/Advocacy/2...

The most convincing and interesting thing I've read about the US's science standing is just a reminder that it wasn't always considered a global science leader. A few people saw the opportunity created by Nazi ideological purges of scientists and built, among other things, Princeton's IAS.Considered most charitably, the current administration sees itself as trying to return to an era of imperialism for the good of the country. In this area I wonder how resilient and immobile the scientific community is to these stresses. If I were in charge of science in a wealthy country right now I would be working overtime to brain drain US researchers.

Our founders were aware of the perils of letting public opinion write public policy. We've spent a lot of the post-Cold War era dismantling that anti-populist infrastructure.To the extent I see a guiding light out of this mess, it's in reducing the electoral fetishism that has dominated post-90s democratic discourse. There is more to democracy (and more pointedly, republics) than popular will. To the extent there is a silver lining in MAGA, it's that the numpties have given us the tools with which to accomplish this if we choose to.

The thing to remember is that in the 1950s and 60s the US government was basically running a censorship regime and had manufactured an anti-Communist consensus. They had to do this because democratic politics back then meant political parties actually listening to their constituents. In other words, America had populist infrastructure, which the state had to carefully commandeer to maintain the illusion of a unified society willing to fight a Cold War against a country which, at least on paper, was promising a better America than America.This broke in the 70s, when the Vietnam War pitted young Boomers against old[0]. A lot of the civic institutions that were powering democracy in that era got torn apart along age lines, and fell apart completely. Politics turned from something you made with your voice to something you purchased with your vote. This is how we got the Carter / Reagan neoliberal consensus of ""free trade and open borders for me but not for thee"". The state was free to dictate this new public policy to its citizens because the citizenry were too busy fighting to mount an effective opposition to it.[0] Recall that ""Baby Boomer"" is actually two generations of people, both because the baby boom was so long and because America's access to birth control was on par with that of a third world country. There's a never-ending wellspring of parental abandonment in that generation.

I think it's worth remembering where that came from.  Before the war, in the 20s and 30s, the American industrial establishment was quite happy to work with the Soviet Union, both in selling equipment and lending technical expertise to help the Soviet Union set up their own production (for instance, Ford helped them set up GAZ).  The ideological incompatibility of the Soviet Union and western capitalism wasn't seen as so much of a problem, it was mutually profitable to be civil and do business with each other.Genuine concern with the Soviet Union grew during the war when it became difficult to ignore the belligerent nature of the Soviet Union, towards their neighbors and their own people.

Now some Jews were Communist sympathizers and some weren't. But there were just so many who flooded in from staunchly Eastern-Bloc, Soviet-dominated areas that they were sure to gain powerful footholds in Western society.McCarthy and the House couldn't afford to be perceived as “anti-Semitic” so they chose to couch everything in patriotic anti-Commie terms. But in hindsight, look at how miniscule the influence has been here from Soviet Communism, compared to ideologies of Eastern-Bloc Jews [many who are quite secular and Americanized].

If you really think about it, America's ""success as a scientific powerhouse"" owes a significant debt to foreigners: scholars from abroad and workers on H1-B visas.It has been a well-known fact for decades that white native-born Americans are at a real disadvantage in academia, tech fields, and any sort of research positions, because for whatever reason, the foreigners coming in on H1-B can run circles around them in terms of productivity, innovation, and even sheer numbers.Perhaps this isn't the sort of ""stealin' our jerbs"" people first think of, rather than picking strawberries and selling oranges off the 405, but it's a real phenomenon. This is a very prominent reason for skepticism about DEI from the Right, because the outsized influence of foreigners on academia, and by extension STEM and other sciences, has been steadily growing and growing and inflamed by DEI hiring practices in the industries. Essentially, thousands of foreign nationals have been immigrating to the USA to be educated at our best schools, and then exert two-way influence over culture and commerce. Is that a sustainable practice? Is America enough of a ""melting pot"" that we can withstand that sort of outsized foreign influence within our borders?Furthermore, America was first in line to embrace Eastern-bloc Jews, from the outbreak of WWI through the end of WWII. Those German and Soviet Jews from the diaspora gained significant prestige, not merely from sympathy or pity, and they now have outsized influence in many Western industries, including Hollywood, finance, manufacturing, and psychology. These are markedly distinct career paths from the ones taken by homegrown Jews, such as the Hasidic ones and other Orthodox communities from New York.

Anecdotally, I too worry about the influx of the dirty Irish into our borders, stealing good jobs and spreading their Irish culture. Oh, sorry, I forgot it's not 1940. In my opinion, America has a strong, strong culture -- brain drained scientist's kids in general look pretty integrated to me, at least the ones I know.

Depends.If your idea of America consists of just the pre-colonial native groups, Navajo etc., then America was already gone a century and a half ago.But the America of 1925 had exactly the same arguments about Italians, and of 1845 about the Irish, in that the local born were complaining a lot and didn't trust the newcomers.The melting pot has been melting for a long time now; you're a big endless stew of a country. (Except for the ""real"" natives, if there is such a thing).

Actually ""Oppenheimer"" the movie also supplies examples of two very different New York Jewish backgrounds:J Robert Oppenheimer, from an affluent, non-religious family - with an Upper West side apartment and a summer vacation home on Long Island. His father came to the USA as a teenager, and prospered in business.Isidor Isaac Rabi, from an orthodox, Yiddish-speaking family living in a two-room apartment on the Lower East Side. He was born shortly before the family came to the USA.

European universities would love to do so, the problem is that our model of funding is just as braindead as it is in the US (if not worse, like in Germany) and our politicians are too braindead or unwilling to fix the circumstances.

At stake in the ongoing patent dispute over the gene-editing tool are rights to the most important new biotechnology of the age and credit for inventing it.

The CRISPR patents are back in play.

On Monday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said scientists Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier will get another chance to show they ought to own the key patents on what many consider the defining biotechnology invention of the 21st century. 

The pair shared a 2020 Nobel Prize for developing the versatile gene-editing system, which is already being used to treat various genetic disorders, including sickle cell disease. 

But when key US patent rights were granted in 2014 to researcher Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the decision set off a bitter dispute in which hundreds of millions of dollars—as well as scientific bragging rights—are at stake.

The new decision is a boost for the Nobelists, who had previously faced a string of demoralizing reversals over the patent rights in both the US and Europe.

“This goes to who was the first to invent, who has priority, and who is entitled to the broadest patents,” says Jacob Sherkow, a law professor at the University of Illinois. 

He says there is now at least a chance that Doudna and Charpentier “could walk away as the clear winner.”

The CRISPR patent battle is among the most byzantine ever, putting the technology alongside the steam engine, the telephone, the lightbulb, and the laser among the most hotly contested inventions in history.

In 2012, Doudna and Charpentier were first to publish a description of a CRISPR gene editor that could be programmed to precisely cut DNA in a test tube. There's no dispute about that.

However, the patent fight relates to the use of CRISPR to edit inside animal cells—like those of human beings. That's considered a distinct invention, and one both sides say they were first to come up with that very same year. 

In patent law, this moment is known as conception—the instant a lightbulb appears over an inventor's head, revealing a definite and workable plan for how an invention is going to function.

In 2022, a specialized body called the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, decided that Doudna and Charpentier hadn't fully conceived the invention because they initially encountered trouble getting their editor to work in fish and other species. Indeed, they had so much trouble that Zhang scooped them with a 2013 publication demonstrating he could use CRISPR to edit human cells.

There's a surprise twist in the battle to control genome editing.

The Nobelists appealed the finding, and yesterday the appeals court vacated it, saying the patent board applied the wrong standard and needs to reconsider the case. 

According to the court, Doudna and Charpentier didn't have to “know their invention would work” to get credit for conceiving it. What could matter more, the court said, is that it actually did work in the end. 

In a statement, the University of California, Berkeley, applauded the call for a do-over.  

“Today's decision creates an opportunity for the PTAB to reevaluate the evidence under the correct legal standard and confirm what the rest of the world has recognized: that the Doudna and Charpentier team were the first to develop this groundbreaking technology for the world to share,” Jeff Lamken, one of Berkeley's attorneys, said in the statement.

The Broad Institute posted a statement saying it is “confident” the appeals board “will again confirm Broad's patents, because the underlying facts have not changed.”

The decision is likely to reopen the investigation into what was written in 13-year-old lab notebooks and whether Zhang based his research, in part, on what he learned from Doudna and Charpentier's publications. 

The case will now return to the patent board for a further look, although Sherkow says the court finding can also be appealed directly to the US Supreme Court.  

Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical.

When does AI cross over from efficiency into surveillance?

Six months ago I attended the largest gathering of chiefs of police in the US to see how they're using AI. I found some big developments, like officers getting AI to write their police reports. Today, I published a new story that shows just how far AI for police has developed since then. 

It's about a new method police departments and federal agencies have found to track people: an AI tool that uses attributes like body size, gender, hair color and style, clothing, and accessories instead of faces. It offers a way around laws curbing the use of facial recognition, which are on the rise. 

Advocates from the ACLU, after learning of the tool through MIT Technology Review, said it was the first instance they'd seen of such a tracking system used at scale in the US, and they say it has a high potential for abuse by federal agencies. They say the prospect that AI will enable more powerful surveillance is especially alarming at a time when the Trump administration is pushing for more monitoring of protesters, immigrants, and students. 

I hope you read the full story for the details, and to watch a demo video of how the system works. But first, let's talk for a moment about what this tells us about the development of police tech and what rules, if any, these departments are subject to in the age of AI.

As I pointed out in my story six months ago, police departments in the US have extraordinary independence. There are more than 18,000 departments in the country, and they generally have lots of discretion over what technology they spend their budgets on. In recent years, that technology has increasingly become AI-centric. 

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

Companies like Flock and Axon sell suites of sensors—cameras, license plate readers, gunshot detectors, drones—and then offer AI tools to make sense of that ocean of data (at last year's conference I saw schmoozing between countless AI-for-police startups and the chiefs they sell to on the expo floor). Departments say these technologies save time, ease officer shortages, and help cut down on response times. 

Those sound like fine goals, but this pace of adoption raises an obvious question: Who makes the rules here? When does the use of AI cross over from efficiency into surveillance, and what type of transparency is owed to the public?

In some cases, AI-powered police tech is already driving a wedge between departments and the communities they serve. When the police in Chula Vista, California, were the first in the country to get special waivers from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly their drones farther than normal, they said the drones would be deployed to solve crimes and get people help sooner in emergencies. They've had some successes. 

But the department has also been sued by a local media outlet alleging it has reneged on its promise to make drone footage public, and residents have said the drones buzzing overhead feel like an invasion of privacy. An investigation found that these drones were deployed more often in poor neighborhoods, and for minor issues like loud music. 

Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, says there's no overarching federal law that governs how local police departments adopt technologies like the tracking software I wrote about. Departments usually have the leeway to try it first, and see how their communities react after the fact. (Veritone, which makes the tool I wrote about, said they couldn't name or connect me with departments using it so the details of how it's being deployed by police are not yet clear). 

Sometimes communities take a firm stand; local laws against police use of facial recognition have been passed around the country. But departments—or the police tech companies they buy from—can find workarounds. Stanley says the new tracking software I wrote about poses lots of the same issues as facial recognition while escaping scrutiny because it doesn't technically use biometric data.

“The community should be very skeptical of this kind of tech and, at a minimum, ask a lot of questions,” he says. He laid out a road map of what police departments should do before they adopt AI technologies: have hearings with the public, get community permission, and make promises about how the systems will and will not be used. He added that the companies making this tech should also allow it to be tested by independent parties. 

“This is all coming down the pike,” he says—and so quickly that policymakers and the public have little time to keep up. He adds, “Are these powers we want the police—the authorities that serve us—to have, and if so, under what conditions?”

Former SpaceX employee Douglas Altshuler is taking aim at the Musk-owned company in a new federal discrimination lawsuit.

The 58-year-old Washington resident and his lawyers filed the lawsuit last month. The suit alleges that Altshuler's employers threatened to fire him for taking frequent bathroom breaks, even after he told them that he had Crohn's disease. Altshuler also alleges that he was exposed to chemicals, was often denied meal breaks, and was denied proper overtime pay during his 18-month employment there.

According to the lawsuit, first obtained by The Independent last week, Altshuler was hired to handle customer support calls at SpaceX's Redmond, Washington, facility in June 2023. He appeared to have no issues with the job until early 2024, when his direct supervisor “began tracking Mr. Altshuler's bathroom breaks and repeatedly criticized [him] for using the bathroom,” the lawsuit claims. Altshuler reportedly provided his supervisor with a doctor's letter explaining that he has Crohn's disease, a form of chronic inflammatory bowel disease that often forces people to use the bathroom frequently, particularly during active flare-ups.

Scientists Uncover Potential Major Cause of Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Altshuler claims that he asked and was given assurance by two supervisors for a reasonable accommodation to use the bathroom as needed. But soon enough, his direct supervisor allegedly began to needle him again over his toilet habits, tracking his bathroom breaks and writing him up whenever he was away from his desk for more than 10 minutes. Altshuler says he then pleaded his case to higher-ups at SpaceX, which reportedly led to retaliation from his supervisor during his next performance review; the lawsuit claims that the supervisor “alleged performance deficiencies which were never brought to [Altshuler's] attention before.”

Though Altshuler was assigned to a new supervisor in October 2024, his issues reportedly continued. Altshuler alleges that he was potentially exposed to chemicals in November from “industrial parts being dried in the kitchen oven where employees cook their food.” He reported the incident to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and filed a worker's compensation claim over it as well. Afterward, he claims that he was further retaliated against, with his new supervisor reportedly threatening to fire him for using the bathroom “too often.” In early January, Altshuler was allegedly told by Human Resources at SpaceX that his “concerns of retaliation were unsubstantiated.” Soon after, on January 9, 2025, he was fired, reportedly for “alleged deficient performance.” 

This isn't the first time that former employees at SpaceX have alleged mistreatment and retaliation from the company's management. In January 2024, the National Labor Relations Board accused SpaceX of illegally firing eight employees after they began to circulate a letter in 2022 calling for SpaceX to distance itself from Elon Musk's behavior and comments at the time, which included allegedly sexually harassing employees at the company. These employees have since filed their own lawsuit in California State Court against Musk. Musk has also fired employees at X, formerly Twitter, since taking over ownership of the social media company.

In speaking with The Independent, Altshuler's lawyers argue that his firing is a clear-cut case of discrimination against him for his disability, as well as an example of retaliation against him for trying to speak up about it. Altshuler has further claimed that he was often required to skip his meal breaks and work long hours without added pay. “The company's actions are egregious and in clear violation of the law. Mr. Altshuler intends to seek all legal remedies that are available to him,” Clive Pontusson, a former trial attorney for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, told The Independent.

Gizmodo reached out to SpaceX for comment regarding the lawsuit but did not hear back by the time of publication.

Tell me if this is you. You've got all your fancy gadgets, but only one measly outlet available. Deciding whether to juice up your phone or your laptop first—what a conundrum. Sure, you could plug one in and then trudge over to the next outlet across the room for the other, but that's just sheer madness. Who's got time for that nonsense? Save yourself the hassle and get a proper desktop that can handle all your devices at once. The Anker USB-C charging station is your knight in shining armor, boasting seven ports and a fast-charging capability for your phone, tablet, and laptop. Normally priced at $66, but guess what? You can snag it for a sweet $30 right now, thanks to a 55% discount. That's a cool $36 that gets to stay in your wallet.

See at Amazon

This charging block doesn't discriminate—it's compatible with a wide array of devices. Samsung phone? Check. JBL earbuds? Check. Apple watch? Check. The Anker desktop charging station flaunts seven charging ports: two USB-C, two USB-A, and three standard AC outlets. Using one USB-C port solo, it pumps out up to 65W of power. To put that more practically, a 2022 MacBook Pro will be able to charge about 17% faster using the Anker charging station versus using its original charger.

All the USB ports used together, you're looking at 90W max. When all are in use, the USB-A ports will produce 15W each while the two of the USB-C ports will output 20W for one and 30W for the other. And your devices are protected in real time with ActiveShield 2.0. It monitors the temperature over three million times per day to ensure your stuff isn't overheating.

This charging station is made for folks working at a desk with just too many different peripherals daisy chained together to stay charged. That's impractical. The Anker desktop charger has all four of its USB ports right in a row so you can manage your cables from your phone, laptop, and more all in one direction. Larger stuff you have that needs AC power is on the back so those cables can be seen behind your desk out of sight. No more tangled wires and no more cluttered desk.

For a limited time, you can secure yourself one of these Anker desktop chargers for $36 off. It's discounted at Amazon right now by 55%, which brings the price down from $66 to just $30.

On May 12, Samsung officially unveiled its latest innovation: the Galaxy S25 Edge, an ultra-slim smartphone that (once again) pushes the boundaries of mobile tech and design. Thin as 5.8mm and made from feather-light titanium, the S25 Edge is Samsung's thinnest phone yet but also among the most state-of-the-art in its field. For this launch, Samsung has an excellent pre-order offer where you can acquire the 512GB version for as low as $419 rather than the usual $1,219 – if you know how to stack up the existing deals.

Here's how you save. The Galaxy S25 Edge 512GB model retails at a normal price of $1,219 but during the pre-order window (until May 30, 2025), Samsung is running its popular “double the storage” offer: This is equivalent to being able to buy the 512GB model for the price of the 256GB one, instantly bringing the price down to $1,099. Samsung is also offering a $50 instant rebate which brings the price down to $1,049. The biggest savings come from Samsung's trade-in scheme: trade in a qualifying phone, and you can receive up to $630 credit toward your next S25 Edge. In the end, you can get a full $800 discount from the usual price, or well over 65% off.

See Galaxy S25 Edge at Samsung.com

First off, its ultra-slim build differentiates it from a sea of clunky flagships: it measures only 5.8mm thick and weighs a paltry 163 grams, the S25 Edge feels almost ridiculously light and thin in hand but its titanium construction gives it toughness and an air of high-endness. Samsung's design team has managed to achieve this without compromising on key features, and the S25 Edge is the most portable and stylish Galaxy S phone yet.

Second, the S25 Edge boasts a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate which unleashes vibrant colors deep blacks, and ultra-smooth scrolling. The near bezel-less design provides maximum screen real estate and Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 offers industry-leading scratch protection.

Third, the S25 Edge has the Snapdragon 8 Gen Elite chip paired with 12GB of RAM, which is the same elite configuration as found in the S25 Ultra. This delivers scorching-fast performance for gaming, and AI-driven features like improved photo editing and real-time translation.

Fourth, the camera hardware remains breathtaking: The 200MP main sensor produces crisp, sharp images, and Samsung's Galaxy AI brings new artistic potential with AI-powered scene awareness and photo editing capabilities. While less forgiving of alternative configurations than the Ultra's camera hardware, it still produces pro-level results for all but a few users.

Finally, the S25 Edge offers the latest connectivity and software: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, and Android 15 with One UI 7 give you a future-proof phone that's as fast and fluid as it is attractive. The battery, smaller than on the Ultra but still benefiting from Samsung's efficiency gains, should comfortably last you through a whole day with most users.

Thanks to Samsung's pre-order deal, this fantastic Galaxy S25 Edge is now an affordable option for hundreds of dollars less. If you want a phone that stops people in their tracks (and slips into any pocket with ease), there's never been a more desirable time to switch.

Most of what we've learned about Alien: Earth so far has been incredibly vague. There's an Alien, and it's on Earth, and that's… well, that's mostly about it. But we've just learned when we can expect to actually see it… and also a lot, lot more about its setting in the Alien timeline.

This morning FX and Hulu confirmed that Alien: Earth will premiere this August, alongside a bevy of new images from the show, which begin to lift the lid on the series' premise. Alien: Earth is set in 2120, just two years before the events of the original film, and follows life on Earth as it is dominated by the corporate interests of five governing companies: Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic, and Threshold. Each of those five corporations in racing to unlock the key to immortality, advancing human longevity through the development of synthetic life and cybernetics. But things heat up when Prodigy's CEO announces that the company has managed to synthesize those two fields and create the very first hybrid form of life: Wendy (played by Sydney Chandler), a human consciousness merged with a synthetic android body.

Wendy lives in Prodigy City, the company's all-encompassing HQ, alongside other hybrids, preparing to usher in a new age for humankind… which Weyland-Yutani doesn't like very much. So, in what can only be described as an extremely hostile corporate takeover, the company intentionally crashes one of its research vessels, the  USCSS Maginot, into Prodigy City, unleashing its surviving Xenomorph passenger, onto Wendy, the rest of the hybrids, and everyone else now trapped in Prodigy City. Oops!

As you can see in all the new preview images above, Alien: Earth has quite the cast, including Andor‘s Alex Lawther, the legendary Timothy Olyphant, and many more. Here's a full breakdown of the new cast and their roles (including one very interestingly named person at the end):

Alien: Earth begins on FX and Hulu August 12, with episodes streaming internationally on Disney+.

Apple is in the early stages of developing brain-computer interfaces that would allow people, especially those with mobility issues, to control their iPhones, iPads, and Vision Pro headsets with neural signals captured by a new kind of brain implant. 

According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple is partnering with Synchron—a privately held, New York City-based company backed by Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates—on the in project. The brain-computer interface, or BCI, industry is projected to grow significantly over the coming decades. Perhaps the best-known player in the space is Elon Musk's Neuralink, which, as of January, has successfully implanted its devices in three people.

Historically, most users have relied on both mechanical (through the use of a keyboard or mouse) and behavioral (through the use of touchscreens or voice) interaction with their computers. BCIs eliminate the need for physical movement, expanding device accessibility for people with profound physical impairments. 

Unlike Neuralink's N1 implant, Synchron's stent-like device, called the Stentrode, is implanted on top of the brain, not inside of it, which allows users to avoid an invasive open brain implant procedure. Once placed, the Stentrode works by using its electrodes to read brain signals and translate them into on-screen navigation and icon selection. 

Synchron's device works with switch control, a pre-existing accessibility feature in Apple's operating system that allows users to remotely control their Mac with an external adaptive device like a joystick or switch (or now, the Stentrode). Since 2019, Synchron has implanted the Stentrode in 10 people. 

The Journal visited Mark Jackson, a Pittsburgh resident who cannot travel outside his home due to ALS. Jackson tested the Stentrode with an Apple Vision Pro. With the headset on, he was transported to Switzerland, where he peered over the ledge of an alpine peak and felt his legs shake. 

Jackson noted that because he can't use the Stentrode to mimic moving a cursor with a mouse or a touchscreen with his fingers, navigation using the Stentrode is much slower than typical interaction with a computer or smartphone. It's also slower than using a computer with Neuralink's N1, which is able to capture much more brain data than Synchron's device, which uses many more electrodes than the Stentrode.

These latest developments in BCI technology come in anticipation of full FDA approval for the implants, which, the Journal notes, is not expected for several more years. 

In a press release, Dr. Tom Oxley, the CEO and co-founder of Synchron, praised Apple, saying that the company is “helping to pioneer a new interface paradigm, where brain signals are formally recognized alongside touch, voice, and typing. With BCI recognized as a native input for Apple devices, there are new possibilities for people living with paralysis and beyond.”

Galaxy S25 Edge is Samsung's latest addition to its flagship line, and it is the thinnest and lightest flagship smartphone the company has ever produced.

To celebrate its launch on May 12, 2025, Samsung is offering an exclusive pre-order deal that makes the S25 Edge even more desirable: Its 512GB version can be purchased at the cost of the 256GB model: $1,099 rather than the usual $1,219. That “double the storage” offer is a Samsung hallmark launch discount, and it saves early adopters big money from day one. On top of that, you get a further $50 knocked off (“instant credit” which drops the price to $1,049.

The savings don't stop there: If you take advantage of Samsung's trade-in offer, you can save up to $630 more which drops the net price of the Galaxy S25 Edge to just $419. Cumulatively, these launch offers together equate to a total of $800 in savings which is over 65% below the standard price. This is a great opportunity, and you won't find any better deals on this phone until probably Black Friday.

See at Samsung.com

Purchasing a Galaxy S25 Edge during the pre-order time can make you save a lot on Samsung accessories too. For example, the Galaxy Watch Ultra would cost you just $357 when it would cost $649 elsewhere, which is a discount of $300. Galaxy Buds3 Pro can be had at $109 versus $249. These accessory bargains are so good that if you actually resell them, you can reasonably expect to earn back most of the cost of your new S25 Edge.

See at Samsung.com

Technically, the Galaxy S25 Edge does not really compromise on performance despite its incredibly thin build. It boasts a 200MP camera sensor borrowed from the S25 Ultra that provides excellent photo and video quality (especially in dark environments) thanks to advanced AI enhancements. The display is similar to that of the Galaxy S25+ with vivid colors, deep blacks and a high refresh rate for ultra-smooth scrolling and gaming. The gadget runs on the current generation Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 – Elite chip which is the most advanced processor from Qualcomm.

Some compromises in design are made by Samsung in the S25 Edge: In the interest of going as slim as possible, the battery is also not as big as in the S25+ or the S25 Ultra, and the camera module is smaller. But these concessions are compensated for by the unique form factor of the phone and by the high-end materials used, which lead to the most comfortable and stylish S25 available. The S25 Edge is IP68 water- and dust-resistant, so functionality is not sacrificed for style.

Galaxy S25 Edge's intro deal is probably one of the best we've ever seen in history: double storage space for same dollars, savings up to $800 total, and deep reductions on accessories. With its really thin profile, the Galaxy S25 Edge is the perfect choice for anyone interested in a stylish phone – especially if you're not into foldable phones like the stylish Galaxy Z Flip 6.

But not with current CPUs?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Even though AMD's AM5 platform is designed to support all features of DDR5 memory modules, including CUDIMMs, the company's existing Ryzen 7000 cannot work with CUDIMMs at all, whereas Ryzen 8000, and Ryzen 9000-series CPUs do not fully support such modules. Nonetheless, AMD's AMD's AM5 infrastructure has everything to support clock unbuffered memory modules, according to Sourabh Dhir, product management lead for gaming and workstations, who spoke to Digital Trends.

As memory technology evolves, innovations include not only memory chips with a higher data transfer rate but also new DIMM technologies, such as CUDIMMs. In fact, JEDEC's standards presume that all memory modules featuring memory speeds of 6400 MT/s and higher are CUDIMMs (i.e., have a clock driver onboard to ensure cleaner signaling and stability at high transfer rates).

According to AMD, CUDIMM support does not require a platform overhaul: AM5 is already equipped with everything needed to support all kinds of DDR5 enhancements. However, it may take AMD another generation of CPUs to fully support CUDIMMs, as Sourabh Dhir did not explicitly say that AMD's existing or upcoming processors will officially support CUDIMMs at some point.

For now, Ryzen 7000-series processors are completely incompatible with CUDIMM memory modules: if installed, the system will fail to boot. By contrast, Ryzen 8000 and 9000 series CPUs can technically work with CUDIMMs, but only in a limited fallback configuration known as 'bypass mode', which ignores the clock driver chip on the module and, therefore, offers no advantage. This means that the system will start in DDR5-3200 mode and will require manual adjustment of the memory transfer rate, and therefore, there will be no performance guarantees.

It is noteworthy that MSI confirmed that AMD's Ryzen 8000 and 9000 series processors will support CUDIMM memory modules on X870 and X870E motherboards. MSI's overclocker Toppc explained that MSI's latest X870 mainboards feature enhanced signaling capabilities, which improve compatibility with high-frequency memory modules. While Ryzen 8000 and 9000 CPUs could operate with CUDIMMs, the full extent of supported memory speeds is still unannounced, and it is unclear whether AMD's implementation will match the performance levels seen on Intel's Arrow Lake-S, which already supports speeds of 9,200 MT/s and higher.

Achieving transfer rates around 10,000 MT/s still relies on heavily optimized setups with cherry-picked memory chips and increased voltages, which limits near-term mainstream use. CUDIMM modules are designed for officially rated speeds starting at 6,400 MT/s, but most high-end CUDIMM kits are intended for Intel's platform.

Sandisk's newest NVMe promises unparalleled performance


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Sandisk has just unveiled its brand new WD Black NVMe SSD, which it says is the world's fastest PCIe Gen 5.0 NVMe SSD on the market. The Sandisk WD Black SN8100 NVMe SSD promises speeds of up to 14,900MB/s and capacities of up to 8TB for gaming, content creation, and, of course, AI.

The company says the PCIe Gen 5.0 SSD is built for hardcore gamers. Not only is it rapid, but Sandisk says the Gen 5.0 model is 100% more power efficient than its PCIe Gen 4.0 SSD.

The new SN8100 also features Sandisk BiCS8 TLC 3D CBA NAND technology, which brings a lower profile and should improve thermal performance.

The spec listed sequential speeds for read and write are 14,900MB/s and 14,000MB/s, respectively, which would give our current best SSD for speed, the Crucial T705, a run for its money. Sandisk also promises 2,300,000 IOPS of random performance on the 2TB and 4TB models, all while averaging just 7W of power draw.

Coming later this fall will be a heatsink version for each capacity costing $20 more, and the 8TB versions are expected to be available later this year. The heatsink version offers a new integrated, low-profile passive cooling design built from anodized aluminum and also features customizable RGB LED.

Naturally, whether the SN8100 stacks up to its touted performance figure remains to be seen, but we'll be sure to bring you our performance results in our full review.

An AIB is reportedly preparing a dual-GPU variant of Intel's rumored Arc B580 24GB, totalling 48GB of VRAM on a single board, via VideoCardz. According to the source, this model is slated to be revealed at Computex 2025, which is just days away at this point. Specific details like the AIB, interconnect technology, and price are in the dark, but we can expect more details at the trade show, if the rumors are true.

This is the third leak that references a 24GB edition of the Arc B580, following EEC filings from Maxsun and an earlier slip-up from Sparkle. It's quite surprising that a GPU that's supposed to rival the RTX 4060 is getting a 24GB memory configuration. Many PCs don't even possess that much system memory. These cards are intended as a cost-effective solution for AI/ML developers, where similar capacity cards from AMD and Nvidia carry a steeper price tag. The most affordable Blackwell GPU with 24GB of memory is the RTX Pro 4000, costing over $1,500 based on preliminary listings.

An AIB is apparently doubling down on this approach by building a dual-GPU solution, housing two of these rumored 24GB B580 GPUs on a single PCB. Keep in mind, this product is reportedly a one-time design from the AIB, not a standard reference model from Intel.

Traditionally, multi-GPU setups nowadays, like Nvidia's B200 and Apple's M1 Ultra, rely on their own advanced interconnect solutions like NVLink and UltraFusion. While Intel does have Xe Link, it likely isn't compatible with the B580 and would be too costly for a one-off project. The most probable contender is a PCIe bridge linking the GPU's interfaces, allowing them to communicate through one slot.

Even so, the system will likely recognize the card as two separate GPUs. Some simulation programs where latency isn't a concern could potentially utilize all 48GB as one large resource. However, as the memory isn't pooled, using both GPUs for AI may require some optimizations on your end, including techniques like model parallelism and data parallelism.

With that in mind, don't expect this GPU to be cheap. My estimate puts it around $700-$800, which should still be significantly lower than the rumored $4,500 figure for Nvidia's RTX PRO 5000 Blackwell 48GB. However, you'd be sacrificing compute power and the convenience of a shared VRAM pool. Alternatively, you may consider mini-PCs or laptops powered by AMD's Strix Halo, with up to 128GB of unified memory.

Zen 5 family expands to new markets.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD on Tuesday introduced its Zen 5-based EPYC 4005-series processors aimed at entry-level uniprocessor servers for small businesses, edge deployments, and hosting providers. AMD's EPYC 4005-series 'Grado' CPUs come in an AM5 form factor and feature up to 16 cores and 32 threads in a bid to offer maximum performance within the framework of the default Windows Server 2025 license, which base price covers CPUs with up to 16 cores.

AMD's EPYC 4005-series processors resemble the company's Ryzen 9000 processors and therefore carry two eight-core Zen 5 core complex dies (CCDs) with 8 MB of L2 cache (1 MB per core) and 32 MB of unified L3 cache as well as one I/O die. In addition, the flagship EPYC 4585PX model features 64 MB of 3D V-Cache. All processors feature a dual-channel DDR5 memory controller that supports up to 192 GB of DDR5-5600 memory with ECC using two modules. As for power consumption, the CPUs are rated for 65W – 170W thermal design power, depending on the model.

When it comes to security, the new EPYC 'Grado' platform offers a dedicated processor with TrustZone compatibility and support for secure boot, TPM 2.0, and memory encryption capabilities.

Just like AMD's Ryzen 9000-series processors, EPYC 9005 processors feature 28 PCIe 5.0 lanes (four are used to connect to the chipset), software RAID 0, 1, 5, 10; DisplayPort 2.0; HDMI 2.1; USB 20G Type-C; and optional USB4.

""Growing businesses and dedicated hosters often face significant constraints around budget, complexity, and deployment timelines,"" said Derek Dicker, corporate vice president, Enterprise and HPC Business Group, AMD. ""With the latest AMD EPYC 4005 series CPUs, we are delivering the right balance of performance, simplicity, and affordability, giving our customers and system partners the ability to deploy enterprise-class solutions that solve everyday business challenges.""

AMD aims its EPYC 4005 CPUs at diverse workloads, from small businesses, branch, and storage servers to dedicated systems for tasks like video editing, code compilation, cloud gaming, and e-commerce. Essentially, EPYC 4005-series processors can be used for all performance-demanding tasks that also require robust security and extended availability.

AMD itself compares its EPYC 4005-series 'Grado' processors to Intel's Xeon E-2400 and Xeon 6300P-series CPUs that only offer up to eight cores. As a result, AMD's offerings provide tangibly higher performance across the board. Performance benchmarks conducted by AMD using the Phoronix test suite show that AMD's 16-core EPYC 4565P outperforms Intel's eight-core Xeon 6369P by a factor of 1.83. Despite the performance gap, the 4565P is priced lower at $589 compared to $606 for the Intel CPU. Other advantages include DDR5-5600 support and larger L3 cache.

Potentially the worst CPU bottleneck in computing history.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia's newest drivers no longer require the system CPU to support the POPCNT instruction. We don't know why this change has been made, however, there are some fascinating implications regarding what you might call mismatched hardware. For example, tech enthusiast Bob Pony observed that due to this driver change, ""you could possibly pair an [Nvidia GeForce] RTX 5090 with [an Intel] Core 2 Duo."" We'd like to see it, and surely we will see this exact scenario tested by a TechTuber, shortly.

UPDATE: Recent NVIDIA drivers no longer require the POPCNT CPU instruction, this means old CPUs such as the Intel Core 2 Duo will be able to install the latest NVIDIA drivers without any issues.And yes, that also means you could possibly pair an RTX 5090 with Core 2 Duo now. 😏 https://t.co/6GwpG9RrMP pic.twitter.com/v8h4eduVH5May 12, 2025

In Pony's screenshot (unfurl the post embedded above) you can see what appears to be an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650 processor powered system running a version of Windows 11 Pro. That alone might need some system hacking shenanigans. However, Pony asserts that the latest Nvidia driver, version 576.40 which was released just yesterday, now plays nicely with systems packing old Core 2 Duo CPUs (introduced 2006) which lack POPCNT support.

The tech enthusiast included a post later in the thread to show that Nvidia didn't support system CPUs lacking the POPCNT instruction when he checked last August. In fact, unfortunate users trying such an installation might face a 'soft brick' and have to wait through a number of boot loops before being able to recover Windows startup.

POPCNT is a CPU instruction and a short form derived from Population Count. Processors use it to determine how many bits are actively set in a given binary number. Notably, it is part of the SSE4.2 instruction set. Given that you have to go back more than a decade and a half to find processors without native POPCNT support, it doesn't really concern anyone who wants a practical workmanlike PC for typical 2025 workloads.

POPCNT may seem like an obscure processor instruction, but it has been in the news previously, with popular software insisting upon it being supported by the system CPU. Case in point - Microsoft's Windows 11 24H2 introduced a requirement for POPCNT hardware support. That change came to light around a year ago, and alongside other requirements such as tech as secure boot and TPM support, it ruled out a host of older CPU generations from official Windows 11 OS compatibility.

In many OLED gaming monitor reviews, I've spoken about their consistent performance and image quality. It's hard to find a bad one; nearly all deliver a premium game experience with a gorgeous, colorful picture. Unfortunately, they are also consistently expensive. In the 27-inch QHD 240 Hz category, you can expect to pay at least $550 to 600, with the best OLED gaming monitors approaching $800.

I'm not here to tell you that AOC has smashed price barriers, but its newest QD-OLED, the Q27G4ZD, is a bit less damaging to one's wallet, selling for $469 at this writing. You won't find many OLED prices that start with a four, so that is progress. Let's take a look.

Despite only being slightly less expensive than its competitors, the Q27G4ZD is a value bomb. The panel is QHD 2560x1440 resolution running at a native (not overclocked) 240 Hz. It also has Quantum Dot technology, and my tests show that it covers over 108% of the DCI-P3 color gamut thanks to some bonus red and green. It is colorful, to say the least. It also includes G-Sync and FreeSync, with seamless operation observed in my tests. It also has USB ports, something rarely seen on budget displays.

So, what are the sacrifices? Nothing is missing here unless LED lighting and internal speakers are essential to you. The Q27G4ZD is full featured with DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, a headphone jack, a solid and adjustable stand, premium build quality and styling; gaming aids like reticles, sniper mode, timers, and frame counters.

One thing I did not find here was variable brightness. Is that a big deal? That depends on your environment and expectations. When an OLED has variable brightness, output levels change based on content. This makes for bright highlights, but black levels do not change. Since it's an OLED, contrast is the same whether you have variable brightness or not. For SDR content, it doesn't matter. But when you want the most from HDR content, variable brightness lends some extra pop.

The Q27G4ZD renders the same brightness peak regardless of signal format or content type. But it still looks amazing since its black levels are infinite and color is highly saturated. And like all OLEDs, its gaming feel is at the next level. 240 Hz is well above the threshold needed for blur-free motion. And QHD resolution presents a lighter load for video cards, so you'll have less trouble maintaining 240fps in your favorite games. There is no black frame insertion or anti-flicker feature, but in my time with the Q27G4ZD, I saw no need for either option.

On paper, the price/performance ratio here is exceptionally high. The Q27G4ZD doesn't represent a massive price drop, but its cost of $469 at this writing is around $100 less than its closest competitors. You can buy a nice gaming mouse with that.

The Q27G4ZD comes in a clamshell box that opens to reveal its contents packed securely in molded pulp rather than crumbly foam. Up first is a nice cable bundle with HDMI, DisplayPort, USB and IEC for the internal power supply. There's a small base, then you'll find the upright and panel underneath. Everything unites without tools. The panel snaps on, or you can use the 100mm VESA mount for an aftermarket arm or bracket with the included fasteners.

I rarely see a new styling element on a computer monitor, but AOC has managed one with its offset cable hole. It's a tiny thing, but it's cool, nonetheless. I saw the same thing in my review of the CQ27G4ZH a few weeks ago. I like it because you can't see behind it when sitting in front of the Q27G4ZD. It's trimmed in red like the mounting point in back, which features a large red ring.

The back features angular styling, and you won't find a curve or taper anywhere. It's a great gaming monitor look that whispers rather than screams for attention. A small “AOC Gaming” logo is the only other indicator of the Q27G4ZD's purpose.

The side view in the above photo doesn't show the Q27G4ZD's surprise attribute, USB ports. There are two version 3.2 ports on the right side, two more on the bottom, and an upstream port as well for full hub functionality. However, there's no KVM in the OSD.

The stand is solid and fully adjustable with 5.1 inches of height, 30 degrees swivel, 5/23 degrees tilt, and a 90-degree portrait mode. Movements are very firm with no play or wobble. This is a quality piece for sure, with a rugged build and premium fit and finish.

The bottom input panel features one DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 ports. You also get one upstream and two downstream USBs to complement the two on the right side of the panel. A 3.5mm jack accommodates headphones or powered speakers with volume and mute in the OSD. There are no internal speakers.

The Q27G4ZD's OSD is loaded with features for gaming and convenience. It departs from AOC's traditional ribbon menu and presents a more familiar tree with three columns. Signal info is always displayed up top and button functions are at the bottom. I missed having a joystick, but the four control buttons get the job done.

The Q27G4ZD has seven picture modes, which you won't need to change if you stick with the default, Standard. It's nearly perfect out of the box, as the included calibration data sheet, and my measurements, attest. Additional options in the Game Setting menu include Shadow Control to brighten dark areas, Adaptive-Sync toggle, Dial Point (aiming point), Sniper Scope with three magnification levels and a Frame Counter that can live in any corner of the screen. The aiming point can be of fixed color or dynamic to shift in contrast with the background.

The Picture menu contains full calibration controls with five gamma presets, three color temps, and a user mode with RGB sliders. You can also select between Native, sRGB, and DCI-P3 color spaces. Native covers 108% of DCI-P3 and is the only way to keep other picture adjustments available. sRGB and DCI-P3 are very accurate, but only allow brightness changes.

There's also Eco Adjustment, which is another set of picture modes. Combined with the Gaming Mode, it can yield dozens of possibilities. Stick with Standard and Standard for best results.

The Q27G4ZD includes three HDR emulation modes that can alter SDR content to look like HDR. It's reasonably effective but does depart from industry standards for gamma. They enhance some content, but should be used with personal preference in mind rather than accuracy. When an HDR10 signal appears, you get two additional modes, Display HDR and Peak HDR. Despite their names, they both render the same peak output, around 250 nits. Peak HDR alters the luminance curve to give the picture more verve but crushes some shadow detail in the process. Display HDR tracks very well, and I'll tell you more about it on page five.

AOC takes the Q27G4ZD's OLED panel care very seriously with eight different settings that can be used altogether, all turned off, or in any combination desired. I only use pixel orbiting for my OLED screens, which have never shown signs of burn-in. Pixel Refresh is useful when run every few days to ensure even wear of the panel's pixel structure.

The Q27G4ZD comes out of the box in Standard mode with no serious need for calibration. It can be enjoyed as is, though neutral tones are a tad warm. A few tweaks of the RGB sliders bring the numbers to reference level. Gamma measured a tad light, but the presets are too far apart to get it right on 2.2. I settled for 2.15, which still looks awesome. In all cases, color is spot on with a little extra red and green that makes the picture vibrant and lively. If you need sRGB or a more exact DCI-P3, those modes are provided but without calibration control. HDR color and luminance track very close to standard in the default Display HDR mode. My SDR settings are below.

The Q27G4ZD delivers the saturated and contrasty picture you'd expect from a premium QD-OLED. Reds and greens are particularly vivid, and you can tell the difference right away when comparing them to a non-QD OLED or a wide gamut LCD. The image is super crisp, even though it's QHD. 109ppi pixel density is plenty for a 27-inch screen and I had little trouble making out the finest details in text and graphics alike.

Video processing is also on par with other OLEDs. I often talk about their consistency and that means you won't get better motion resolution or faster response just because you spend more money. The Q27G4ZD is a little less expensive than the competition but gives nothing away regarding performance and gaming feel.

QHD resolution makes high frame rates easy to achieve and I never saw anything but 240fps in the games I played. The Q27G4ZD lacks extra features like anti-flicker and black frame insertion, but they were not missed. Control response is perceptually free of lag, and I expect there will be no gamer who doesn't like this monitor. Like any OLED, it's capable of next-level gameplay.

I noted that HDR content was slightly undersaturated in red. This was confirmed in my tests, which you can check out on page five. Even though the Q27G4ZD is fully capable of going beyond 100% red in the DCI-P3 color space, it doesn't quite get there in HDR mode. It would be good for AOC to address this with a firmware update. It didn't reduce my enjoyment, however. The picture was stunning no matter what I put on the screen, from the icy cold worlds of Doom Eternal to the lush jungles of Tomb Raider, everything was rendered beautifully.

I've already mentioned the Q27G4ZD's lack of a variable brightness option. This didn't impact my use experience at all. It isn't a super bright example of the category, but it has more than enough light output. For daily use and gaming, I didn't need to max the brightness slider to see a vivid picture. HDR had plenty of impact but there, it would be nice to have the extra pop in highlights afforded by variable brightness.

Physically, the Q27G4ZD gives nothing away to its more expensive competition. Styling is game forward but not look-at-me. The bits of red trim are just enough to make it work aesthetically. Even though it's a budget screen, AOC didn't skimp on the stand, it's solid and fully adjustable. And the extra side USB ports are a nice bonus that few monitors include today.

Takeaway: The Q27G4ZD represents one of the best values in the OLED monitor category. It has enough brightness, pixel density and color saturation to match image quality with the very best and, in some cases, for half the price. Gaming is a blast, and daily use is a pleasure. It truly doesn't get much better in the 27-inch category.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Diabetes and weight loss drug semaglutide may also treat liver disease","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diabetes-weight-loss-drug-semaglutide-ozempic-may-also-treat-liver-disease","Tue, 13 May 2025 11:15:51 GMT","

The use of semaglutide, a medication from the class of GLP-1 receptor agonists, has become increasingly popular. The brands Rybelsus and Ozempic are currently FDA-approved for diabetes management, and Wegovy is used to assist with weight loss. 

Experts are also interested in other uses of semaglutide. A recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine furthered research on semaglutide, exploring how the drug affected outcomes for people with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, a type of liver disease.

The results suggest that semaglutide may help resolve steatohepatitis and decrease fibrosis. 

This research was a phase 3 clinical trial involving people with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). As described in this study, MASH is a severe type of what used to be called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. 

The study also notes that MASH involves damage to liver cells, inflammation, and steatosis or fat buildup in the liver. Steatohepatitis, which involves fat buildup and inflammation in the liver, can then contribute to tissue scarring or fibrosis. 

This study involved participants from hundreds of clinical sites in thirty-seven countries. The current published results report the end of the first part of the trial. 

Among the participants, 534 received semaglutide, and 266 received a placebo. The research reported in this study lasted 72 weeks. Participants received 2.4mg injections of semaglutide each week, and they followed a 16-week dose escalation schedule. 

All participants were at least 18 years old and had steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Researchers excluded participants who had other chronic liver problems besides nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Other exclusion criteria included components like alcohol consumption over a certain amount and use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the three months leading up to screening. All participants also received standard care for MASH. Participants got two liver biopsies to help evaluate the effects of semaglutide.

About 56% of participants had type 2 diabetes, and about 73% had obesity. 

The researchers evaluated participants for two main outcomes: resolution of steatohepatitis, where liver fibrosis didn't get worse, and improved fibrosis, where steatohepatitis did not get any worse. Researchers also evaluated participants for weight changes, pain, adverse events, and labs. 

Semaglutide appeared to benefit participants more than the placebo. Almost 63% of participants who received semaglutide had steatohepatitis resolution without their fibrosis getting worse. Only 34.3% of participants in the placebo group experienced this outcome.

Additionally, 36.8% of participants who received semaglutide experienced decreases in liver fibrosis without their steatohepatitis getting worse, compared to 22.4% in the placebo group. Results were similar in sensitivity analyses that considered components like age, diabetes, and how bad fibrosis was. 

Additionally, some participants experienced steatohepatitis resolution and decreased fibrosis. About 33% of the semaglutide group experienced this compared to about 16% in the placebo group. 

The semaglutide group also experienced an average 10.5% decrease in body weight compared to only an average 2% decrease in the placebo group. While it did not reach statistical significance, participants taking semaglutide also appeared to experience pain decreases more than the placebo group. 

Participants in the semaglutide group had better outcomes from non-invasive testing as well. For example, more participants taking semaglutide experienced decreased enhanced liver fibrosis scores and decreased liver stiffness than participants on the placebo.

Other outcomes were better in the semaglutide group, too, such as greater decreases in systemic inflammation and cholesterol, as well as better insulin sensitivity. 

Around 86% of participants in the semaglutide group reported an adverse event, compared to about 80% in the placebo group. The semaglutide group also experienced more gastrointestinal events, like nausea and constipation, than the placebo group. However, researchers found that “no new or liver-related safety signals emerged.” 

Overall, the results of this study indicate that semaglutide may help improve liver outcomes for people with MASH. However, it does have limitations. 

First, the research only included a small number of Black participants, as well as a low number of lean participants. There may be a need for more diversity in future research, and it's unclear how the use of semaglutide benefits lean individuals with MASH. Researchers did not have data on biomarkers for alcohol consumption. They also acknowledge that genetic variations are part of what determines how someone responds to treatment. 

This particular trial is ongoing and will have additional follow-up that will focus on cirrhosis-free survival. Thus, researchers did not share some information about clinical outcomes in this paper for reasons of study integrity. This part of the study included 800 randomized participants, and this did not have to do with how well participants were following taking semaglutide or the placebo or certain medication changes. Additionally, there was some missing data. 

Researchers acknowledge that semaglutide helped to address problems of metabolic dysfunction that drive liver problems and holistically helped address “liver disease and associated cardiometabolic illness.” 

It's possible that the findings of this research are the result of weight loss. Mir Ali, MD, board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, who was not involved in the study, noted the following to Medical News Today: 

“This study showed a reduction of MASH with semaglutide use; however, because the greatest contributor to MASH is obesity, I believe this is more a function of weight loss than a direct effect of the medication. We see significant improvement in MASH in our surgical weight loss patients, and it seems to be directly related to the amount of weight lost. The clinical implications are that this shows another benefit to weight loss associated with use of semaglutide.”

This research holds promise for helping people with MASH and suggests another potential benefit of semaglutide. 

Ian Storch, DO, an osteopathic physician specializing in gastroenterology and internal medicine and an American Osteopathic Association member, who was also not involved in the study, explained to MNT: 

“MASH (Metabolic Associated Hepatitis) is such an important disease, which didn't get much attention in the past for two reasons, one being our deficiency in cost-effective noninvasive imaging modalities to assess fibrosis and the second being our lack of treatment modalities. The study in the NEJM showing possible benefits of semaglutide in MASH patients with advanced inflammation and fibrosis is another exciting advance in our efforts to conquer this indolent, but deadly disease.”

 May 13, 2025  

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the world's first low-carbon version of a triple-combination inhaler for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

The new formulation of Trixeo Aerosphere replaces the traditional propellant, HFA-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), with HFO-1234ze(E) (trans-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene), a fluorinated gas with near-zero global warming potential. 

The MHRA said the new propellant is “safe and effective.”

Pressurised metered-dose inhalers account for 70% of all inhaled medicine use in the UK. Their emissions make up around 3% of the NHS's total carbon footprint.

According to the manufacturer, AstraZeneca, the new propellant offers a 99.9% reduction in global warming potential compared with the original version. This brings it in line with dry powder inhalers, which do not require propellants.

Preclinical studies funded by AstraZeneca found that HFO-1234ze was not genotoxic and had no effects on male or female reproduction.

The new propellant is used solely for drug delivery and does not alter the active ingredients of Trixeo Aerosphere. The inhaler contains a fixed triple therapy of:

It is indicated for adults with moderate to severe COPD who are not adequately controlled with dual therapy. The recommended use is two puffs twice daily, as a long-term maintenance treatment to improve COPD symptoms of shortness of breath, wheezing, and cough, and to prevent exacerbations.

Julian Beach, interim executive director for healthcare quality and access at the MHRA, said in a press release that inhalers are “a cornerstone of COPD treatment” but that their propellants contribute to emissions. 

Beach said that the approval supported the continued availability of a widely used COPD treatment ""while enabling a transition to inhalers with a lower carbon footprint, without compromising on safety, quality, or clinical benefit.""

The MHRA estimates that 1.2 million people in the UK are living with COPD. It is the second most common cause of emergency hospital admissions. 

According to the NHS, most of those affected are middle-aged or older smokers.

Common side effects of Trixeo Aerosphere include oral candidiasis, anxiety, sleep disturbances, nausea, headache, cough, muscle cramps, palpitations, and hyperglycaemia. 

Pneumonia has been reported in 4.6% of users and urinary tract infections in 2.7%.

Patients and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report adverse reactions through the MHRA's Yellow Card scheme.

The new formulation of Trixeo Aerosphere is expected to be available in the UK in the second half of 2025. The current version will remain on the market until then.

The patient information leaflet and summary of product characteristics will be updated ahead of the launch.

Restricting eating to an 8-hour window for 3 months improved weight loss in patients with overweight or obesity for at least a year, regardless of the timing of the eating window, according to preliminary results of a randomized controlled trial.

The strategy, called time-restricted eating (TRE), limits when — but not what — an individual eats on a daily basis.

“A key point of this study is that the timing of the 8-hour eating window may not be as critical as previously thought, suggesting flexibility in implementation,” Jonatan Ruiz, PhD, of the University of Granada, Granada, Spain, and the Spanish Biomedical Research Centre in Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition in Madrid, Spain, told Medscape Medical News.

The study, presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO) 2025 in Málaga, Spain, is an extension of an earlier randomized controlled trial that showed benefits of TRE at three different schedules over the short term (12-week follow-up).

Ruiz and colleagues conducted the 12-month follow-up in 99 adults with overweight or obesity (50% women; average age, 49 years; average BMI, 32) from Granada. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups for 12 weeks: Habitual eating window of ≥ 12 hours; early TRE (8-hour eating window starting before 10:00 AM); late TRE (8-hour eating window starting after 1 PM); or self-selected TRE (allowing participants to choose their own 8-hour eating window).

All groups also took part in a Mediterranean diet education program to encourage healthy eating.

Researchers measured body weight and waist and hip circumferences at the start of the trial, after the 12-week intervention, and 12 months after the intervention ended.

After the intervention, the habitual eating group experienced an average weight loss of –1.4 kg (–1.5%). All TRE groups achieved significantly greater weight loss: An average of –4.2 kg (–4.5%) in the early TRE group, –3.1 kg (–3.5%) in the late group, and –3.8 kg (–3.9%) in the self-selected group.

In addition, the habitual eating group had a lower waist circumference (–1.1 cm) and hip circumference (–1.4 cm) after 12 weeks of intervention.

In comparison, the early TRE group experienced significantly greater reductions in waist and hip circumferences (average, –4.1 and –4.6 cm, respectively).

The late TRE group also achieved a significant reduction in waist circumference (average, –4.1 cm), but there was no significant reduction in hip circumference (average, –3.2 cm).

The self-selected TRE group also achieved reductions in waist and hip circumferences (average, –3.7 and –3.6 cm, respectively), although the reductions were not significant.

One possible explanation for the less robust response in the self-selected group, Ruiz said, “is that allowing participants to choose their own eating window may have led to greater variability in timing, potentially reducing the consistency of the fasting window. This is just a hypothesis we plan to explore further in future studies.”

At 12 months after the intervention ended, preliminary results reveal that the habitual eating group had an average body weight increase of 0.4 kg (+0.5%). By contrast, both the early TRE and the late TRE groups maintained significantly greater weight loss (average, –2.1% [−2.2 kg] and –2.0% [−2.0 kg], respectively).

The self-selected TRE group also maintained greater body weight loss than the habitual eating group (average, –0.7% [−0.7 kg]), although the change was not statistically significant.

Furthermore, the habitual eating group showed an increase in waist circumference of +1.8 cm at 12 months and a slight increase of +0.03 cm in hip circumference.

In comparison, both waist and hip circumferences remained significantly lower in the late TRE group (average, –5.6 and –3.4 cm, respectively) than the habitual eating group. And, although not statistically significant, the early TRE group and self-selected TRE group also showed lower values in waist (average, –0.5 and –1.3 cm, respectively) and hip circumferences (average, –1.0 and –1.8 cm, respectively).

“This makes TRE a potentially attractive, low-cost, and sustainable strategy to support weight management — particularly for patients who struggle with strict calorie counting or rigid diet plans,” Ruiz said. “However, longer and larger trials are needed to confirm these findings across different populations.”

The team's next steps include combining TRE with exercise, he noted. “We are currently finalizing the last measurements, and we are eager to see the outcomes.”

“One general note of caution on TRE protocols is that altering the opportunities to eat and the potential for meal skipping may compromise the nutritional adequacy of the diet,” Adam Collins, PhD, associate professor of nutrition, University of Surrey, Surrey, England, said in expert commentary in a press release on the presentation.

“This may be an issue for those whose diet was marginally nutritionally replete to start with,” he said. “To this end, we are midway through a study exploring the impact of TRE specifically on eating behavior and nutritional adequacy of people's diets.”

Regarding the finding that the self-selected group didn't manage to keep weight off as successfully, he noted, “It is possible that following the more regimented early and late TRE created more sustainable changes in eating behavior and dietary habits that remained after the intervention.”

Maria Chondronikola, PhD, principal investigator and lead for Human Nutrition, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, commented, “It is important to note this study did not include a caloric restriction group, and therefore, its results cannot be directly compared with other weight loss strategies that involve intentional caloric restriction.”

“Furthermore, additional information on participant adherence to the prescribed eating windows is crucial,” she said. “Understanding how well participants adhered to the timing of their meals, the level of their caloric intake, and whether TRE changed any obesity-related metabolic outcomes would provide valuable insight into the true effectiveness of TRE.”

Ruiz told Medscape Medical News that “adherence was high (85%-88%)” and that “no serious adverse events were reported.”

Ruiz and Collins declared no relevant interests. Chondronikola is currently leading an intervention study on the effects of TRE on cardiometabolic health in the United Kingdom and globally.

Recently announced federal funding cuts for asthma care in high-risk areas in Massachusetts highlight the short- and long-term effect of the dissolution of support programs for public health at the community level.

The nearly $1 million in funding from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Department of Public Health (DPH) was intended to “support in-home environmental remediations, such as mold removal and improved ventilation,” according to a statement from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

“The loss of this funding is critically significant for the individuals enrolled in the program,” said a spokesperson for the Massachusetts DPH in an interview. “The termination of this funding will negatively impact opportunities to replicate and expand this model to other communities,” the spokesperson added.

In the short-term, “the funding was intended to improve asthma outcomes for individuals and families by creating asthma-friendly conditions at home and helping individuals enrolled in the program better manage their asthma,” the spokesperson told Medscape Medical News. In the long term, the funding was intended to address housing quality issues and increase awareness among residents and community organizations about environmental health and the effect of indoor air quality on asthma management and control, the spokesperson said.

A recent report from the American Lung Association gave Hampden County, Massachusetts, a grade of C on air quality. “The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) looked at a variety of factors beyond only air quality to select a partner organization in this work, including overall asthma burden in the communities where this work would occur, with an emphasis on Massachusetts' Environmental Justice Communities,” according to the spokesperson. Revitalize Community Development Corporation in Springfield, Massachusetts, was selected as a partner organization.

The state was relying on the federal funding to implement the program, the spokesperson told Medscape Medical News. “The state is not able to replace the millions of dollars in federal funding being terminated by the Trump Administration,” the spokesperson said. However, “we remain committed to continuing our efforts to improve air quality and reduce respiratory illnesses and asthma, including through enhanced air monitoring, strong public health protections from pollution, and planting more trees in urban areas,” the spokesperson added.

For patients with asthma who live in high-risk locations with poor air quality and other environmental factors, clinicians should continue to treat patients in alignment with the latest guidelines the spokesperson said. This includes discussing environmental factors and triggers in controlling asthma symptoms, raising patient awareness of the short- and long-term effects of poor air quality on asthma, and helping them build strategies to mitigate these effects, the spokesperson added.

In women with uterine fibroids (UFs), pain relief with linzagolix was largely driven by a reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), with a smaller contribution from a reduction in fibroid volume (FV). Hormonal add-back therapy (ABT) also affected these effects.

""This analysis showed that reductions in pain were significantly mediated by reductions in HMB (all doses) and FV (200 mg alone) in linzagolix-treated women with UFs. Further research is needed to identify additional mediating factors,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Sven Becker, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany. It was published online on May 06, 2025, in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology.

This study could not explain all proportions of pain reduction, suggesting the need to explore other contributing factors. Pooling data from two trials might introduce bias, despite adjustments for factors like race and age. Pain was assessed globally as perceived by patients rather than by symptom type/location, which may have obscured the role of different pain types in the observed outcomes.

The PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 trials were funded by ObsEva. The current analysis was funded by Theramex. Several authors reported being employees and receiving honoraria from the funding agency and from various other sources.

In a 4.3-year follow-up study, few asymptomatic patients with preclinical left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) progressed to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with a higher incidence noted in women. High blood pressure and decreased kidney function were associated with elevated levels of N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).

""High blood pressure and decreased kidney function were associated with higher levels of NT-proBNP. This highlights the need to further explore cardiorenal protection as a method to prevent HFpEF,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Anne Margje Lisa Naomi van Ommen, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands. It was published online on May 04, 2025, in Open Heart.

The moderate sample size resulted in insufficient power to draw definitive conclusions about sex differences. A potential risk for measurement biases existed. The relatively low prevalence of comorbidities and the potential selection bias towards healthier individuals may have limited the generalisability of the findings.

This study received financial support from the Dutch CardioVascular Alliance, supported by the Dutch Heart Foundation. The authors declared having no competing interests.

In older patients, elevated blood pressure is often observed during visits to general practitioners. However, if it is not measurable, this should raise particular concerns. If a psychotic episode also occurs, prompt action is needed.

Bastien Picut and his colleagues at Valais Hospital in Sion, Switzerland, reported an unusual case of a 60-year-old woman with decompensated metabolic syndrome and psychosis caused by a typical adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC; adrenocortical oncocytic neoplasm, ACON).

The woman presented to the hospital with symptoms of refractory arterial hypertension, accompanied by dizziness, headaches, and asthenia, and a weight gain of 20 kg within a span of 6 months. Despite maximal antihypertensive therapy, her systolic blood pressure remained at approximately 160 mmHg.

Examination revealed the onset of type 2 diabetes, requiring immediate insulin, and mixed hyperlipidaemia associated with hypokalaemia and hypernatremia. While hospitalised under geriatric care, the patient experienced a psychotic breakdown characterised by persecutory delirium, noncritical visual hallucinations, and mistrust of contacts associated with anxiety.

A comprehensive laboratory analysis was performed. Liver function tests were abnormal, with significantly elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Additionally, hypernatremia (149 mmol/L) was noted (normal range, 135-145 mmol/L). The calcium and ammonia levels were normal at 2.31 mmol/L and 36 μmol/L, respectively. 

Urine analysis revealed proteinuria, ketonuria, urobilinogen, and haematuria. The levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and urinary catecholamines, including metanephrine, normetanephrine, and methoxytyramine, were marginally elevated. 

Following the initial evaluation, an ultrasound was performed, revealing a large, bilobed retro-pancreatic mass near the left kidney and para-aortic region. Subsequent abdominal CT confirmed a bilobed left adrenal mass measuring 8 × 5 cm and 1.8 × 2.2 cm, which was vascularised without calcifications. The CT scan ruled out the presence of any locoregional or distant spread of the disease.

The differential diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was considered. Radiological findings and elevated urinary metanephrines, suggesting the secretion of catecholamine precursors. No other causes for the elevated urinary catecholamines were identified.

Prior to the intervention, the patient was medically managed with haloperidol (1 mg orally three times daily) and clomethiazole (192 mg orally twice daily as needed) for psychiatric decompensation. For diabetes management, metformin 500 mg orally three times daily, linagliptin 5 mg orally, and insulin glargine 30U subcutaneously were administered. Hypertension was managed with metoprolol (50 mg), spironolactone (25 mg), lisinopril (20 mg), and doxazosin (4 mg) orally.

Subsequently, laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed without intraoperative complications. The patient required adrenergic support until the fourth postoperative day. Additionally, all antihypertensive medications were discontinued, except for beta blockers.

This is the first ACON case described in the literature with such an atypical clinical presentation, according to the authors. Psychotic manifestations of ACC have been previously described; however, they are associated with cortisol-secreting ACC as part of Cushing syndrome.

Furthermore, the doctors could not conclusively determine whether the tumour was a pure non-secreting ACON. The clinical presentation resembled Cushing syndrome, and hypokalaemia could be attributed to vasospasm from secondary hyperaldosteronism.

Aldosterone secretion from the tumour could not be clearly assessed due to the ongoing use of antihypertensive medications (beta blockers, spironolactone, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). This may have affected the aldosterone-renin ratio, leading to a potentially false-negative assessment.

The variable clinical presentation and the lack of sensitivity and specificity of preoperative diagnostic procedures, such as imaging in aggressive malignant diseases, make adrenocortical oncocytic neoplasms a significant challenge for clinicians.

 May 13, 2025  

Five years after the legalization of cannabis in Canada, cannabis use frequency has risen slightly, and cannabis misuse has decreased, new data suggested.

A prospective cohort study of 1428 adults indicated that the mean proportion of days using cannabis increased by 0.35% annually and by 1.75% over 5 years. Cannabis misuse decreased annually (β = −0.08) and over 5 years (β = −0.4). Prelegalization use frequency influenced the use and misuse of cannabis after legalization.

“It is important to note that both effect sizes were quite small, so we are looking at modest changes,” lead author André J. McDonald, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, told Medscape Medical News. “Still, our finding that cannabis use frequency increased is concerning from a public health perspective.”

The study was published on April 23 in JAMA Network Open.

“The hypothesis, based on previous studies, was that cannabis use and misuse had increased in the adult population,” said McDonald. “It is important to place this [study] within the broader literature, which predominantly suggests that cannabis use and misuse have increased. This, however, is a different study design, and so it gives a more nuanced description of what those trends are over time.” The current study's longitudinal design enables distinctions in use and misuse within subsets of the study population, he added.

The investigators asked participants about the proportion of days that they used cannabis in the past 6 months to determine cannabis use frequency. They employed the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test–Revised (CUDIT-R) scale to determine cannabis misuse. Prelegalization cannabis use frequency, age, and sex were examined as moderators of these two outcomes. Secondary endpoints included changes in cannabis product preferences over time.

“Amongst those who were using frequently before legalization, we did not see an increase in their use or misuse,” said McDonald. “A positive [outcome] is that legalization did not exacerbate some of those issues. If anything, we found that for those who were using frequently before legalization, generally, their cannabis use and misuse decreased over time.”

Investigators observed annual changes of −5.26% in the proportion of days using and −0.63 in the CUDIT-R score among prelegalization daily users.

The researchers observed that the decline in cannabis misuse primarily occurred among younger people. The CUDIT-R score changed by −0.12 in participants younger than 30 years.

“There is a typical pattern where problematic substance use peaks in early adulthood and then gradually discontinues,” said McDonald. “That is consistent with what we saw in our cohort.”

Investigators observed that participants' cannabis product preferences shifted. There were statistically significant decreases in the use of dried flower, solid concentrate, liquid concentrates, cannabis oil, tinctures, topical ointments, and hashish. They also found statistically significant increases in the use of edibles, liquids, and cannabis oil cartridges or disposable vape pens, noted McDonald.

The most pronounced decline was in dried flower use, with a 3.56% annual decrease in prevalence among active cannabis users (from 81.3% before legalization to 64.6% at 5 years postlegalization). The most pronounced increase was in the use of cannabis oil cartridges or disposable vape pens, with a 3.39% annual increase in prevalence among active cannabis users (from 18.4% before legalization to 33.0% at 5 years postlegalization).

“It could be viewed positively, in that people are transitioning away from the combustible products,” said McDonald. He noted, however, that some vape products have high tetrahydrocannabinol content.

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Sameer Imtiaz, PhD, staff scientist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health's Institute for Mental Health Policy Research and assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, Toronto, remarked that categorizing users by cannabis use and comparing patterns of use before and after legalization is noteworthy. Imtiaz did not participate in the research.

“The findings are novel and interesting,” said Imtiaz. “Specifically, the moderating role of cannabis use frequency before cannabis legalization is noteworthy, as those who used cannabis more frequently before cannabis legalization demonstrated larger decreases in cannabis use frequency and cannabis misuse after cannabis legalization. Such insights are often not available from studies with repeated cross-sectional designs.”

Imtiaz commended the investigators for the study's robust methodology, including the prospective cohort design, measurement of use and misuse before legalization, long-term follow-up after legalization, biannual repeated measurements, large sample size, high retention rate, inclusion of validated measures, and appropriate statistical methods.

Given that the study sample mostly comprised women (60%), highly educated (92% with some postsecondary education), and unmarried (68%) participants, the generalizability of the findings is limited, noted Imtiaz.

The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a Canada Research Chair in Translational Addiction Research grant, and the Peter Boris Chair in Addictions Research. McDonald and Imtiaz reported no relevant financial relationships.

 May 13, 2025  

An artificial intelligence (AI) model using routinely collected data predicted subsequent development of active tuberculosis (TB), Swiss researchers reported. The AI model outperformed biological tests for latent TB in identifying HIV-positive patients at high risk of developing TB.

As well as immune function and sociodemographic variables, the AI model retained several biomarkers indicative of patients' well-being and metabolism.

In Switzerland and other countries with good access to antiretroviral therapy, TB is a rare but serious co-infection in people living with HIV, frequently linked with late HIV diagnosis. To prevent progression to active TB disease, people known to have latent TB infection can be offered preventive treatment with isoniazid and/or rifampicin.

But detection of latent TB is challenging, especially in people with HIV. In a previous Swiss analysis, a combined approach using interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests identified only 30% of people who subsequently developed active TB.

“It was worse than tossing a coin,” Joahnnes Nemeth, MD, an attending physician in the department of infectious diseases and hospital epidemiology at the University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland, told Medscape Medical News.

The problem is that the tests rely on immune response, which may be impaired. “You interrogate the very system that is malfunctioning during HIV infection, so it's not a surprise that the tests perform poorly,” he explained.

This led him and his colleagues to look into alternative ways to identify patients at risk. They leveraged data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, which includes around 70% of people receiving HIV care in the country.

Over 23 years' worth of data were analyzed using machine learning, a subset of AI that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed for each task. Their machine learning model employed a random forest — an algorithm which combines the outputs from multiple decision trees.

The model looked at data collected at HIV diagnosis in order to predict active TB disease that developed at least 6 months later. Rather than only considering variables which the researchers thought were potential risk factors, the model reviewed all the variables for which they had sufficient data.

“What I really liked about this machine learning approach is that we threw all the data we collect into the machine and just asked it: Can you do something with that?” Nemeth said. “I think that really paid off.”

The first iteration of the model included 48 variables and had a sensitivity of 70.1% and a specificity of 81.0%. A streamlined second version retained 20 variables — making it computationally less demanding — while delivering a sensitivity of 57.1% and specificity of 77.8%.

Given that biologic tests had a sensitivity of 30% and specificity of 94%, for Nemeth this “blows everything of the water.” The model doesn't require additional data collection or have the expense of IGRA.

As might be expected, the 20 retained variables included immunological parameters, hematological markers, and sociodemographic factors, but some were more surprising: along with several variables linked with metabolism (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, glucose, and creatinine), body mass index, and mean arterial pressure.

The researchers noted that TB is associated with malnutrition and said that some of these markers may reflect metabolic perturbations and compromised muscle mass in people at risk for TB.

The model was first validated on a portion of the Swiss cohort which it was not trained on, and then on a cohort in Austria. Despite the many parallels between the two cohorts, initially the model performed badly in Austria.

The researchers realized the issue stemmed from different migration patterns between the countries: Most people with TB in Switzerland have moved from sub-Saharan Africa, while in Austria, most come from the former Soviet republics. Only after modifying the ethnicity and region of birth variables did the model begin to work effectively.

“This is a cautionary tale,” said Nemeth. “You go to a very similar setting with a little difference, and all this stops working. With machine learning models, we really have to be careful and test them vigorously before we rely on them.”

Emily Wong, MD, is an associate professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who has used AI to aid interpretation of chest radiography in South Africa, but was not involved in the new study.

The Swiss research “opens one's eyes to the idea that with very large data sets with lots of clinical variables, you can discern meaningful and predictive patterns that predict whether someone will go on to develop TB,” she told Medscape Medical News. 

Nemeth is working on an implementation study in which physicians whose patients have never been tested for TB will be randomly allocated to either receive a reminder to test, or a risk score based on the machine learning model. A key question is whether the latter will be enough to convince physicians to take further action, such as offering preventative therapy.

Wong noted that the potential benefits and risks (including liver toxicity) of preventative therapy need to be weighed up for each patient. But a machine learning model could help clinicians to do this.

“The idea that in the future, based on key demographic and clinical information of a person, and maybe including their chest x-ray or IGRA test, or maybe not, we would have a well-functioning clinical decision making tool that would guide a health care worker to make TB prevention decisions for the patient in front of them is definitely a worthy goal,” she said.

The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Nemeth declared receiving honoraria for presentations from Oxford Immunotec and ViiV.

Whether among passengers or crew, seasickness remains one of the most frequent medical issues encountered on board ships. At the 131st Congress of the German Society for Internal Medicine, Andreas H. Leischker, MD, specialist in internal medicine, emergency medicine, aviation medicine, and sports medicine and an experienced ship physician, shared practical insights on the prevention and management of motion sickness at sea.

This article is based on Leischker's lecture delivered during the congress.

Approximately 25% of cruise passengers experience seasickness (motion sickness) within the first 3 days of travel — this figure can rise to 60% during rough seas, according to Leischker. “Seasickness has a strong genetic component, and estrogen appears to play a role,” he noted. In clinical practice, it is evident that women are more affected than men, with pregnant women particularly being vulnerable.

Children aged 6-12 years are also frequently affected, while children younger than 2 years are rarely affected. Individuals older than 50 years tend to be less affected due to age-related decline in vestibular system sensitivity.

Leischker explained that approximately 50% of people adapt well to sea conditions. This adaptation process usually takes 1-3 weeks, which exceeds the duration of most passenger cruises but is highly relevant for ship crew members. Once adaptation is achieved, it typically persists for up to 3 months after disembarkation. “If someone hasn't worked at sea for 3 months, they will need to readapt,” he emphasized.

Seasickness results from sensory conflict among three systems: The visual system, the vestibular apparatus (inner ear), and proprioceptive input — especially from the feet. In rough conditions, these systems relay conflicting signals to the brain, triggering symptoms due to sensory mismatch.

Common symptoms include:

Less commonly occurring symptoms were headaches and bradycardia.

Leischker stressed the importance of conducting a thorough physical examination when passengers or crew members present with symptoms suggestive of seasickness. “A patient complaining of vomiting or headache in rough seas may very well have seasickness, but more serious conditions — such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage — must always be ruled out,” he cautioned.

When assessing patients with symptoms suggestive of seasickness — especially on board ships — it is important to rule out more serious conditions. According to Leischker, the following differential diagnoses should be kept in mind:

Behavioral modification can play a key role in preventing motion sickness. Because histamine pathways are implicated, Leischker advises avoiding histamine-rich foods (eg, aged cheese, cured meats, and fermented products) and alcohol.

Additional non-pharmacologic strategies include:

Scopolamine: Scopolamine has the most robust clinical evidence and the highest number of randomized controlled trials supporting its use in motion sickness prevention. The transdermal patch form is particularly well-studied and should be applied at least 8 hours before expected exposure to rough seas, which can generally be predicted using weather forecasts. The effect of the patch lasts up to 72 hours.

If the patch cannot be applied in advance, oral scopolamine (0.3-0.6 mg) may be used prophylactically, with administration approximately 1 hour before exposure. Combining oral and transdermal forms may improve efficacy. However, its use is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma or benign prostatic hyperplasia, and delirium may occur in patients with dementia.

Ginger: Clinical data also support the use of ginger as a prophylactic agent for motion sickness. Fresh ginger is generally more effective than dried preparations. In one study, fresh ginger outperformed 100 mg of dimenhydrinate in reducing symptoms. When used in a capsule form, a total dose of 940 mg (two capsules) was found to be effective.

Vitamin C: A study involving young military personnel younger than 27 years evaluated the prophylactic use of vitamin C for motion sickness. The results indicated a preventive effect but only at a high oral dose of 2 g, which may lead to gastrointestinal side effects, particularly diarrhea.

“If every passenger affected by seasickness sought medical attention, the onboard medical center would be overwhelmed,” noted Leischker. To manage demand, the placebo effect is sometimes utilized: Homeopathic remedies are available at the ship's reception desk and are effective in approximately 40% of cases. “We typically only see those patients for whom this approach has not been sufficient,” Leischker explained.

Acupuncture and acupressure — specifically stimulation of the Pericardium 6 (Nei Guan) point — have shown some effectiveness but are not practical on large cruise ships due to time and personnel constraints.

Dimenhydrinate is a frequently used treatment for nausea and dizziness. However, due to its sedative properties, it is not suitable for crew members. “In rough seas, the entire crew — whether it's the cook or a technician — must remain fully operational in case of emergency,” emphasized Leischker.

Special care must be taken when dosing dimenhydrinate in children younger than 3 years, as overdosing can lead to seizures and respiratory depression.

Dimenhydrinate via suppositories: When using suppository formulations (eg, Vomex A), the following dosages apply:

The total maximum dosage should not exceed 5 mg/kg/24 hours.

Dimenhydrinate intravenously: Intravenous administration (62 mg in 10 mL) is also effective and fast-acting. Up to three ampoules per day can be given to adults. However, Leischker pointed out a practical limitation: “In a mass casualty scenario, our onboard facility with only four beds reaches capacity quickly. We therefore need an alternative for managing a high volume of cases” — which is intramuscular administration.

Dimenhydrinate intramuscularly: Intramuscular delivery provides a higher depot dose and prolonged action. It is especially useful for patients who are already vomiting. An additional advantage is patient preference: “Most adults dislike suppositories. From around age 14, nearly all prefer an injection,” said Leischker.

While prescribing information typically recommends injecting the drug deep into the gluteal muscle, Leischker advises against this: “Do not strictly follow that guidance. Two milliliters are well-tolerated in most upper arm muscles, and this avoids the risk of sciatic nerve injury.” Contraindications for dimenhydrinate include narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, epilepsy, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

Because dimenhydrinate's sedative effect is incompatible with operational duties, an off-label option is often used for crew members. Flunarizine, a calcium channel blocker taken orally in a tablet form, is effective without sedation. However, it is contraindicated in patients with Parkinson's disease or depression.

Prevention: Scopolamine patches and tablets are effective; ginger is a non-pharmacologic alternative.

Therapy: Intramuscular dimenhydrinate is effective for passengers; flunarizine is a practical option for crew.

Preoperative use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduced the risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) by 31% after surgery, according to this retrospective, case-control study.

“Renoprotective effects of SGLT2i [SGLT2 inhibitor] in the perioperative setting could have far-reaching implications given the annual volume of patients undergoing surgical procedures and the burden of postoperative AKI,” the authors concluded.

This study was led by Roberta Teixeira Tallarico, MD, Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, University of California San Francisco. It was published online in JAMA Surgery.

The observational nature of this study limited the ability to establish direct causality. The exact timing of the last SGLT2 inhibitor administration before surgery was unknown, and the absence of ketone measurements limited their diagnostic criteria for euglycemic ketoacidosis. The study population primarily consisted of White male veterans older than 60 years, which limited the generalizability of the results.

This study was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, the statistical core of the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Pepper Center through the National Institutes of Health, the UCSF FAST-CaR Seed Research Grant, and UCSF Anesthesia Research.

Primary care physicians are the frontline warriors in the battle against cardiovascular disease — a killer that takes the life of someone in the United States every 33 seconds.

“Most patients have more regular contact with their primary care doctor than with any specialist,” said Lt. Col. Zaid Fadul, MD, the founder and CEO of Bespoke Concierge MD in Scottsdale, Arizona. That “means we are often the first to spot early warning signs of heart trouble, even before a patient ever realizes anything is wrong.”

“Our ongoing relationships allow us to track changes in health overtime, manage chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol and provide personalized education and support,” Fadul said.

Here are some tips for you — the primary care physician — to help your patients stave-off cardiovascular disease or manage their condition more effectively.

“The primary caregiver's job is to make sure that their patients never need a cardiologist because this disease is preventable,” said Louis Malinow, MD, an internist in Baltimore and director of Education and Clinical Excellence for MDVIP, a nationwide network of doctors that has more than 1300 affiliated physicians.

The keys are to identify at-risk patients early and provide them with comprehensive and aggressive care.

“I think it's important for docs to know that you can't determine who's at risk by just doing a yearly cholesterol profile,” Malinow said. “That's 20th century medicine.”

In the old days, high high-density lipoprotein or “good” cholesterol was believed to protect the heart and blood vessels even if low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad” plaque-forming cholesterol was elevated, he explained. “We know that is simply untrue now,” said Malinow.

Instead, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol particles are key determinants of cardiovascular health, according to Malinow.

The LDL cholesterol in the blood sits in particles called Apolipoprotein B (ApoB). Often, a patient might have a healthy LDL cholesterol number but a high ApoB, which is a concept called discordance, explained Malinow.

The only way to get a clear picture is to order a lipid profile with an ApoB blood test for your patients. The higher the ApoB number, the greater the risk. “Countless studies show that heart attack risk always tracks with the (ApoB) particle number, not the cholesterol,” Malinow said.

Strongly consider cholesterol-lowering drugs for patients with high ApoB, even if LDL cholesterol looks healthy, Malinow advised.

Lifestyle changes like drinking less alcohol, quitting smoking, eating less carbs and sugar, and exercising can help lower triglycerides and other risk factors.

“You can't start a fire without firewood,” Malinow said. “Well, the firewood is the cholesterol particles. The more that firewood gets packed into the wall of coronary arteries, the more likely a fire will break out.”

Genetic factors can add fuel to that fire. Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is another plaque-forming particle that makes blood clot easier and makes clots harder to break down. Lp(a) levels can be picked up by genetic tests.

Malinow said everyone should have the Lp(a) test at least once as 20% of people have this abnormal cholesterol particle. “It is the single biggest determinant of early cardiovascular risk and the biggest single driver of aortic valve stenosis,” he said. Patients with elevated Lp(a) levels should be followed even more closely.

Cholesterol and inflammation both play significant roles in cardiovascular disease. All primary care doctors should order a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein test to check for that marker of inflammation, said Malinow. If it's elevated, the gout drug colchicine can lower cardiac risk.

One of the best ways to lower inflammation is losing weight, Malinow added. If patients are having trouble shedding pounds through diet and exercise, a glucagon-like peptide 1 medication can help them drop weight and “miraculously” decrease inflammation.

Endothelial dysfunction: The endothelium acts like a fence in artery walls that keep cholesterol particles flowing free in the bloodstream. If that fence is broken, those particles can pile up in artery walls. Certain tests run once a year can check for signs of endothelial dysfunction:

Insulin resistance: In addition to fasting glucose and A1c, Malinow also runs a fasting insulin test. “Insulin levels go up 10 years before we see the sugar budge,” Malinow said. “So that's a window into the future. If you see someone with perfect sugar, but it's taking way too much insulin to keep it normal, they're in trouble.”

The prescription in cases like that is usually lifestyle changes first before opting for medication, Malinow noted.

It's important for patients to know that a stent does not prevent heart attacks in people with stable heart disease, according to Fadul. Stents mainly help relieve symptoms but do not prolong life.

Many people believe crushing chest pain signals heart trouble. It's the doctor's role to warn that subtle symptoms — including dizziness, unexplained worsening of shortness of breath, and pain in the jaw — are just as dangerous, Fadul explained.

It's also critical not to overlook the risk for heart disease in both women and younger patients, which can lead to missed or delayed diagnosis, he said.

Malinow also noted that doctors shouldn't solely rely on the 10-year calculated risk to decide whether to start cholesterol-lowering medications, as that algorithm is largely based on a population of people with that number. To obtain your patient's personal risk, get an imaging test, like a coronary calcium score. “Any score that's not zero means that the patient is at increased risk and needs to be managed more aggressively,” Malinow said.

“I refer patients to a heart specialist when they have significant heart disease, like heart failure, a previous heart attack, or irregular heart rhythms,” said Fadul. Women with pregnancy-related complications that increase heart risk get referred, as well.

Both Fadul and Malinow would also call in a specialist if there are any symptoms of heart trouble, whether obvious or subtle. Malinow would also refer if there are signs of heart failure, like swollen ankles or a new ECG change.

“If there is one thing I have learned, it is that successful cardiovascular care depends on vigilance, communication, and empowering patients,” Fadul said. “I have seen patients' lives changed by catching subtle symptoms early or by helping them make lasting lifestyle changes.”

Malinow agrees that early cardiovascular prevention is the name of the game. “We know this is a lifetime disease that starts in childhood,” he said. “We just don't start seeing heart attacks in most people who don't have severe problems until their 40s, 50s, or 60s, etc.”

Hopefully, with aggressive, early action, patients in the later part of life will never experience cardiovascular disease.

Hi, everyone. I'm Dr Kenny Lin. I am a family physician and associate director of the Lancaster General Hospital Family Medicine Residency, and I blog at Common Sense Family Doctor.

Not long after the US Preventive Services Task Force first recommended colonoscopy as a screening method in 2002, I started giving lectures that argued fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) was still a comparable option because patients generally find FIT more convenient than colonoscopy and the mortality benefit of FIT has been proven in several randomized controlled trials. 

However, over the past two decades, colonoscopy has become the most commonly used screening test for colorectal cancer in the United States. Newer noninvasive screening options that I discussed in a previous Medscape commentary are also being promoted as superior options to FIT. So, will FIT continue to play a role in colorectal cancer screening?

In a word…absolutely.

Several ongoing randomized trials are evaluating the efficacy of FIT vs screening colonoscopy. In the COLONPREV trial conducted in Spain, 57,000 adults at average risk for colorectal cancer aged 50-69 years of age were randomly assigned to receive an invitation for either a single colonoscopy or FIT every other year. According to results published last month in The Lancet, 55 people in the colonoscopy group and 60 people in the FIT group had died of colorectal cancer at the 10-year endpoint — a difference that was not statistically significant.

There are two main drawbacks to this population-based study: Less than 40% of participants received either screening test, and more than 1 in 3 persons assigned to the colonoscopy group chose to have FIT instead. These issues are understandable, because a minority of eligible adults in Spain have routine colorectal cancer screening and colonoscopy plays a much smaller role as an initial screening test compared to its use in the United States. On the positive side, the study showed that 18% fewer people needed colonoscopy in the FIT group compared with the colonoscopy-first group, and there was no significant difference in cancer deaths.

Although FITs are a widely available and cost-effective option for colorectal cancer screening, FIT efficacy is largely dependent on patient adherence and follow-up compliance; FIT is only effective if patients return stool samples to the lab and get a timely follow-up colonoscopy if they receive an abnormal result. Fortunately, there is a growing body of research focused on exploring strategies to enhance adherence to FIT.

To evaluate patient sentiments regarding FIT screening, investigators in Iowa, North Carolina, and Texas distributed a questionnaire about five different FITs to patients who were scheduled for a screening or surveillance colonoscopy. The investigators found that study participants strongly preferred sample collection in a liquid vial as opposed to a card and made more errors with the latter type. The TEMPO trial also found that the language included in patient instructions can significantly affect follow-up compliance. The addition of one sentence suggesting a 2-week deadline for FIT return (rather than leaving it open-ended) increased overall test return rates and reduced the need to send reminders. Furthermore, results from a cluster randomized trial conducted across 28 clinics in rural Oregon indicate that mailed FIT outreach and telephone-based patient navigation following an abnormal FIT result improved colorectal cancer screening rates at 6 months and diagnostic colonoscopy completion rates at 1 year.

These study findings have important applications for primary care practice. When reviewing colorectal cancer screening test choices with patients, family physicians can continue to recommend annual or biennial FIT as a comparable option to colonoscopy. If FIT is selected, we should provide a kit with liquid vial sample collection, if possible, and include a suggested return date in patient instructions. Finally, clinicians in leadership and population health management roles should advocate for cost-effective investments in patient navigation to enhance colorectal cancer screening and diagnostic colonoscopy completion rates, because these initiatives play a crucial role in preventing colorectal cancer deaths.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Researchers at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation (TIBI) have developed a technique that could help advance treatments in tissue engineering. The study, published in the scientific journal Small, introduces a technique for producing tissues with precise cellular organization designed to mimic the natural structure of human tissue.

Using a simple light-based 3D printing method, the team created microgels with controlled internal architectures. These structures helped guide how cells behave and grow, mimicking the way cells naturally behave in the body. By adjusting properties of light as it interacts with hydrogels, they modified the internal structure of these microgels, enabling precise control of cell organization in 3D space. This breakthrough addresses a major challenge in creating realistic, functional tissue environments critical for tissue repair and regeneration.

Our technique enables the production of microtissue with precise structural control, which is essential for engineering tissues such as muscle, and retina. We're enabling a new class of modular biomaterials that can actively guide tissue formation and engineering organ through the bottom-up approach.""

Dr. Johnson John, study's principal investigator

The study showed that these microgels could be used in a variety of ways. In one example, the team placed muscle cells inside rod-shaped gels, which helped the cells align and form muscle fibers, a promising step towards injectable treatments for muscle injuries. In another case, they used the gels to hold photoreceptor cells, which naturally organized themselves into layers similar to the outer retina, offering potential for future retinal therapies. The researchers also added angiogenic peptides to the gels which encouraged new blood vessel growth, both in vitro and in vivo. The microgels maintain their shape during injection and are designed to support cell growth, new blood vessel formation, and tissue growth. Their flexible design supports customization for various medical uses, making them a promising tool for wound care, organ repair, and studying diseases.

""This work represents a significant step toward creating structures that can form functional tissues"" said Dr. Ali Khademhosseini, CEO of TIBI. ""By merging light-based fabrication with smart biomaterials, we are getting closer to making personalized, minimally invasive therapies.""

This study is supported by National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and TIBI.

A new review in Genes and Diseases explores the central role of MYC, a master regulatory protein, in the development and progression of cancer, spotlighting its potential as a multidimensional therapeutic target. MYC is dysregulated in nearly 70% of human cancers, where it influences a vast network of biological processes including cell cycle control, metabolism, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. The article underscores how MYC not only drives aggressive tumor behavior but also contributes significantly to drug resistance, making it one of the most compelling yet complex targets in oncology.

Historically considered undruggable due to its disordered protein structure, recent advances have begun to shift this paradigm. Researchers are now devising strategies to target MYC directly by interfering with the MYC-MAX protein complex, which activates numerous cancer-related genes. Promising compounds, such as OMO-103, have demonstrated early clinical potential by disrupting this interaction and halting tumor proliferation.

Beyond direct approaches, the review also emphasizes indirect targeting strategies, including inhibition of MYC transcription or translation, promotion of protein degradation, and synthetic lethality-wherein pathways essential to MYC-overexpressing cells are selectively disrupted. These methods aim to exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells that depend heavily on MYC for survival, while sparing healthy tissues.

The therapeutic potential of MYC targeting is further enhanced by innovations in small molecule inhibitors, protein degradation technologies like PROTACs, and combination therapies that integrate MYC inhibition with existing treatments. These approaches are being designed with an eye toward precision medicine, tailoring interventions based on tumor-specific MYC activity and associated molecular pathways.

However, the article cautions against oversimplification. Because MYC interacts with a wide array of partners and affects diverse signaling cascades, context-dependent effects must be carefully considered. Targeting MYC too broadly might risk unintended consequences, such as impairing normal regenerative processes or inducing premature cellular aging.

Still, with improved molecular understanding and refined drug design, the tide is turning in favor of MYC-directed interventions. This review calls attention to MYC as not just a notorious oncogene, but a gateway to novel, more effective cancer treatments-redefining what is therapeutically possible for one of the most elusive yet consequential drivers of malignancy.

Unprecedented progress in reducing the number of women smoking during pregnancy in England could be put at risk by NHS funding cuts, according to a UEA addiction expert.

A new BMJ article, co-authored by Prof Caitlin Notley from UEA's Norwich Medical School, reveals that the proportion of women smoking during pregnancy in England has almost halved in the last decade.

Most of the decline happened in the last five years thanks to the introduction of dedicated stop smoking advisers in NHS maternity services since 2020.

But the team fear that the reduction could be threatened by cost-cutting exercises.

And they are calling for continued investment to give every child a smokefree start in life.

The article has been written by members of the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group - a coalition of organisations committed to reducing rates of smoking in pregnancy.

It shows how the amount of women smoking during pregnancy dropped from 11.7 per cent in 2014/15 to 5.9 per cent as of Q3 2024/25.

The progress on reducing rates of smoking in pregnancy has accelerated in recent years, thanks to the focused efforts of all healthcare professionals involved in the pregnancy care pathway.

However, there remain significant inequalities, as rates of smoking remain higher in deprived areas - suggesting that we need innovative targeted approaches for those who really struggle to quit.""

Prof. Caitlin Notley, Professor of Addiction Sciences at UEA

The authors say that cuts to integrated care boards (ICB) budgets and the loss of ringfenced funding for NHS tobacco treatment services could threaten the success.

Stop smoking support in some hospitals and mental health services has already been cut, according to the group, with further cuts expected.

The Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group is a partnership between the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the voluntary sector and academia.

Prof Linda Bauld, director of the SPECTRUM Research Consortium, co-chair of the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group and co-author of the BMJ article said: ""The evidence is clear that stop smoking support for pregnant women has played a vital role in reducing rates of maternal smoking and saving babies' lives. Without continued investment in these services there is a real risk that this decline could stall, or even start to reverse, with tragic consequences for parents and families."" 

Dr Clea Harmer, chief executive of Sands and co-chair of the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group, said: ""As the government sets its sights on a smokefree generation, now is not the time to be cutting investment in these services. Instead, they should be going further and faster to ensure every child has a smokefree start in life.""

John Waldron, policy and public affairs manager at Action on Smoking and Health and co-author of the BMJ article said: ""The 2024 Labour manifesto committed to ensuring that all hospitals integrate smoking cessation support into routine care. The government must deliver on this commitment by protecting funding for these lifesaving services.""

'NHS Cuts Could Spark Surge in Smoking During Pregnancy, Experts Warn' is published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ).

A new publication shines a spotlight on HER3, a long-overlooked member of the ErbB receptor family, revealing its critical role in cancer progression and resistance to therapy. Once considered a passive player due to its weak kinase activity, HER3 is now recognized as a major contributor to the survival and spread of various solid tumors, including breast, lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and gynecologic cancers.

HER3 functions through its interaction with other ErbB receptors, particularly HER2, forming potent signaling pairs that drive cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. These dimerized complexes activate key downstream pathways, such as MAPK and PI3K/Akt, both essential in cancer cell growth and evasion of apoptosis. Overexpression or mutation of HER3 in tumor cells correlates with poor patient outcomes and therapeutic resistance, positioning it as a high-value therapeutic target.

Despite the development of multiple HER3-targeted therapies, most clinical applications have yielded modest results. The limited success is now attributed to the failure to match treatments to patients with active HER3 signaling. Crucially, only a subset of tumors—such as those with NRG1 gene fusions or high HER3 expression—appear to respond well, highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers to guide treatment selection. Without precise patient stratification, many promising therapies fall short of their potential.

The tumor microenvironment plays a decisive role in regulating HER3 activity. Stromal components, particularly fibroblasts and liver endothelial cells, secrete factors that activate HER3 independently of its known ligands, contributing to therapy resistance and disease recurrence. This underscores the importance of considering non-genetic activation mechanisms in future treatment strategies.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a powerful approach to overcome resistance. By combining HER3-targeting antibodies with cytotoxic payloads, ADCs selectively eliminate HER3-positive cancer cells while minimizing systemic toxicity. Encouraging early results in HER3-expressing breast and lung cancers demonstrate their potential to reshape HER3-directed therapies.

The review also calls for integrating HER3 expression profiling into clinical trial design and patient care. Accurate detection methods and biomarker-driven therapies could transform HER3 from a failed target to a cornerstone of precision oncology.

With a better understanding of its biology, interaction with the microenvironment, and the emergence of next-generation therapies, HER3 is being redefined as a central player in cancer therapeutics—one that may finally deliver on its long-overdue promise.

Health professionals will have access to national clinical practice guidelines to help assess and diagnose fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), following a 4-year research project led by The University of Queensland.

The Australian Guidelines for Assessment and Diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder are the first guidelines in this area to be approved by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). 

Dr. Natasha Reid from UQ's Child Health Research Centre, who led the collaborative project involving more than 40 organizations, said it is a groundbreaking development in the assessment and diagnosis of FASD, which is the leading cause of non-genetic disability in Australia.

""FASD is a lifelong disability arising from prenatal exposure to alcohol, but every individual is unique with areas of both strength and challenges,"" Dr. Reid said. 

""The challenges can include difficulties with, attention, learning and memory, communication, behavioral and emotional regulation."" 

Dr. Reid said having access to assessment and diagnosis will help people understand their unique challenges and strengths, enabling them to better access individualized support.

""We hope these new guidelines will enhance assessment and diagnostic practices, improve service accessibility, reduce stigma, and ultimately improve the quality of life for all people living with FASD in Australia,"" Dr. Reid said.

""FASD has typically been diagnosed in specialist clinics, but these guidelines encourage all practitioners, regardless of setting or discipline, to contribute where they can to the assessment. 

In developing the guidelines, researchers completed a comprehensive review that included understanding people's lived experiences of the assessment process and examined more than 300 research papers to understand the link between prenatal alcohol exposure and diagnostic outcomes.

Associate Dean (Research) Professor Karen Moritz, from UQ's Faculty of Health, Medicine and Behavioral Sciences, said a key feature in the development of the guidelines was extensive consultation involving more than 120 health professionals, researchers, cultural experts, along with families and carers of people living with FASD.

Through collaborative networks and extensive stakeholder engagement, these new national guidelines for assessment and diagnosis of FASD have the potential to change the life-course for individuals living with FASD.""

Funding was provided by the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care to a consortium involving The University of Queensland, The University of Sydney, The Kids Research Institute Australia, La Trobe University, Griffith University, Gold Coast Health's Child Development Service, National Organisation for FASD (NOFASD), Patches Paediatrics, Monash Children's Hospital, West Moreton Health, FASD C.A.R.E and The Russell Family Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Association. 

Many other organizations were also involved as part of the Guidelines Development Group and Project Advisory Groups.

Conditions such as Tourette syndrome (TS), schizophrenia, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have sex differences with unknown mechanisms. These sex-specific mechanisms may inform the development of more effective treatments. In a new JNeurosci paper, Meghan Van Zandt and Christopher Pittenger used mice to shed light on the mechanisms underlying sex differences in these psychiatric conditions. 

Prior to this study, the researchers knew that these neurological disorders are characterized by altered dopamine signaling in the same brain network. Additionally, human genetic studies implicate a natural compound called histamine in dysregulating dopamine signaling to potentially underlie at least TS. Thus, Van Zandt and Pittenger examined sex differences in how histamine interacts with dopamine signaling in this brain network. 

By manipulating histamine signaling in mice, the researchers discovered that histamine had opposite effects on dopamine levels in males and females: Histamine decreased dopamine in males and increased dopamine in females. In females, this effect was influenced by the estrous cycle. The researchers also found sex differences in the mechanisms through which histamine regulated dopamine levels. 

According to the authors, this study may inform treatment development, suggesting that sex-specific treatments targeting different histamine receptors may effectively correct dopamine signaling in TS, schizophrenia, and ADHD.

The results of an international study led by researchers from Queen Mary University of London's Precision Healthcare University Research Institute (PHURI) shed new light the underlying biological mechanisms which cause differences in health risks, symptoms and outcomes between males and females. 

The study, carried out in collaboration with the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, was published today in Nature Communications. Using data from UK Biobank and the Fenland study, the team carried an in-depth analysis of the genetic links between ~6,000 proteins and hundreds of diseases in 56,000 males and females. 

The team found that for two-thirds of these proteins, their levels differed between males and females. Further examination revealed that only a very small fraction, around 100 proteins out of the 6,000 studied, had differences in the genetic 'switches' which control their levels, when compared between males and females. 

These findings, which may have implications for drug development, indicate that while there are differences between the sexes in relation to how much they express certain proteins, what's causing these differences isn't solely down to differences in their genetics. 

Instead, the authors highlight the importance of looking beyond genetics – and other medical factors such as hormones – when comparing health risks and outcomes between males and females. Their findings indicate that non-medical factors such as where people work and live, their education, financial situation, access to resources, as well as their lifestyle also contribute to the health differences experiences between the sexes and so should be explored further and considered more when exploring sex differences in health. 

Mine Koprulu, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary's PHURI, said: ""For the first time in history, we are able to study human biology at this level of detail-across genes, proteins, and more. This is the largest study to date exploring the similarities and differences in how our genetic code regulates blood protein levels between sexes. Our findings highlight the need to better understand the factors that impact health differences - at the genetic level and beyond- to create more tailored and equitable healthcare for everyone."" 

Professor Claudia Langenberg, Director of the PHURI at Queen Mary and Professor of Computational Medicine at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Germany, said: ""Drug development pipelines increasingly incorporate information on genetic differences in protein levels and function and this has led to large investment in human cohorts, such as UK Biobank. From this perspective, better understanding of population differences in the regulation of proteins, such as those between males and females, is essential to guide precision medicine approaches and identify where one size may not fit all. Our results clearly show that with very few exceptions, protein regulating genetic variants identified so far behave in a very similar way in males and females. This provides evidence for an important implicit assumption – that insights arising from studying these variants apply to both sexes."" 

In this study, data was categorised as male or female based on chromosomal information (XX or XY). The authors acknowledge that chromosomal information does not always align with an individual's gender identity. However, for the purposes of this study (genetic and protein-level scientific analyses), this categorisation was necessary, and data on gender identity was not reliably recoded meaning it could not be consistently used across all data.

A study of U.S. adults finds that excess central fat, measured by LAP, is linked to lower spinal bone density, only after reaching a certain tipping point, suggesting a new early warning sign for osteoporosis.

Study: The association between lipid accumulation products and bone mineral density in U.S. Adults, a nationally representative cross-sectional study. Image Credit: Crevis / Shutterstock

In a recent study in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers evaluated the association between a new indicator of lipid accumulation, 'lipid accumulation products (LAP)', and bone mineral density (BMD). The study dataset comprised 3,883 (mean age = 39.33 yrs; 45.48% women) NHANES participants with analyses including subgroup, interaction, and threshold analyses, adjusted for covariates.

Study findings revealed a non-linear negative relationship between LAP and lumbar BMD, with the negative association observed only above a specific LAP threshold (ln-LAP ≈ 2.85); below this value, no significant association was found. Interaction analysis indicated no influence of subgroups, suggesting that the observed pattern held across demographic and health characteristics. These findings suggest the clinical utility of LAP as a bioindicator and predictor of osteoporosis, providing valuable insights that may lead to earlier intervention strategies in treating these chronic diseases.

Osteoporosis is a bone condition characterized by severe weakening of bones (reduced bone mass), significantly increasing the likelihood of fracture, especially in adults over the age of 50. The chronic condition is a growing public health concern, with an estimated 158 million adults (>50 yrs) living with the condition. Alarmingly, prediction models suggest that this number will only double by 2040, highlighting the need for prevention, early detection, and intervention against this societal burden.

Previous research has established an association between osteoporosis and obesity, with the latter significantly exacerbating the former's risk. Interestingly, validated studies have revealed that body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) – obesity's most common metrics – are insufficient predictors of osteoporosis due to the latter's nuanced relationship with adipose tissue and lean tissue.

Lipid accumulation products (LAP) is a relatively novel lipid accumulation scoring system that combines serum triglyceride (TG) levels with WC to compute an estimate of central obesity. The measure has been at the center of recent scientific discussion and research due to growing evidence that it can potentially predict the risks of several health conditions, including diabetes and other metabolic syndromes, insulin resistance, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and even osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, the association between LAP and osteoporosis (bone mineral density [BMD]) has never been formally established.

The present study aims to address this knowledge gap and inform future research on interventions against osteoporosis by evaluating the relationship between LAP and BMD on a nationally representative United States (U.S.) cohort. The study hopes to facilitate improved recognition, early detection, and enhanced prevention of future osteoporosis incidence.

Study data were obtained from participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) program conducted by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data from four NHANES survey periods (2011–2018) were enrolled, comprising demographic, medical examination, dietary records, and questionnaire data. Participants younger than 20 and those with missing lumbar BMD, LAP, or covariate data were excluded from subsequent analyses.

The exposure variable (LAP) was computed using the following formula: Men – WC (cm)–65 × TG (mmol/l), Women – WC (cm)–58 × TG (mmol/l). Data for these computations were obtained from serum sample triglyceride measurements. The outcome variable (lumbar BMD) was measured using a fan-beam densitometer conforming to International Society for Clinical Bone Densitometry (ISCD) guidelines.

Covariates of interest included age, race, gender, BMI, education, poverty income ratio (PIR), laboratory blood assays, smoking and alcohol status, and chronic disease status. Statistical analyses were carried out using linear regression models, weighted chi-squared tests, multivariate linear regression models, threshold effect analyses, and interaction analyses.

Of the 39,156 NHANES records initially enrolled in the study, 16,539 and 18,374 were excluded based on age and missing data, respectively, leaving a final dataset of 3,883 participants (mean age = 39.33 yrs; 45.48% female). Regression models revealed a negative association between LAP and lumbar BMD, confirmed via threshold analyses that identified a threshold value for LAP (ln-LAP ≈ 2.85).

Importantly, the negative association between LAP and BMD was only observed when LAP values were above this threshold; below this point, no significant association was found. Surprisingly, subgroup and interaction analyses failed to highlight the significant impacts of any covariates on the study findings. This indicates that the negative association above the threshold is consistent across different demographic and health groups. Notably, associations between LAP and BMD were observed to be non-linear. Together, these findings suggest the untapped potential of leveraging LAP in the early detection of osteoporosis and the routine monitoring of overall bone health.

The study authors note that, while the analysis used a large, nationally representative dataset and adjusted for many potential confounders, it is cross-sectional in nature and therefore cannot establish causality. Additionally, the analysis was limited to lumbar spine BMD, as relevant data for femur BMD were unavailable in the used NHANES cycles. Further research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms linking LAP and bone density and to verify these findings in prospective studies.

The present study uses a large, nationally representative U.S. dataset to establish and describe the relationship between LAP and BMD. Study findings indicate a non-linear negative correlation between the variables, with a significant association only above a defined LAP threshold, supporting LAP's clinical and research utility in future osteoporosis interventions.

A pilot study suggests that adding gravitational load via a weighted vest during dieting may help older adults maintain weight loss by preserving metabolism, hinting at a novel biological pathway for long-term weight control.



Study: Does weighted vest use during weight loss influence long-term weight loss maintenance? A pilot study in older adults living with obesity and osteoarthritis. Image Credit: Martin Criminale / Flickr

In a recent article published in the International Journal of Obesity, researchers investigated whether wearing a weighted vest over six months during a calorie restriction intervention to promote weight loss could influence longer-term weight regain among older adults with obesity. They found that participants wearing weighted vests lost similar amounts of weight over the six months but regained only half of the lost weight over 24 months, while those who did not wear the vests regained all of it.

Obesity is a considerable public health concern, particularly among older adults. Weight loss through lifestyle-based interventions, which typically result in 8–10% weight loss in a year, is the standard treatment but often fails to maintain long-term results. This failure is mainly due to biological changes following weight loss, such as reduced energy expenditure and increased hunger due to hormonal shifts.

Recently, researchers have considered gravitational loading, or how body weight exerts force on the skeleton, as a factor in weight regulation. This idea is the basis of the “gravitostat” hypothesis, which suggests that bone cells in the lower body detect body weight changes and send signals to the brain to regulate appetite and fat storage. While most evidence comes from animal studies, one human study showed that increasing gravitational load can lead to small but statistically significant losses in fat mass and body weight over a short period, although the magnitude of weight loss in that study was less than what would be considered clinically meaningful.

This study analyzed data collected during follow-ups of a randomized controlled trial that assessed whether wearing a weighted vest during a six-month weight loss intervention is feasible and beneficial for older adults with obesity and arthritis.

The original trial randomized participants to either a calorie-restricted diet with weighted vest use (20 participants) or a diet alone (17 participants). For this pilot analysis, 18 participants (two groups of nine people), who had finished the six-month program, returned voluntarily for a follow-up over 24 months.

All participants followed the dietary plan that was delivered between 1100 and 1300 kcal daily, as well as weekly nutrition and behavioral counseling. The treatment group wore an adjustable weighted vest for at most 10 hours daily during active periods. The vest's weight increased weekly to replace lost body weight, not exceeding 15% of baseline weight. Participants' compliance was self-reported weekly. After the six-month intervention, participants were not contacted or monitored during the follow-up period, except for being invited to return for the 24-month assessment. They did not receive further study protocol or support after the intervention period.

Baseline demographics and anthropometric measures, including body weight, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and body composition, were collected by blinded staff and assessed at baseline, after 6 months, and after 24 months. RMR was assessed using indirect calorimetry after 12 hours of fasting and no recent exercise.

Data analyses included mixed models and Pearson correlations to assess changes over time and associations between RMR changes and weight regain.

This pilot study involved older adults with an average age of 70.4 years, 83.3% of whom were female, with obesity, who underwent a six-month weight loss intervention, followed by an 18-month follow-up.

Both groups achieved similar and significant weight loss during the initial six months; those who wore the vest lost an average of 11.2 kg, while those who did not lost 10.3 kg on average. Approximately one-quarter of this weight loss comprised lean mass.

After 24 months, the group wearing vests regained only about half the lost weight, with a net loss of 4.8 kg from baseline, while the group not wearing vests reverted to baseline weight. Lean mass remained lower in the group wearing vests at 24 months, whereas it returned to baseline in those who did not.

Notably, RMR decreased less in the group wearing vests at six months, by 16.3 kcal per day, compared to the control group, which showed a decrease of 237.5 kcal per day. Both groups' RMR reverted to baseline by 24 months.

A modest inverse correlation was observed between RMR reduction during active weight loss and weight regain during follow-up, suggesting that preserved RMR may support sustained weight loss. However, this association did not reach statistical significance (r = −0.39, p = 0.11).

This study suggests that wearing a weighted vest during intentional weight loss may help reduce long-term weight regain, possibly by preserving resting metabolic rate. While both groups initially lost similar amounts of weight, the group wearing vests maintained more weight loss at 24 months. The findings support emerging research on gravitational loading as a factor in weight regulation.

Key strengths include the novel intervention, randomized controlled design, and extended follow-up period. However, the study's small sample size and reliance on a convenience sample for the 24-month follow-up limit generalizability. Additionally, the study lacked detailed data on posture (such as standing vs. sitting) and dietary intake during vest wear, which may have affected outcomes.

Overall, the pilot findings are promising and suggest that gravitational loading may help sustain weight loss in older adults. Larger, more comprehensive trials are needed to confirm these results and further explore mechanisms such as osteocyte signaling and appetite regulation.

We might have another reason to enjoy our daily cup of tea or small piece of dark chocolate, as a new study from the University of Surrey has found that naturally occurring compounds called flavan-3-ols - found in cocoa, tea, apples and grapes - may improve blood pressure and the health of our blood vessels.

The research, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, analyzed data from 145 randomized controlled studies, and found that regular consumption of flavan-3-ols can lead to a reduction in blood pressure readings, particularly in people with elevated or high blood pressure. In some cases, the average blood pressure-lowering effects were comparable to those seen with some medications.

Flavan-3-ols were also found to improve the function of the endothelium - the inner lining of blood vessels - which is crucial for overall cardiovascular health. This improvement occurred independently of blood pressure changes, suggesting a broader positive impact on the circulatory system.

The findings are encouraging for those looking for accessible ways to manage their blood pressure and support their heart health through enjoyable dietary changes. Incorporating small amounts of commonly consumed foods like tea, apples, dark chocolate, or cocoa powder into a daily balanced diet could provide beneficial amounts of flavan-3-ols.

While not a replacement for prescribed medications or medical advice, including more flavan-3-ol-rich foods in a daily routine could be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle, especially for those with higher blood pressure. These are findings that, although promising, require ongoing investigation.""

International Football

It took Peter Moore about 30 minutes at a Xerox machine in 1993 to create the most iconic piece of design in American soccer history.

Moore had made his name years earlier at Nike, as the designer of the first Air Jordan sneaker and the iconic “Jumpman” logo. He'd helped grow the sportswear and shoe brand from a tiny Oregon startup to a global titan before leaving for Adidas in the early 90s. There, he'd continued knocking almost every design out of the park. By the time Moore stood at the copy machine, most of the world's soccer jerseys bore the ascending three stripes of the modern Adidas logo that he'd designed.

This was not Moore's first soccer project. Among his first tasks at Adidas had been designing the beautiful, baggy men's and women's kits they'd worn in the early 90s, with the blue and red stripes up the shoulder. But this particular assignment – designing the USMNT's kits for the 1994 World Cup, the first ever to be hosted in the United States – felt more important than most. Moore, remembers his close friend and associate Mary McGoldrick, had kept the circle close on this one. Barely anybody at Adidas' U.S. headquarters in Portland had any idea what he was up to, and even fewer at the company's global headquarters in Germany.

Moore took a piece of denim – Levi's, he remembered before his death in 2022 – and laid out some paper stars on it. He pressed the copy button on the Xerox machine and slowly, methodically, dragged the swath of fabric across the glass.

“Remember,” said Moore, “in 1993, computer graphics were not really in existence, at least not in Portland, Oregon. In other words, we got our hands dirty.”

Moore took one look at the output of the copy machine and knew right then and there that he'd nailed the design. He'd just created the “denim kit,” and over 30 years later, those kits remain iconic. They are held aloft by some as the pinnacle of American soccer design and they are derided by others, reduced to a frivolous example of gauche 90s fashion, chucked in a bin alongside the purple and teal designs of the day.

Undeniably, though, the kits evoke memories of that tournament, the one where the USMNT finally solidified America's love affair with the global game. On sun-drenched fields in California and under the roof of the Silverdome, the 1994 USMNT exceeded all expectations, emerging out of a very tough group and fighting gallantly against eventual champion Brazil.

Years later, the kit's popularity has only increased. You see it everywhere at national team matches and it has become wildly bootlegged and emulated, maybe the ultimate mark of relevance.

Tuesday, with another World Cup on home soil just over a year away, we got our first look at the USMNT's latest kit – a red and blue pinstriped number dubbed the “heartbeat kit” that frankly may be its best offering in recent years. It's simple and bold without being boring, feels highly wearable off the pitch and seems an ideal stopgap between the USMNT's current shirts and the 2026 World Cup designs, which they'll presumably release closer to the tournament itself.

There's a new complete women's set as well, including the lighter “brilliant kit.” Both were designed in collaboration with women's players Lynn (Williams) Biyendolo, Naomi Girma and Sophia (Smith) Wilson, and men's players Kellyn Acosta, DeAndre Yedlin and Walker Zimmerman. The designs, U.S. Soccer says, celebrate the legacy of its teams and the “passion of U.S. Soccer fans across the country.”

The men's kit, which they'll debut on June 7 in a friendly against Turkey, is evocative of the 2007 “Copa” kits that were only worn for a single year. It's a vintage design that remains a favorite these days, and Nike and U.S. Soccer have done well to emulate it, even if perhaps unintentionally.

The men's shirts, though, pale in comparison to the new women's kits, which offers a callback to the denim kit. The washed-out stars, the red-and-blue trim around the neck … even the sublimated, vertical stripes are reminiscent of the USMNT's home kit at the ‘94 World Cup, the “wavy flag” design that never quite achieved the notoriety of Moore's other design that year.

The women's “brilliant” design, which will be debuted on May 31 in a friendly vs. China, frankly would not make a bad men's World Cup shirt. The women's kits have been largely aligned with the men's kits for years, and the women's team has done just as much, if not more, to solidify the legacies of some of those designs. (The men will be sticking with their current white kits for the time being.)

One thing feels certain enough: whatever the USMNT ends up wearing in 2026 needs to be daring and bold and brash. U.S. Soccer, and Nike, need to look to iconic designs of the past – the denim kit, or the “bomb pops” – to determine their course for the tournament. It feels easy enough to argue that this tournament could prove the most pivotal moment in the history of American men's soccer – maybe even bigger than the ‘94 tournament – and the U.S. needs to be equipped with something memorable.

There are risks, of course. Had the USMNT crashed out in the group stage in ‘94, for example, it feels almost certain that the denim kit would've become a punchline, the latest example of how decision-makers in American soccer had “gotten it wrong.” Take the oversized Nike kits, the ones the USMNT wore in 1998. They're not bad-looking on the surface, but the design itself is imbued with the team's failure in France, a painful memory.

The opposite, of course, also holds true. Fans adore the bomb pops not only because they broke the trend of “clean” design, but because of Clint Dempsey or John Brooks celebrating goals in it at the 2014 World Cup. USWNT fans love the 2019 kits – which, on the surface are a little bland – not because of the design itself but because of the World Cup the women won in it, something that can be said for their 1999 kits as well.

As for the denim kit? Fans love it because of Wynalda, Lalas, Harkes and the lot on those sun-drenched fields. Nike can only get so close to the denim kit before it runs into copyright and intellectual property issues with Adidas, a chief competitor. And it's worth noting that as design cycles go, much of the design work for the men's kit is likely already done, leaving precious little room for adjustment.

But we can always hope they get it right. The task at hand for the USMNT and Nike is two-fold: create an iconic design, and live up to it. If they do, Nike likely won't be able to print enough jerseys to meet demand. If they come up with something forgettable – and if the team itself puts on a forgettable performance – the shirts will only prove as evidence of a painful, embarrassing memory.

The new Nike-designed kits are called “Brilliant” and “Heartbeat,” and were designed with input from Lynn Biyendolo, Naomi Girma, and Sophia Wilson.

US Soccer has two exciting new National Team kits that will be worn for the first time in the coming months, and one of them is specifically for the USWNT. The Nike kits were developed in collaboration with USWNT players Lynn Biyendolo, Naomi Girma, and Sophia Wilson and USMNT players Kellyn Acosta, DeAndre Yedlin and Walker Zimmerman.

The new light kit, called “Brilliant,” will be worn only by the USWNT, and was designed as a tribute to the history of the women's national team. It features a white background of stars with red and blue details.

“This collection represents Nike's deep commitment to women's soccer as an undeniable force that continues to elevate the game globally,” said Maggie Gauger, Vice President/GM, Nike North America Women's Business. “The refreshed designs honor the brilliance of the U.S. Women's National Team — celebrating 40 years of legacy, resilience, and groundbreaking achievements both on and off the pitch.” 

“To me, the kits represent the USWNT mentality of always pushing forward,” said USWNT player Lynn Biyendolo. “I know I can speak for my teammates when I say that every time we put on the uniform, it brings a great sense of pride. When we represent our country, our team and ourselves, we know we are doing so while standing on the shoulders of giants. The Brilliant Kit is just another way to honor our past and the women who played before us.”

The second kit, a dark kit called “Heartbeat,” will be worn by both the USWNT and USMNT. It features vertical red and blue stripes on a dark background. According to a press release, the kit is dedicated to fans and features a “heritage-meets-streetstyle aesthetic.” 

“As the game evolves, the style evolves,” said USMNT player Mark McKenzie. “There's a modern edge to this (Heartbeat) kit, a sleekness that catches the eye. But it doesn't lose sight of what this crest stands for, the history etched in the red, white, and blue threads. The kit pays tribute to our fans and the importance of their connection to the team. It's a reminder of who we play for and what we represent every single time we step onto that field. Not much more you can ask for!”

The Brilliant kit will be debuted by the USWNT on May 31st in Saint Paul when they play China PR.

The Heartbeat kit will be worn by the USMNT on June 7th at their game in East Hartford, Connecticut against Turkey. The USMNT will continue to wear their current home kits.

There's a new complete women's set as well, including the lighter “brilliant kit.” Both were designed in collaboration with women's players Lynn (Williams) Biyendolo, Naomi Girma and Sophia (Smith) Wilson, and men's players Kellyn Acosta, DeAndre Yedlin and Walker Zimmerman. The designs, U.S. Soccer says, celebrate the legacy of its teams and the “passion of U.S. Soccer fans across the country.”

The men's kit, which they'll debut on June 7 in a friendly against Turkey, is evocative of the 2007 “Copa” kits that were only worn for a single year. It's a vintage design that remains a favorite these days, and Nike and U.S. Soccer have done well to emulate it, even if perhaps unintentionally.

The men's shirts, though, pale in comparison to the new women's kits, which offers a callback to the denim kit. The washed-out stars, the red-and-blue trim around the neck … even the sublimated, vertical stripes are reminiscent of the USMNT's home kit at the ‘94 World Cup, the “wavy flag” design that never quite achieved the notoriety of Moore's other design that year.

The women's “brilliant” design, which will be debuted on May 31 in a friendly vs. China, frankly would not make a bad men's World Cup shirt. The women's kits have been largely aligned with the men's kits for years, and the women's team has done just as much, if not more, to solidify the legacies of some of those designs. (The men will be sticking with their current white kits for the time being.)

One thing feels certain enough: whatever the USMNT ends up wearing in 2026 needs to be daring and bold and brash. U.S. Soccer, and Nike, need to look to iconic designs of the past – the denim kit, or the “bomb pops” – to determine their course for the tournament. It feels easy enough to argue that this tournament could prove the most pivotal moment in the history of American men's soccer – maybe even bigger than the ‘94 tournament – and the U.S. needs to be equipped with something memorable.

There are risks, of course. Had the USMNT crashed out in the group stage in ‘94, for example, it feels almost certain that the denim kit would've become a punchline, the latest example of how decision-makers in American soccer had “gotten it wrong.” Take the oversized Nike kits, the ones the USMNT wore in 1998. They're not bad-looking on the surface, but the design itself is imbued with the team's failure in France, a painful memory.

The opposite, of course, also holds true. Fans adore the bomb pops not only because they broke the trend of “clean” design, but because of Clint Dempsey or John Brooks celebrating goals in it at the 2014 World Cup. USWNT fans love the 2019 kits – which, on the surface are a little bland – not because of the design itself but because of the World Cup the women won in it, something that can be said for their 1999 kits as well.

As for the denim kit? Fans love it because of Wynalda, Lalas, Harkes and the lot on those sun-drenched fields. Nike can only get so close to the denim kit before it runs into copyright and intellectual property issues with Adidas, a chief competitor. And it's worth noting that as design cycles go, much of the design work for the men's kit is likely already done, leaving precious little room for adjustment.

But we can always hope they get it right. The task at hand for the USMNT and Nike is two-fold: create an iconic design, and live up to it. If they do, Nike likely won't be able to print enough jerseys to meet demand. If they come up with something forgettable – and if the team itself puts on a forgettable performance – the shirts will only prove as evidence of a painful, embarrassing memory.

GOAL ranks the top-13 USMNT prospects at or under the age of 21

America is always on the lookout for the next big homegrown soccer talent — and with good reason. The U.S. men's national team continues to make meaningful strides, and sometimes all it takes is an influx of talent to reach the next level.

Landon Donovan was once that rising star, as were Clint Dempsey, Brian McBride, Tab Ramos, and Steve Cherundolo. Christian Pulisic, who was a highly-touted prospect, continues to defy expectations, and now, with the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, a new generation is preparing to make its mark.

So who's next? Which rising stars could play a role in this World Cup cycle, and which ones should fans be watching closely?

Paxten Aaronson, Jack McGlynn, Cavan Sullivan, Diego Luna, and Diego Kochen headline the list, thanks to their rapid development and growing reputations. Others like Damion Downs, Julian Hall, Noahkai Banks, and Josh Wynder may be less known, but they possess serious upside. In between, there's Borussia Dortmund's Cole Campbell, Inter Miami's Benjamin Cremaschi — Lionel Messi's young teammate — and Chelsea's promising duo of Gabriel Slonina and Caleb Wiley, all pushing to take the next step.

Christian Pulisic has been one of the few high points in an otherwise rocky season for AC Milan which has, naturally, attracted him several admirers.

The U.S. Men's National Team captain, 26, is the Rossoneri's leading scorer this season with 17 in all competitions, whilst also having provided a further 11 assists across 47 appearances.

Only Pulisic's second season in Serie A, since making the switch from Premier League side Chelsea for $25.9 million, his 32 goals already surpasses his total of 27 from his four seasons in London.

Unsurprisingly, Pulisic's career rebirth has prompted Milan to engage in talks to extend his current contract, which is set to expire in the summer of 2027. However, it now seems the Pennsylvanian may be tempted to weigh up his options before putting pen to paper on a new deal in Italy.

While said to be “happy in Milan,” Pulisic “wants to know Milan's plans for next season,” according to Orazio Accomando, who added that he remains “especially popular in the Premier League.” Exactly which teams are currently keen on the American remains unclear.

That being said, prior to the January transfer window, Manchester United, Liverpool, and West Ham United were all linked with the American, as per Calciomercato.

This news comes a matter of days after it emerged that Milan were planning their summer rebuild around just a handful of players, including Pulisic, Tijjani Reijnders, and potentially Mike Maignan and Theo Hernandez - although their futures remain uncertain, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.

A proposed new deal for Pulisic could see him secure a significant pay increase, going from $4.56 million per year to $5.7 million, via Goal. This new deal would run through the summer of 2029.

Milan's desire to keep hold of Pulisic is no surprise, especially given that he recently became the first player since Zlatan Ibrahimovic to score at least 15 goals in each of their first two seasons with the Rossoneri.

But while Pulisic may be loved in Milan, the tumultuous situation the team finds itself in may give Pulisic cause for concern when it comes to committing his long-term future to the team.

Currently eighth in Serie A with just two games to go, Milan would need various slip-ups to fall in their favor over the coming weeks if they're to secure European soccer for next season via the league. Alternatively, their best bet to ensure another year of continental competition would be to win their upcoming Coppa Italia final against Bologna, with the winner awarded a UEFA Europa League spot.

This would also mark Milan's second piece of silverware this season, following their Supercoppa Italiana win in January.

Whether they lift another trophy this season or not, it seems that they will be looking for a new head coach in the summer regardless, with Sergio Conceicao's future continually thrown into question, and the Portuguese boss said to be ready to leave even if they win the final, as per Sempre Milan.

Mic'd Up: The ESPN analyst talked all things Club World Cup, and backed American fans to show up for FIFA's event this summer 

Kay Murray has been in the United States long enough to get a read on American fans. The Middlesbrough, England native spent her early years working in British and European television, embedding herself in the supporter culture across the pond.

What never fails to surprise her, though, is just how much American fans have shown they love the game.

""I've been to a Clasico friendly here in the United States and it was fabulous,"" she tells GOAL. ""It was absolutely packed. And I have found that whenever I've gone to preseason games that I think there's not going to be too many people, the fans come out in force all the time.""

And she has a point. Preseason games in the States are always well attended - especially when big clubs are involved. It's something that FIFA will undoubtedly be counting on this summer, when the Club World Cup comes to the U.S. 

The expanded, 32-team tournament - which includes MLS sides Inter Miami and Seattle Sounders, with LAFC also a potential participant - will bring a month of global soccer to America, with some of the best teams in the world vying for a trophy, as well as a generous pot of cash.

Murray is certain that when the games start, teams will want to win. She says the money - a total pot of $1B, with up to $125M for the winning team - will be a real motivator.

""I think we often ask these questions, and when it comes to it, we always find out that they do actually care,"" she said about whether clubs will be incentivized to win. ""In this day and age, everybody wants whatever they can call silverware. What might be deemed less important silverware to the outsider is pretty much always important to those inside the club.""

The ESPN analyst talked all things Club World Cup in Mic'd Up, a recurring feature in which GOAL US taps into the perspective of broadcasters, analysts, and other pundits on the state of soccer in the U.S. and abroad.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

Argentina's minister of national security Patricia Bullrich sent a list to the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires on Monday that included the names of more than 15,000 violent soccer fans who will be banned from attending this summer's Club World Cup.

""The list includes more than 15,000 people who will be banned from stadiums,"" Bullrich said, per Reuters. ""For us, this is extremely important because no violent person who has committed any crime in Argentine stadiums will be able to attend this sporting event.""

The list of names was created through the ""Tribuna Segura"" program, which detects people who have been banned from stadiums in Argentina.

""Since the beginning of this government, 'Tribuna Segura' has monitored more than four million people in 1,328 matches,"" Bullrich, who has been in her current role since 2023, when Javier Milei became the president of Argentina, said. ""We have detected 1,166 people with arrest warrants and have issued more than 40 administrative resolutions restricting entry to stadiums.""

The Club World Cup, which will take place in the U.S. from June 14 to July 13, will have two teams from Argentina taking part – Boca Juniors and River Plate. Boca Juniors were placed into Group C and will take on Germany's Bayern Munich, Portugal's Benfica and New Zealand's Auckland City in the group stage. River Plate, meanwhile, are in Group F and will play Italy's Inter, Mexico's Monterrey and Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds in the group stage.

Having been way off the title pace in the Premier League this season, Manchester City are already looking to start afresh by releasing their new home kit for the 2025-26 campaign.

Sure, Pep Guardiola's side can still claim a major trophy in Saturday's English FA Cup final against Crystal Palace (stream LIVE at 11:30 a.m. ET on ESPN+), but after an early exit from the UEFA Champions League and potentially finishing more than 20 points behind champions Liverpool in the Premier League, they will be happy to see the back of the 2024-25 season and anything that reminds them of it.

As such, City are so eager to get into next season's kit that they will be wearing it at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. The newly expanded tournament, which runs from June 14-July 13 and features 32 teams, will feature City playing at least three group-stage matches: against Morocco's Wydad AC in Philadelphia on June 18, the UAE's Al-Ain in Atlanta on June 22 and Serie A giants Juventus in Orlando on June 26.

The big news regarding the jersey is that is that City are bringing back the sash which, while a semi-regular sight on their away and third kits since it was first introduced during the 1970s, has never been used to adorn their home shirt before. Laid over a traditional sky-blue base is a wispy white diagonal band that looks like a feathery cirrus cloud running from the left shoulder to the right hemline.

The shirt -- as modelled by City stars including Phil Foden, Oscar Bobb, Alex Greenwood and Erling Haaland -- also has white detailing on the sleeves and the back of the collar.

A dual-color sash first appeared on City's alternate kits in the 1972-73 season and has been given intermittent retro revivals throughout the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Perhaps the most memorable modern iteration was the 2009-2011 third shirt, which ploughed a nostalgic furrow with a white base and red-and-black sash.

If City can go into next season as reigning world champions, something they first achieved in 2023 under the Club World Cup's former and far smaller format, then the new sash home kit may well become an instant classic among the club's fans.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Filed under:

The Englishman may be leaving but he is still needed in Bavarian.

Eric Dier's move from Bayern Munich to AS Monaco on a free transfer is more or less a done deal, with Bayern already confirming the Englishman's departure and reports indicating that Dier has already signed a deal for the 2017 Ligue 1 champions. Still, his time at Bayern may not be over just yet.

Despite moving Dier on, the club has short term injury concerns in the center of defense. Dayot Upamecano is currently battling to return from a months long injury, Kim Min-Jae has been fighting with Achilles problems for months and needs a break and Hiroki Itō broke his metatarsal again and will be out for an indefinite period of time. Bayern has already wrapped up the Bundesliga title, but the start of the FIFA Club World Cup is just about a month away, at the time of writing, and there is a chance none of the other center backs will return in time.

So Bayern may still need Dier for a little longer and are willing to make the necessary concessions, via Maximilian Koch (and captured by @iMiaSanMia):

Due to the injury concerns in defense, Bayern are considering giving Eric Dier a short-term contract in order to be able to play at the Club World Cup.

Board member for sport Max Eberl recently hinted that outgoing players may not be required to stay at Bayern for the Club World Cup, but Dier's contract in Munich lasts until end of the group stages of the tournament. An extension would likely see the former Tottenham Hotspur player remain at the club until the tournament is over. But would Monaco allow this to happen? Would Dier be willing to wait two weeks to start his adventure in France? Let's see.

MANCHESTER CITY have unveiled their kit for the 2025/26 season and dropped a hint over Jack Grealish's future.

Pep Guardiola's side will wear the new home shirt at this summer's Club World Cup in the US.

Puma have gone for a white sash across the club's iconic sky blue jersey.

The diagonal stripe is a nod to City kits from the 70s as it has been seen on old away strips.

Grealish is one of the stars modelling the new look alongside the likes of Phil Foden, Erling Halaand and Mateo Kovacic.

And fans reckon having him as the poster boy suggests he is staying at City beyond the summer.

It comes amid rumours of Grealish's departure after a tough season in which he has scored just three goals and started only seven Premier League games.

Tottenham, Aston Villa and Napoli are all interested in signing him.

Grealish was not, however, seen in the promotional video to launch the new kit.

The clip stars actor John Thompson hosting a talent show as stars like Foden, Haaland, Manuel Akanji, Oscar Bobb and Ederson take to the stage to perform.

Former players Micah Richards, Joleon Lescott and Mike Summerbee also have cameo roles.

The video was filmed at the Clayton Official Supporters Club just around the corner from the Etihad Stadium.

Puma say the sash home shirt ""creates a connection to the past with a futuristic design, bridging the gap between different generations of City fans"".

The German sportswear brand's chief Marco Mueller said: “We're so excited to be featuring the iconic sash, made famous from away days of old, on the home kit for the first time.



""Both in this kit and all our kits for this upcoming season, fans across the world will be reminded that with our partnership we do things differently and want to push the boundaries in terms of design, creativity and innovation”.

The kit is available in the City shop for £85 and the authentic jersey costs £130.

...

The upcoming summer promises to be a criticial one for Real Madrid following how things have gone for them in the ongoing campaign.

Even though the Merengues won the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, they have missed out the major trophies – with Barcelona knocking them out of the La Liga title race and beating them in the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup finals.

Naturally, some major changes are set to take place, starting with the imminent departure of Carlo Ancelotti and the impending arrival of Xabi Alonso.

New signings are also on the horizon, with Trent Alexander-Arnold set to join on a free transfer in the coming days.

As such, Fabrizio Romano now confirms that Real Madrid will bid goodbye to veteran star Lucas Vazquez this summer, potentially after the FIFA Club World Cup.

Vazquez has spent 18 years at the club, having joined the Real Madrid academy all the way back in 2007. It was in 2015 that he made his first-team breakthrough and the 33-year-old has stayed an important part of the setup ever since.

A four-time La Liga champion and a five-time UEFA Champions League winner, Vazquez transformed from a winger to a right-back in recent seasons and has been largely reliable, although his performances have been a letdown this season.

With Alexander-Arnold set to arrive and Dani Carvajal also closing in on a return from his long-term injury absence, Vazquez no longer has a place in the squad.

Currently injured, the 33-year-old Spaniard's contract expires on June 30, but there is an agreement for him to play for Real Madrid until the end of the Club World Cup in July, following which the veteran defender will go his separate ways.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Aaron Ramsey made his Wales debut against Denmark in November 2008

Aaron Ramsey is at a crossroads.

As a generational Welsh talent, captain of his country and veteran of three major tournaments, his legendary status is already secure.

Mind you, the former Arsenal midfielder would say any talk of legacy is premature because, although he has enjoyed his first taste of management with boyhood club Cardiff City, Ramsey still wants to keep playing.

At 34 years old, that seems a plausible ambition for a man who has graced the Premier League, Serie A and Champions League, and scored in two FA Cup finals.

But after another luckless run of injuries, Ramsey is out of contract at Cardiff, who will be playing in the third tier next season for the first time since 2003.

Would a player of his class drop down to League One? And which other clubs would want to sign him now, given his fitness issues?

Will Ramsey turn to management instead? He relished his brief stint in charge of Cardiff despite their relegation from the Championship, and he has been tipped for a bright future as a coach.

Ramsey has a choice to make as he embarks on a summer of significant change.

Ramsey 'doesn't know' what Cardiff future holds

'This storm has been coming' – how Cardiff lost way

Ramsey 'gutted' but backs Cardiff for instant return

Ramsey has said he wants to continue playing next season, but that in itself comes with uncertainty.

The 34-year-old's Cardiff contract expires this summer and, while the option of another year is written into the deal, he has not yet committed either way.

Matters are complicated by the fact Ramsey is still recovering from a hamstring injury which has kept him out of action for two months and requires further rehabilitation.

By his own admission, Ramsey's return to his boyhood club ""hasn't materialised how we wanted"" because of a ""very frustrating"" series of injuries which have severely limited his playing time.

Since rejoining Cardiff in 2023, the midfielder has started only 13 league games plus two in the FA Cup as well as making eight substitute appearances in the Championship.

""He still wants to play,"" former Wales striker Iwan Roberts told the Feast of Football podcast. ""But is his body going to allow him?

""I think this [management] is the natural progression for Aaron with all the injuries he's had for quite a long period.""

Although Ramsey is earning nowhere near the amount of money he was on at Arsenal or Juventus, the Bluebirds still had to push the boat out financially to bring him back to the Championship.

In League One, he would almost certainly need to take another pay cut.

According to those who know Ramsey best, he is a homebird who would be reluctant to move his family again towards the end of a career which has already taken him from London to Turin and then Nice, via Glasgow.

One of the main reasons for signing with Cardiff for a third stint was to settle down in south Wales with his wife Colleen and their three children.

It would need to be a compelling offer for Ramsey to consider moving now and, despite his standing in the game, his circumstances might limit the amount of potential suitors vying for his signature.

Captain Aaron Ramsey has played for Wales at three major tournaments and has 86 caps, scoring 21 goals

If he was to stay, would playing in League One hamper his chances of being included in Wales' squad for the 2026 World Cup should they qualify?

""I don't know,"" Ramsey said. ""I don't know what's going to happen. At the moment I'm still in the early stages of rehab [from the hamstring injury] and I'm going to carry on with that.""

Ramsey would not be the first third-tier player to represent Wales, who have picked from League Two and the Cymru Premier in the past.

However, playing in League One would represent a significant step down for a man who has spent the vast majority of his career at the highest levels of European football.

Ramsey has publicly stated that representing his country at a second World Cup is a factor in his desire to continue playing; there is a sense of unfinished business given how dismally Wales exited at the group stage in 2022.

But he was off the pace in Qatar and still only 31 at that point, as a lack of regular club football caught up with him and, in Ramsey's defence, many of his team-mates.

Four years on in the United States, Canada and Mexico, it is likely his powers will only have waned further.

That was one of the reasons for fellow midfielder Joe Allen's decision to retire last week.

""My instinct told me I wasn't going to get there [2026 World Cup],"" said Allen, who like Ramsey, was a shadow of his former self in Qatar.

""Or, if I did get there, it wasn't going to be at the level I wanted to be representing my country at a World Cup.""

Allen knew the time was right to step aside. A Welsh football great as he undoubtedly is, it had become apparent the 35-year-old could no longer reach the high standards he demanded of himself.

The same could be said of Ramsey but, unlike his long-time former Wales team-mate, he does not feel he is quite ready to let go.

Should Ramsey choose to retire and focus on management, he got a glimpse of how his future might look in the opposition dugout earlier this month.

Cardiff ended their ill-fated Championship season with a 4-2 defeat at Norwich City, who were under the temporary guidance of Ramsey's former Arsenal midfield partner Jack Wilshere.

Although Wilshere, 33, is a year younger than Ramsey, the ex-England international has already been retired three years after an injury-ravaged career.

He started coaching with Arsenal Under-18s and joined Norwich's staff earlier this season, before overseeing two games as caretaker manager.

There are plenty who want Ramsey to take the reins at Cardiff on a full-time basis, even though he has expressed his desire to keep playing.

""I think he's got the pedigree, there won't be much pressure on him in League One,"" said his former Bluebirds team-mate Michael Chopra.

""If Cardiff stayed in the Championship I would have been a bit wary of giving him the job but I think it's the perfect opportunity for Aaron.

""He knows the area, he's a Cardiff fan. If he's not going to get a chance at Cardiff City, where else is he going to get a chance of being a football manager?""

That is a sentiment shared by numerous Bluebirds supporters too, but one of Ramsey's coaching inspirations has urged caution.

Although Wales boss Craig Bellamy has backed Ramsey to manage ""at a high level"", he suggested earlier this season the Cardiff job might have become available a little too soon.

Former team-mates for Cardiff and Wales, now reunited as captain and head coach at international level, Ramsey and Bellamy enjoy a close working relationship.

Even outside of international windows, the two will meet at Dragon Park, the Wales National Football Development Centre in Newport, to discuss tactics and other aspects of the game.

Aaron Ramsey had no managerial experience before becoming the third man to take charge of Cardiff this season

It was no surprise, therefore, that Bellamy was Ramsey's first port of call when he was made Cardiff's caretaker manager some 48 hours before his first game in charge.

""I spoke to Bellers [Bellamy] quite a bit. He's helped me out quite a lot in that 24, 48 hours,"" Ramsey said after that match.

""We didn't have a lot of time to work on tactical things, so I didn't want to overload the players with too much information. We had a day to do that. We had to take in a bit from meetings, but it was more about trying to get your principles across and habits.""

It was striking how similar Ramsey was to Bellamy as a coach, not only in the way he set up his team but in the way he spoke about the game afterwards.

Habits and principles are key buzzwords of Bellamy's burgeoning Wales tenure and, less than a year into the job, he has already had a major effect on his players – evident in Ramsey's three games in charge of Cardiff.

Like Bellamy, Ramsey's teams set out to be aggressive off the ball, pressing their opponents intensely and high up the field, while the aim in possession is to dominate, playing out from the back and attacking wherever possible.

Having spent a decade playing under Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, Ramsey will also take inspiration from the legendary three-time Premier League winner who signed him from Cardiff when he was 17 years old.

""I think what Arsene instilled in us is having that freedom to go and express ourselves, having that sense of confidence from him to go out there and to do that,"" said Ramsey.

""That's something that I'll take throughout my managerial career, giving the players the confidence to go out there and express themselves.""

Young coaches making their way in the game often talk about the qualities they would like to take from their former bosses – while still maintaining their own clear identity, being their own person.

One thing Ramsey has ruled out for now is being a player-manager. Bellamy worked under Vincent Kompany while the former Manchester City captain played that dual role at Anderlecht, and the Wales head coach has warned Ramsey against doing the same.

That is not to say he would need to put his coaching on hold completely even if he was to continue in midfield.

When he was injured earlier this season, Ramsey sat in the stands and analysed games, sharing his findings with Cardiff's coaches on the touchline.

He already has his A Licence and next on his list will be the Pro Licence, the highest coaching qualification.

Ramsey has already taken his first steps in management but, before committing fully to life as a coach, the Wales captain must decide when he comes to the end of the road as a player.

Local artist John Rego chosen to illustrate FIFA World Cup 2026 poster

New England has been selected to host the FIFA World Cup in 2026, and Rhode Island native John Rego has been selected to illustrate the event's official poster.

John Rego, originally from Warren, Rhode Island, now lives in Boston as an illustration professor at the Massachusetts College of Art. Rego both illustrates and paints, and ultimately chose an illustration for this project. Together with the help of students at the school, Rego compiled a Boston Harbor-themed illustration for the poster, showcasing some of New England's most iconic representations. The poster includes depictions of a lobster, the Bunker Hill Monument, the Tall Ships, the Tea Party, and the Gloucester Sea Monster, to name a few.

""We invited illustration students to help with the poster and get a firsthand look at the process of working as a professional artist. While I created the illustration, the poster aimed to elevate the student's voices and depict what Boston means to them,"" said Rego.

You will see his poster used to promote the World Cup taking place in June and July 2026 across the United States and Mexico.

LA is poised to host the World Cup, transforming the city's local economy and leading to economic growth. 


Drama, passion and joy are set to fuel another summer as the World Cup takes over iconic North American stadiums in Los Angeles (LA) for the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) 2026 tournament. 

The most recent edition of this soccer or fútbol tournament drew an impressive attendance of 3.4 million individuals, a number nearly equivalent to the entire population of Uruguay. While many dedicated soccer fans around the world look forward to this event every four years, there is criticism from the public about the expenses associated with building large stadiums to support crowds that are frequently abandoned, despite massive investment.

However, with California's stable economy, facilities to support urban populations and stadiums capable of hosting large crowds, the 2026 FIFA World Cup will bring significant economic gains without the hefty price tag that has damaged past host countries. The event will be an economic boost for LA as it will generate revenue through increased tourism, provide new job opportunities and bring recognition to the soccer industry, not just as a sport, but as a global event worth celebrating. 

The FIFA World Cup will bring more money off the field due to a substantial boost in tourism revenue, directly benefiting California's economy. It is expected to generate $343 million in direct spending just from an estimated 179,200 out-of-town visitors drawn in by the grandeur of the tournament. With increasing global recognition for soccer and an influx of tourists pulled in by the World Cup celebrations, LA is expected to gain an extra $230.4 million in future tourism revenue. 

The average tourist will spend $2,35 on travel, food, housing and shopping, generating much-needed tax income for the state to support companies and their staff. This illustrates the economic multiplier effect, where increased spending sources lead to greater economic activity. Eventually, the original amount spent by tourists cascades through local businesses to hotel employees, drivers, waiters and food vendors, creating economic incentives surrounding this event. 

The additional money from new sales and occupancy tax revenues — taxes collected from hotel stays and short-term lodging — can be directly used to improve diminishing urban infrastructure, support upgrades to local public transportation and provide funding to alleviate the homelessness crisis in LA. Better transportation infrastructure would boost productivity and efficiency, which in turn would stimulate economic growth and future tourism. Some of these new revenues can also be used to fund long-term solutions to aid the reintegration of the state's homeless population into the workforce, such as transitional housing programs and mental health care. 

By investing money in long-term interventions, LA can better address issues of homelessness while simultaneously increasing employment opportunities and improving overall quality of life. Tourist-generated revenue can yield more economic opportunities than drawbacks, which will improve consumer and investor confidence in purchasing goods, investing in companies and overall business growth. As a result, California's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will increase, demonstrating how the FIFA World Cup 2026 will help build a better LA. 

Furthermore, the 2026 FIFA World Cup is expected to be a great investment for California's economy by increasing the availability of employment and wages. In hosting just eight World Cup games in LA, wages will increase by $243.2 million from new jobs and added working hours for existing employees. Additionally, this sporting event will create new job opportunities to support the stadiums and merchandise booths and extended work hours in various industries to support the demand of crowds during the games. 

While much of the increased workload will be temporary in hospitality, food service and transportation, these jobs can still provide valuable experience and transferable skills for future employment. As the tournament is scheduled for summer, the boost in employment opportunities will be particularly beneficial for students, teachers and seasonal workers with specific scheduling restrictions. 

Many of these new jobs will not require a college degree, making them more accessible to individuals from low-income backgrounds, as a large proportion of young United States (U.S.) workers without a college degree are concentrated in customer service representative and construction laborer occupations. With extra work hours, employees will gain more disposable income, which will be pumped back into the local economy, driving further consumption and stimulating economic growth.

Increased Major League Soccer (MLS) audience and merchandise sales in LA would economically benefit the local population. The MLS revenue would provide the cash to pay for the wages of those who work for clubs such as LA Football Club (LAFC) and LA Galaxy (LA Galaxy), supporting hundreds of households. 

 

In addition, local sports firms gain monetary value from the revenue created by LA MLS teams because many of their goods and merchandise are handled by third-party sellers like soccer shops and sports stores. Media and sponsorship growth from the tournament will generate employment and investment, which would significantly advance the economic well-being of California and the U.S. by inspiring dreams and paying bills.

The World Cup can also provide significant socioeconomic benefits by fostering growth within the soccer industry. Soccer's popularity has been rapidly increasing in the U.S. In fact, the revenue generated in the soccer industry is projected to reach $5.43 billion in 2026, compared to the $4.33 billion generated in 2024. The passion and excitement fans have about the tournament can positively impact youth participation and registration for academy and club soccer teams, thereby stimulating the job market as more coach and instructor positions become available. Expenses associated with playing soccer, such as facility fees and access to specific athletic gear, can also contribute to local sporting goods stores and boost local market economies.   

Soccer's unique position as a global sport can bring communities together and promote collective celebrations in the form of watch parties. Other positive externalities or indirect benefits from the growing popularity of the soccer industry also include improved public health and greater community engagement. Research shows that participation in soccer improves cardiovascular health, coordination and mental health. Playing soccer can also work as a protective factor in preventing non-communicable diseases, such as obesity and hypertension. 

Some argue that despite economic benefits, the expenses set aside for the World Cup should be allocated elsewhere. In previous host countries, the money needed to successfully run this competition became an unbearable burden due to significant infrastructure construction and wage costs, which tend to rest in the hands of unwilling owners of private stadiums or a struggling government. Qatar spent $220 billion to build brand new stadiums, housing, parking and sporting facilities for the entire competition. However, these factors don't hold true for the 2026 edition of the tournament. 

The U.S. already has established stadiums that host the National Football League (NFL) and MLS, such as SoFi Stadium and Levi's Stadium, and the benefits of hosting a large-scale event like the World Cup would include infrastructure development, cultural exchange, sports growth and job creation. 

Therefore, the costs for the U.S. will be very minimal compared to prior nations. FIFA and the World Trade Organization (WTO) expect a $47 billion economic output from the World Cup. With these existing supports, the 2026 World Cup is an opportunity for the U.S. to not just host an international spectacle, but to be able to do so with a minimal financial burden.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is more than a global sporting event — it is a transformative economic opportunity for the city of LA and the U.S. It will provide a lasting boost through increased tourism, expanded employment opportunities and growth in the soccer market by introducing the sport to new players.

The Senegal striker's red card against Newcastle kickstarted a pile-on, but he is not the only guilty party in the chaos of the BlueCo regime

You have to be clever and cunning to get away with football's 'dark arts'. It's not only a matter of being snide, but deceitful and dastardly like a cartoon villain. Think about Jose Mourinho in Tottenham's Amazon Prime documentary telling his new players they must behave like 'intelligent c*nts'.

Well, there was nothing intelligent about Nicolas Jackson's elbow square to the jaw of poor Sven Botman during Chelsea's trip to Newcastle on Sunday, one which ended with his dismissal and the Blues losing 2-0 in what was effectively a six-pointer in the race to secure Champions League qualification. There was no attempt to hide Jackson's contempt, staring down the defender long before the high ball from goalkeeper Robert Sanchez had returned to Earth, before planting his pointed forearm straight into the Dutchman's unsuspecting face. And he would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for that meddling VAR.

The knives were quickly out for Jackson, which was a fair reaction and reflection having acted so daftly rather than deftly in Chelsea's biggest game of the season so far. Defeat at St James' Park has left them just about in the Premier League's top five, only leading sixth-place Aston Villa on goal difference with two matches remaining. The club are desperate to secure a lucrative return to the Champions League, but blame cannot be solely or directly pointed at Jackson if they fall short now - this is a downfall of Chelsea's own making.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Red Devils are in a worse position in the Premier League than when the Portuguese took charge, and his negative comments are not helping his cause

Sunday should have been a day to savour for Manchester United fans. Old Trafford was lit up by glorious sunshine, the stadium had just enjoyed one of its best occasions in recent memory in the comeback win over Athletic Club and everyone was looking forward to the Europa League final. What's more, in front of United were a team they had not lost at home to in 18 years and who have had an even worse season than them.

But West Ham had too much for the Red Devils, and it looked as if was all too much for Ruben Amorim, who did not try to hide his contempt for United's players in a frank and damning post-match press conference. After speaking his mind to a surprising degree in his first few weeks as manager, from calling his team the worst in the club's history and making jaw-dropping remarks about Antony and Marcus Rashford, there was a sense in recent weeks that Amorim had mellowed. His conversations with the media had become normal affairs rather than box-office events. But on Sunday, he was mad as Hell and he wasn't going to take it any more.

In a breathless display, Amorim took aim at his players for not showing enough urgency to defend their box or when attacking. He declared that United had lost the sense that they were a big club as they were so ready to accept defeat. He urged the club to be ""really strong, be brave in the summer"", which was a thinly-veiled plea to Sir Jim Ratcliffe to let him overhaul the squad. And he warned that if things did not improve next season he might have to quit. That is, if he is not sacked first.

The tirade begged the question: Is Amorim capable of succeeding at United or will he be gone by the end of the year and become the seventh managerial casualty of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era?","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

If you didn't know the entire drama behind the Jannik Sinner suspension, you could be fooled into thinking that the world No. 1 has been playing throughout the entire spring. He dropped into the Internazionali BNL d'Italia last week and has plowed his way into the round of 16. But the fact is that he had a three-month layoff and his fourth-round match against Francisco Cerundolo is the first time he will be put to the test.

Cerundolo, a scrappy Argentine, is playing fantastic clay-court tennis. He and Sinner have split their previous matches 2-2, and the world No. 18 won their only match on clay. Still, it's hard to draw too many conclusions based on that alone. Their last meeting was in 2023 before Sinner became the major-winning champion he is today. Look for Cerundolo to challenge Sinner in this one. Yes, the Italian will be playing in front of an enthusiastic home crowd–but Cerundolo is just playing too well to give in too easily. Sinner should pull through, but not without some effort.

(8) Lorenzo Musetti vs. (10) Daniil Medvedev

Daniil Medvedev has had some good success on the clay courts of Rome. This was the most recent title he has won, surprisingly, all the way back in 2023. It's also his only career clay title. But whether it will be enough to overcome his comparatively lackluster form remains to be seen. Medvedev played pretty well in Monte-Carlo a few weeks ago, when he reached the quarterfinals. But he has just come up short more often than not in 2025. That he faces Lorenzo Musetti in the fourth round is not good news for the Russian.

Musetti Is enjoying some of the best form of any player on the ATP Tour right now. The Italian made the final in Monte-Carlo and the semis in Madrid, and now he is also playing with home-court advantage. All of this spells trouble for Medvedev's prospects to make it into the business end of the tournament. Not only is Musetti a better clay-court player generally, he is also in superior form. The eighth seed may well make it a short day at the office on Tuesday. He has all the momentum and while he has played a lot of tennis in the run-up to the French Open, he also had the chance to rest in between Madrid and Rome.

Sinner – Cerundolo: 13.05.2025 15:00 CEST
H2H: 2-2

Jannik Sinner has won 26 straight matches. He is returning to competitive tennis after serving a three-month suspension related to anti-doping procedures. This week in Rome, Sinner easily won his opening-round match against Navone in straight sets. In the third round, he defeated de Jong in straight sets.

Francisco Cerundolo has won four of his last five matches. This week in Rome, Cerundolo won the opening match against Jarry in straight sets. Ofner also had no answer for Cerundolo's game in the third round. Last season in Rome, Khachanov stopped him in the third round.

According to the bookies, Sinner is the big favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. Cerundolo is a clay-court specialist in great form. He has already defeated Sinner twice. We expect him to put up a big fight and keep this match tight.

That being said, Cerundolo covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Francisco Cerundolo +4.5 games handicap @1.73 @bet365

Paul – De Minaur: 13.05.2025 18:30 CEST
H2H: 0-5

Tommy Paul has won four of his last five matches. This week in Rome, Paul won the opening round match against Bautista-Agut in straight sets. He struggled in the third round against Machac, winning in three tight sets.

Alex de Minaur has won four of his last five matches. This week in Rome, de Minaur won both matches in straight sets but also had a favourable draw.

According to the bookies, de Minaur is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is a better clay-court player than Paul. De Minaur played on clay courts in Spain under similar conditions for several years. On the other hand, Paul never succeeded on clay courts.

That being said, de Minaur winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Alex de Minaur winning @1.53 @bet365

Munar – Ruud: 13.05.2025 20:30 CEST
H2H: 1-5

Jaume Munar has won three of his last five matches. This week in Rome, Munar demolished Shelton in the second round. He easily defeated Korda in straight sets in the third round, as we had predicted. The Spaniard lost against Norrie in the second round last season in Rome.

Casper Ruud has won eight straight matches. Last week in Madrid, Ruud won the Masters 1000 title, defeating Draper in the final. This week in Rome, Ruud had to fight hard against Bublik in the second round. After losing the second set 4-6, the Norwegian served great in the third round and deservedly won. In the third round, Berrettini retired mid-match against Ruud.

According to the bookies, Ruud is the big favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. He played many matches in the last couple of weeks and will probably not be fully fit for this match. On the other hand, Munar played his best tennis this week in Rome, and we expect him to keep this match tight.

That being said, Munar covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jaume Munar +4.5 games handicap @2.00 @bet365

Lorenzo Musetti was on the edge of victory on Tuesday at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, until rain halted his charge toward the finish line.

The Italian led Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 5-4, 30/30 where heavy showers swept through the Foro Italico at 4:38 p.m. local time. While fans rushed for cover, Musetti and Medvedev continued. The 23-year-old remained composed on court, crafting a delicate drop shot that barely bounced on the damp clay to bring up match point.




But that's when the drama paused. With Musetti perched on the verge of victory, the chair umpire suspended play. Musetti will return with a chance to close out the match and secure a place in the quarter-finals against Alexander Zverev or Arthur Fils.

Musetti is aiming to reach his fifth ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final and third of the season, highlighted by his final run in Monte-Carlo.

Hubert Hurkacz's match with Miami champion Jakub Mensik has also been suspended due to rain. Hurkacz leads 7-6(5), 4-6, 3-2.

Moovit, the world's leading urban mobility app, and the ATP Tour, have today announced a pilot collaboration to guide tennis fans to tournaments more sustainably. The trial kicks off at the ATP Masters 1000 tournament currently underway in Rome (7–18 May 2025).

Moovit will provide spectators travelling to the Internazionali BNL d'Italia with tailored journey planning information, covering all scheduled public transport services as well as sustainable last-mile options such as bike and taxi. By encouraging the shift to high-capacity public transit and low-emission mobility solutions, the collaboration aims to significantly reduce CO2 emissions associated with match-day travel, underlining the critical role that sustainable mobility plays in mitigating climate impact at major sporting events.

Fans will be able to access journey information via a dedicated ATP experience within Moovit's app and web platform, translated into 45 languages. This custom tool will guide users step-by-step from their starting point to the Foro Italico's various gates, delivering real-time updates on schedules, service alerts, and helpful wayfinding tips to ensure a seamless fan journey.



“We are proud to join forces with the ATP and support tennis fans in traveling to Rome's iconic clay-court tournament in the most eco-friendly way possible,” said Samuel Sed Piazza, Director of Global Partnerships at Moovit. “By integrating comprehensive public transit data with multimodal options and localised wayfinding in 45 languages, we're making sustainable mobility accessible and stress-free for every fan, from first-time visitors to seasoned travellers.”

Mark Epps, ATP Director of Communications & Web3, added, “Travel is by far the biggest contributor to our sport's carbon footprint, and reducing that impact has been our top sustainability priority under ATP Serves. That's why we're excited to team up with Moovit. Their technology is smart, scalable, and already serves nearly a billion users worldwide. Through this pilot, we're exploring how to make sustainable mobility easier and more accessible for the 5.5 million fans who travel on-site to watch tennis each year.”

 Carlos Alcaraz found his best level when he needed it most on Tuesday at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. 

 The No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings delivered an up-and-down fourth-round performance against Karen Khachanov at the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome, but his peaks proved enough to secure a 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 victory. Alcaraz let slip a break lead in both the second and third sets, including four straight games from 6-3, 3-2 up, but recovered in time to maintain his perfect Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Khachanov. 

 “It feels amazing to get the win at the end against a really big and really tough guy like Khachanov,” said Alcaraz. “Physically I struggled a bit. Not any pain on any part of the body, but I was just tired. The match was really tough. I had to run a lot, so I'm just really proud of the way I fought for every ball. 

 “At a break up in the second set, from then to the end of the second set, I probably lost focus a little bit. He started to play great, but I was really happy to forget it and come into the third set as good as I could. I just fought, and I'm really happy about that.” 

Game. Set. Alcaraz. 🦸@carlosalcaraz completes the set of quarter-finals at all nine Masters 1000 events and will face Draper in what promises to be a fabulous encounter!@InteBNLdItalia | #IBI25 pic.twitter.com/dTrvGEXNzM

 With his two-hour, 29-minute win, Alcaraz advanced to the quarter-finals in Rome for the first time, and he has now reached that stage at all nine Masters 1000 events. The 22-year-old is the first Spaniard to make the last eight in Rome since record 10-time champion Rafael Nadal in 2021. Jaume Munar could make it two Spaniards in the 2025 quarter-finals later on Tuesday by defeating Casper Ruud. 

 Now 26-5 for 2025, including a 12-1 record on clay, Alcaraz will take on fifth seed Jack Draper in the semi-finals after the in-form Briton rallied past Corentin Moutet 1-6, 6-4, 6-3. It will be a clash between the first and second-placed players in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Alcaraz leads 3-2 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, but Draper won their most recent meeting in March en route to the title in Indian Wells. 

 “Jack is playing great,” said Alcaraz of Draper, who will rise to a career-high No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings next Monday should he win the pair's quarter-final. “The way he's playing is really high. I've been watching his matches. The way he plays is huge, and I have to be ready for that. I think it's going to be a great battle.” 

 As he had in his third-round win against Laslo Djere, Alcaraz struggled to find his rhythm in the opening few games of Tuesday's fourth-round clash against Khachanov. He dropped serve in the opening game of the match as his opponent stayed solid from the baseline and behind his powerful serve. 

 Yet after that low-key start, Alcaraz appeared to flick a switch. He reeled off five straight games featuring some typically classy shotmaking that energised the Tuesday morning crowd on Campo Centrale, and the Spaniard seemed to be riding that wave to victory when he pulled off three sublime clean winners to break for 3-2 in the second set. 



 Khachanov, who had not won a set in his four previous Lexus ATP Head2Head clashes with Alcaraz, did not let himself be shaken by the prospect of another straight-sets defeat. The 23rd seed continued to keep his errors to a minimum, which allowed him to capitalise on a lapse in Alcaraz's level, reel off four straight games and force a deciding set. 

 Alcaraz soon forged a 4-1 lead in the third, set but again stuttered as Khachanov refused to lay down in his bid for his maiden Top 3 win on clay. Alcaraz rediscovered his touch in time to escape with the win, however, decisively breaking Khachanov's serve in the 12th game to seal victory. 

 Just how close the margins were in the fourth-round clash was reflected in the fact that the defeated Khachanov won more points (98 to 95) than his opponent overall, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Alcaraz produced 29 unforced errors to Khachanov's 17, but also outhit the 23rd seed by 41 winners to 17.

Holger Rune and Joao Fonseca will make their Laver Cup debuts this year, the event announced on Tuesday.


The Dane joins Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz for Team Europe while Fonseca adds to Team World's roster, which includes Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul and Ben Shelton. The Laver Cup will be held at Chase Center in San Francisco from September 19-21, 2025.


“It feels amazing to be selected to play for Team Europe in San Francisco this year,” said Rune. “I was so close to playing the Laver Cup a few years ago but unfortunately got injured and couldn't make it. I knew that if I got the chance to play again, I would be ready and I'm really looking forward to the competition and to visiting San Francisco for the first time. It's going to be a great atmosphere, and I know from talking to the other players that the Laver Cup is one of the most enjoyable competitions of the year. I cannot wait to be part of it.”




Rune, World No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has won five tour-level singles titles. The 22-year-old has reached three Grand Slam quarter-finals and has appeared in four ATP Masters 1000 finals, most recently at Indian Wells in March. Last month, he defeated Team Europe teammate and World No. 3 Alcaraz to win the Barcelona ATP 500. Rune was set to make his Laver Cup debut in Vancouver in 2023 but was forced to withdraw due to a back injury.


Team Europe will be led by captain Yannik Noah. “Holger is a fierce competitor with big-match experience and strong form this season,” said Noah. “I know how eager he is to be part of the Laver Cup, and he will be a fantastic addition to our team in San Francisco.”


The 18-year-old Fonseca has quickly emerged as one of the brightest young stars in the sport. The reigning champion at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Fonseca reached junior No. 1 in 2023 and broke into the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings just 16 months later. He qualified for his first Grand Slam at the Australian Open in January, stunning then World No. 9 Andrey Rublev in the opening round. In February, Fonseca won his first ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires.


“I am so excited to have been selected to play for Team World at the Laver Cup,” said Fonseca. “I've watched the event since I was a kid and always dreamed of playing. To now be on a team with guys like Fritz, Paul and Shelton, and to be coached by Andre Agassi, it's just unbelievable! I will give it everything I've got.”




Agassi, who also makes his Laver Cup debut as Team World captain this year, looks forward to having the young Brazilian on the team.


“Joao is the kind of young talent that makes Laver Cup so special,” said Agassi. “He's fearless, energetic, has a huge game and loves the big stage. His performance this season shows me he's ready for this. I'm sure he will thrive in the team environment and I'm really looking forward to working with him and getting to know him better.” 


Now in its eighth edition, the Laver Cup pits six of the best men's tennis players from Europe against six of their counterparts from the rest of the world in a thrilling three-day competition.


The three highest-ranked players from Europe and the World, based on their PIF ATP Ranking as of the Monday following Roland-Garros, receive an automatic invitation to play the Laver Cup. If any one of these players chooses not to participate, the offer is made to another high ranked player. The remaining three places on each team will be ‘Captain's Picks' and can be announced any time before the start of the US Open.


By naming Rune and Fonseca to their teams right now, Noah and Agassi are committing to use a Captain's Pick on them if they do not qualify based on ranking. 


Laver Cup will visit San Francisco for the first time this year, bringing top-level men's pro tennis back to the Bay Area for the first time in over a decade. Chase Center, home of the seven-time NBA Champion Golden State Warriors and WNBA's Golden State Valkyries, will host tennis for the first time. 


A limited number of Full Tournament and Multi-Session Ticket Packages are still available via Ticketmaster, the official ticketing partner of Chase Center. Single-Session Tickets go on sale this Friday, May 16, at 10:00AM (PT). For further updates on player announcements, event updates and ticket presales, fans are encouraged to register as a ‘Laver Cup Insider' at lavercup.com.

The Italian Open is rapidly moving towards its final stages, with many players using the tournament as preparation for the French Open.

Jannik Sinner has made a positive return to tennis at the Italian Open, having made his comeback from a three-month ban in Rome.

The ATP number one has avoided a shock thus far, but WTA star Iga Swiatek was among the players losing out early on.

Swiatek left Jim Courier shocked after she fell to Danielle Collins, although world number one Aryna Sabalenka remains on track for success at the WTA 1000 event.

She will reunite with Qinwen Zheng in the Italian Open quarter-finals, with American duo Coco Gauff and Peyton Stearns also reaching that stage.

And it is Stearns who former players Steve Johnson and John Isner have been really impressed by as the French Open nears.

Discussing American women other than Gauff who they think can shine at Roland Garros, Johnson said on the Nothing Major podcast: “I am going to go off the beaten track here and say Peyton Stearns can make a bit of a run.

READ MORE: WTA Italian Open 2025 – how to watch, top players, prize money & predictions

“She has a couple of big wins, six in the third over [Madison] Keys and six in the third over [Naomi] Osaka here in Rome.

“Playing some of the best tennis of her career. She is going to be flying completely under the radar, unless she titles this week, because there are so many American women ahead of her.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

“That is sometimes a good thing, you can go out there and be businessman like, take care of what is in front of you and go and win and she is playing great tennis and can be somebody who if she can get a favourable draw can make some noise, get a good run, and once she is in the second, third or fourth round, hopefully, that belief will be there to beat anyone and then the tournament will begin.”

As Johnson mentioned, Stearns has picked up some huge wins at the Italian Open, knocking out Osaka and Keys.

Both players are Grand Slam champions, with Stearns having also beaten Nuria Brancaccio and Anna Kalinskaya in Rome.

Hugely impressively, she came from behind to edge past Keys and Osaka, and now meets Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals.

The American remains the only unseeded player left in the women's draw, with the 23-year-old currently ranked 42nd in the world.

Discussing her chances at the French Open later this month, Isner said: “She is playing well. Early on in the season she lost a lot of close matches.

“I remember she lost to Emma Navarro early on at the Australian Open, 7-5 in the third and she was up maybe 5-1 or 5-2 in the third that match.

“But winning two matches in a row, 7-6 in the third is going to do her confidence a lot of favours going forward. I like her game and she could certainly be someone who can make a lot of noise at the French Open.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

PARIS (AP) — Three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka and French veteran Richard Gasquet were among eight men given wild-card entries Tuesday for the French Open.

Wawrinka, who turned 40 in March, won the Australian Open in 2014 for his first Grand Slam singles title and added major wins at the French Open in 2015 and the 2016 U.S. Open.

The Swiss player has battled injuries in recent years and has dropped to No. 132 in the ATP rankings.

Gasquet will be playing his final tournament in Paris. The 38-year-old Frenchman, who reached a career-best ranking of No. 7 back in 2007, was once regarded as a potential Grand Slam winner but could never get past the semifinals at any major. Gasquet reached the Wimbledon semifinals twice and was also a semifinalist at the U.S Open. He claimed 16 tour titles and was a member of the France team that won the 2017 Davis Cup.

The French Open runs from May 25 to June 8.

Their split comes after the 24-time grand slam champion lost the first match at his past two tournaments

Andy Murray will no longer coach former rival Novak Djokovic, ending their six-month partnership, the pair announced on Tuesday.

Djokovic stunned the tennis world in November when he said he had hired the retired Murray, who had no track record as a coach, to lead his off-court team.

But the two 37-year-olds have already parted company, with Britain's Murray thanking Serbia star Djokovic for an “unbelievable opportunity”.

Their split comes after Djokovic, the winner of a record 24 men's grand slam singles titles, endured a difficult start to the season – including losing the first match at his last two tournaments.

“Thanks to Novak for the unbelievable opportunity to work together and thanks to his team for all their hard work over the past six months,” Murray said in a statement.

“I wish Novak all the best for the rest of the season,” added the Scot, who defeated Djokovic in the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon finals to win two of his three grand slam titles.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","tennis"

Former British tennis star, Tim Henman, has expressed his unwavering support for Emma Raducanu despite her recent exit from the Rome Open. Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion at just 18 years old, faced a tough defeat in the fourth round of the Rome Open against Coco Gauff, with a score of 6-1, 6-2. This loss marks the eighth time in nine events this season that Raducanu has failed to advance past the early stages of a tournament.

Henman, however, remains optimistic about Raducanu's future in tennis. He believes that despite her recent setbacks, the young player is on the right path to success. Reflecting on Raducanu's clay-court season, Henman noted that it has been overall positive for her development as a player.

While Raducanu may not have performed as well as expected in the Rome Open, Henman highlighted her potential for improvement in the upcoming events. He acknowledged that Raducanu was outplayed by Gauff in their recent match but emphasized that the clay courts at Roland Garros could be more favorable for her playing style.

As Raducanu climbs up the live rankings to the 42nd position, Henman raises the question of whether she can secure a seeding pre-Wimbledon to gain a competitive edge in the early rounds on grass courts. With her game showing signs of progress, Raducanu's journey in professional tennis continues to capture the attention and support of fans worldwide.

China's tennis ace Zheng Qinwen defeated former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu 7-5, 6-1, reaching the tournament's quarterfinals for the third consecutive year of the WTA Italian Open in Rome on Monday. She will next face world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus, which will mark their first meeting on clay.""At present, Zheng appears to be in good physical condition. The intensity of her training and competitive form are both solid, and there are no obvious signs that past injuries are affecting her performance,"" former Chinese Tennis Association coach Pan Shouhu told the Global Times on Tuesday.Pan noted that Zheng has strong on-court adaptability, explaining that even if she starts slowly or falls behind early, she can adjust her game plan based on how the match unfolds.That ability to stay composed and make timely adjustments was on full display in her match against Andreescu. Zheng built an early 3-0 lead in the first set, but that was broken in the seventh game as Andreescu mounted a comeback, holding and breaking serve to take a 5-4 advantage. Zheng regained her rhythm and broke back in the critical 10th game, winning three straight games to seal the set 7-5.""After taking a 3-0 lead, I may have relaxed a bit,"" Zheng reflected in a post-match interview on Monday. ""My focus wasn't as sharp, and I became slightly less aggressive, which allowed the match to shift to my opponent's rhythm.""Even when I made a lot of unforced errors, I didn't panic. I kept my mindset steady and fought back point by point,"" she said.In the second set, Zheng  dominated the court and even pulled off a stunning tweener shot, eventually closing out the match with a commanding 6-1 victory.""Every time I hit a great shot or score, like the tweener today, I get excited. It helps me get into a better rhythm,"" Zheng said. ""I always want to give my all in every match, and I'm happy I was able to do that today. I hope to continue this positive momentum in the upcoming matches.""In the quarterfinals, Zheng will face top seed Aryna Sabalenka. This will be their first meeting on clay. Zheng has yet to defeat Sabalenka in their six previous encounters.""Based on records, Sabalenka has been a formidable obstacle for Zheng, like a mountain that's hard to climb,"" Pan noted. ""But if she can overcome this obstacle this time, it would be a major boost to her confidence.""Sabalenka is a pure offensive player. You must absorb a few of her powerful shots during her attacks,"" Zheng said. ""She'll give you some opportunities, because aggressive play naturally comes with errors. I plan to stay consistent and look for my chances to strike.""According to Shangguan News, Zheng Qinwen is particularly adept at playing on clay courts, where she has achieved remarkable success. In 2022, she advanced to the second week of a Grand Slam, and in 2024, she clinched the Olympic gold medal in women's singles. Both of these career highlights came on clay. Zheng has often stated that she finds it easier to get into rhythm and find her game on clay courts.Zhe Kunlin, China representative of leading tennis clay court supplier Tianjiao Sports, told the Global Times on Tuesday that clay surfaces place greater demand on a player's ability to instantly react and significantly influence the pace and tactical choices of a match.""Compared to hard courts, clay has a lower coefficient of friction, making sliding a key technical skill - something that happens to be one of Zheng's strengths,"" Zhe said.Zhe further explained that clay courts also offer notable advantages in terms of injury prevention. ""Hard courts are more taxing on the body, and extended play can lead to knee and joint issues,"" he said.""Clay is relatively softer and helps absorb impact. It provides an ideal platform for players with good balance and coordination to showcase their strengths,"" he said.While clay courts can offer physical advantages for agile athletes, Zhe noted that Chinese players in general have had relatively fewer opportunities to compete extensively on the surface.""This is mainly because most domestic tournaments in China are played on hard courts, so players have fewer opportunities to adapt to clay. But Zheng Qinwen, who won gold on clay at the Olympics, has already demonstrated strong adaptability and great potential on this surface,"" he noted.Zhe said that the upcoming clash with Sabalenka may be subtly influenced by the court surface, noting that Zheng's movement and quick reactions on clay make her performance on this surface something to look forward to.

Coco Gauff is laser-focused this season. 

After a disappointing start to the campaign, the American has bounced back during the clay swing, and such is her age at 21, the records are starting to fall once again. 

""Been on tour for 6 years and the age stats are still coming lol,"" Gauff wrote on Instagram above a post of her becoming the second-youngest woman to reach a quarterfinal at the Italian Open.

She will face Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva for a place in the last four, just a week on from beating her at the Madrid Open.

Andreeva's rise echose that of Gauff.

After making her debut at the age of 14 on the ITF women's circuit, it's no surprise that after six years, Gauff is still smashing records to do with her age,

After victory over fellow former US Open champion Emma Raducanu, she became the first American player to reach her third quarter-final in Rome since Serena Williams in 2008

She also has the second most wins at the Italian Open before turning 22, with 15 wins, only Gabriela Sabatini, with 27, is ahead of her.

It's no surprise that the clay swing that has seen Gauff play her best tennis; it is a surface that she recently described as being the most comfortable on, it was also the surface on which she reached her first Grand Slam final.

“When I was younger, I always thought my best surface was hard, and then I got on tour, and I thought my best surface was on clay, and then the US Open, and I was like maybe it is hard!” Gauff told Tennis Channel.

“But I don't know, there's something about clay that I have always felt comfortable on. I feel like this year, more than ever, I am moving the best that I have, especially so early in the clay season.""

Gauff was in a bit of a slump by her own very high standards before the clay swing began.

After losing in the quarterfinals to Padula Badosa at the Australian Open in January, Gauff lost back-to-back first-round matches at the Qatar Open and Dubai Championships.

The sunshine double saw a slight improvement, but she wasn't able to get past the third round at Indian Wells and the Miami Open.

Now, in another quarterfinal, after reaching the same feat in Stuttgart and making the Madrid Open final, where she lost to Aryna Sabalenka, Gauff is getting back to her best.

Ultimately the world no.3 has made clear that while tournaments like this are vital, it's Grand Slams she wants, even more so than the illustrious World No.1 ranking, a feat she has never reached.

""It's not really that much in my mind, cause I really want another Slam,"" Gauff said when asked if being top of the rankings was in her sights.

""It's not something that I think about, I'd rather take away some more Slam trophies.""

And there's no reason why the looming French Open can't be the place she picks up her second major. 

So far, she has two semi-finals and a final in Paris, along with a doubles title in 2024, a modest return considering clay has often spelled trouble for American stars.

Only three of Serena Williams' 23 single majors came at the French Open, and she remains the last American to win the title in Paris, back in 2015.

On the men's side, the drought is even longer, stretching back to 1999, when Andre Agassi beat Andrei Medvedev.

Players from the USA tend to struggle on the surface as a result of the lack of opportunities to play on the red clay used in European tournaments at a grassroots level.

Many of the already limited number of clay courts in the United States are fast, low-bounce versions -- the polar opposite of those in Europe.

Nonetheless, there is every chance that Gauff could be the one to end the decade-long wait for an American champion at the French Open this year.

The Coco Gauff and Alex Eala doubles partnership marched on at the Italian Open as the former revealed how they ended up playing together in Rome.

Gauff is a former women's doubles world No 1 as she won the 2024 French Open alongside Katerina Siniakova while she also finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 2022 when she partnered Jessica Pegula and at the 2021 US Open with Caty McNally.

The 21-year-old enjoyed a lengthy and successful stint as Pegula's partner, but that partnership ended last year and Gauff has played with several different WTA stars since then.

Eala, meanwhile, is still new on the scene as the 19-year-old hasn't played too many top-level doubles matches, but she does have success in the format as she won the 2020 Australian Open girls' doubles and the 2021 French Open girls' doubles.

And the two exciting talents on the WTA Tour decided to team up at the WTA 1000 event in the Italian capital.

They started with a straight set win over Alexandra Panova and Fanny Stoller in the first round and followed it up with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Italian wildcards Tyra Grant and Lisa Pigato.

But who initiated the partnership?

“She DM'd me on Instagram. She slid in my DMs and asked me to play. I was like, ‘Sure, why not?'”, Gauff said of Eala.

“We really didn't know each other, honestly, before Madrid. I said hi to her for the first time in Madrid or maybe Miami, we may have briefly said hello. I figured she would be nice so I was just hoping she would be, you know?

“Obviously, she's such a nice person. When there's people finally my age on tour, I'm glad to interact.

“For me, it was a good opportunity to play doubles but also have a relaxed vibe with another player. I'm super happy to play with her, and obviously she's a killer in doubles: two junior Slams and probably some future ones too.”

The Gauff-Eala team will next face the formidable seeds Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini for a place in the semi-final.

Coco Gauff makes feelings clear on Iga Swiatek's hopes of winning the French Open

WTA Rankings: Iga Swiatek's unique feat set to continue after Italian Open exit

2023 US Open winner Gauff was also asked about Eala's breakthrough this year.

The teenager caused several upsets at the Miami Open when she beat three Grand Slam winners in Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek en route to reaching the semi-final.

With that run, she became the highest-ranked Filipina in WTA Tour history as she surged into the top 80.

“She seems to be handling it super well. There's ups and downs in the sport, but you realise that the media is there to kind of paint that story and make it more interesting, but that shouldn't be added pressure or anything like that,” the American said.

“She seems chill. She seems like she's working hard, so I don't have any advice for her just because she seems relaxed. The only thing I did tell her was that doubles helped me a lot in that space, having some time on court where it's a little less stressful. So, I encouraged her to play when she could.”


                Coco Gauff has made an admission about 'throwing away' win over Iga Swiatek in Madrid.            


                Coco Gauff emulated a Venus Williams feat, while Emma Raducanu fell short of a ranking milestone.            


                The two former US Open champions have discussed their Italian Open showdown.            


                ""For sure in the movement. I felt like playing myself.""

Destanee Aiava this week flies to Europe as the countdown to her Roland Garros main-draw debut continues.

The Australian received a main-draw wildcard at the year's second major, reward for the excellent stretch of results she has enjoyed in previous months.

Qualifying for the main draw of last year's US Open proved a breakthrough, before she produced her best Grand Slam result at Australian Open 2025, again qualifying for the main draw then saving a match point to advance to the second round.

“It was really great. It was quite a crazy two weeks,” Aiava said on this week's episode of The Sit-Down.

“Coming through qualies for AO was honestly like one of the main things I have been wanting to do for a while. I've been in qualies for quite a while now for this [tournament]. So yeah, just qualifying in front of my friends and family and I had a really big crowd as well for, I think, the last two of my qualities matches, which was really great.

“I think my draw was pretty tough as well. All the players I played were really great competitors. When you see the girls that you have beaten do that well after, I guess it just shows that I can get there as well, and it's just a matter of time… I just need to keep going and persisting.

“But yeah, I've really enjoyed my AO this year. It was amazing. I always enjoy my time here, but this one was super special.”

Aiava's run at Melbourne Park ended when she fell in three compelling sets to Danielle Collins, who made global headlines with her post-match celebrations and interview.

It is a match Aiava says people still mention to her months later, and one she remembers fondly.

PODCAST: Listen to Destanee Aiava on The Sit-Down

“I look back on it and I smile. I really enjoyed it, honestly, with the crowd,” said Aiava of a match notable for its crackling evening atmosphere at Kia Arena.

“I thought even I had some hecklers (laughter) so it was something really different to what I've been used to, even playing overseas. It was like a different level. It was on Kia [Arena] but it still felt massive and there were so many people; I think it was literally full.

“And then it ended and I lost and then I was walking up to the net and I just saw her do her thing and I was like, 'oh, I should probably not look that way and ignore'. (laugher)

“But after the match, she was really lovely to me at the net. She messaged me as well, which I really respect, and she was so kind to me. So I could only say good things about her.

“I tried to avoid what she was doing on the court, and yeah, just let her do her thing. But I'm really grateful that I had that kind of experience as well. I feel like you don't really get those kinds of matches too often.”



It was the culmination of a fortnight that did wonders for Aiava's profile and career trajectory.

The 25-year-old continued her momentum into February, reaching an ITF final in Prague then the semifinals in Trnava, Slovakia – both W75 level events – to boost her ranking inside the world's top 150 for the first time in almost eight years.

Her social media following soared, she now has a manager and she has since commenced a partnership with clothing brand LSKD, whose outfits she is looking forward to unveiling at Roland Garros.

“I think maybe after my third round qualies match, my follower count, like my Instagram was just blowing up. Everything, my X [account]. I think those were the main two things, and TikTok as well,” Aiava reflected.

“Everyone was all of a sudden interested in either the outfits, or my tennis, or the Collins match. My phone did not stop blowing up. I had to change my settings and everything.

“I was able to get a manager after that week, which was really good. Got a lot of opportunities off court, which was really nice.

“So yeah, it only did good things.”

Published May 13, 2025

Novak Djokovic confirmed on social media Tuesday that he had parted ways with rival-turned-coach Andy Murray, ending a six-month partnership that saw the 24-time Grand Slam champion reach the Australian Open semifinals and Miami Open finals.“Thank you, coach Andy, for all the hard work, fun & support over last six months on & off the court,” Djokovic wrote. “Really enjoyed deepening our friendship together 🙏”

Two former world No. 1s, Djokovic and Murray shocked the tennis world over the 2024 off-season when they first announced that they would be teaming up as coach and pupil, the move coming six months after Murray officially announced his retirement from professional tennis.“When somebody like Djokovic asks you, you say yes,” 18-time major champion Martina Navratilova said of the move on Tennis Channel Live in January. “But still, I'm surprised that emotionally, he felt ready to get back into the cauldron again.”Djokovic has struggled with injuries throughout the partnership, retiring from the Australian Open semifinals and sitting out this week's Internazionali BNL d'Italia. The 37-year-old confirmed he would return to action in Geneva for a final Roland Garros warm-up, but it will be the first tournament without Murray at his side.

GREATEST RACES: Celebrating the 25 best races across F1's 75 years of history

GREATEST RACES #25: The ‘best race' of Gilles Villeneuve's life – 1981 Spanish Grand Prix

‘To already be at this pace is very impressive' – Verstappen and Norris heap praise on Antonelli after rookie's Miami display

TECH WEEKLY: The key differences between how Hamilton and Leclerc are driving the Ferrari – and the changes made to help the Briton adapt

MUST-SEE: Relive the highlights of F1's first-ever championship race in full colour footage

Did you know that the field for the first ever World Championship F1 race included a Swiss baron, a Thai prince and a well-known jazz musician? Exactly 75 years on, as part of the sport's year-long celebration, we present a compendium of the most interesting, little-known and downright unusual facts about the historic Silverstone event…

Believe it or not, the first World Championship race had two titles. Officially it was the Grand Prix d'Europe – the first time that title had ever gone to a race outside Italy or France – but as the race was held on UK soil it incorporated the British Grand Prix. Unlike today, when the season-opening event is traditionally held in March, the race took place on May 13.

Only seven World Championship season openers have been held later in the year. They were: 1951 (May 27), 1952 (May 18), 1961 (May 14), 1962 (May 20), 1963 (May 26), 1966 (May 22) and 2020 (July 5).

From 1952 until 2011, Woodcote was Silverstone's final bend, but for the inaugural World Championship event, the sweeping right hander was the 4.6km circuit's first corner – and thus the first corner tackled in the history of F1 racing.

From there the drivers would take on six other turns – Copse, Maggots, Becketts, Chapel, Stowe and Club – before arriving at the final corner, Abbey. The pit lane and starting grid were situated between Abbey and Woodcote, with the cars lining up for the start in 4-3-4 formation.

It was estimated that up to 120,000 spectators lined the track on race day, though by far the most prestigious was His Royal Highness King George VI, who attended the race with Queen Elizabeth, Princess Margaret and guests Lord and Lady Mountbatten. It remains the only time a reigning monarch has attended a British motor race.

Rather fittingly for a race attended by royalty, the entry list had a distinctly aristocratic flavour.

Among the 21 drivers that took the start were Prince Birabongse Bhanudej Bhanubandh (better known as Prince Bira or B. Bira), a notable racer and member of the Thai royal family, and Baron Emmanuel ‘Toulo' de Graffenried, a Swiss driver who'd won the 1949 edition of the British Grand Prix in the pre-World Championship era.

Bira, the only Thai driver to race in F1 competition until Alexander Albon made his debut in 2019, qualified his Maserati fifth at Silverstone but retired in the race when he ran out of fuel.

Similarly, De Graffenried failed to make the flag after his identical 4CLT-48 developed engine problems.

1 / 2

Alfa Romeo's 158 may have been 13 years old by the time of the first World Championship race, but the 1.5-litre supercharged machine was still the car to beat, and that helped the Italian manufacturer sign three of the era's biggest names: Guiseppe ‘Nino' Farina, Luigi Fagioli and Juan Manuel Fangio, affectionately known as the ‘Three Fs'.

The trio duly qualified their scarlet cars in the top three grid slots, with British driver Reg Parnell a second down the road in fourth in the final Alfa Romeo entry. In the race Farina, Fagioli and Fangio predictably ran away from the rest of the field, which was otherwise made up of a mixture of ageing Maseratis, ERAs, Talbots and Altas.

After 70 laps and nearly two and a quarter hours of racing – during which the leading trio had traded places several times – it was Farina who triumphed, leading fellow Italian Fagioli across the line by 2.6s. But it was Parnell and not Fangio who completed Alfa's clean sweep of the podium places after the Argentinian had been forced into retirement with a broken oil pipe – possibly as a result of clipping a straw bale at Stowe.

Despite their obvious speed advantage, Alfa Romeo were lucky to get three of their four cars to the finish after Parnell's Alfetta came into contact with an unlucky member of Silverstone's hare population. According to reports from the time, the animal caused a significant dent in the cowling of the British driver's car.

1 / 3

The average age of the drivers who lined up on the grid for this year's season opener in Australia was around 27 years, but for the very first World Championship race it was a much more mature 39.

Three of the 21-driver field at Silverstone were in their fifties (pre-war aces Luigi Fagioli, 51, Louis Chiron, 50, and Philippe Etancelin, 53), while five more were 40 or over, including race winner Giuseppe Farina (43).

The ‘baby' of field, if you could call him that, was British racer Geoffrey Crossley, who at 29 came in 12 years older than Max Verstappen was on his World Championship debut...

No, it's not a joke – a well-known jazz musician did indeed take part in the inaugural round of the World Championship, though it's fair to say that Johnny Claes enjoyed considerably more success with his splendidly named combo ‘Johnny Claes and the Clay Pigeons' than he did in F1.

The Belgian driver (who was born in London) qualified his Talbot dead last at Silverstone, a full 18 seconds back from Farina's pole-sitting Alfa, but he did at least reach the chequered flag in the race, coming home six laps down on the Italian in 11th.

1 / 3

Up-and-coming British constructor BRM had hoped to debut their V16 Type 15 at Silverstone, but after experiencing a litany of technical problems, the pale green car was only able to complete a handful of pre-race demonstration laps with team founder Raymond Mays at the wheel.

The car would eventually make its long-awaited World Championship debut at the following year's Silverstone round.

Stirling Moss would go on to win the British Grand Prix in both 1955 and 1957, but at the inaugural World Championship Grand Prix in his homeland, the then 20-year-old only appeared in the 500cc support races, not in the main event.

Moss won his heat and was involved in a barnstorming battle for the lead in the final, but in the end had to settle for second place after his Cooper-JAP suffered a piston failure at the final corner.

Still, at least he got to meet the King…

Orlando Bloom and Domhnall Gleeson also star in the movie about two sisters so close that they start digging a tunnel through a mountain range that HanWay is promoting to buyers at the Cannes market.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Bucking Fastard, the new feature film written and directed by the legendary Werner Herzog (Grizzly Man, Fitzcarraldo) and starring sisters Kate Mara (House of Cards, The Martian) and Rooney Mara (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Carol), as well as Orlando Bloom (The Lord of the Rings) and Domhnall Gleeson (Ex Machina), now has a first-look image. 


	It shows the sisters who star in the “deeply intertwined lead roles of Jean and Joan Holbrooke,” marking the first time they have appeared on screen together.




	Bloom plays their rowdy ex-lover, Gareth Mulroney, while Gleeson portrays Timothy, their government-issued social worker/mender who is trying to help them “adapt to modern life after the two become tabloid sensations.”

	A synopsis of the movie reads: “Set in both contemporary urban modernity and against the epic untamed wilds of Ireland, Bucking Fastard is about two sisters who are so close to each other that they speak in unison, love the same man, and have the same dreams. They even make the same slip of tongue in unison. In search of an imaginary land, the Orkneys – where true love is possible – they start digging a tunnel through an entire mountain range.”


	The film is produced by Clara Wu Tsai (Blue Bayou), Ariel Leon Isacovitch (Theater of Thought), and Agnes Chu (Spiderhead), with Kieran Corrigan, Emanuele Moretti and Andrea Bucko. 


	Principal photography wrapped in late April, with HanWay Films having boarded the movie to handle worldwide sales. HanWay said it would be sharing first footage from Dublin and Sligo, Ireland and Slovenia with buyers at the Cannes film market.

On Monday, the fallen rap mogul's trial began in earnest with opening statements followed by testimony from two witnesses, with Cassie Ventura's testimony pushed to Tuesday.


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



Day one of the second week of Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial in Manhattan saw a flurry of activity, as the jury was finalized after an accusation of racial bias from the defense team. On Monday, the trial began in earnest with opening statements followed by testimony from two witnesses. 


	Combs — the 55-year-old rapper, producer and fashion mogul whose rags-to-riches-to-near-billionaire status New York fairytale came to an abrupt end last year with his arrest and a five-count indictment — stood up in the court on Monday morning when lead attorney Teny Geragos described him in her opening statements. The second lead defense attorney told the jury that Combs, accused by federal prosecutors of two decades of abuse of women, trafficking of sex workers, and turning his music and fashion empire into a criminal enterprise, is no saint and that he's by all accounts guilty of domestic abuse; but that's not what he's charged with and why he should be found innocent.

					Sean ""Diddy"" Combs Trial Sees Jury Finalization Kicked to Monday So No One Gets ""Cold Feet""		
			









	On Monday, the day after Mother's Day, Combs' mother found her seat in the federal courtroom on the 24th floor in lower Manhattan. As she sat, her now-grey-haired-and-bearded son blew her a kiss. “Hi, mom, I love you,” he mouthed to her. 


	Before the jury was finalized, the defense lobbed a “Batson challenge” at the prosecution, essentially stating that the striking of eight Black potential jurors indicated the feds were excluding potential jurors based on demographic characteristics, such as race, gender, national origin, religion or sexual orientation. But the government was quick to shut this down, reading off the valid reasons the jurors in question were struck: one seemed favorably inclined toward 17 names she recognized might come up at the trial; another said he would miss out on 30 percent of his income by spending eight weeks on the jury, but didn't seem bothered, which suggested to the feds he may have an agenda. Judge Arun Subramanian overruled the Batson challenge and the jury was finalized.


	“Sean Combs is a complicated man. But this is not a complicated case. This case is about love, jealousy, infidelity and money,” Geragos told the court, referring to what the defense says was the motivation of the women and alleged victims set to testify. “There has been a tremendous amount of noise around this case over the past year… It is time to cancel that noise.”

	











	Combs has pleaded not guilty to all five counts in the indictment and says he has not committed any of the crimes of which he has been accused.


	Prosecutor Emily Johnson spent significantly less time — about half an hour to Geragos' hour — laying out the feds' case against the fallen superstar to the jury: Over two decades, Combs conspired to use his business and loyal staff to stalk, harass and abuse via forced sex and drug use with male prostitutes, two women in his life — ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and a women he met in 2020 who is being referred to as Jane. 


	Johnson opened the case against Combs by telling what the feds say is a tale of one single night in the defendant's life: learning that Ventura was out with another man, he and a bodyguard went out to find them. In the process, the government says he woke and kidnapped one of his staffers and stalked his on-and-off girlfriend and when she was found, Combs “beat her brutally, kicking her in the back and flinging her around like a rag doll.” Other descriptions of his alleged abuse in court on Monday included an account of Combs tossing Ventura to the floor of a vehicle and stomping on her face, then directing a cover-up handled by his staff to ensure she stayed at home for a week while healing.  


	Ventura was allegedly forced, by Combs, into participating in “freak-offs,” mostly in hotel rooms where she was force fed drugs, primarily Ecstasy or MDMA, and engaged in sex with “dozens upon dozens” of male escorts over the years as Combs would masturbate as he looked on. Johnson said some “freak-offs” lasted days and participants required IV-drips to recover, Johnson told the jury. In a bid for coercive control over his girlfriend, Combs, who had signed Sunderland to his Bad Boy Records label for a 10-album deal (of which only one saw the light of day), threatened to ruin her music career by releasing videos of her engaging in sex with male escorts, the feds claim.

	











	The second alleged victim, Jane, is a single mother whom Combs met in 2020 and dated among other romantic interests at the time. She is set to testify that she was also coerced into participating in “freak-offs” at the rap mogul's behest. When she discovered his other love interests were taken on trips and out for meals, Jane confronted him. Prosecutors say Combs beat her mercilessly in this moment, kicked down several doors as she ran and hid from him, then put her in a chokehold and kicked her to the ground before dashing off, late for a previously scheduled “freak-off.”


	The defense told the jury that this is merely the story of a wealthy Black man with eccentric sexual proclivities and jealous women in his orbit who have become greedy for a piece of his fortune. Geragos, who repeated the defense's talking points several times over her hour-plus statement, put a fine point on the fact that Ventura did not file a police report but did file two multi-million dollar lawsuits against Combs. It was the next-day settlement of her suit by Combs that opened the floodgates for the river of civil lawsuits Combs now faces. 


	“I want you to ask yourself, how many millions of reasons does this witness, swearing to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, have to lie?” she asked the jury.At a point, Geragos boldly let the jury know that they'll witness the “closure” between Cassie and Combs when they see each other for the first time in six years.Following opening statements, two men took the stand on Monday afternoon: Israel Florez, a former security officer at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles who witnessed and filmed footage of the rap mogul's infamous 2016 assault on Ventura and Daniel Phillip, a male escort hired for a so-called “freak off.” 


	Jury members also saw the contentious footage brought by prosecutors of the hotel attack, in which Combs beats and kicks Ventura, then throws a hotel vase at her. Shown in court were two cellphone videos and three hotel surveillance videos related to the attack. Florez told the court that he recorded the hotel's video of the attack on his cellphone because he wanted to describe what he saw to his wife.

	











	Florez also described the fear he felt Ventura was experiencing after the attack and that he believes he was offered a bribe from Combs when the mogul handed him a stack with a $100 bill on top. “Don't tell nobody,” Florez testified Combs told him. Florez recalled telling Combs, “I don't want your money. Just go back into your room.”


	Phillips' testimony centered on the “freak-offs” he participated in with the couple; notably, the sexual marathons were mostly referred to as “hotel nights” by the defense. In 2012, the male stripper was invited by Ventura to meet the couple at the Gramercy Hotel in Manhattan, he explained. Wearing red lace lingerie when he arrived, Ventura first told him that she wanted to do something special for Combs. The night started with a baby oil massage, he told the court.The night, which led to him having sex with Ventura as Combs watched in a white robe, netted him a few thousand dollars and he was hired repeatedly to recreate the encounter, he said. At one point, he testified, Combs demanded that a photograph be taken of Phillip's driver's license; the sex worker testified that he saw this as an intimidation tactic. Another night, he says he witnessed Combs become violent with Sunderland, dragging her by the hair and slapping her in another room after she told him to “hold on a second.” 


	Following several objections during his questioning by the prosecution, defense attorney Xavier Donaldson went on the attack in cross-examining Phillip. Here it was revealed that he didn't even want money during his encounters with the couple, telling the court, ““In my head, I was just excited I was in this world and happy to be involved with people of such notoriety.”Ventura was expected to testify on Monday, but the two men's testimony carried the court to the end of the day. The trial was to resume at 9:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday.

The track would become the star's first solo Billboard Hot 100 hit.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	The party don't stop for Kesha‘s biggest hit, “Tik Tok,” which has remained one of the most popular songs from the late 2000s more than a decade later. But according to the pop star, she originally thought the track was “too dumb” when she first wrote it.


	While serving as a guest on The Jennifer Hudson Show Tuesday (May 13), Kesha recalled being blown away by the success of “Tik Tok” after it dropped in 2009. “No, oh my god,” she said when asked whether she ever expected it to become such a big hit. 

	











	“When I was writing ‘Tik Tok,' it was weird, because the dumber it got, the better it got,” the “Praying” singer continued. “Which was confusing, because I like to think of myself as a fairly intelligent human being. But it just got dumber and dumber and better and better.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Kesha added, “When I listened to the final product, I was like, ‘This is too dumb.'”


	Regardless, there was nothing dumb about what the track would do for her career. “Tik Tok” would launch the California native to superstar status, becoming not just her first solo Billboard Hot 100 entry, but her first No. 1 on the chart. It would also remain in the top spot for nine weeks, her longest run at the chart's summit, and helped Kesha's first album, Animal, debut atop the Billboard 200. 


	Fifteen years later, the musician is gearing up to release her sixth studio album, . (Period), her first LP under her own label, Kesha Records. Her departure from Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records — the founder of which also produced much of Animal — comes after a yearslong legal battle with Dr. Luke over Kesha's claims that he drugged and raped her in 2005, after which he sued her for defamation while calling the allegations “false and shocking.” Their ensuing legal battle continued for nine years before the two parties finally reached a settlement in 2023. 


	Of finally getting to release music fully on her own terms, Kesha told Hudson, “I'm really excited for the world to hear this, because I've been in control of everything.”


	“It's been all of my vision, all of my words, a lot of hard work, a lot of joy,” she continued, tearing up. “Really coming back home to myself and feeling what freedom really looks like, feels like, sounds like.”

	Irish hip hop act Kneecap will still be headlining Wide Awake Festival 2025 as planned, the festival has announced. It will mark the band's first show since they performed at Coachella last month.

	The news arrives following a period of intense scrutiny on the West Belfast trio in the weeks after Coachella. At the end of their sets, Kneecap displayed messages on the war in Gaza, writing: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. F–k Israel; free Palestine.”

	The group went on to face criticism from a number of industry figures including Sharon Osbourne, who called for their U.S. visas to be retracted. A group of politicians, meanwhile, called for Kneecap to be removed from a series of U.K. festival line-ups this summer. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Scrutiny continued when counter-terror police in London announced (May 1) an investigation into videos of band members allegedly calling for the death of elected British MPs and shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” The group have since gone on to issue a statement to their Instagram account: “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah. We condemn all attacks on civilians, always. It is never okay,” it read in part.


	Consequently, German headline shows in Hamburg, Cologne and Berlin for this summer have been pulled, alongside previously-announced appearances at Hurricane and Southside Festivals. A night at the Eden Project, Cornwall, was also cancelled last month but has since been replaced with three new dates in the nearby city of Plymouth, south west England. 


	Wide Awake have now shared a statement across their social media platforms confirming Kneecap's headline performance is still slated to go ahead next week (May 23). “After positive discussions with key stakeholders, Wide Awake Festival can confirm that, as planned, Kneecap will be performing at this year's festival on Friday May 23 at Brockwell Park,” it began.


	“Wide Awake has a proud history of supporting the alternative music scene, and we look forward to staging another unforgettable event showcasing the very best emerging and established talent.”


	The post also featured a lengthy signatory list of artists sharing their support for Kneecap and the “freedom of expression,” featuring names such as Pulp, Fontaines D.C., Primal Scream, Massive Attack, Self Esteem and Amyl and The Sniffers, among others. 

	











	Other acts set to perform at Wide Awake, which takes place in Brockwell Park, south London, include English Teacher, CMAT, Peaches, Fat Dog and more. Tickets and the full line-up can be found on the event's official website.

	Willie Nelson's Farm Aid, the longest running concert for a cause, will mark the 40th anniversary of its advocacy for family farmers with an all-star festival on Sept. 20 at Huntington Bank Stadium in Minneapolis.

	Since Nelson introduced the first Farm Aid concert in Champaign, Ill., on Sept. 22, 1985, the nonprofit behind the festival has raised nearly $80 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture, while also building connections in the battles against climate change and social injustice.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Family farmers are the heart of this country, and we depend on each other for good food and strong communities,” says Nelson, in announcing this year's event. “For 40 years, Farm Aid and our partners have stood with farmers, supporting them to stay on their land even when corporate power, bad policies and broken promises make it harder to keep going. 


	“This year, we're proud to bring Farm Aid to Minnesota to celebrate the farmers who sustain us and to fight for a food system that works for all of us. Family farmers aren't backing down, and neither are we.”


	Not since the farm foreclosure crisis of the 1980s, which prompted Nelson to launch Farm Aid, have family farmers faced the challenges that confront them today, from the devastation of storms driven by climate change to government actions that play havoc with their finances.


	Last month, on the Farm Aid website, Nelson and veteran agricultural activist David Senter wrote an open letter directed at America's young farmers, addressing this moment.


	“The commitment you're making to your families, your communities and our water, soil and climate is not an easy one—and it never has been,” they wrote. “We want you to know that, even with the wave of uncertainty farmers are facing right now, the work you're doing has never been more critical for our country.

	











	“All farmers — no matter their age, background, politics, location, size, type or production methods — must call on each other in these challenging times,” they wrote. “We invite you to call on us, and hope that you will answer when we call on you. We're in this together and it's only together that we will get through.”


	The music at Farm Aid gives power to its message and mission. 


	Throughout its history, including during the first term of President Trump, the festival has been perhaps the one place in America today to unite blue and red, urban and rural, for a common cause: supporting the men and women who grow the nation's food.  


	Farm Aid notes the significance of the festival making its first appearance in Minnesota, a state which, since the 1980s, “has offered a groundswell of strength in the farm movement, championing rural advocacy, sustainable and equitable agriculture and forward-thinking policy reform,” the organization says in a statement.


	This year's Farm Aid will once again include its trademarked HOMEGROWN Concessions, with a menu featuring “ingredients that are grown or raised by farmers who use ecological practices and are paid a fair price,” the organization states. The HOMEGROWN Village will feature exhibits about soil, water, energy, food and farming.


	Farm Aid co-executive director Jennifer Fahy says this year's festivities are not only about looking back, but also about building for the future.


	“We're grateful to our dedicated board members and hundreds of generous artists who have brought us together year after year to celebrate family farmers and highlight the challenges they face every day,” says Fahy. 

	











	“Our anniversary marks a critical time for the nation to come together in support of the family farmers we all depend on. Our work isn't done. There are significant threats to the future of family farm agriculture and our food system. Farm Aid 40 is an opportunity to call those out and work for the food system that farmers, eaters and our planet all deserve.”


	Farm Aid co-executive director Shorlette Ammons adds: “There is no farm movement without the people. Rural communities represent the heartbeat of this country. Farmers and rural and immigrant labor sustain our food system, care for the land, and strengthen our foodways and cultural connections. When we invest in rural communities, we uplift the well-being of our entire country, celebrating the vibrant and needful contributions of all.”

""People misjudged us because they couldn't label us,"" Daryl Hall explained of the contentious genre.

	Though the likes of Hall & Oates might be heavily associated with the contentious ‘yacht rock‘ genre, Daryl Hall himself has expressed disdain towards the classification.

	Used as a way to refer to the soft pop-rock and blue-eyed soul of the '70s and '80s, the term ‘yacht rock' was initially coined by makers of a 2005 mockumentary series of the same name. The series itself was a popular one, lasting from 2005 until 2010 and even resulting in a 2024 HBO ‘Dockumentary‘ that explored the genre in deeper detail.

	However, while the likes of Michael McDonald and even John Oates have been receptive to the original show, Hall is singing a far different tune. In the latest episode of the Broken Record podcast, Hall told interviewer Justin Richmond that he's far from a fan of the concept.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“This is something I don't understand. First of all, yacht rock was a f–king joke by two jerk-offs in California, and suddenly it became a genre,” he explained. “I don't even understand it. I never understood it. It's just R&B with maybe some jazz in there. It's mellow R&B, smooth R&B. I don't see what the yacht part is.


	“People misjudged us because they couldn't label us,” he continued. “They always came up with all this kind of crap, soft rock and yacht rock and all this other nonsense. And none of it, none of it really describes anything that I do, really.”


	In 2007, Oates reflected on the success of the Yacht Rock series, explaining that it was the “beginning of this whole Hall & Oates resurrection,” and even noting that “a lot of things have happened because of Yacht Rock.”


	It's little surprise that both Hall and Oates have differing views on the matter, given that the pair's 2024 dissolution was given an air of finality when Hall claimed in March that they would never again perform together. “That ship has gone to the bottom of the ocean,” he explained. “I've had a lot of surprises in my life, disappointments, betrayals, so I'm kind of used to it.”


	The Hall & Oates dissolution first began back in November 2023 when the pair became embroiled in a legal dispute. Described by Oates as “a very boring business issue,” the crux of the issue began when Hall filed suit against his former partner over Oates' attempt to sell his half of the duo's joint venture Whole Oates Enterprises to Primary Wave Music without Hall's consent.

ABC‘s April renewals left one series on the bubble, Ryan Murphy's glossy freshman cruise ship medical drama Doctor Odyssey, starring Joshua Jackson and Don Johnson. 


	A month later, that has not changed. Ahead of the Disney upfront presentation later today, ABC revealed its fall 2025 schedule, which features new spinoff 9-1-1: Nashville, also from Murphy, replacing Doctor Odyssey in the Thursday 9 PM slot.


	“Doctor Odyssey isn't currently on our schedule,” Craig Erwich, President, Disney Television Group, told Deadline. “Ryan's really busy. He's doing a lot with us. 9-1-1, 9-1-1 Nashville, All's Fair [for Hulu]. So we're just continuing that creative conversations with him.”

	











	In the end, the decision likely will be Murphy's, Eric Schrier, President of Disney TV Studios whose division 20th Television produces all Murphy series, recently told Deadline.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I really love Doctor Odyssey, I think it's a wildly inventive show, and we're doing everything we can to support it,” he said. “That decision ultimately lies with Ryan Murphy, whether Ryan wants to continue to do it, and he feels like there's stories to tell that he feels confident in.”


	As for timing, the call will likely be made before the end of June when the options on the cast are set to expire.


Doctor Odyssey, whose trailer set a record for a new broadcast series with 77.8M views in the first 48 hours, amassed 13.6M cross-platform viewers for the premiere in its first week. But the Love Boat homage has not been able to sustain the momentum throughout its freshman run. And with its slick production values and big stars, Doctor Odyssey is expensive to produce. 


	Amid the uncertainty, the upcoming Season 1 finale has an ending that could serve as a series finale, sources said.

Like its 9-1-1 predecessors — and in typical Ryan Murphy fashion — the rookie is expected to start with a bang, Craig Erwich, president, Disney Television Group, told Deadline, calling 9-1-1: Nashville, the only new ABC series for next season so far, “a huge priority.” You can watch 9-1-1: Nashville‘s fiery teaser below.  


	The scheduling has potential crossovers written all over it; something 9-1-1 franchise's executive producer Murphy accomplished with 9-1-1 and his other ABC series, Doctor Odyssey, this season.

	“I think that the 9-1-1 team are truly the masters of event-izing television, the way that be-nado kicked off 9-1-1 last year,” Erwich said. “They have a really special event planned for 9-1-1: Nashville, and although we haven't discussed [crossovers], I think it's an incredible opportunity that I'm sure at some point we'll figure out how to capitalize on. What the 9-1-1‘s been able to do, it's really a master class in television, which is consistently event-izing that show to keep it fresh after all these many years, my hat's off to [showrunner] Tim {Minear] and Ryan for that.” 


	The mothership 9-1-1 delivered a shocker this spring, with male lead Peter Krause‘s Bobby Nash dying as a result of a chemical lab leak, leaving his wife, Athena (Angela Bassett) and his team devastated. Erwich shared his thoughts about the plot twist as a viewer and as an executive who had to sign off on it.


	“As a viewer, it was incredibly emotional. He's a beloved character, and there was so much grist for the mill for Angela Bassett, who I thought gave such an incredible performance in both the episode where he died and the funeral,” he said.


	“Ultimately, it's about the creative, and it was a decision that Tim Minear came to us with, and we supported him, as we always do. It was a really great night of television that created a massive amount — not just of viewing, but really social conversation. And I think it'll give us a lot of momentum going into Thursdays next year. And it'll be a great lead-off for 9-1-1 Nashville, which will be a huge priority for us.”


9-1-1: Nashville is an action procedural about heroic first responders, as well as their family saga of power and glamour set in Tennessee. It stars O'Donnell as Captain Don Sharpe, Jessica Capshaw, LeAnn Rimes and Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 9-1-1: Nashville is produced by 20th Television in association with Ryan Murphy Television. Murphy, Minear and Rashad Raisani will serve as executive producers and writers, with O'Donnell, Brad Buecker, Brad Falchuk and Bassett also executive producing.

Mads Mikkelsen will star in action thriller Sirius, the debut feature from Academy Award-winning editor Lee Smith.


Neon International is kicking off foreign sales to the film at in Cannes, with Neon's third-party sales house Decal handling rights domestically and planning it as the label's first wide theatrical release.


	Pic is based on a screenplay by Tony Mosher (Mechanic: Resurrection) and is currently in pre-production, described as a “gripping Arctic action-thriller inspired by the real-life Sirius Patrol, the Danish special forces unit charged with defending Greenland's 8,700-mile frozen coastline.”

	Smith, a first time director, is known for collaborations with Sam Mendes, Christopher Nolan and Peter Weir, and won an Academy Award for Best Film Editing for his work on Nolan's Dunkirk. He was also nominated for Weir's Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World and Nolan's The Dark Knight.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘The Voice' Fans ‘Screaming' & ‘Crying' Over Season 28 Coach Lineup Reveal: ‘Iconic'","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/season-28-coaches-fans-react/","Tue, 13 May 2025 14:10:01 GMT","

As fans of “The Voice” prepare to vote for their favorites on the first live shows of season 27, they got an unexpected extra dose of excitement on May 12, 2025, as NBC announced the coaching lineup for season 28. 

Snoop Dogg, whose return was announced in early May, will be joined this fall by three more of the most popular coaches in recent history: Reba McEntire, Michael Bublé, and Niall Horan. The morning announcement had fans flipping out on social media. 

Snoop, Bublé, and McEntire had incredible chemistry during season 26, with Gwen Stefani rounding out their foursome. On May 12, fans were thrilled to see three of the four returning, but the addition of Horan — who was a coach during seasons 23 and 24 — took the excitement to a fever pitch.

A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice)

NBC dropped the news of its season 28 coaches with two social media posts featuring all four returning coaches. The first had over 100,000 likes within a couple of hours, and the comment sections were immediately flooded with responses from over-the-moon fans. 

One exclaimed in all caps, “SCREAMING BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST ICONIC GROUP YET!!!! 😍😍😍”

Another excitedly commented, “Snoop 🔥 Reba 🔥 Niall 🔥 YAAS ❤️ YAAS ❤️YAAS ❤️ So Hyped 😍”

“LETS FREAKING GOOOOOOOO,” someone else wrote, while another chimed in, “Niall Horan & Micheal Buble on THE SAME season was notttt on my 2025 bingo card!!! Eek! This is very yay!!!🙌🏼✨👏🏼🤩”

Horan's return had fans particularly pumped. The former One Direction star was a popular addition to the show and won both seasons he coached, with Gina Miles in season 23 and Huntley in season 24, but left in 2024 for his world tour. He's also been mourning the loss of One Direction bandmate Liam Payne, who died tragically in October. 

Even Bublé, left a funny comment about Horan's return, writing, “My favourite Horan is back!! It's the return of the Irish king! The world is healing”

A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice)

Bublé, 49, previously said he turned down “The Voice” producers at least 15 times before finally agreeing to join the show for season 26. He quickly fell in love with the format, his fellow coaches and the contestants — including his season 26 winner Sofronio Vasquez.

“This is the best job I've ever had,” he told People on May 12. “Going to work every day is a joy, and I'm so thrilled to be back for Season 28. I remember being just like these contestants. I know how badly they want it and how hard it is to get there. I've had my dream come true, and the fact that I get to be a part of helping someone else in their journey to do that same thing, there's nothing better. It is really fulfilling.”

Returning for season 28 in the fall makes the Canadian crooner one of the only coaches to appear three seasons in a row in recent years, per People. 

He told the outlet, “There's a reason why ‘The Voice' remains such a success after so many years, and it's because it really is about the artists. The talent on this show is incredible, and it's been such a beautiful experience to be a part of the process.”

Season 28 will air in the fall on NBC. Meanwhile, season 27 kicks off its live shows on May 12 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

Jamal Roberts, a physical education teacher and dad of three who made it into the top 5 of “American Idol” season 23, vied for viewers' votes again on May 12, 2025. It was the second of two Disney nights, during which Roberts had to perform two tune from Disney's vast song catalog. Viewers had less than two hours to vote for their favorites during the show, determining who would make it through to the top 3 of season 23.

SPOILER ALERT: Do not continue reading if you do NOT want to know whether Roberts made it into the top 3.

Voting closed during the final commercial break, and the results were handed over to host Ryan Seacrest to reveal which members of top 5 would advance to the top 3. So did Roberts make it through? YES, he did make it through!

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

Before performing his first tune on the May 12 show, Roberts was seen on at Disneyland with his young daughters, mom and sister. He got to take his little girls to dress up like princesses and said that he loved “seeing the smiles on my kids' faces.” He also said that if his God-given gift of singing could change his life, he doesn't want to stop what he's started with “American Idol.” 

The show then moved back in-studio for Roberts' live performance of “Ain't No Mountain High Enough” from “Remember the Titans.” Roberts got the crowd involved, clapping their hands above their heads and got Bryan and Richie leaped to their feet at the end. Smiling as the crowd went wild, Bryan kept yelling, “Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out!” Bryan said he was emotional seeing Roberts at Disneyland with his family, and that after watching his original audition, he is blown away by how far he's come. 

Richie told him, “I don't know if I can emotionally take another performance” because he's so impressed by Roberts, saying he “Jamalarized” the song, with an ability to make any tune “soulful.” Underwood said that while he an incredible voice, she did think he did miss an opportunity to move all around the stage with such an upbeat song. 

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

Roberts' second song choice started out rocky. He chose to sing “Beauty and the Beast,” but couldn't tell guest mentor Lin-Manuel Miranda why. In fact, he realized he was having a hard time connecting with the lyrics like “tale as old as time” and Miranda said the disconnection was obvious. Roberts admitted it would probably be “one of the biggest challenges of the season for me.” 

Miranda urged him to find meaning in the words for himself, and that if he could do that, he'd knock it out of the park. He must have done that, because the crowd and judges were blown away by what he did with the song. 

After Roberts' performance, the crowd continued to cheer so loudly that Underwood couldn't speak. Bryan finally yelled, “Let's win this baby, let's win this!” And Richie told him that no one but him could turn “Beauty in the Beast” into an R&B song. Roberts will now move onto the finale on May 19.

While they've admitted to having very different personalities, there doesn't seem to be anything that could come between Kendall and Kylie Jenner. The sisters are very close and always try to support each other. Recently, the supermodel publicly showed her approval of Kylie's relationship with Timothée Chalamet by happily playing third wheel at the New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics Game 4 on May 12.

Kylie and Kendall sat courtside alongside Chalamet at Madison Square Garden for the much-anticipated game. They both posted photos on their Instagram stories of themselves in their tank top and leather jean uniforms, topped off with Knicks hats. At the game, Kylie also had a blue Knicks jacket, which she took off. 

The three could be seen gleefully supporting the Knicks with Chalamet, who's known as an avid fan. So avid that, while Kylie went to the Met Gala, he cheered the team on at home with pals.

Chalamet was photographed looking ecstatic during the game. Afterwards, when the Knicks beat the Celtics 121 – 113, he celebrated with Spike Lee and shook Karl Anthony Town's hand. 

A post shared by Timothée Chalamet Files (@tchalametfiles)

Chalamet has been an ardent fan since he was a kid. After the win, he posted a photo of himself at 14 on his Instagram stories, getting his jersey signed by then-Knicks star Amar'e Stoudemire. A second photo showed him as an adult clasping hands with Stoudemire. “TIED THE LOOP,” he captioned the photo. 

No matter who she chooses as her partner, Kylie can always count on her sister. The two have often double-dated or seemed to befriend each other's beaus. In 2017, when Kylie was still dating Tyga and Kendall A$AP Rocky, the Daily Mail posted photos of the four in New York City. Their double date included diamond shopping. 

When Kylie was pregnant with Stormi, she and Travis went on a double date with Kendall and then-boyfriend Blake Griffin. According to People, the group was spotted at Universal Studios' Halloween Horror Nights. 

While Kylie was still with Travis Scott, Kendall often accompanied her sister to his concerts. Even after they split, she's frequently proven she can still be counted on when her sister needs her. In one TikTok video a fan posted, Kendall supervised Kylie and Scott's daughter, Stormi, at Coachella earlier this year so she could watch her dad perform. 

Replying to @🐰 adorbsssss#stormiwebster #kyliejenner #travisscott #kendalljenner #fypシ 

It's always been apparent that the sisters have a powerful bond. While they've joked about doing a Kardashians spin-off that's just about them, it would be fun to watch their two contrasting personalities together.

Despite being three decades since the two starred together in James Cameron's True Lies, the easy banter between Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger makes it seem like it was only yesterday. As Schwarzenegger spoke at Amazon's Upfront event, Curtis came up to playfully take him off the stage. What followed was the pair giving the audience a sweet and entertaining trip down memory lane.

It started with Schwarzenegger talking about his new Amazon film, The Man with the Bag, before he began rambling about getting tricked into speaking, and the best marketing strategies. “Marketing, and communicating to the mass, and publicity is the most important thing,” he said at the Ad-focused event (via Deadline). “You can have the best product in the world, but if they don't know about it, you have nothing! Absolutely nothing.”

Soon, Curtis was sneaking out, pretending she was there to pull him from the stage. As she grabbed his arm, he protested. “This is elder abuse!” he joked. Soon, both were off-script, reminiscing about True Lies.

But as the two wrapped things up and senior ad executive Alan Moss began to walk out, she yelled, “Hold on, don't come!” She then turned to Schwarzenegger, who uttered “We'll be back,” before the two recreated a True Lies moment with a kiss. “She still has it,” Schwarzenegger said.

“Let me just say this because I'm here with all y'all, because of this man, I have the career I have,” the Freaky Friday actress told the audience. She then explained how significant Schwarzenegger's decision to put her name above the title was to her.

“So Jim [Cameron] writes the part for me. We shoot the movie. So we make the movie and you know, they cut it together and we finished in April, [it] came out in July. I mean it was a really fast thing,” Curtis recalled (via People). “And I remember I was at home and I got a phone call and it was James Cameron and Arnold. And Jim said to me, ‘Jamie, I'm sitting here with Arnold in my office. I've just shown him the movie. It's about a married couple.'”

“And in the contract, it says Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies starring Jamie Lee Curtis,” she continued. “And Jim said to me on the phone, ‘I asked Arnold if I could put you above the title because it's a movie about a marriage, and I think it would be appropriate,' and Arnold, a figure who clearly did not have to say yes, said yes.”

The high-rise restaurant disaster that kicks off “Final Destination Bloodlines” has a “Looney Tunes” quality to it that some critics will falsely pin on a single falling piano. Yes, there is a thousand-pound string instrument that comes crashing down several stories before flattening a bratty kid in a bow tie. But that's just the cherry on top of a perfectly cartoonish opening to the best film this fiendish horror franchise from the 2000s has ever known. Delivering the most visually impressive, emotionally compelling, and quick witted “Final Destination” to date, co-directors Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein work wonders with a reboot that shouldn't land nearly as well as it does.

Twenty-five years since Flight 180 failed to reach Paris, New Line's freak accident series — infamous for its mass-casualty events and Rube Goldberg-inspired kill sequences — returns with an unconventional script written by Guy Busick and Lori Evans. Here, the same narrative scaffolding that brought Laurie Strode and Jamie Lee Curtis back to “Halloween” (2018) meets the more retro side of The Conjuring Universe… but in typical “Final Destination” fashion, there's no slasher villain in sight.




			Popular on IndieWire		






“Bloodlines” is a prequel/sequel hybrid that introduces, torments, and revives a legacy final girl, who didn't exist at all before now, over the course of just one film playing opposite the invisible threat of Death. That might sound like a bad idea, but the blood-soaked series' triumphant sixth installment is better for the unexpected approach. Ambition trips up this highly detailed resurrection just a handful of times, leaving behind a feat of nimble comedic tone and cohesive pacing that's even more effective than the iconic time-loop twist that directly precedes it at the end of the last sequel, “Final Destination 5.”

“Bloodlines” zips past the 2010s and the aughts to the same day as the plane crash from the original 2000 movie in the year 1968. Lovebirds Iris (Brec Bassinger) and Paul (Max Lloyd-Jones) help their atypical “Final Destination” setup take flight with a believable but still idyllic date night reminiscent of a romantic old ad for a luxury car brand. The dramatic radiance of AMC's “Mad Men” contorts to resemble something more like the body horror in Shudder's “Mad God” when opening night at the Skyview ends in a cataclysmic structure collapse. Screws pop loose, glass panels break, and open flames collide with panicked dancers for a chain reaction so fatally funny it could have happened to Wile E. Coyote. It's all triggered by a careless flick of the wrist and cinema's least lucky penny: a fitting new totem for “Final Destination” that shines brightest the instant that crappy kid's piano flattening finally sticks.

 










You can't cheat death without seeing your fate first, and signs have always played an essential part in the “Final Destination” universe. Still, “Bloodlines” pushes far past its standard premonitions to explore Death's superstitious side and its complex lore more completely. The scares continue to rely on the laws of physics, creepy atmosphere, and common objects to work their magic. (If you aren't afraid of Trash Day yet, you will be.) But filmmakers Lipovsky and Stein find their groove in a unique sort of bouncy brutality. Eyes brimming with tears, reflecting back the bright teal color of her '60s party dress, Bassinger should take the following comparison — between her performance as Young Iris and that one scene with the clown shoe in “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?” — as a compliment of the highest order. Helping a toddler (Jayden Oniah) survive the Skyview carnage, Iris emerges as a fully formed, energized, and sympathetic horror heroine who seems like she's battled through her share of sequels before. 

Following in the footsteps of fan favorite Kimberly Corman (the “Final Destination 2” lead played by A.J. Cook, who gets a solid shout-out in “Bloodlines”), new girl Iris Campbell seems to meet her sky-high maker when a piercing scream suddenly jolts “Bloodlines” into the present. Waking up confused in the middle of a college lecture hall in 2025, Stefani Reyes (Kaitlyn Santa Juana) has been having recurring nightmares about her estranged grandmother for months. “Iris.” One of several delightfully melodramatic reveals, that's the first clue this “Final Destination” puzzle won't operate like the earlier ones did.

 










Soon, Stefani is speeding back to her childhood home, demanding answers about Iris and the bizarre fine-dining disaster she endured decades ago. How did Iris escape the certain doom foretold to her by that “Shout!” needle drop? And could that terrible night have something to do with why her only daughter, Darlene (Rya Kihlstedt), abandoned Stefani and her brother, Charlie (Teo Briones), years later?

After a rushed reunion with her dad, Marty (Tinpo Lee), Stefani wastes no time contacting even more of her relatives about uprooting the planet's most fucked-up family tree. Haunted by his disturbed mother and her mysterious history, Uncle Howard (Alex Zahara) doesn't want to talk about it. His wife, Aunt Brenda (April Telek), isn't related to Stefani anyway. And as for Erik (Richard Harmon), Julia (Anna Lore), and Bobby (Owen Patrick Joyner) — the coolest cousins to grace a major horror sequel since Alexandra Daddario hit “Texas Chainsaw 3D” — the siblings are mostly loyal to each other. They like their parents. They like Charlie. They even love Bobby's pet turtle, Paco. But when it comes to Stefani and her crazy theories about Grandma Iris (Gabrielle Rose), news of the Campbell family's supposed curse isn't welcome. Of course, “Final Destination” rarely wastes time explaining itself to victims who won't listen.

 










The rare reboot with a decent title, “Bloodlines” uses direct confrontation between characters who know each other intimately to revitalize a torture format typically reserved for total strangers. The core cast has an infectious chemistry that improves the film's tone immensely, and even situated in a generally good plot, there are portions of the story that wouldn't fly without their buzz. It's vastly more exciting to watch relatives as they simultaneously battle Death's Design and their petty grudges than it is to see single-trait caricatures getting repeatedly yanked through a twisted public health crisis. Better still, that familiarity between actors subtly affirms the work of the two “Bloodlines” filmmakers — conveying faith in this story, comfort with their artistic collaboration, and authority over the “Final Destination” fanbase.

Having loved these movies since the turn of the century, I'll debase myself with first-person references just long enough to admit that “Bloodlines” gave me everything I could personally need. Ranking these films is a nostalgia-laden minefield that's more sensitive than most, and yet each chapter seems to serve a distinct purpose(*) in retrospect. “Final Destination” (2000) delivers Jeffrey Reddick's original “X-Files” spec script idea in its purest form, but “Final Destination 2” (2003) enjoys the smartest arc of the first five films and has already gone down in history for its indelible highway disaster. The brilliant decision to cast Mary Elizabeth Winstead — and include that tanning booth scene — in “Final Destination 3” (2006) make it the most entertaining chapter that's specific to aughts horror, while “Final Destination 5” (2011) continues to boast the all-around strongest collection of kills with the most stable shelf life. 

 










(*)The purpose of “The Final Destination” (2009)  is that it is the worst one. The end. (Also known as “Final Destination 4,” that one also has the pool butt scene, which ought to count for something.)

Die-hard “Final Destination” obsessives will find plenty to pick apart when it comes to Iris' dubious survival strategy in “Bloodlines.” Suffice to say, Clear Rivers' padded cell has never looked smarter — and some tackier sequences near the end undercut that sparkling first impression from the Skyview. Clever enough to riff on the earlier films' spotty track record with digital effects, the newest “Final Destination” stays a smidge too true to its era by including at least one slow-mo explosion à la Michael Bay. It's a fiery splash of nonsense that's as boring to look at now as it would have been then, but the underwhelming effect feels even more maddening in the middle of near-miss climax that needs all the help it can get.

Narrowly saved by a truly genius kicker (one that's oddly reminiscent of Sam Raimi's “Drag Me to Hell,” by the way), “Bloodlines” is the only “Final Destination” that doesn't play both versions of its centerpiece emergency back-to-back. It's also the first of these philosophical kill-a-thons that feels like watching a real flesh-and-blood movie. An emotional death by a thousand darkly comic cuts, “Bloodlines” wracks up little character wins along its way to rendering an impeccable kill featuring the best-written death in the entire series. Intertwining humor, horror, and heart into a jester's crown of thorns, the magnetic actor sacrificed at the main altar of that kill should be immediately canonized a “Final Destination” saint.

 










Silly, delicate, sharp, and mean, “Bloodlines” has its flaws but nevertheless confirms Death's Design as a force worthy of its own special place in the horror hall of fame. A flawless goodbye for Tony Todd, whose enduring affection for the genre community oozes from the screen like a warm hug, “Bloodlines” should appear high on any list of the Candyman's most enchanting performances regardless of when he passed. As the sun sets on William Bludworth, the latest and greatest “Final Destination” looks to the horizon in a rapidly expanding world that Todd helped build into an institution as big as his presence.

Sketched with the same boundary-pushing meticulousness “Looney Tunes” animators once used to make Bugs and Daffy leap off the page, “Final Destination” could have returned with the disappointing *dink* of a 2D penny. Instead, this wonderfully weird and lyrical film — a crackling ode to the perverse operatics underpinning accidents no human can explain — lands with the full weight of a frenzied jazz band. It doesn't get much better than a rude maître d' ironically denied a life-saving spot on a crowded elevator. And yet, even falling from the top of the Skyview, “Bloodlines” will have newcomers and lifelong “Final Destination” fans laughing about that damn piano the whole way down.

 










Warner Bros. Pictures, “Final Destination Bloodlines” is in theaters Friday, May 16.

Bob Odenkirk is back as Hutch Mansell AKA the anonymous assassin whose identity was compromised during the ass-kicking 2021 action hit film “Nobody.” Now, four years later, Odenkirk reprises his role for “Nobody 2” and has more than a few enemies to battle onscreen…

After inadvertently taking on the Russian mob, Hutch is still $30 million in debt to the criminal organization and is working it off with an unending string of hits on international thugs. During his day job of being a suburban dad and husband to his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen), he realizes that his role as a family man is also in danger. And so, Hutch and his kids decide to go on a vacation, one that quickly turns into a bloodbath as Hutch has to not only protect his family but also his identity from hit men.

The official synopsis reads: “Much as he likes the slam-bang action of his “job,” Hutch and his wife Becca find themselves overworked and drifting apart. So, they decide to take their kids (Gage Munroe and Paisley Cadorath) on a short getaway to Wild Bill's Majestic Midway and Waterpark, the one and only place where Hutch and his brother Harry (RZA) went on a vacation as kids. With Hutch's dad (Christopher Lloyd) in tow, the family arrives in the small tourist town of Plummerville (“Plummerville is Summerville!”), eager for some fun in the sun. But when a minor encounter with some town bullies yanks the family into the crosshairs of a corrupt theme-park operator (John Ortiz) and his shady sheriff (Colin Hanks), Hutch finds himself the focus of the most unhinged, blood-thirsty crime boss he (or anyone) has ever encountered (Sharon Stone).”

Timo Tjahjanto directs from a script by Derek Kolstad and Aaron Rabin. Kelly McCormick, David Leitch, Marc Provissiero, Braden Aftergood, and Odenkirk are back producing, with David Hyman executive producing. “Nobody 2” is an 87North/Eighty Two Films/Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment production.

Odenkirk famously trained for two years to play the role in the first 2021 feature. He also told The New York Times at the time that “Nobody” was inspired by two real-life break-ins that he experienced. The character was also an extension of his titular “Better Call Saul” role, as Odenkirk explained. 

“My hope is we get to do a trilogy, and he ends up with nothing,” Odenkirk said of his dreams of a franchise for the character. “He destroys everything he loves.”

 










Universal will premiere “Nobody 2” August 15 in theaters. Check out the trailer below.

Kim Kardashian has had some of the most publicized divorces in celebrity history, but this budding attorney is turning her fact into fiction for Ryan Murphy series “All's Fair.” 

Kardashian reunites with her “American Horror Story: Delicate” producer Murphy for the Hulu ensemble legal drama. And Kardashian isn't the only Murphy staple in the mix: In addition to Kardashian, the cast includes fellow Murphy alums Sarah Paulson, Naomi Watts, and Niecy Nash, as well as Glenn Close, Teyana Taylor, and Matthew Noszka. 

Kardashian is set to play Los Angeles' most successful divorce lawyer, who works at an all-female law firm. Murphy is directing the series, as well as writing and executive producing. Fellow producers include Jon Robin Baitz, Joe Baken, Jamie Pachino, Lyn Greene, and Richard Levine. Of course, Kardashian's momager Kris Jenner is also executive producing, along with Alexis Martin Woodall, Eric Kovtun, and Scott Robertson. 20th Television, which Kardashian has a first-look deal with, produces “All's Fair” in association with Ryan Murphy Television.

The official synopsis reads: “A team of female divorce attorneys leave a male-dominated firm to open their own powerhouse practice. Fierce, brilliant, and emotionally complicated, they navigate high-stakes breakups, scandalous secrets, and shifting allegiances—both in the courtroom and within their own ranks. In a world where money talks and love is a battleground, these women don't just play the game—they change it.” 

Upon the announcement of “All's Fair,” Kardashian said in a press statement that she is “incredibly interested in telling stories that are personal, complicated, relevant, from my own experiences and those familiar to me.” 

Kardashian's “All's Fair” co-star Paulson teased to IndieWire while promoting her film “Hold Your Breath” that the series is in good hands with its all-star cast. “It's a who's who of the greats,” Paulson told IndieWire of the “All's Fair” ensemble. “I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to it.”

The series also marks Paulson's first non-terrifying role in a Murphy production, aside from her “American Crime Story” appearances. 

Paulson added of reuniting with Murphy, “It's also for me, something I've never really done with Ryan, which is not playing a real person. I'm not running around and I'm not a witch or running from a clown. In the Ryan world, those are the things that I sort of have done the most: either I'm playing a real person, or I'm a witch or a fearful clown person. So I get to play this character that is very far from all of those things, and the whole piece is very far from all of those things.” 

 










Paulson continued, “There's nothing Ryan Murphy could ask me to do that I would say no to. When he calls I answer, and that's what that is. I am lucky to do so. Being reunited with him which is really, really, thrilling”

“All's Fair” will premiere in Fall 2025 on Hulu. Check out the teaser below.

In a film sure to break the internet, real-life sisters Rooney and Kate Mara are playing infamous tabloid twins Joan and Jean Holbrooke for Werner Herzog‘s buzzy “Bucking Fastard.” 

Maverick auteur Herzog writes and directs “Bucking Fastard” based on the true story of the Holbrooke sisters who lived on the fringes of society and spoke in their own twisted language, shared the same dreams, and even loved the same man. Domhnall Gleeson and Orlando Bloom co-star in the feature, which is a sales title from HanWay Films. 

“Bucking Fastard” is set in Ireland, where the sisters are assigned a government-issued social worker (Gleeson) in an attempt to help them adapt to modern life. The official logline teases that Joan and Jean begin digging a tunnel through a mountain range to find an imaginary land where true love is possible; Bloom plays their shared ex-lover, Gareth Maloney.

Herzog announced that “Bucking Fastard” will “complete a circle in an operatic triptych” with his two prior films, “Fitzcarraldo” and “Grizzly Man.” Herzog said of the sisters, played by both Maras, “We cannot see the world as Jean and Joan Holbrooke see it, but we do see how the world reacts to them — through the courts and the press, through those that want to help and those who want to use them, through the eyes of beasts both tame and wild, and even through their own echoes in the core of the earth.”

Kate Mara recently told IndieWire while promoting hit comedy “Friendship” that she was skeptical over whether or not “Bucking Fastard” would even get made. To Mara, the project seemed “too good to be true,” especially as her debut acting alongside sister Rooney Mara. 

“I have loved Werner Herzog's films ever since I saw ‘Burden of Dreams,'” Mara said. “I just love his passion for film and his dedication to it, and how seriously he takes it. I just think it's so rare and beautiful, and he's such a brilliant writer and so truthful and honest and so unique and peculiar. He wrote me and my sister a beautiful letter asking us to be in this about a year ago. We were both so thrilled because we have been wanting to work together for a while, but nothing made sense. This one was immediately a no-brainer, and then it just so happened that it was these sisters who are so connected that they speak in unison and they dream the same dreams. It was so perfectly presented and the script was so special, and odd, so it's an obvious thing to say yes to. But it kind of felt like it would never happen just because it it was like too good to be true.” 

 










Mara added, “It was the most special experience working with Werner, who was wild and fantastical. He's everything you want him to be. He just knows exactly what he wants. And then working with my sister was equally as much of a dream.” 

“Bucking Fastard” is produced by Clara Wu Tsai, Ariel Leon Isacovitch, Agnes Chu, Kieran Corrigan, Emanuele Moretti, and Andrea Bucko. The film is a sales title that will be presented at the Cannes marketplace. Check out the first look image above.

Michelle Pfeiffer at Christmastime? No, it's not a “Batman Returns” sequel, but it may be just as campy. The beloved actress who recently (finally!) received her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is leading Michael Showalter‘s holiday feature “Oh. What. Fun.” alongside a slew of It-indie actors. 

Pfeiffer plays matriarch Claire Clauster, whose perfectionist tendencies always make for the best Christmases. However, when her kids forget about their own mother over the holidays, she's forced to reflect on priorities. The official synopsis reads: “Claire is the glue that holds her chaotic, lovable family together every holiday season. From perfectly frosted cookies to meticulously wrapped gifts, no one decks the halls quite like Claire. But this year, as her grown kids and distracted husband get swept up in their own seasonal dramas, they make one crucial mistake: They forget their mom. By the time they realize she's missing, Claire's already set off on a festive adventure of her own — one that doesn't involve cooking, cleaning, or coordinating anyone else's chaos. As her family scrambles to find her and salvage their Christmas, Claire rediscovers what the holidays mean when you're finally free to put yourself first.”

Dominic Sessa, whose own holiday-centric film “The Holdovers” propelled him to stardom in 2023, plays one of Pfeiffer's children, alongside fellow indie stars Felicity Jones, Chloë Grace Moretz, Devery Jacobs, Havana Rose Liu, and Maude Apatow in the cast. The iconic Joan Chen also is among the ensemble, as well as Denis Leary, Danielle Brooks, Jason Schwartzman, and Eva Longoria.

Director Showalter cowrote the script with Chandler Baker; he also produces, along with Tribeca CEO and legendary producer Jane Rosenthal, Berry Welsh, Jordana Mollick, and Kate Churchill. Showalter has had a beneficial partnership with Prime Video as of late: The filmmaker helmed viral hit “The Idea of You” for the streamer, and will reunite with actress Anne Hathaway for another novel adaptation, this time of Colleen Hoover‘s “Verity.” “The Act” and “A Friend of the Family” true crime creator Nick Antosca is writing the script, with Josh Hartnett and Dakota Johnson co-starring. 

“Oh. What. Fun.” will be streaming on Prime Video December 3. Check out the teaser below.

Despite best efforts to talk about movies at Cannes, with the sprawling official selection yet to be screened, at early press conferences festival director Thierry Fremaux and his Competition jury batted back questions about the state of the world today. Queries swung from Gerard Depardieu's #MeToo conviction, to showing three films from Ukraine and banning Russia from the festival, which from its founding in 1939 was “predicated on liberty,” said Fremaux. 

“People take risks to make films,” he said. “The most important thing is not someone's safety, but making a film. The festival is political when the artists are political. Jafar Panahi [Iranian Competition entry ‘A Simple Accident'] is prepared to risk going to prison.”

As to the current political winds prevailing in America and elsewhere, Fremaux said, “The cinema requires a lot of funding. It is often the first target. Around the world we need to defend cinema.” As for President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs on films produced overseas, Fremaux feels it is too early to know what will actually happen. “Maybe we should talk in a year,” he said. “The cinema always finds a way of existing and reinventing itself. Here in Cannes we wouldn't like the American cinema to cease to be strong.”

While Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche deflected a question about Gaza, she took on President Trump's threatened tariffs on films, and she eventually revealed her true feelings. “We understood that from the beginning that President Trump was trying to protect his country but for us, we have a very strong community of filming on our continent,” she said. “We can see that he's fighting, and he's trying in many, many different ways to save America and save his ass.”

She continued, “The world is going into places that are very dangerous. And so the more we're going close to those spaces of danger, we need art in order to survive and have a view that gives us gives us hope and connection between each other.”

Juror Jeremy Strong addressed playing his Oscar-nominated role in “The Apprentice,” which played Cannes last year without him, as he was on Broadway. “Roy Cohn, I see essentially as the progenitor of fake communities and alternative facts, and we're living in the aftermath of what he created,” he said. “This time where truth is under assault, where truth is becoming an increasingly endangered thing. The role of stories, of cinema art, but here specifically at this temple of film, the role of film is increasingly critical, because it can combat those forces and the entropy of truth, and can communicate truths, individual truths, human truths, societal truths, and affirm and celebrate our shared humanity. What I'm here doing this year is in a way, a counterbalance to what Roy Cohn was doing last year.”

 










Fremaux's main message is how Cannes has the power to propel even small indies like “The Apprentice” and Sean Baker's “Anora” (Neon) into the world — and eventually even win Oscars. “Things got going, the adventure begins in Cannes,” he said. “It's a special festival. A film can show in Cannes in May and still be alive in March the following year. American distributors and producers who like Cannes, like Neon, know how to make the best of it.”

Last year, Oscar winners “Emilia Pérez” and “Flow” also launched at Cannes. And the increasingly international cast of the Academy voters has elevated foreign-language films that gain a profile at Cannes.

Much of that buzz is generated for the prize-winners like Palme d'Or-winning “Parasite,” “Anatomy of a Fall,” and “Anora,” all from Neon. And that comes down to the Competition jury. 

Jury duty began Tuesday, May 13 for this year's Cannes Film Festival competition panelists, led by Binoche, who first came to the festival 14 years ago. She presides over a nine-member jury composed of actors Halle Berry, Alba Rohrwacher, and Jeremy Strong, directors Hong Sang Soo, Dieudo Hamadi, Payal Kapadia, and Carlos Reygadas, and French-Moroccan diplomat/journalist Leïla Slimani. The winners tend to be films that move the jurors emotionally, which is why the Dardennes have won twice.

 










This year, Fremaux is proud to host the Dardennes for the ninth time in Competition, Julia Ducourneau's second (“Alpha”), as well as American auteurs Wes Anderson's fourth Cannes entry (“The Phoenician Scheme”) and Richard Linklater's second (“Nouvelle Vague”). What will the prize contenders be? “Sentimental Value” from Norway third-timer Joachim Trier could fly, along with Oliver Hermanus's gay romance “The History of Sound” (MUBI).

 “We'll watch the films together,” said Binoche. “And after that, it's this connection that is beyond thinking that will make a special result.”

Noname has become the second artist in a week to have a concert in New York's Central Park canceled. No cause was given, and representatives for Live Nation, which organized the show for the SummerStage concert series, and for Noname herself have not responded to requests for comment. That the cancellation so swiftly follows that of a Kehlani SummerStage concert has prompted speculation that the two vocally pro-Palestine artists have been targeted on political grounds, as Hell Gate notes. New York's mayor, Eric Adams, took responsibility for the Kehlani cancellation, citing apparent “security concerns” while alluding to the pro-Palestine statements that caused Cornell University to drop her campus concert last month. The mayor's office told Hell Gate, however, that it had no part in the Noname cancellation.

Noname had been due to perform the Juneteenth SummerStage concert in Central Park, supported by Ravyn Lenae and Fana Hues. City Parks Foundation, the nonprofit that runs SummerStage, has directed media to Live Nation, saying the foundation had no direct part in organizing the Noname show. Lenae's representatives had no comment when reached by Pitchfork.

Queens of the Stone Age have announced a new concert film. Alive in the Catacombs documents a largely acoustic performance that the band—accompanied by a three piece string section—recorded in the Catacombs of Paris last July, around the time frontman Josh Homme underwent emergency surgery that led the group to cancel some tour dates. Directed by Thomas Rames, the film will premiere June 5 via Queens of the Stone Age's website. Watch the trailer below.

“We're so stripped down because that place is so stripped down, which makes the music so stripped down, which makes the words so stripped down… It would be ridiculous to try to rock there,” Homme said in a press statement. “All those decisions were made by that space. That space dictates everything, it's in charge. You do what you're told when you're in there.” He also described the catacombs' several million human remains as “the biggest audience we've ever played for.”

May 13, 2025

By day, Erika de Casier deals out soft-spoken come-ons and kiss-offs via throwback R&B. By night, she's an incognito hitmaker. Last year de Casier lent a steely edge to Floridian producer Nick Léon's heady summer club cut “Bikini,” and in 2023 she got in the studio with K-pop group NewJeans, co-writing several songs from their Get Up EP—among them the winningly naive “Super Shy.” The Danish singer has quietly left her fingerprints all over pop's ongoing Y2K revival, but sometimes at the cost of Erika de Casier the solo recording artist. While her last album, 2024's Still, could often stun and delight—the laugh and twinkling chimes that kick off “Lucky” never fail to make me grin—a spate of unnecessary guest features diluted its creator's singular talents. Entirely self-written, self-produced, and released on her own label, Independent Jeep Music, Lifetime is a deliberate recentering, de Casier's attempt to single-handedly distill the better part of a decade into one highly potent vibe.

Forgoing her trademark nostalgia for the '00s, de Casier has committed herself to pre-Napsterdom in spirit and sound, triangulating three high-concept pop lodestars all released between 1992 and 1998: Janet Jackson's Janet., Madonna's Ray of Light, and, at the apex of her altar, Sade's Love Deluxe. Every song here fades in—how retro is that—on a bed of aqueous synthesizers, buoyed by boom-bap drums. “If you know, what I'd do, do to you,” de Casier coos on album opener “Miss,” her voice enveloped in so much reverb that it dissolves at the edges. One working title for Lifetime was Midnight Caller, an easy shorthand for seduction, mystery, and menace rolled into one. Several tracks (“You Can't Always Get What You Want,” “The Chase,” “Two Thieves”) even incorporate what are either diegetic dial tones—a noted Janet-ism—or soundwaves shaped to convincingly mimic one.

As “Miss” yields to the hothouse piano and tabla of “You Can't Always Get What You Want,” Lifetime takes a turn towards Pure Moods, and with that some period-accurate new-age triteness: “Health or disease—you never know what you get/Might as well live gratefully.” But de Casier delivers these songs archly and suggestively—a glimmer in her eye, liquor on her breath—and the lyric sheet is appropriately marked up with each stray “uh,” “uhmm,” “ah,” and “mmh-mhh.” On “Moan,” a spiritual successor to Jackson's “Throb,” her hypnotic entreaty to “just make love” warps the whole track around it, as represented by an impassioned keysmash: “%!//&”//“/!!/!(()!=“##=”. The syncopated hook of “Delusional,” built around a sample immortalized by Cypress Hill's “Insane in the Brain,” is irresistibly ear-catching, as is the way de Casier's tongue catches on “slow mo-tion,” right before “You Got It!” kicks up a spray of seafoam. And once in a while, de Casier will hit on something profound: “The truth was in the bottom of the wine/Bordeaux can make you talk a lot,” she notes, soberly, on the trip-hop standout “December.”

If the results of Lifetime's solo writing process are mixed, de Casier's work behind the boards is wall-to-wall dazzling, from the extraterrestrial rave stabs that pan across the stereo field on “Seasons” to the mournful cyborg whose voice echoes her own on “December.” Beginning as a funky, TLC-style creeper, “Two Thieves” gradually grinds down to an industrial chug that would do Massive Attack proud. But there are challenges that come with jacking completely into the mainframe. Lifetime lacks a commanding, sharply defined persona at its center—a sensuous Janet, an adamant Sade Adu, a Madonna brashly taking stabs at transcendence. De Casier seems to worry about this, too. “When the light's out/Do you still see me,” she ponders aloud on the record's title track, but one can't be sure what to look for, other than “lipstick, blush, eyes half open and a feeling that's so bold.” Then again, the best operatives never make the front page. Here is a master of soft power at work.

A little less than a decade ago—after a traumatic and tragic stint in Miami that led to time spent in a psychiatric care unit—Yung Lean began working on an album that he said sounded like a combination between Daniel Johnston and Lil Wayne. “I'm gonna release it as Yung Lean,” he told The Fader in 2016. “You put out three rap albums, then you can do whatever you like.” The resulting record didn't really sound like the combination he described, and he didn't release it as Yung Lean either, instead putting out the post-punk-inspired Psychopath Ballads as jonatan leandoer127. Since then, Lean has often used this alias (which he changed to jonatan leandoer96 in 2018) to channel his alternative, non-rap creative impulses: collaborations with Dean Blunt, covers of This Mortal Coil, folk songs sung in Swedish. Elements of the side project have seeped into his work as Yung Lean as well; over the years, as he's navigated maturity and sobriety, his albums have reliably featured more personal songwriting and genre experimentation. Fans track his character development with each new release.

Jonatan, his fifth studio album as Yung Lean, is an attempt at merging his various musical identities under one banner. Executive produced by Frank Ocean collaborator Rami Dawod, with contributions from Oneohtrix Point Never and Beck, the album's 13 songs are built around pared-down guitar and piano melodies and sparse drums, pushing Lean himself to center stage. This emphasis on his voice makes for some raw moments when Lean's idiosyncratic delivery and the blunt production meet each other eye to eye. At other times, Jonatan's stripped-down framework highlights his limitations as a vocalist and songwriter, veering into pastiche.

The album is Lean's reckoning with breaking up, getting older, and spending the past 12 years making music for public consumption. In the video for “Forever Yung,” the first single, he holds a funeral procession for a past version of himself dressed as a king. The song's narrator searches for authenticity in a world full of artifice, and its industrial rockabilly swing lends itself to Lean's subdued melody. His ABBA interpolation (and halfway Gil Scott-Heron interpolation) on “Might Not B” sounds at home over a buzzing bassline, while his abstract writing and monotone sing-song are well suited to the toy music box synth on “Paranoid Paparazzi.” The album whirrs when the production is at its most dynamic: the Coldplay-like string hits on “I'm Your Dirt, I'm Your Love,” and the dramatic choral backing on the OPN-assisted “Terminator Symphony” support some of the album's most captivating vocal performances. On “Teenage Symphonies 4 God (God Will Only),” Lean fully commands the backing track, his voice full of anguish as he wails, “I've been so cold to everybody that loves me.”

The Yung Lean catalog is buoyed by the skillful, ever-evolving production of longtime collaborators Gud, Whitearmor, and Yung Sherman. In contrast, for his leandoer96 releases, he's turned to a different generation of Scandinavian outsiders: The Tough Alliance collaborator Kendal Johansson, Joakim Benon from the Swedish electronic duo jj, and Frederik Valentin of Rock Hard Power Spray and the label Posh Isolation. Lean continues this trend with Dawod, and their proto-punk and no wave-influenced sound is faithful if not groundbreaking on a song like “Horses.” Elsewhere, it sounds as if recording songs in this style was a creative decision made beforehand, not because these arrangements are the best expression of his ideas. “Babyface Maniacs” and “Changes” are particularly unimaginative and canned; the despondent delivery on the latter track is quintessential Lean but the rote hook—“Changes they come, changes they go/Life goes over and over again”—sounds hollow over the near-atonality of the instrumental.

There's a reason Yung Lean has endured well beyond his initial internet virality. He's grown as a person and an artist, and, through his music, he's let his fans in on the messy, nonlinear process. The distance between Jonatan's rugged, monochrome rock and the lush synths and 808s of his early work is interesting, but that on its own doesn't inherently make these songs great. The strength of Lean's music has always been in its juxtapositions: crushing vulnerability over bright melodies, simple flexes next to existentialism. In swinging all the way towards one sound for this album, he's lost small parts of what made both his side project and his main project special. He never quite found that combination of Daniel Johnston and Lil Wayne, and it sounds like he's still yet to find a way to unite the disparate parts of Yung Lean.

It's easy to root for PUP, even when it seems like they don't want you to. Frontman Stefan Babcock would much rather you sling mud at his melodic punk-rock band or tell him you're sick of his shit. After all, he's spent five albums disgusted with his own self-loathing and profusely apologizing for it. “Trust me, I get it,” he says with an eye roll on the opening track to their latest record, Who Will Look After the Dogs? But from the jump, PUP swapped pop-punk's key traits of angst and apathy for depression and deep concern. It's what gave the Toronto stalwarts an edge of maturity over their peers, even if they hid it by crushing beer cans and pledging allegiance to perpetual heartbreak.

That perspective is rare within the genre, which rewards staying young at heart forever onstage. But eventually, performers stop recognizing the stickers on the green room's scratched-up mirror and start noticing their crow's feet instead. It's a game of musical cryogenics where contestants like the Wonder Years still have to yell, “Jesus Christ, I'm 26!” at age 39, or the Menzingers are still rhetorically asking what comes after your 20s as they stare down their 40s. Addressing the insecurities of aging without souring a melody is tricky, particularly when fans crave heart-pounding, carefree shout-alongs. Learning how to mature alongside your work, though, is what separates the middle-age deniers from the mindful adults. On Who Will Look After the Dogs?, PUP has filled out an application form to join the latter demographic.

The lifelong struggle with mental health that Babcock sings about isn't on his shoulders alone; all of his bandmates—guitarist Steve Sladkowski, bassist Nestor Chumak, and drummer Zack Mykula—have confessed to carrying that weight in their own lives at times. Thankfully, Babcock has learned to frame bouts of self-destruction as annoying obstacles to overcome, not justifications for self-pity, a distinction that allows PUP to act their age. When vindictive detractors once again taunt him on “Get Dumber,” he doesn't take the bait. It helps that he's literally got friends by his side, with Jeff Rosenstock sharing vocal duties and exemplifying how to shrug off the stress, like filling in a forgotten line with “Ohhh, lyrics.” PUP wouldn't be PUP without their intoxicating self-contempt or knowing winks to break the fourth wall. Here, however, there's an air of responsibility when Babcock resists the urge to go all-in, as do his bandmates when dialing back their typically rowdy hooks a notch.

PUP's discography has always looked inward with its criticisms, but Who Will Look After the Dogs? shifts its focus from anxiety over Babcock's mistakes to the disorienting experience of watching his peers lap him on the milestones track; while his bandmates celebrated marriage and had kids, Babcock's decade-long relationship imploded. The impulse to indulge somewhat childish reactions weakens two album cuts: “Paranoid” soundtracks a bitter breakup dispute with the riled-up noise-punk format of past PUP songs, losing some of its bite in the retread; and the tongue-in-cheek “Olive Garden,” rife with spite for Christian hypocrisy and the forced expectations of dates, offers dissonant vocal harmonies and a sloshed chorus, a queasy enough combo to make even endless garlic breadsticks unappetizing. Both offer the pained awkwardness of a preteen growth spurt.

When PUP prioritize forward momentum, both in music and lyrics, their songs take off with ease, even if it means leaving behind the party vibes they're adored for. “When one door closes, it might never open/There might be no other doors,” Babcock frets in “Hallways,” one of the album's most deceptively optimistic tracks. A bright guitar melody steers him away from pessimism and towards a sliver of perseverance: the reminder that your dog needs you, from which the album takes its title. On upbeat earworms like “Concrete” and “Cruel,” Babcock learns how to be the bigger person and how to part ways with whatever drains you. Fans may rally around Babcock's self-deprecating tirades of the past, but hearing him embrace self-improvement, however much he downplays it, has a special ring to it.

In a first for PUP, the best tracks on their album are slow songs and mid-tempo romps, which bolster Who Will Look After the Dogs? after its rambunctious opening track. Chumak and Mykula's rhythm section gives “Needed to Hear It” and “Falling Outta Love” lively grooves despite the songs' low tempos. It's album closer “Shut Up” that steals the show, though. Plagued by imposter syndrome and suffering wintertime blues, Babcock can't help contrasting his futile songs with his partner's masters thesis research; life as a punk band seems cool until you recognize it indulges arrested development. John Congleton's production turns lo-fi and cold: bare electric guitar strums, ripped straight from the privacy of someone's bedroom mid-nervous breakdown; gentle cymbal taps and syncopated drumming. Then, the full band joins in, and as their voices intertwine with Babcock's, scooping him up from the floor, PUP sound closer than just friends or bandmates. They're in this together for the long haul, growing pains and all.

Follow all our Sean Combs trial coverage


	A year and a half after Casandra “Cassie” Ventura filed her explosive lawsuit against ex-boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs, the R&B singer took the stand today in front of a packed courtroom to testify against the man she claimed emotionally, physically, and sexually abused her for more than a decade. 


	Ventura's court appearance marks the first time she and Combs have seen each other in person since their 2018 breakup. She arrived in court wearing a long brown dress, with brown suede heels, and when she walked in, Combs turned around and stared at her.


	Ventura is considered the key witness in the Southern District of New York's criminal case, referred to in the charging indictment as Victim-1. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts against him. 


	Ventura's voice was quiet, but her demeanor confident. She chose her words carefully as she detailed what she called “frequent” instances of physical abuse. “He would smash me in my head, knock me over, drag me, kick me, stomp me in the head if I was down,” she said of Combs, per media reports. 


	Ventura also described the nature of the “freak-offs,” sexual encounters Combs allegedly orchestrated, and which could last anywhere from 36 hours to four days. Ventura said she was 22-years-old when she had her first freak-off, adding, “eventually it became a job for me,” per media reports.

	











	Ventura testified that she felt responsible to “make [Combs] happy” and didn't know how to refuse freak-offs. “I didn't feel like I had much of a choice, I didn't know what ‘No' could look like,” she said. 


	Of Combs, she added, “Sean is a very polarizing person, he's also very charming. It can be hard to decide what you need when he's telling you his needs.”


	Prosecutors asked Ventura to detail the beginning of her relationship with Combs. She said she first met him around 2005, when she was 19, describing her view of him at the time as “this larger-than-life entrepreneur musician,” per reports. 


	They had sex for the first time two years later during a trip to Miami, not long after Ventura's 21st birthday. Ventura said Combs also gave her ecstasy during the trip, and the jury was shown a photo of the pair: Ventura wearing a robe and sunglasses, with Combs draped around her.

	After the Miami trip, Ventura said, she became a “little shadow to Sean.” Ventura described herself as being naive and young at the beginning of their relationship, acknowledging that she was “enamored” with him at the first, until things started to turn. Ventura said Combs' moods could swing wildly: “Make the wrong face, and the next thing I knew, I was getting hit in the face,” she testified, per reports. 

	











	Ventura went on to describe the control Combs wielded over her life. He kept tabs on her whereabouts and sent staffers out to look for her; decided what she wore and where she lived; and often gave her, what she described, as types of “busy work” — random tasks that kept her occupied when she wasn't with Combs. 


	“He had control over what I did every minute of the day,” Ventura said.


	And as for Combs' control over her music career, Ventura said she recorded hundreds of songs, many of which “didn't see the light of day.” She added: “My career was stifled.”

Sean #Diddy Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering criminal trial began yesterday. Rolling Stone's Senior Investigstions Reporter Cheyenne Roundtree  breaks down the trials opening statements. #diddylawsuit#diddycharges#diddyraid#diddytrial#diddycase#pdiddy#pdiddycase#pdiddytrial#puffdaddy#puffdaddytrial#trial#case#fyp#fypシ#foryou


	Before her testimony, Combs' attorney, Marc Agnifilo, was worried jurors would be biased against his client if they saw Ventura, who is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, walking into the courtroom. On Monday, Agnifilo asked U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian if Ventura could already be sitting in the witness box when jurors entered. (Ventura eventually walked into the courtroom with the jury present.)

	“I think there is a prejudicial quality,” Agnifilo said in a closed-door meeting ahead of Monday's opening statements. “Pregnancy is beautiful and wonderful. It also is a source of potential sympathy.” Prosecutors objected, arguing it would be “deeply inappropriate” for the court to treat any witness with a medical condition differently.  


	Ventura is expected to testify for the duration of the trial's first week. She'll provide testimony that mirrored her harrowing and graphic civil lawsuit from November 2023 that launched the federal investigation that saw Combs go from a seemingly untouchable billionaire mogul who now faces the possibility of life in prison if he's convicted of the counts against him. 


	Prior to her testimony, Combs' team asked that Ventura's husband, Alex Fine, be barred from hearing her testimony, noting they may want to call him as a witness, per media reports. The two sides agreed that Fine could listen to a majority of Ventura's testimony, but not the allegation that Combs raped her in 2018.


	Ventura is the third witness to testify in the high-profile trial that expected to last eight weeks. On Monday, jurors heard from Israel Florez, a former security manager who worked at the since-shuttered InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles. Florez testified he was present in the immediate moments after Combs kicked and dragged Ventura by a set of elevator banks in March 2016. 

	











	Surveillance video of the attack, which CNN published last year and was shown to jurors on Monday, shows Combs chasing after Ventura before throwing her to the ground. Florez claimed that Combs had a “devilish stare” and offered what he described as a cash “bribe” to keep the incident quiet, which he refused. Florez claimed he observed Ventura with a purplish eye as she left the hotel, and he questioned if she wanted him to call the police, which she declined. 


	Male escort Daniel Phillip also testified on Monday, giving detailed and explicit testimony about the multiple freak-offs he had with Ventura and Combs between 2014 and 2016. 


	Although initially excited by being “involved with people with such notoriety,” Phillip testified that his enthusiasm waned the first time he claimed to witness Combs attack Ventura during a freak-off. Combs called for Ventura to come to the bedroom, but when she didn't immediately comply, Phillip claimed Combs threw a liquor bottle in her direction, with the bottle smashing into the wall. Combs then allegedly dragged a screaming Ventura by her hair back to the room, where he heard sounds of slapping and Ventura apologizing and saying, “I'm sorry, I'm sorry!” 


	After that incident, Phillip said he had trouble performing sexually during freak-offs with Ventura and Combs. During one moment they were left alone in another freak-off, Phillip said he tried to warn Ventura of the “danger” that he perceived she was in, asking why she was staying with Combs when he was “hitting” her. Phillip said Ventura attempted to reassure him, saying she'd be OK. 


	When Ventura first met a 37-year-old Combs in 2005, she was an aspiring 19-year-old singer, excited to sign a record deal with Bad Boy. By the time she turned 21, Combs had begun to romantically pursue her, culminating with an alleged forced kiss in the bathroom the night of her 21st birthday party. 


	Eventually, prosecutors said, Combs forced Ventura to engage in sex with male escorts while he watched and masturbated. If she refused, prosecutors allege Combs would beat her and regularly supplied her with drugs to keep her awake and compliant. Ventura claimed she would have to camp out in hotels and Combs' mansion until the bruising from physical beatings faded. 


	When Ventura said she tried to escape Combs, his team helped track her down and encouraged her to return to her allegedly abusive label boss. Outside the bedroom, Combs allegedly controlled all aspects of Ventura's life and career.  

	











	While Combs' team admitted in opening statements that the mogul was physically abusive to Ventura, they reminded jurors that Combs was not being prosecuted for domestic violence in this case. Instead, they claim Ventura was a consenting adult and had personal motivations for being in a relationship with Combs and later pursuing litigation against him. “Ask yourself why,” Geragos said. “The answer is money.”

	Last week, Combs' lawyers claimed that Ventura was a fully capable woman and independent, suggesting that it wasn't in her nature to be forced into anything. Subramanian quickly shot down the notion. “Strong people can be coerced just like weak people,” the judge said.

	Is the title character of the new Apple TV+ series Murderbot the most relatable person, machine, or other in science fiction history? Yes, the security unit (played by Alexander Skarsgård) has no genitals and various deadly weapons built into its artificial body. But its desires are simple: “All I really wanted was to be left alone to watch my shows.” 


	You see, in the first episode of the show — adapted by Paul and Chris Weitz from the beloved series of novels by Martha Wells — Murderbot (as it has privately dubbed itself) figures out how to disable the module that forces it to obey any orders from humans. And its first order of business is to download thousands of hours of serialized dramas and watch them while its human clients jabber away about their own problems. It is especially fond of one called The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, of which we get frequent glimpses, with John Cho, Jack McBrayer, Clark Gregg, and DeWanda Wise starring in the space opera-within-the-space opera — which seems incredibly cheesy, but don't try telling that to Murderbot. 

	











	The books are told entirely through the eyes of Murderbot, who inadvertently grows to understand human behavior and emotions through Sanctuary Moon and shows like it, and is often disappointed that real people don't behave like their scripted counterparts. The novels have a dry sense of humor, but are more straight sci-fi with jokes. The Weitz brothers (American Pie, About a Boy) allow us to hear Murderbot's inner monologue, but there's also a lot of material shown from the perspective of his latest clients, a touchy-feely group of scientists from a socialist collective who are disgusted by the vast corporation that controls so much of this part of the galaxy (and rented this robot to them). The show is more of a comedy with periodic moments of action, suspense, and pathos. (Episodes usually clock in around a half-hour, if not shorter.) 


	For the most part, the shift in tone and genre works because of Skarsgård. In some ways, he's a more straightforward choice for the role than the asexual, agender character described in the books would suggest. But from his first American role, as a Marine aptly nicknamed “Iceman” in the HBO miniseries Generation Kill, through his recent stint as an aloof tech bro on Succession, he usually comes across as emotionally off-kilter or inhuman in some way, as if he were built in a factory himself. His delivery of the voiceover narration is both funny and surprisingly sweet at times, leaning into the idea of Murderbot behaving as if it's somewhere on the autism spectrum. Eye contact is incredibly stressful for it, social cues frequently elude it, and when a human gets physically affectionate, and even flirty, it's horrified and thinks, “Melt me down, now!”

	The human clients are more of a mixed bag. Noma Dumezweni is very good as Mensah, the group leader who suffers from panic attacks, and who seems the most eager to understand and help their artificial new colleague. David Dastmalchian does some effectively understated work as Gurathin, an artificially enhanced human whose machine implants make him inherently more suspicious of this unusual security unit. And Pen15‘s Anna Konkle has fun for a few episodes as a member of another group who winds up hanging out with Mensah's crew for a while. But there's a subplot where lovers Pin-Lee (Sabrina Wu) and Arada (Tattiawna Jones) decide to attempt a throuple with Ratthi (Akshay Khanna) that is way too broad and sitcom-y for everything else(*). 


(*) Your mileage may vary about what we see of Sanctuary Moon, especially if you know and love the books. A friend who adores them felt it was much sillier and lamer than the version they had in their head. I always interpreted Wells' references to the show as a way to suggest that Murderbot has bad taste — or, at least, that it is so new to learning about emotion that it's gravitated towards the most obvious, cliché-ridden material available.

	But when a threat appears from which Murderbot has to save his idiot clients, the danger feels real, and the action is staged well, in a way that's both exciting and also lightly comedic, since Murderbot is a nearly obsolete model that's often overmatched by its robot or alien opponents. And when the show leans into real emotions, whether or not Murderbot itself feels them, the audience will.

Murderbot isn't an exact recreation of the books — and it's too irreverent to be the kind of thing Murderbot would enjoy — but it's very fun and satisfying as its own thing. Though it might be even more satisfying if it went by the longer title that the security unit proposes at one point when fed up with the crew: Murderbot and Its Selfish Ungrateful Hippie Clients.


The first two episodes of Murderbot begin streaming May 16 on Apple TV+, with additional episodes releasing weekly. I've seen the whole 10-episode season.

	The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments over President Donald Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship on Thursday. Trump signed the order, “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” on the first day of his second term, but it has since been halted by nationwide injunctions issued by three separate federal district courts.


	The Supreme Court is taking up the issue after the Trump administration filed emergency appeals asking the justices to narrow the injunction orders so the policy could move forward in some capacity while the issue is battled out in courts around the country. Twenty-two states have sued over the ostensibly unconstitutional executive order, which seeks to end the practice of granting citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.


Rolling Stone spoke with legal experts Christopher M. Lapinig and Christopher W. Schmidt about the significance of the Supreme Court's decision to hear oral arguments, the merits of the cases challenging the order, and the broader impact of the Trump administration's attack on the 14th Amendment.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Lapinig is an attorney with Asian Law Caucus, co-counsel alongside American Civil Liberties Union Foundation Immigrants' Rights Project, State Democracy Defenders Fund, NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, and others on New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al v. Donald J. Trump, et al (this birthright citizenship case is separate from those the Supreme Court is convening over on May 15). Schmidt is a law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago Kent College of Law and a research professor at the American Bar Foundation.


	It's unclear exactly which questions the Supreme Court will take up on Thursday. But the oral arguments will likely have less to do with the constitutionality of birthright citizenship, and more to do with judicial authority and a contentious issue that has affected both parties in recent administrations: how lower courts can issue nationwide injunctions essentially inhibiting a president from instituting policies nationwide. The decision on that issue would not only impact these birthright citizenship cases, but the hundreds of other lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's actions that are in the pipeline.

	Here's what else is at stake:


	The 14th Amendment, passed by Congress in 1866 and ratified in 1868, is pretty cut and dry regarding birthright citizenship: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” It has long been widely interpreted that anyone born on U.S. soil is an American citizen, regardless of the citizenship of the child's parents.


	“It essentially was part of the efforts to make sure that slavery would not happen again, or anything resembling slavery would not happen again. And so the drafters of the 14th Amendment were abolitionists, right? They were anti-slavery, and they created this language with the idea of anti-subordination in mind,” Lapinig says. “And what that means is essentially that they wanted to make sure that no person in the United States would be subordinated or relegated to second-class citizens or something else by virtue of their race or their ethnicity or national origin.”


	Drafters built “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” into the amendment's language. Lapinig says they “contemplated that birthright citizenship should not extend to invaders, for example,” but that “it's otherwise clear from the sort of discussions leading up to the enactment of the 14th Amendment that, of course, the 14th Amendment was to make sure that children of formerly enslaved people would be citizens by birth.”

	“They also made clear,” he continues, “that they knew that, for example, children of immigrants from places like China or anywhere else would also be U.S. citizens by birth if they were born in the United States.”


	The “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” line in the 14th Amendment is the key to the Trump administration's argument.


	“They are arguing that the categories of people that they are attempting to exclude are not subject to jurisdiction,” Schmidt says. “Their argument being that if you're not legally in the country, [or] temporarily, you're not, in some sense, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Now, even as I talk through that, it doesn't seem to really resonate in any meaningful way when people think about why you're subject to jurisdiction.”


	“That was put in there to exclude people like someone born to a foreign diplomat who is subject to a different set of rules, even when they're in the United States, perhaps also Native American populations who are not fully subject to the control of the United States. So, there were certain groups of people who were thought to fit in that category at the time.”

	











	Both the text and the amendment's history are not favorable to Trump's argument.


	“‘Subject to jurisdiction' basically means, does the United States sovereign have control, or can it regulate you, like it can regulate other people? And whether you're in the country legally or not, you're subject to the sovereign authority of the United States, which is why [the jurisdiction argument] just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, just in terms of the language,” Schmidt says. “Also, for those people who studied immigration policy around the time of the 14th Amendment … the categories of ‘legal,' ‘illegal,' ‘documented,' ‘undocumented' — they were not categories that had much or any meaning at the time. The process by which someone would enter the country or leave the country was not nearly as regulated … And there wasn't this sort of idea that there is a separate category of people who are undocumented or illegal immigrants.”


	He adds: “This is a provision of the Constitution that has always struck me as being more clear than much of the Constitution.”


	Notably, beyond the text and history arguments when interpreting the Constitution against Trump's executive order, there is also strong precedent against it with the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, in which the justices decided 6-2 in favor of Wong Kim Ark.


	In the New Hampshire lawsuit, along with the other cases involving birthright citizenship, lawyers cite the 1898 case. Wong Kim Ark was a Chinese-American cook born in San Francisco in 1873. “His parents, who were from China, because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, were ineligible to be U.S. citizens,” Lapinig says.


	Wong Kim Ark left the U.S. for China to see his family and his wife, whom he married on a previous trip (“Chinese immigration, especially Chinese women, were restricted” at the time, Lapinig says), but when he returned home to San Francisco, he was denied reentry by immigration officials on the claim that he was not a U.S. citizen, despite being born in San Francisco. He and his lawyers argued he was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, which sided with Wong Kim Ark. The ruling “enshrined the right to birthright citizenship for all babies, all children born in the United States to this day,” says Lapinig.


	In addition to the pretty straightforward legal precedent against Trump's executive order, Schmidt notes that it's “just established practice” that birthright citizenship applies to anyone born in the U.S., even if their parents are undocumented, and that “Congress has been operating under the assumption this is the proper reading of the 14th Amendment for generations.”

	











	The Supreme Court's move to hear oral arguments is unusual because typically when the Supreme Court schedules oral arguments, it's after granting certiorari, meaning the court has agreed to review a decision from a lower court. “The striking thing about the granting of oral arguments in the birthright citizenship cases is that they did not grant certiorari in any of the cases, nor did they identify a question presented that they're going to be talking about,” Schmidt says.


	There are a couple of topics that could be addressed on May 15. The first is the one Trump brought to the court: the validity of nationwide injunctions, which the district courts involved in the cases issued after deeming the executive order likely unconstitutional. “This is what the Trump administration went to the court saying: ‘We want you to lift these nationwide injunctions, because it's an abuse of judicial authority,'” says Schmidt. “So, it's highly likely that the court will want to hear some discussion simply about that problem, which certainly is sharply put into focus with this case, but it actually transcends this particular case. It's just about the scope of district court authority on these national issues.”


	The other topic is the substantive question of the lawsuits, which is unlikely to be discussed on Thursday as the administration only asked the court, so far, to narrow the nationwide injunctions. The question is a big one, though: “The constitutionality of a redefinition of birthright citizenship away from what's been understood for over 100 years, to make it more narrowly applied, namely, at least according to the Trump executive order, to not apply to people who were born in the United States but to parents who are not in the United States with legal documentation or are only here temporarily,” Schmidt says.


	Babies born after Feb. 19, 2025, to parents who do not have U.S. citizenship or permanent immigration status in the U.S. are the target of the executive order, should it stand. It is unclear how this would be enforced if the courts do ultimately allow it to stand.


	“Anyone that is even on a visa that, in theory, could lead to a green card, like, say, an H-1B visa, which is a very common sort of skilled worker visa that is issued in the United States [would be vulnerable],” Lapinig says. “If at that point, they're only put only on an H-1B and have not quite obtained legal permanent residents in the United States, then the executive order would consider their children, their babies, born to be ineligible for their birthright citizenship.”

	











	Other visa holders, such as students, exchange visitors, tourists, athletes, and entertainers would also fall under this umbrella, as would Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients, and people with humanitarian visas, among others. 


	“This is the president of the United States declaring what at least takes the form of an authoritative interpretation of the Constitution. So simply the significance of who is making the claim and the significance of how much the claim would affect people does seem to indicate that allowing lower court decisions to do the work for the Supreme Court … it has always struck me as unlikely,” says Schmidt.


	There is also likely a strategic reason the Supreme Court might want to take this case up. While the GOP-controlled court may give Trump some wins, like it did with the Trump immunity case last July, it's likely “the court really wants to assert that it's not just simply a rubber stamp for the Trump administration, and it wants to find opportunities to also assert its role in this whole process,” Schmidt says. “So therefore, it wants to find some Trump administration initiatives to strike down, and this has always struck me as easy pickings. The law is so clear, so well-established, and the impact of this on American society would be very disruptive, quite radical, quite harmful.”


	“It is just head spinning, the amount of activity coming out of the executive branch that is constitutionally and legally questionable, and the burden that's going to place on the courts,” Schmidt adds. “It's a question about whether the courts are going to be spread so thin with these really major issues, and whether they want to be a little strategic about which cases they're going to take on. … They might just allow the lower courts to take this one. I still don't think that's likely, but it is an option.”


	Should Trump's executive order be implemented as is, the policy would create an “underclass of individuals,” says Lapinig, which is something the drafters of the 14th Amendment worked to combat. “The 14th Amendment was truly an effort to make sure that slavery itself would not happen again in the United States, but also that nothing like slavery would happen again, as in that there would never be the creation and growth of an underclass of people in the United States that were denied off their race or ethnicity or ancestry, equal rights to others.”

	











	“This executive order would create, dramatically, a large underclass of people in the United States that, in turn, would not be eligible for any public benefits, or [other] aspects of public support — and all Americans would be affected, because they are in your communities,” he adds. “The fabric of every community in the United States would be affected in some way because there would be the presence of folks who would unfortunately be part of this underclass of people. And so those communities would have to — whether on an individual level or on a community level — deal with the ramifications of children who are or who have been, who will be excluded from membership among the ranks of U.S. citizens.”

	As for the New Hampshire v. Trump lawsuit, which was filed hours after Trump signed the birthright citizenship executive order on his first day in office on Jan. 20, Judge Joseph Laplante issued a preliminary injunction on Feb. 10. On April 10, Trump and his administration filed a notice of appeal.


	“We are very confident in our lawsuit, in the legal merits of our lawsuit, and our position that this executive order is completely and flagrantly unconstitutional,” Lapinig says. “We know that the law — has stood for as I mentioned over 120 years — is clearly on our side, and so we will just continue to litigate our lawsuit and do what we can to make sure that this executive order is never implemented.”

	It's getting increasingly difficult for Republicans and even the MAGA faithful to defend Donald Trump's unconstitutional or otherwise misguided actions as president. In the case of Trump accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar, they aren't even trying — and some of them, including some of the president's most loyal defenders, are going out of their way to bash the brazenly corrupt act.


Laura Loomer, the far-right conspiracy theorist and diehard Trump supporter (and adviser), was quick to respond to the news on Sunday that the administration was preparing to accept the pricey jet from the desert nation, and that it will be retained by Trump's presidential library after he leaves office. “I love President Trump. I would take a bullet for him. But, I have to call a spade a spade. We cannot accept a $400 million ‘gift' from jihadists in suits,” she wrote on X. Loomer added that accepting the plane would be “such a stain” on the administration.


	“Ditto,” replied Mark Levin, one of Trump's most fervent supporters on Fox News, whose fawning coverage the president frequently lauds.

	Right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro sounded off on his podcast. “Is this good for President Trump? Is it good for his agenda? Is it good for draining the swamp?” he asked. “The answer is: No, it isn't. If you want President Trump to succeed, this kind of skeezy stuff needs to stop.”


	Republican lawmakers weren't thrilled, either.


	“The Constitution in Article II talks about how the president can't take emoluments or gifts from foreign leaders,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) told Fox News on Monday, before attempting to parse whether the gift could be accepted if it were only used for official purposes. “We're not talking about a ride on the plane; we're talking about the entire $400 million plane. I think it's not worth the appearance of impropriety.”


	“It would be better if Air Force One were a big, beautiful jet made in the United States of America,” said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), per The Hill. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) seemed most concerned with safety. “I'm not flying on a Qatari plane. They support Hamas. I don't know how you make it safe,” he said. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) echoed Paul in wondering “whether the administration would be in compliance with gift law.”

	The concern is well-founded. The Constitution states that the president cannot “accept any present … of any kind whatever” from a foreign state without the approval of Congress.


	Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sounded off on security concerns on Tuesday. “I think the plane poses significant espionage and surveillance problems,” he told CNBC. “We'll see how this plays out but I certainly have concerns.”


	ABC News highlights how some Republicans have dodged the issue entirely, with the top Republican in the Senate, John Thune, and the top Republican in the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, both claiming on Monday that they didn't know enough about the situation to comment on it. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) told Fox News on Tuesday that he's “still seeking to get more information” on the situation, but did note that “we don't want to be straight up accepting any type of gift from any foreign government.”


	The former top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, wasn't as evasive during an interview with CNN. “I don't think another country should be providing America,” he said. “We don't need that.” McCarthy criticized the gift, but absurdly tried to shield Trump from responsibility: “I don't know what staffer worked on this, but I know [Chief of Staff] Susie [Wiles] and President Trump and that is probably not what they desire.”

	Trump has made clear, however, that he did desire the plane. In fact, he has called anyone who has said he shouldn't have accepted it “stupid.”


	“I think it's a great gesture from Qatar, I appreciate it very much,” he said Monday. “I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.” Trump later lashed out at a reporter who asked him about the gift, launching into a screed about legendary golfer Sam Snead, whose motto, according to Trump, was to take the putts the opponent offers: “A lot of people are stupid. They say, ‘No, no, I insist on putting it.' Then they miss it and their partner gets angry at them.”

	“They're giving us a free jet,” the president emphasized, incredulous that anyone could question whether to accept such a gift from a Middle Eastern nation notorious for trying to buy influence.


	Trump is in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as part of his first official international trip of his second term. He'll soon head to Qatar, where his company recently struck a deal to build a golf resort.

	Twitch streamer and political commentator Hasan Piker, a longtime critic of Donald Trump, said Monday he was questioned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers after returning to the country over the weekend.


	Piker explained on Twitch, where he streams as HasanAbi, that he was pulled aside at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after a flight from Paris, even though he is enrolled in Global Entry. The influencer said he was questioned for two hours about his job, political affiliation, and if he had a connection with terrorist groups.

Hasan Piker, a U.S. citizen, was detained and questioned by ICE and U.S. Customs — including questions about his views on Donald Trump. Piker is a vocal critic of Trump, describing his administration's agenda as ‘nefarious' and ‘fascist,' and has condemned Trump's mass deportation plans and attacks on free speech.


	“They take me to this backroom. This backroom is not great. It's destined in the most hostile way. The vibes are fucked back there,” he said. “It's very obvious they knew who the fuck I was.”


	Piker said he was asked, “Do you talk about Trump?” to which Piker says he responded, “Why are you asking me this?” before saying he told the agent, “I don't like Trump. What are you gonna do? It's protected by the First Amendment … He said he was gonna end the wars, he hasn't ended the wars. What the fuck is up with that.”

	











	Piker said the agent he spoke to was “very sympathetic” to Piker when he was asked questions about Israel's war in Gaza, and when he was asked if he was involved with Hamas. (On X, Hasan said that the experience “wasn't that bad” but was a “very strange experience overall.”)

	“They straight up tried to get something out of me that I think they could use to basically detain me permanently,” Piker said. “[The agent] kept saying stuff like, ‘Do you like Hamas? Do you support Hamas? Do you think Hamas is a terror group or a resistance group?'”

	Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary, confirmed to The Washington Post that Piker was taken in for questioning, but claimed it had nothing to do with his political views.


	“Our officers are following the law, not agendas,” McLaughlin told the outlet. “Upon entering the country, this individual was referred for further inspection — a routine, lawful process that occurs daily, and can apply for any traveler. Once his inspection was complete, he was promptly released.”

	The incident with Piker comes amid concerns that the Trump administration is targeting people with anti-Trump and pro-Palestinian views. In March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist with a green card, after he led protests at Columbia University. And several days ago, a judge ordered the release of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts student the Trump administration detained after she co-authored a pro-Palestine op-ed.

Follow all our Sean Combs trial coverage


	Sean “Diddy” Combs strode into court today morning to a packed courtroom filled with his children and anxious family members, as the hip-hop mogul faces charges of sex trafficking and racketeering that could put him behind bars for life.


	The 55-year-old, who is now fully gray, has pleaded not guilty to the five felony counts against him. During jury selection last week, the larger-than-life music executive who is known for commanding a spotlight and has previously faced a 15-year prison sentence and beat the case admitted he was a “little nervous” ahead of the trial's commencement. 


	Yet this morning, his publicist, Holly Baird, described Combs as “upbeat” and “ready to have his side told in court.” Combs' mother, Janice, and children Christian, Justin, Quincy, D'Lila, Jessie, and Chance appeared in court to support the mogul. Dressed in a grey sweater, collared shirt, and grey dress slacks, a smiling Combs waved to his children and greeted his attorneys before taking his seat. He held a Bible in his hands, reading through passages before the jury was brought in. 


	Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Johnson began opening statements by conceding the jury members might be familiar with Combs by multiple names, his multi-million-dollar businesses and his “larger-than-life” persona, but she said, “there was another side to him”: a dangerous and violent figure, whose “inner circle” of bodyguards, personal assistants and high-ranking staff “who helped him commit crimes and helped him cover them up.” His team allegedly worked tirelessly to deliver on his every whim and to safeguard his reputation. At the heart of his alleged “criminal enterprise” was Combs' insatiable sexual appetite where he required two girlfriends, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and an anonymous woman identified as “Jane,” to have sex with male escorts, in what he called “freak-offs” or “Wild King Nights.”

Sean #Diddy Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering criminal trial began yesterday.

	In the coming days, Johnson said, Ventura will testify about the “dark hotel rooms” that Combs kept her in for days at a time, where she was allegedly forced to have sex with hired male sex workers. During these days-long “freak-offs,” Ventura was allegedly kept compliant and awake through a variety of drugs, including Ecstasy. Johnson said Ventura once overdosed during a freak-off and said it felt like she was “choking” when Combs directed a sex worker to urinate in her mouth.

	Jane is expected to testify that Combs physically abused her too, Johnson said. The prosecutor said jurors will hear that Combs once chased Jane around a house and lifted her off the ground in a chokehold before he kicked her to the ground.  

	











	Johnson said the evidence will show Combs ran an enterprise with the help of co-conspirators. One employee allegedly helped Combs break into a romantic rival's residence in December 2011. Johnson said Combs' chief of staff helped him “broker a deal” with a hotel security guard in 2016 to cover up the video showing Combs beating Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel. Combs allegedly bought the surveillance video by paying a hotel security guard $100,000 stuffed in a brown paper bag, Johnson told jurors.


	Meanwhile, Combs' attorney Teny Geragos argued that the case is not about sex trafficking, but about people's motivations for coming forward after all these years. She argued that Ventura and “Jane” were fully capable women who made choices because they had something to gain from being in a relationship with Combs. She told jurors that Ventura filed a civil lawsuit before reporting her alleged abuse to authorities. “Ask yourself why,” Geragos said. “The answer is money.”

	Geragos admitted Combs engaged in domestic violence in both relationships, but she said it was the product of romantic quarrels linked to jealousy. She claimed the hotel beating caught on tape was not sparked by Ventura trying to escape alleged sex trafficking, but by something found on a cellphone that led to a dispute over alleged infidelity. When combined with drug use, the fight led to regrettable actions — but in no way did it constitute sex trafficking, she told jurors.


	The defense lawyer said Jane was older than Cassie and had a child from a previous relationship. She described both Ventura and Jane as a fully consenting adult who was a willing participant in threesomes and remained in the admittedly “dysfunctional” relationship by choice.


	“This case is about voluntary, adult choices made by capable adults and consensual relationships,” Geragos said. “This case is about those real-life relationships, and the government is trying to turn those relationships into a racketeering case, a prostitution case, and a sex trafficking case. It will not work.”


	Earlier Monday morning, the line outside the Manhattan federal courthouse stretched down the block, as members of the press, enthusiastic supporters, curious spectators, podcasters, and content creators — including Myron Gaines from Fresh and Fit and Jaguar Wright — waited upward of 12 hours in hopes of securing a seat in the courtroom and catching a glimpse of the embattled Bad Boy Entertainment founder. Music producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones, who sued Combs in February 2024 for sexual assault and lack of payment, and his attorney Tyrone Blackburn turned up to court, though declined to give statements.


	The government has claimed Combs — who founded Bad Boy Records, which produced legendary rapper the Notorious B.I.G. and whose tremendous influence brought hip-hop and rap to the mainstream — used his billion-dollar empire as a criminal enterprise, fueled by the mogul's sexual desires. In the background of his business dealings, Combs is accused of sex trafficking two women between 2009 and 2024. 

	











	He allegedly instructed a team of staffers — who were allegedly subjected to forced labor and physical threats themselves — to carry out acts of bribery, arson, and kidnapping. Other alleged victims were said to be coerced into sex with Combs, as well as with hired male sex workers in dayslong, drug-fueled sexual sessions Combs called “freak-offs.”


	Meanwhile, Combs' all-star legal team — which includes celebrity attorneys Brian Steel and Marc Agnifilo — has insisted upon their client's innocence. They have claimed that although Combs participated in a “swinger” lifestyle and would frequently hire male escorts that did not constitute as sex trafficking. 


	In regard to Ventura, referred to as “Victim-1” in the indictment, Combs' attorney Agnifilo indicated to Judge Arun Subramanian that the defense planned to argue the pair's decade-long relationship was deeply “toxic” and there was “mutual” violence on both sides.


	When quizzed on the lines of questioning the defense would take during their cross-examination of Victim-1, attorneys Agnifilo and Alexandra Shapiro said they hoped to question Combs' former girlfriend about “other instances where she has been violent.” They said the questioning was central to speak to Ventura's alleged nonpeaceful nature and her independence in effort to dismantle prosecutors' claim that Combs coerced her into certain situations. 


	Subramanian quickly shot down the notion. “Strong people can be coerced just like weak people,” Subramanian said.

	This week, prosecutors indicated that they planned to call two “short” witnesses to the stand, including a male escort, before a third witness would testify. Although the name of that witness has not been disclosed, all signs point to Ventura. While stressing it was necessary to keep to a strict time schedule for the trial, prosecutors said an early key witness was “time sensitive” and would need to take frequent breaks throughout their dayslong testimony. Ventura is several months along in her pregnancy for her third child, and the indictment closely mirrors the claims she made in her bombshell sex-trafficking lawsuit.


This post was updated on Monday, May 12 at 1:15 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. to reflect opening statements by prosecutors and Combs' lawyers.

Paranormal investigator Stan Gordon, posing near his research equipment in 1973. Gordon is the author of the book ""Silent Invasion,"" which among other things, documents a string of paranormal sightings in Pennsylvania over 1973 and 1974.Provided photo

Be it cryptids or unexplained lights in the sky, paranormal sightings in Pennsylvania are nothing new. 

But some have reason to believe the two are linked. And for one intense period, sightings of both - large, hairy humanoid creatures and unidentified flying objects - were frequent in southwestern Pennsylvania.

The period was between 1973 and 1974, and paranormal researcher Stan Gordon documented the claims of connection between Bigfoot and UFOs in his book, “Secret Invasion: The Pennsylvania UFO-Bigfoot Casebook.”

Among other subjects, “Secret Invasion” details incidents where sightings of both Bigfoot and UFOs were made, and suggests a correlation between the two.

Gordon's own interest in the paranormal began in 1959, when as a 10-year-old with interest in science and technology, he overheard a radio program about “unusual occurrences.”

“They were talking about everything from flying saucers, haunted houses, strange creatures,” Gordon said. “I was a curious kid, but I was still somewhat skeptical even at that age. And so I decided to make some trips to my local Greensburg PA library, sort of reading all the books they had on the subject.”

When Gordon was 16, he said, the famed Kecksburg Incident took place, forever solidifying his interest in researching unexplained phenomenon. In 1969, he set up a phone line for people to report UFO sightings, and in 1970 he helped to found an organization of volunteers to investigate and document sightings.

Gordon and his collaborators were “very, very busy” throughout 1973 and into 1974, he said.

As the “Silent Invasion” book description reads, “it was during the summer of that year however when a mysterious wave of events began to unfold.”

“Alarmed citizens over a widespread area reported close encounters with huge hairy Bigfoot-like creatures,” it says. “Frightened residents called local authorities and media outlets reporting enormous footprints and terrified animals.”

“This started out January 1, here in Westmoreland County, and then it just continued all year long across the state,” Gordon said. 

Gordon shared details of many sightings that he and his team investigated.

“There were all kind of sightings - it was just amazing to detail the reports coming in,” he said. “And these, again, are coming from all walks of life: men, women and children.”

And the summer of '73, Gordon said, Pennsylvania was “the largest outbreak of Bigfoot sightings ever documented, I'm quite certain, anywhere in the country, around the world.”

It began with a sighting in Greensburg at the end of that July, Gordon said, when a man was shaving in his upstairs bathroom and “began to smell this funny odor.”

“He said it was like rotten cucumbers,” Gordon said. “He turned to look out the window, and here's these two huge glowing red eyes staring at him.

After interviewing the witness, Gordon said, he heard from other locals that a large hairy figure, between 7 and 8 feet tall, had been spotted in the nearby woods. 

“I got permission to go up and look around on the property,” Gordon said. “I was about ready to call it a day, when I happened to look down and there was a partial footprint, and there was one complete footprint, of the strangest track I think any of us in that group had ever seen.”

Gordon described the footprint as “13 inches long, eight inches wide, and clearly three-toed.”

And while the investigation continued, he said, his team got another call, near Pittsburgh, about a similar set of circumstances: the sighting of a nine-foot tall figure and signs of strange footprints in the woods.

It was the start of a wave “that ran for weeks and weeks and months,” Gordon said. 

“Many of the sightings coming in were in daylight, where people were getting give us very detailed physical descriptions of the creatures,” Gordon said. “In some cases, we had more than one creature seen together. So you're getting all these Bigfoot reports and UFO reports, and then we begin to see a pattern.”

The pattern, Gordon said, was “we'd have a UFO sighting in a particular area, and within minutes to hours and days later, we'd have a Bigfoot sighting, or vice versa.”

“They have some incredible incidents with Bigfoot and UFOs seen together at the same time and place,” he said. 

Another notable occurrence included multiple sightings of UFOs on October 25, 1973, from “across Pennsylvania,” particularly along the Chestnut Ridge in Fayette County.

In that instance, Gordon said, 15 separate witnesses described a “huge red sphere, about as big as a barn, about 100 feet off the ground, that was hovering and slowly beginning to move downward towards the pasture.”

Electronics supposedly went haywire during this time. Shortly after witnesses reported seeing two large, hulking figures, over 7 feet tall, “covered long, dark, matted hair hanging off the body,” with “large, luminous, glowing green eyes.”

And after one of the witnesses reportedly fired a warning shot at the creatures, both they and the glowing lights in the sky vanished.

Gordon shared several more stories, such as a trail of Bigfoot-like creatures leading to an area of “luminescent glowing, about 100 feet in diameter,” or reports of lights in the sky followed by tall, hairy creatures with glowing eyes.

But despite his interest and dedication to the research, Gordon said he remains something of a skeptic.

“I've always looked at these cases scientifically,” he said. “We always try to find explanations for what people report, whether it's a UFO or a Bigfoot.”

Some sightings can be explained away, he said, as anything ranging from meteorites or astronomical phenomenon for UFOs, and bears or other large animals for Bigfoots.

“A lot of the reports may initially sound unusual, but when you take the time to investigate these cases properly, many are determined to be misidentification of either natural or man-made objects,” he said.

But ultimately, Gordon said, “every year, reports are coming in that you cannot easily dismiss, of all these type of various phenomena.”

RAHWAY, NJ — If you love paranormal, you can look forward to a spine-tingling evening.

On Saturday, May 31, Bruce Tango – of “Tango & Friends Radio Show” and also a retired Elizabeth police officer – will be hosting “The Paranormal World Event” at Merchant and Drovers Tavern Museum in Rahway.

There will be lectures, films, audio and discussions on ghosts, UFOs and exorcisms. Guest speakers include Jane Doherty, a renowned psychic medium; Joe Foster, a respected MUFON investigator; and Bruce Pearson, a UFO and paranormal investigator.

Tango plans on talking about a well-known and true exorcism case. “A movie was made about it,” he said. “Not ‘The Exorcist.'”

He has actual audio of one of the exorcisms. “It's very frightening,” he said. “When I play it, people are going to get very unnerved.”

Time permitting, Tango will be doing a lights-out EVP – Electronic Voice Phenomena – session with immediate playback. “We will ask questions,” he said. “Anything you may want to ask. It's amazing. Many times, you'll get answers you'll hear on the recorder. It's a very cool thing to do. One of the reasons we turn the lights out, sometimes a ghost will try to manifest itself.”

He will also ask attendees to share their paranormal experiences. “Maybe myself and other people there can give insights and info on what happened,” said Tango. “Give them some closure.”

There's a lot that is unknown about the paranormal, but Tango believes it has to do with energy. He said, “Even Einstein believed in ghosts and said they are made of energy. You're more apt to see it in the dark, even though I've had many experiences in the daytime.”

Foster, who will be talking about UFOs, has worked with the FBI. “He'll share some fascinating stories over the years,” said Tango. “He's pretty cool and his stories are great.”

Pearson is a paranormal investigator originally from New Jersey, now living in Pennsylvania. “He's had a long-time distinguished career,” said Tango. “In the broadcast industry, he's a producer, director… He's the segment producer of ‘Unsolved Mysteries.' He's going to be telling some great stories.”

Doherty will be giving readings. “She's one of the best in the country,” said Tango. “She's been on many TV shows, ‘Sightings,' ‘The Jenny Jones Show,' and ‘Ghost Stories.' For those who attend, there's a good chance Jane connects you with a loved one who passed. I've seen people break down. She's quite an amazing woman.”

As for The Merchants and Drovers Tavern Museum, Tango said, “It's very haunted. I've been doing events there (for) close to 20 years.”

Extraterrestrial Life: We Are Not Alone
by Antonino Del Popolo
Springer, 2025
paperback, 156 pp., illus.
ISBN 978-3-031-83496-7
US$37.99


It's a familiar trajectory for astrobiology stories. Scientists announce the discovery of a biosignature, or at least a potential biosignature, on another world in our solar system or beyond. The announcement is made at a conference, or in a paper provided to media under embargo, resulting in a surge of stories touting the discovery. Then other scientists step in and poke holes in the original discovery: a flaw in the methodology, perhaps, or alternative explanations that don't require life. The discovery becomes far less convincing.



That happened in recent weeks with the discovery of a molecule in the atmosphere of an exoplanet linked to life: after that wave of initial coverage, some scientists noted there were alternative ways to make the molecule that did not require life, while others questioned the detection itself (see “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence”, The Space Review, April 28, 2025). The same happened nearly three decades ago with Martian meteorite ALH 84001, whose claims of containing signatures of past Martian life have faded over the years.



Despite the lack of definitive detections of extraterrestrial life to date, some scientists remain convinced that life exists beyond Earth, either elsewhere in the solar system—from the upper atmosphere of Venus to the subsurface oceans of Enceladus—or in one of the billions of exoplanets beyond. That certainly is the central thesis of Extraterrestrial Life by Antonino Del Popolo, an Italian physicist, but like those earlier purported biosignatures, you may not find yourself convinced.



Much of the relatively slender book is devoted to an overview of astrobiology and related topics, such as discoveries of exoplanets and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. (ALH 84001, for example, has its own brief section.) Most of this is pretty straightforward, with little in the way of new information or insights.



The final chapter is where the author finally delivers on the argument made in the book's subtitle: that there certainly is other life, including intelligent life, elsewhere in the universe. But this chapter is only about three pages long, and its primary argument is manipulation of the terms of the Drake Equation to conclude that the probability of intelligent life not forming elsewhere in the galaxy or the universe to be exceedingly low: about one in 60 billion in the case of our galaxy. That is an unsatisfying conclusion that relies much more on assumptions of some values of the Drake Equation not well constrained today than on any analysis in the preceding chapters.



The book is disappointing in another respect. Despite coming from a large, respected publisher, the book is poorly edited. An example is a section about exoplanets, which discusses how the discovery of the first exoplanet around a Sun-like star was at an observatory “located on a hill and is not equipped with a very powerful telescope with a 1.93 m aperture.” Well, if it's not equipped with a 1.93-meter telescope, what does it have? Or did the author mean that such a telescope is not very powerful? A few pages later, the reader is referred to an appendix for more discussion on “abitable planets.” One might expect such errors, along with sometimes clunky wording, in a self-published book, not one from a major publisher.



In the end, the challenge with this book, and the search for life in general, is that we seek certainty when the universe offers instead uncertainty. Conclusive proof of life beyond Earth may end up being difficult to establish: spectral lines will be scrutinized, chemical analyses will be questioned, with the result being not “yes” or “no” but instead “quite possibly” or “probably not.” The truth is out there, but it won't be easy to pin down.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Tassili n'Ajjer (Algeria): Is there a presence of extraterrestrial in the city of Sefar?","https://www.pressenza.com/2025/05/tassili-najjer-algeria-is-there-a-presence-of-extraterrestrial-in-the-city-of-sefar/","Tue, 13 May 2025 01:01:44 GMT","

Tassili n'Ajjer is a vast plateau in south-east Algeria at the borders of Libya, Niger and Mali, covering an area of 72,000 sq. km.  The exceptional density of paintings and engravings, and the presence of many prehistoric vestiges, are remarkable testimonies to Prehistory. From 10,000 BC to the first centuries of our era, successive peoples left many archaeological remains, habitations, burial mounds and enclosures which have yielded abundant lithic and ceramic material. However, it is the rock art (engravings and paintings) that have made Tassili world famous as from 1933, the date of its discovery.  15,000 engravings have been identified to date.

Tassili n'Ajjer, located in a strange lunar landscape of great geological interest, this site has one of the most important groupings of prehistoric cave art in the world. More than 15,000 drawings and engravings record the climatic changes, the animal migrations and the evolution of human life on the edge of the Sahara from 6000 BC to the first centuries of the present era. The geological formations are of outstanding scenic interest, with eroded sandstones forming ‘forests of rock'.

Algeria's Sahara Desert, a barren and mysterious expanse spanning millions of square kilometers, reveals secrets that will forever change our view of the universe. Archaeologists and scientists who have conducted research in this remote region of southeastern Algeria continue to question the possibility of an extraterrestrial presence. This isn't the first time the Sahara has revealed buried treasure, dinosaur fossils, prehistoric tools, and ancient rivers hidden beneath the sand, but this time, the story goes beyond anything anyone could have imagined in the town of Sefar, in Tassili n'Ajjer (wilaya of Illizi, located 2,400 km south of Algiers, the capital).

The city of Sefar is the largest troglodyte city in the world (listed as a World Heritage Site since 1982), the largest open-air museum in the world, housing hundreds of thousands of engravings, drawings, and rock paintings, including the famous “Great Gods” and “Martians” of a very particular pictorial style, which are among the oldest and most enigmatic paintings in the world. The dating of these astonishing figures goes back to at least 12,000 years BCE, if not much earlier.

The transition from one cultural style to another should never be imagined as a clear and brief break. The Capsians of the Bubaline period (the Algerian Paleolithic), in the north, did not suddenly disappear to make way for the following ones, in the south. One can imagine a sort of cross-fade of images, like in the cinema, to give the impression that many inseparable events are occurring.

For some, perhaps an extraterrestrial visit to Earth in the distant past. Could the Sahara, once a verdant region crisscrossed by rivers and populated by life tens of thousands of years ago, have been a point of contact with a civilization from the stars?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","This Actor Played Opposite Roles in Lost & Supernatural (& He Was Perfect in Both of Them)","https://www.cbr.com/mark-pellegrino-roles-in-lost-supernatural/","Tue, 13 May 2025 03:10:00 GMT","

The 2000s were a television golden age for both cable and network programming. While prestige dramas like The Sopranos and Breaking Bad produced legendary antiheroes navigating shades of gray with grit and realism, genre shows such as Lost and Supernatural escalated the stakes, exploring similar themes by transforming characters into literal deities. It was a bold narrative dichotomy, challenging viewers with network episodic television like never before.

As several memorable shows mined these moral extremes, one actor moved between these cosmic extremes with precision: Mark Pellegrino. The veteran character actor performed a rare spiritual twofer in the late 2000s, embodying both divine protector and fallen angel across two genre-defining series. As Jacob, the actor watched over the Lost island with a relaxed yet all-powerful presence, while his Lucifer terrorized Supernatural with a mellow, patient menace. It's an underappreciated acting feat, and it's high time it gets celebrated.

Lost, ABC's groundbreaking mid-aughts TV drama, famously followed survivors of a plane crash stranded on a mysterious island with supernatural tendencies. Throughout the five Lost seasons, characters and audiences mined clues and symbols to unravel the program's many mysteries and faith-based inspirations. When Pellegrino finally appeared as Jacob, a heavily hinted-at character before his debut in the Season 5 finale, audiences got a proxy to address these thematic and plot-forward puzzles head-on.

Throughout its six season, Lost introduced massive and mind-blowing plot twists changing the show in irrevocable ways and these are some of the best.

Pelligrino's mysterious island protector emerged not like an almighty deity but like a gentle paternal presence. Pellegrino spoke softly and moved deliberately, plucking inspiration from the oldest source material of all: the Bible. The Lost producers described the character as a ""Christ-like carpenter figure."" Pellegrino took their direction literally, creating a character whose divinity came not from grandeur but from humility.

I approached Jacob as Jesus the carpenter. Jesus in the crowds, Jesus with the people. He looks at you and he can see into you. And you feel like you are being penetrated by him and that he knows you. Yet he is simple and unassuming, and that's kinda the way I felt about Jacob. If he does something miraculous it's simple. And he can see into you, he's got the wisdom to see what you are about and see into your soul.

- Mark Pelligrino

Key Jacob Moments in Lost:

-First appearance in Season 5 finale ""The Incident""

-Meeting with the Man in Black on the beach

-Flashbacks showing Jacob's interactions with main characters

-Final appearance in Season 6's ""What They Died For""

What makes the performance significant isn't technical virtuosity but tonal control. Jacob carries the burden of immortality without broadcasting it. He maintains cosmic balance while appearing unremarkable. The result confused some viewers and critics. Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker complained that Pellegrino made Jacob ""more of a pious simp than a sturdy conveyor of Lost wisdom."" Others recognized something more nuanced—a world-weary guardian tired of human folly but bound to protect it anyway.

Supernatural, The CW's super-long-running fantasy-horror series, followed brothers Sam and Dean Winchester as they hunted monsters across America. After years of build-up, Supernatural Season 5 introduced a climactic event befitting its title: the literal biblical apocalypse, catalyzed by Lucifer being freed from Hell, seeking to destroy humanity. What followed was another Pellgrino masterclass.

Two years after Jacob's introduction, Pellegrino stepped into another metaphysical archetype, albeit on the opposite side of the sanctity spectrum. Joining another rabid fan-base-boasting program, Supernatural, Pelligrino played Lucifer himself. Though the role showcased the actor as a dynamo, Pellegrino's Satan didn't rely on scenery-chewing excess like most do. Instead, he built something more disturbing: a calm, collected Devil with legitimate grievances, not so far removed from Jacob in Lost. His Lucifer didn't rage, but rather pervaded and persuaded.

The Supernatural series finale divided fans, but four years before then, it had the perfect ending for Sam and Dean Winchester with ""Alpha and Omega.""

Jacob (Lost)

Lucifer (Supernatural)

Protect the island

Revenge against God

Patient, calm

Witty, resentful

Distant observer

Active manipulator

Subtle, restrained

Direct, intimidating

Key Lucifer Moments in Supernatural:

-First appearance in Season 5 episode ""The End""

-Confrontation with Castiel in ""Abandon All Hope""

-The garden scene with Sam in ""The Devil You Know""

-Apocalyptic showdown in Season 5 finale ""Swan Song""

-Return from The Cage in Season 11's ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""

-Final comeuppance in Season 13's ""Let the Good Times Roll""

Pellegrino found an unexpected approach to playing the supreme evil: making him empathetic. ""Lucifer's problem is very human,"" he told Smashing Interviews. ""After being betrayed by his father and his brother, he wants revenge. That's a pretty down-to-earth issue."" The grounded interpretation transformed biblical evil into relatable angst, subverting the usual Satan depiction and helping etch Pellegrino's name into the annals of genre television history.

 Despite the ethical polarity of Jacob and Lucifer, Pellegrino portrays them as fundamentally similar. Both are calmly resolute, devoted to their causes. Both gently manipulate characters, occupying the margins and operating unseen, all to achieve their brand of cosmic balance. Both represent god-like forces that trump human understanding, but still endure recognizably human emotion.

""Sometimes what appears to be evil on the outside may not be, and vice versa."" - Mark Pellegrino, AOL TV

Pellegrino brought immediate authority to both of his mythic roles. That natural presence the 6'4"" Pellegrino enjoys works to his advantage; Jacob needed only to stand still to command attention. Lucifer's presence implied an invasion of personal space without overacting or active intimidation, thanks to Pellgrino's imposing figure and subtly insidious demeanor. Both characters possess quiet power but deploy it to achieve opposite ends.

""They were very different takes on the world and not so different takes on how to go about getting what you want because I think Jacob was very mission-oriented as well. And wouldn't stop until he finished his experiment, so there was a certain synchronicity between the parts.""

- Mark Pellegrino, DragonCon 2021

Supernatural introduced several characters in memorable ways that revealed to the audience who they truly are in a single scene. 

In limited, late, or mid-series appearances as Jacob and Lucifer, Pellegrino became an embodiment of evidence that the distance between heaven and hell might not be so far after all. As two sides of the same cosmic coin, each convinced of its rightness, each blind to its flaws, Pellegrino's performances proved that morality is, mostly, about perspective. And though the actor hasn't headlined a prestige series or won major awards, his ability to transform archetypes into fully-realized beings makes him television's most unsung secret weapon—screentime and accolades be damned.

Supernatural and Lost are streaming on Hulu and Netflix.

An animal communicator has revealed the three tell-tale signs that your dog truly loves you, and it's sure to bring a smile to every pet owner's face. Danielle, a pet psychic with two decades of experience, strives to bridge the communication gap between pets and their owners, helping them understand each other's thoughts and feelings better.

In a TikTok video, she shares the signs that all pet parents can look out for to gauge their furry friends' true feelings towards them. She begins by saying: ""First, they feel comfortable looking you in the eye and doing nothing else. It's a gentle stare and it feels awesome. Second, they like to touch you but in that touch they're also okay not facing you. It means they trust your energy.""

Third, and this is the most important one, and if you don't get this one your dog, cat, horse, guinea pig doesn't love you.

""Well, this third one is, they do love you. They have mastered unconditional love, it's just sometimes their love looks different to what yours looks like.""

This comes after Dr James Greenwood, resident vet on ITV's The Pet Show, shared the unmistakable signs that you're the 'favourite' – and the best ways to strengthen this bond between you and your pet.

According to Dr Greenwood, you only need to observe your dog's tail to know whether you're its 'favourite human'.

He emphasized: ""It's all about the tail with dogs! They can express a whole range of emotions through their tail wag. Whilst it's important to note not all tail wagging is a sign of happiness, there are two types that signal pure joy in our dogs.""

The expert further explained: ""Secondly, the helicopter tail wag is usually reserved for those who are viewed as especially important. Finally, that super excited greeting when you get back from leaving the house – the jumping and licking, sometimes they may bark or bring you a toy – is a genuine signal that they are pleased to see you.""

Additionally, selecting a favourite human as a snuggle partner during late-night couch sessions can reveal deeper canine affections. Dr Greenwood points out if your furry friend chooses to cuddle with you on their own accord, it means they truly adore you and believe in your ability to protect them while they snooze.

For strengthening your connection with your dog, Dr Greenwood simply suggests quality time together. He advises: ""A daily walk is essential; dogs love using their senses to smell and explore and need to burn off calories exercising. I would also suggest setting up an obstacle course or using puzzle feeders to get them thinking and problem-solving.

""Food is also a big motivator for dogs and you can use this to your advantage when training by using treats as a reward for good behaviour.""

Pet owners have been hitting up social media to spill the tea on the signs that a doggo has chosen their human. A user on Reddit dished: ""My oldest dog was actually adopted for my son, but she has definitely chosen me as her person.

""She comes to me for comfort when she's scared, she sleeps in my bed, and gets extremely jealous when our cats and younger pup try to be near me.

""Our younger dog sings the craziest song whenever she sees my daughter's cat pull into our driveway. She acts like my daughter has been gone for a year, and rears up on her little hind legs, puts her paws together, and prances when she sees her come in the door. It's heartwarming.""

Trading away Luka Dončić made Nico Harrison a reviled figure among Dallas fans. Now he has an unexpected chance to redeem himself 

Dallas is ground zero for one of America's most historic conspiracy theories. Just half a mile from the grassy knoll where John F Kennedy was assassinated on 22 November 1963, sits the American Airlines Center – the newest site of Dallas conspiracy lore.

While this year's NBA draft lottery took place in Chicago on Monday night, the heart of the drama haunts Dallas. Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison's career lives to see another day after his team improbably beat 1.8% odds to land the No 1 pick in this year's draft – which they will almost certainly use to pick Duke phenom Cooper Flagg, one of the most talented college players in years. The 6ft 9in wing will presumably usher in the first full season of Dallas's post-Luka Dončić era. Mavs fans almost have to laugh, or maybe raise a very suspicious eyebrow. With the NBA's four worst teams (Washington Wizards, Charlotte Hornets, Utah Jazz, and New Orleans Pelicans) all taking a nosedive in the lottery, the storyline is tailor-made for a grand conspiracy theory.

The Mavs' decision in February to trade away Dončić garnered widespread conjecture around the franchise's owners, the Adelson family, tanking the team to eventually move them to their home base of Las Vegas, where they could add an NBA team to their casino empire. There were also theories around the NBA's disappointing ratings and what a prodigy like Dončić could do in Los Angeles. Those theories were only amplified by the poor return the Mavericks got in return for Dončić, already widely considered a future Hall of Famer. Online speculation quickly connected Harrison, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Lakers GM Rob Pelinka in a shadowy quid pro quo: send Dončić to one of the NBA marquee franchises, the Lakers, where he would play alongside the league's biggest name, LeBron James, and Harrison would be rewarded with the No 1 pick. It's a tale fit for any great sports conspiracy.

In the real world, Mavs fans have had a hell of a year. They watched their team, which had reached the NBA finals less than a year before, blown apart by their general manager as Dončić, a beloved superstar who had no desire to leave the city, was shown the door. And on the way out, Harrison and the organization disparaged Dončić's name, weight, commitment and tenure at every turn. Injuries broke apart any hope the fanbase had of reclamation this season, which ended with a disappointing play-in tournament exit. Now, they have a chance at a silver lining, and more importantly, a new chapter in the dismal story Harrison had started to write for the franchise.

There's a chance the Mavericks could trade the pick, perhaps as the centerpiece in a deal for two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is reportedly open to leaving the Milwaukee Bucks. But Dallas fans need the healing only a homegrown star can provide. Drafting Flagg would give Mavericks fans someone with them from the beginning of his career to rally behind, with the same kind of seismic potential Dončić once brought. Trading the pick for another star, in yet another attempt to manufacture a contender through trades, wouldn't mend the wound left by Harrison's unraveling of the Dirk Nowitzki-to-Dončić handoff – one that symbolized more than two decades of Mavs continuity. Flagg offers a clean slate, one that finally anchors the present and future after Harrison mortgaged most of the team's draft capital in the Dončić era.

Mavs fans never deserved Harrison's mismanagement. The lottery win was a near-impossible stroke of luck. Before Monday night, Mavericks fans braced for a bleak future. Anthony Davis, the return centerpiece for Dončić, has struggled with injuries since arriving. Kyrie Irving is expected to miss the first half of next season recovering from an ACL tear at age 33.

Harrison has been public enemy number one since trading Dončić to the rival Lakers in February. Chants calling for his firing have erupted across Dallas, from college basketball games and concerts to Medieval Times. He avoided his usual seat at the Mavs' arena. He delayed holding a press conference until forced by Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont. The coffee shop where Harrison and Pelinka first discussed a Dončić trade has marked the infamous table with “Luka was traded here” on a laminated strip. But on lottery night, Harrison was seen leaping with joy when Dallas secured the first pick. Rumors were already swirling that Dumont wanted to bring in a seasoned executive to assist him on basketball decisions. It's safe to say winning the lottery has saved his job although the blame doesn't stop with him. He was hired by Mark Cuban, retained by Miriam Adelson, and empowered by Dumont.

Now Harrison and the Mavs have an unexpected chance to rebuild trust with their fans. The Mavericks have historically built through the draft, from Mark Aguirre and Rolando Blackman in 1981 to Jason Kidd, Dirk Nowitzki, Jalen Brunson, and Dončić. Harrison may be too steeped in his own arrogance to see that. His many tone-deaf comments on the Dončić trade revealed a staggering lack of understanding of the fanbase that pays his checks.

Winning the draft lottery at such odds takes either a miracle or a grand conspiracy. Knowing what to do with the gift you've been given should be a no-brainer. We have a little over a month to find out what kind of leader Harrison chooses to be.

If you're a fan of chaos, you surely loved what went down in the NBA Draft Lottery on Monday night. The Dallas Mavericks, on just a 1.8% chance, secured the No. 1 pick. The San Antonio Spurs and the Philadelphia 76ers -- who both were long shots to get top-three picks -- followed at No. 2 and No. 3, respectively.

Here is the 2025 NBA Draft order for the top 10 picks:

And with that settled, let's take a look at some of the big winners and losers on lottery night.  

The Mavericks have to be thanking their lucky stars that they lost to the Grizzlies in their last Play-In Tournament game. If they win that game, they fall out of the lottery all for the right to get blasted in the first round by top-seeded OKC.     

Instead, they lose that game, and give themselves a 1.8% chance of landing the No. 1 pick. It wasn't much. About like betting on the longest shot at the Kentucky Derby. But I'll be damned if that horse didn't come through, and suddenly a team that traded Luka Dončić, then saw Kyrie Irving blow his ACL, and was right about at the edge of needing to blow the whole thing up, finds itself in prime position to build an immediate contender.     

The Mavericks have all kinds of options now. They can just draft Cooper Flagg, a player who's probably ready to contribute on a contender right away (sort of like a Chet Holmgren) and who also while locks in Dallas' future as the sort of two-way building block Nico Harrison can't stop telling the world he covets. If Kyrie Irving can come back around January, which Dallas is optimistic about, an Irving-Flagg-Anthony Davis trio with shooters and a bunch of defenders around them is, dare I say, probably a more complete and capable team than one that was going to be led by Dončić.     

Or, the Mavericks can put the No. 1 pick on the open market and see what comes back. Giannis Antetokounmpo is going to be up for discussion. Everyone knows that by now. Can you imagine a Kyrie-Davis-Giannis trio? This is absolutely crazy how this has flipped, on a 1.8% chance, from a franchise on fire to a top-tier contender that has stumbled onto an almost impossible pathway to both short- and long-term success.     

The nightmare scenario for Flagg, the almost guaranteed top overall pick, was to end up with the Wizards. Of the three teams with the highest odds to get the No. 1 pick, the Hornets would've palatable if only for the chance to team up with LaMelo Ball, and the Jazz are in good hands with Danny Ainge and figure to be capable of building a small-market winner. Going to Washington would've been the worst.     

But now Flagg doesn't have to mess with any of those losing teams. He's either heading to a good team in the Mavericks with a chance to compete right away or he's going to be in a trade, perhaps to Milwaukee, which is fading as a desirable destination but, alas, isn't Washington. Good night for Flagg.     

After signing Paul George with the expectation that it would catapult it into top-tier contention, Philadelphia saw its season turn into an unmitigated disaster. Joel Embiid only played in 19 games. George only played in 41 and wasn't even close to good enough even in that limited action to justify his four-year, $212M price tag.     

When the Sixers finally gave up on winning and turned their attention to upping their lottery odds as high as possible, the only thing that could salvage their season was landing a top-six pick. If they landed anywhere outside the top six, they would've lost the pick to OKC.     

Not only did Philly stay in the top six, it landed the No. 3 overall pick. Once we knew it was in the running for Flagg, sure, it's a little bit of a disappointment that it didn't get No. 1. But beggars can't be choosers. This is a deep draft and Philadelphia can do a lot with the No. 3 pick, either with a quality young player or, perhaps more likely, as a trade asset. Big night for the Sixers.     

The Spurs are their way up, up, up baby. Two years ago they drafted Victor Wembanyama, who feels destined to be one of the greatest players ever barring injury. Last year they got Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle. And now they land the No. 2 pick in this summer's draft despite coming in with just a 6.3% chance of that happening.     

Just like the Mavericks and Sixers above, the Spurs now have the option of using this pick on yet another young prospect as they build toward one of most promising futures in the league, or they can use it as a trade asset to hit the fast-forward button on their contention timeline.     

Giannis Antetokounmpo is in play here. San Antonio has the draft assets, young players and matching money to make something happen. Gregg Popovich, now officially off the sidelines and into the top front-office spot, has a major decision to make with this pick, and all the options sound pretty damn good.     

There were a few teams who started out the season trying to win and went to the tank late, notably the 76ers, Spurs and Pelicans. But the teams that were on the tank from the start, whose sole mission all season was to lose enough games to win the lottery, came up bust.     

That would be the Charlotte Hornets, Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards, who finished with the three worst records in the league and thus shared the highest odds (14.5% each) of winning the lottery. They fell to No. 4, 5 and 6, respectively.     

If you're a team without absolutely no chance of competing for a playoff spot, and even more if you're not what we've come to refer to as a destination franchise that can build a winner through free agency, tanking still makes sense. But it has not proven to be a path to the No. 1 pick.     

In fact, since the league smoothed its lottery odds in 2019, the team with the worst overall record has never won the No. 1 pick. This year that team was the Jazz, who fell to No. 5. Unbelievably, this is actually the third straight year that the league's worst team has landed the No. 5 pick. It happened to the Pistons in both 2023 and 2024. The Wizards, in particular, literally fell to the lowest spot possible, No. 6, for a team with a bottom-three record.     

Finally something didn't go Oklahoma City's way in the draft. Nobody's crying for the Thunder, who still have a treasure trove of assets in addition to one of the most talented and youngest rosters in the league, but had they added another lottery pick here, in this draft, it would've been too crazy to deal with. Good on the Thunder, who have made their own luck, but at least a little bit of it ran out on Monday.     

This guy was about to go into witness protection after trading Dončić for, relatively speaking, a pathetic return, only to watch Anthony Davis get immediately injured and Kyrie Irving tear his ACL. This guy was done in Dallas. And the next thing you know he steps in you know what and lands Cooper Freaking Flagg -- who, just to repeat everything from above, can either be Dallas' future franchise player or its ticket to Giannis Antetokounmpo.     

Players like Luka might come around every couple decades. If that. When you just give one away, as Harrison and the Mavericks did, you are signing up for the possibility that a player like that will never wear your uniform again. But Harrison, on a 1.8% prayer, gets gifted a basketball miracle to start the cover-up process for what will always be one of the dumbest trades in sports history. Absolutely unbelievable.     

If you like to trumpet NBA conspiracy theories -- that the league rigs playoff games, lottery spots, et cetera for business purposes -- then Monday night was your time to shine.     

Let's be honest, the league did not want to see Cooper Flagg dying a slow basketball death in Washington or Charlotte or even Utah. It was also watching the Mavericks, a pretty premier franchise, go up in flames. It also has every incentive to make the Spurs as good as possible, as quickly as possible, to maximize the marketing bonanza that Victor Wembanyama stands to be. And clearly the Sixers, another high-profile team, getting a top pick to put a tourniquet on their bleed out is in the best interest of the league.     

And what do you know, against extraordinary odds ... it all happened. Not one of those things. Not two of those things. All of them. The Mavericks, with a 1.8% chance, landed the No. 1 pick. The Spurs, with a 13% chance, landed a top-two pick. The Sixers, with a 31.6% chance, landed a top-three pick.

Put all those outcomes together, and the chances of it happening are miniscule. And it came to fruition. Do with that what you will.

Claims that spruce trees synchronize their responses to a solar eclipse were widely reported recently — but many researchers are sceptical of the results.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The idea that trees communicate with each other during an eclipse and synchronize their behavior — as has been widely reported recently — is a compelling one. The fascinating idea sprang out of research detecting bioelectric signals in spruce trees (Picea abies) in Italy's Dolomite mountains during a 2-hour-long partial solar eclipse. But many researchers aren't convinced, saying the number of trees studied is tiny and that there are more plausible explanations for the results.

Some 6,600 feet (2,000 meters) above sea level, Alessandro Chiolerio, a physicist at the Italian Institute of Technology, Monica Gagliano, an ecologist at Southern Cross University in Australia, and their colleagues attached remote sensors to three healthy spruce trees — two of about 70 years old and the other around 20 years old — and to five tree stumps.

The sensors were there to detect electrical currents created when charged molecules travel through the cells of living organisms.

""Our results demonstrated that spruce trees exhibited synchronized changes in their bioelectrical activity in anticipation of a solar eclipse,"" Gagliano told Live Science. ""Remarkably, this synchronization began several hours before the eclipse occurred, suggesting not just a passive reaction to darkness but an active, anticipatory response.""

""The strongest signs of this early response were observed in older trees, hinting at a memory-like capacity linked to their age and environmental history,"" she said. ""This study provides the first evidence that trees in a forest can behave as a coordinated collective system — functioning more like an integrated network than just as isolated individuals.""

So, what exactly is going on in this work published April 30 in Royal Society Open Science, and how seriously should we take it?

""There is strong concern among my colleagues that this paper was published,"" James Cahill, a plant ecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, told Live Science. ""The paper doesn't meet what I would say are the basic standards needed for science. Its sample size is three, which is very low and they have a super large number of variables that they're testing — over 10 — and you're always going to find a pattern if you do something like that.""

Many plants and animals respond to the day-night cycles of light and dark, so plants responding to approaching darkness shouldn't be a surprise, he said.

""If you turn off the lights in a greenhouse at or at night, every plant will show reduced water transpiration and reduced photosynthesis. Is that coordination?"" asked Cahill. This would also alter their bioelectrical signals, and every biological material has bioelectrical signals, he added, so there's nothing fancy in detecting changes to these.

It's also unlikely there's an evolutionary survival advantage to responding to an eclipse, Cahill pointed out, given how briefly and infrequently they occur. Instead, he thinks the plants are responding with capabilities that have evolved for a different reason. ""It is very easy to imagine that sensory systems evolved for other purposes that are then hijacked in an eclipse. Plants respond to darkness and an eclipse causes darkness. But it doesn't mean that the eclipse caused the response to darkness.""

And when it comes to the bioelectrical signals changing before the eclipse rather than during it, there's also a simple possible answer, he said. ""Plants have elaborate sensory systems for detecting light and a lot of plants can detect UV light and blue light changes and those tend to come first across the horizon. A lot of plants will start changing their photosynthetic machinery before sunrise,"" said Cahill. ""I'm not sure this is anything different.""



""It's disappointing that this paper is getting so much press because it's just an idea and there's not much here other than assertion,"" said Cahill. ""This could have been replicated, it should be replicated. There's no understanding of why they are focusing on electrical signals instead of the photosynthetic rate. They also didn't compare this to just night and day, which is the obvious thing to do and that's very worrisome to me.""

Other researchers approached by Live Science said similar things. ""I don't think anything can be concluded from an experiment that does not include replicates,"" Justine Karst, a forest ecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, told Live Science.

Researchers in the field are also skeptical about the idea that older trees responded more strongly.

There are three living trees in the study and there are assertions about young versus old, said Cahill, ""but they only have one young plant and it's in a different site. And it's not even young, it's 20 years old.""

Asked about the small sample size, Chiolerio told Live Science how difficult it was to spend whole days working at almost 7,000 feet above sea level to attach sensors to trees when temperatures go down to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees Celsius).

""Due to the complexity of the field setup — monitoring trees 24/7 in alpine conditions — we focused on a small number of carefully selected individuals. Despite the sample size, the data were robust and consistent across trees and sites,"" said Gagliano. ""Still, this is an early study, and we view it as a foundation for broader research.""

Karst compared the new findings to experimental studies that seemed to reveal a wood-wide web in which trees communicate and share resources via underground networks of mycorrhizal fungi. She was a co-author of work published in 2023 showing that there was insufficient evidence for the idea.

""I hoped that after the wood-wide web fell apart, journalists would be more skeptical about research claiming that 'trees talk',"" said Karst.

—Scientists find the best crops to grow during the apocalypse

—'Gossiping neighbors': Plants didn't evolve to be kind to each other, study finds

—'Alien plant' fossil discovered near Utah ghost town doesn't belong to any known plant families, living or extinct

Cahill is in favor of studying plant behavior to probe whether these organisms have cognition — he is doing work in that area himself — but says the level of evidence needs to be very high before claims are made.

""How would we test cognition in plants? I'm sympathetic to the idea of a different approach, but papers like this make it really hard to do very strong science in a controversial area,"" said Cahill. ""It's very disappointing because the Royal Society has had a great reputation. But this should not be published.""

In response to questions about the study's publication, The Royal Society Open Science sent Live Science the following comment.

""All research published by Royal Society Open Science goes through thorough peer review before being accepted.""

They also noted the role post-publication discussion plays in their process.

""We encourage academic debate and constructive criticism of the research published in our journals. Any reader is able to submit a comment on research published in Open Science, this will be peer reviewed and published alongside an invited reply from the original authors.""

A security camera near Thazi, Myanmar, captured the earth cracking during a magnitude 7.7 earthquake in March.

A video showing the ground tearing apart in a major earthquake in Myanmar in March may be the first of its kind.

The video captures a ground rupture, the ripping of Earth's crust all the way up to the surface, during a major earthquake. The magnitude 7.7 quake struck on March 28 at 12:50 p.m. local time and was felt as far away as Thailand. Nearly 5,500 people died.

The video, posted on Facebook by Singaporean engineer Htin Aung, comes from GP Energy Myanmar's Thapyawa solar farm, located near the town of Thazi, according to Aung's post. The feed is centered on a concrete-and-metal gate, which shudders and slides open as the earth begins to move. About 14 seconds into the video, a crack opens across the driveway and yard outside the gate, with the ground literally pulling apart.

""It's really kind of unsettling,"" said John Vidale, a seismologist at the University of Southern California Dornsife. Vidale told Live Science he knew of no other videos that show such a ground rupture. Rick Aster, a geophysicist at Colorado State University, concurred.

""To my knowledge, this is the best video we have of a throughgoing surface rupture of a very large earthquake,"" Aster told Live Science.

The Myanmar quake occurred on the Sagaing Fault between the Burma and Sunda tectonic plates, two minor tectonic plates. This fault slices through central Myanmar in a straight line, north to south. It's a transform fault, just like California's famous San Andreas, where the two plates move side by side against each other.

The epicenter of the Myanmar quake, where the fault rupture started, was north of the location in the video, near the city of Mandalay. This rupture then propagated both north and south, cracking the ground all along the fault line.

""The actual segment of the Earth that is slipping side to side goes from the surface down to maybe 20 or 30 kilometers [12 to 19 miles] depth,"" Aster said. Below that, the crust still moves, but the crust is more malleable and deforms rather than cracks.

The shaking first seen in the video comes from the earthquake waves that speed out from the rupturing crack, Vidale said. Then, the rupture itself arrives.

Seismologists get good measurements of such ruptures from seismic stations that use GPS to quantify even tiny movements of the crust. They also often do fieldwork to find evidence of ruptures after they happen, Aster said. ""But we don't really understand the dynamics of what happened, exactly how things move,"" he said. The video might be useful for researchers who are trying to understand those unusual dynamics.

""I have no doubt that seismologists will take a very close look at this,"" Aster said. ""It will probably lead to some kind of a publication at some point, if the location and other details can be sorted out.""

Live Science reached out to Aung and to GP Energy Myanmar and will update this story with further details, if available.

Microsoft plans to cut less than 3% of its global workforce, or about 6,000 employees, with notifications beginning Tuesday, the company confirmed.

A person familiar with the cuts said some affected employees would stay on the payroll for 60 days and still be eligible for rewards and bonuses. Microsoft's spokesperson did not comment on or confirm these terms.

As Business Insider reported last month, these cuts are intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders versus noncoders on projects. Microsoft organizations want to increase their ""span of control,"" or the number of employees who report to each manager. A spokesperson said these latest cuts were not performance-driven.

Across the tech industry, a culling of middle managers is already underway. Amazon has been trying to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers. And in December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency drive.

Microsoft is also trying to decrease the ""PM ratio"" on some teams, which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers.

The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it is cutting an additional $450 million in grants to Harvard University through eight federal agencies, on top of the $2.2 billion already frozen last week.

""Harvard University has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus,"" the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said in a statement.

The task force went on to call Harvard a ""breeding ground for virtue signaling and discrimination.""

It's the latest funding hit for the elite university, which has been a target of the Trump administration over the last several weeks. The Trump administration and Harvard have been engaged in a high-profile legal battle.

Harvard did not immediately respond to the latest funding cuts. University President Alan Garber previously issued a statement defending its constitutional rights after filing a lawsuit against the administration to halt the funding freeze.

Wealth and power.

Global political and business leaders gathered in Riyadh on Tuesday for the Saudi Arabia Investment Forum, discussing the artificial intelligence boom and global trade.

President Donald Trump met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as several deals were announced between the two countries.

Saudi Arabia is investing $600 billion in the U.S., a package the White House said would boost ""energy security, defense industry, technology leadership, and access to global infrastructure and critical minerals.""

The White House also touted a nearly $142 billion deal to provide Saudi Arabia with weapons and services from U.S. defense firms.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced a deal to provide the kingdom its high-end AI Blackwell chips.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy were among the attendees, as well as other high-profile executives and power players such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Alphabet President Ruth Porat, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, Palantir CEO Alex Karp and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon.

White House touts deal made on first stop of US president's four-day diplomatic tour to Gulf states

The United States and Saudi Arabia have signed a $142bn arms deal touted by the White House as the “largest defence sales agreement in history” in the first stop of Donald Trump's four-day diplomatic tour to the Gulf states aimed at securing big deals and spotlighting the benefits of Trump's transactional foreign policy.

During the trip, the White House also confirmed that Trump would meet with Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former rebel commander whose forces helped overthrow Bashar al-Assad in 2024. The informal meeting will be the first face-to-face meeting between a US president and a Syrian leader since 2000, when Bill Clinton met with the late leader Hafez al-Assad in Geneva.

Speaking at an investment forum on Tuesday, Trump said that he planned to lift sanctions on Syria after holding talks with Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” Trump said.

Sharaa's pitch to woo the US president offered access to Syrian oil, reconstruction contracts and to build a Trump Tower in Damascus in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions on Syria.

Though the details of the sanctions relief were still unclear, Sharaa's team in Damascus was celebrating. 
 “This is amazing, it worked,” said Radwan Ziadeh, a Syrian writer and activist who is close to the Syrian president. He shared a picture of an initial mockup of Trump Tower Damascus. “This is how you win his heart and mind,” he said, noting that Sharaa would probably show Trump the design during their meeting in Riyadh on Wednesday.

The visit was heavily focused on business interests and securing quick wins – often with characteristic Trumpian embellishment – for the administration. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed pledged to invest $600bn in the United States during a lunch with Trump, including $20bn in artificial intelligence data centres, purchases of gas turbines and other energy equipment worth $14.2bn, nearly $5bn in Boeing 737-8 jets, and other deals.

But details of the specific commitments remained vague, the numbers put out by the White House did not total $600bn, and some of the programs began under Joe Biden's administration.

The White House called the arms deal the “largest defence sales agreement in history” and said that it included plans for more than a dozen US defense companies to sell weapons, equipment and services in the areas of air force advancement and space capabilities, air and missile defense, as well as border and maritime security.

The US president was feted with a royal guard as he arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s escorted Trump's Air Force One jet as it arrived in Riyadh and Trump sat with Salman in an ornate hall at the Royal Court at Al Yamamah Palace with members of the US and Saudi and business elite. Among them were Elon Musk, prominent figures in AI like Sam Altman, as well the chief executives of IBM, BlackRock, Citigroup, Palantir and Nvidia, among others.

When Salman pledged that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn in the US economy, Trump smiled and joked that it should be $1tn.

The trip is part of a reordering of Middle Eastern politics dominated by Trump's America First platform of prioritising domestic US economic and security interests over foreign alliances and international law. Critics have said that the dealmaking empowers Trump and a coterie of businessmen around the president, and the US president's family has business interests in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, giving this administration an unprecedented conflict of interest.

The most glaring example of the new commoditisation of American foreign policy under Trump has been the proposed gift from the ruling family of Qatar of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet that the White House said could be converted into a presidential plane and then be given to Trump's presidential library after he leaves office.

The gift has provoked anger from congressional Democrats, one of whom described it as an “aerial palace” and said it would constitute “the most valuable gift ever conferred on a president by a foreign government”.

Trump has defended the offer, saying it would “replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction” and called Democrats asking for an ethics investigation “World Class Losers!!!”

The meeting between Trump and Salman was characterised by smiles and friendly backslapping, a sharp contrast to past summits when the Saudi leader was mired in controversy over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

While his administration touted big deals, Trump also admitted that his geopolitical goals of Saudi Arabia's diplomatic recognition of Israel would take time due in large part to the Israel's prosecution of the war in Gaza.

“It will be a special day in the Middle East, with the whole world watching, when Saudi Arabia joins us” in the Abraham accords, the Trump administration's framework for Arab states to recognise Israel, he said. “And I really think it's going to be something special – but you'll do it in your own time.”

Trump is also due to visit the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday before continuing on to Qatar this week.

His negotiations in the region have been characterised by big ticket investment deals, and those appeared to play a role in his reversal of US policy on Syria as well.

Sharaa, who is keen to normalise relations with the US, has reportedly offered Trump a number of sweeteners including the Trump tower in Damascus, a demilitarised zone by the Golan Heights that would strengthen Israel's claim to the territory it has occupied since 1967, diplomatic recognition of Israel, and a profit-sharing deal on resources similar to the Ukraine minerals deal.

The idea to offer Trump a piece of real estate with his name on it in the heart of Damascus was thought up by a US Republican senator, who passed on the idea to Sharaa's team.

“Sanctions in Syria are very complicated, but with Trump, he can [get] most of them lifted. It is a great opportunity,” Ziadeh said.

The trip is also extraordinary for Trump's decision not to visit Israel, the US's closest ally in the region, due to the war in Gaza and Trump's fraught relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas released the last remaining American hostage, Edan Alexander, on the eve of Trump's visit to the Middle East, in an effort to push Trump to pressure Netanyahu to end the war.

Netanyahu doubled down on the war on Tuesday in a show of defiance, saying that any ceasefire would only be “temporary”.

“In the coming days, we will enter with full force to complete the operation to defeat Hamas,” he said. “Our forces are there now.”

“There will be no situation where we stop the war,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

			US president receives warm welcome from Gulf leaders as he seeks new investments

When Donald Trump landed in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for a whirlwind visit to the Middle East, he arrived in his happy place.

The stakes could not be higher across the region. Conflict rumbles on in Gaza, the Houthis continue to launch missiles from Yemen, Israel is making noises about attacking Iran, and there are oil, trade and investment talks under way.

Yet Mr Trump is avoiding the hotspots for three Gulf states that are crucial to Washington's regional strategy without being at the heart of the turmoil.

He received a warm welcome from the leader of Saudi Arabia and will also meet leaders in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom have cash to invest in the US.

So while Joe Biden agonised for weeks over how to greet Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman (MBS) after calling his country a pariah, settling eventually on an awkward fist bump out of view of his travelling press pack, Mr Trump faced no such qualms.

Jon Alterman, senior vice-president of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said: “It's hard for me to escape the idea that President Trump is going to the Gulf because this is his happy place.

“His hosts will be generous and hospitable. They'll be keen to make deals.”

His choice bucks tradition. Before Trump, Mexico or Canada had been the first or second foreign destination for almost every US president since the Second World War.

The decision highlights a wider White House strategy. Officials see the region as a “hinge,” connecting America, China and Europe as the engines of the global economy.

Critics see another motive: personal profit.

The Trump Organisation last month announced a deal to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar.

It shows the president's family business has no intention of slowing the pace of foreign dealings during Mr Trump's second term.

It adds to a Trump golf course in Dubai, where a second is now under construction, and three developments in Saudi Arabia.

On Friday, Karoline Leavitt told reporters the president was not expected to meet anyone involved in those projects during his trip. And she hit back angrily at any insinuation that was the case.

“I think it's frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit,” she said during her regular White House briefing.

Mr Trump's visit is taking him to three of the world's richest nations, whose leaders have the sort of wealth and gold-edged trappings that the president admires.

His addition of golden frames and mouldings to the Oval Office, and the glittering tapestries in his Mar-a-Lago home shows he shares not just a taste for luxury with his hosts, but an entire aesthetic.

Saudi Arabia also offers Mr Trump a venue free from the sort of political tension he might face elsewhere, in capitals riled by tariffs and trade disputes.

Gulf states are also not known for the sort of street demonstrations that would be seen if he visited Canada, Mexico or the UK.

The region has other good vibes for Trump, according to Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute.

He was feted by its leaders during his first visit in 2017.

And, when much of the rest of his foreign policy received decidedly mixed reviews, his efforts to build relations between Israel and Arab states through the Abraham Accords were a high point.

“I think he has positive, fond memories of what his administration was able to do there, at least on the Abraham Accords,” he said.

The war in Gaza and tensions with Iran are providing an awkward backdrop to the visit. Do not expect quick progress there, added Mr Katulis, but rather a rash of investment announcements.

The region's deep pockets mean there is rich pickings for a president who wants to drive investment and job growth at home. Mr Trump is seeking major new investments in infrastructure, technology and energy ventures.

And he will find willing partners, said Mr Alterman.

“The Gulf itself is a developer's dream, with mangrove swamps and sand dunes transformed into glittering complexes of malls, apartments, and fountains – often owned by people with connections to the rulers,” he said.

“It seems to me that, in the president's mind, this is the world as it should be.”

Mr Trump spent the weekend teeing up a string of huge announcements: the release of the last American hostage held by Hamas, a deal to ease tariffs with China, and he confirmed that he was planning to accept a bling-filled 747 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One.

Expect more deals during the next three days, but they are likely to be investments in the US rather than the sort of geo-strategic agreements that would end simmering conflicts.

The Saudi government is hosting an investment forum with David Sacks, White House crypto tsar, and other top business leaders. Elon Musk, the Tesla founder and close aide to Mr Trump, is also there.

MBS has already promised $600 billion for the United States during the next four years, a number Mr Trump says he wants to double.

And in Qatar, the US president is expected to seal hundreds of billions of dollars in deals, including the $2 billion sale of Reaper drones.

“Colorado is paving a different path by acting on its own to strengthen our right to vote,” said one advocate. 

On Monday, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act (COVRA) into law, significantly bolstering protections against voting discrimination and reinforcing the right to fair and equal access to the ballot.

“Governor Polis and the Colorado legislature have made clear that they are committed to defending voters from discrimination,” Janai S. Nelson, Legal Defense Fund (LDF) president and director-counsel, said in a statement.

COVRA will safeguard the right to vote for more than 150,000 eligible Black Coloradans and other communities of color by going after racial vote dilution and voter suppression, according to the LDF. The legislation will also expand access to multilingual ballots, enhance transparency by creating a publicly accessible statewide database with key demographic and electoral information, and strengthen protections for LGBTQ voters, disabled voters, and eligible voters in county jails.

“Generations of brave activists, women, and people of color have fought for the right to vote — and now, it's our turn,” Democratic State Sen. Julie Gonzales, one of the sponsors of the bill, said in a statement. “This law will ensure that in Colorado, no matter your gender, race, or the language you speak, your sacred right to vote is protected.”

Gonzales has emphasized that a series of legal decisions have weakened voting rights protections, raising concerns that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans may further erode the Voting Rights Act — just as they have with other civil rights protections.

“Those were hard fought protections that the civil rights movement and the Black community particularly fought and led to achieve, and to see the fact that now a generation later, we don't know whether or how long those protections will continue to exist — we're not just going to sit around and see what happens,” Gonzales said.

COVRA empowers the Colorado Attorney General to enforce protections for voting rights both at the state and local levels so that the state can act against violations without relying on federal courts. Voters will also be able to initiate court challenges under the act, either individually or with the support of civil rights organizations.

“The most fundamental right in a democracy is the right to vote. Since 1965, with the passage of the Voting Rights Act, there have been consistent and persistent efforts to protect this fundamental right,” said Deborah Richardson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado.

Colorado has become a model for safe, open, and accessible elections, according to state lawmakers. Legislators have led efforts to expand ballot access for Indigenous voters, incarcerated people, and university students. In 2021, the state also enacted legislation expanding access to minority language ballots beyond federal requirements. 

“In this time of uncertainty and national instability, Colorado is paving a different path by acting on its own to strengthen our right to vote,” Aly Belknap, executive director of Colorado Common Cause, said in a statement.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Truthout is appealing for your support to weather this storm of censorship. We've launched a fundraising campaign to find 500 new monthly donors in the next 10 days. Will you be one?

As independent media with no corporate backing or billionaire ownership, Truthout is uniquely able to push back against the right-wing narrative and expose the shocking extent of political repression under the new McCarthyism. We're committed to doing this work, but we're also deeply vulnerable to Trump's attacks.

Your support during our fundraiser (9 days left) will help us continue our nonprofit movement journalism in the face of right-wing authoritarianism. Please make a tax-deductible donation today.

“If approved, the Velvet-Wood mine project in San Juan County, Utah, would produce uranium and vanadium,” said the agency. Uranium is used as fuel in nuclear reactors and for the production of tritium, which is required for nuclear weapons, while vanadium is used in steel production and titanium aerospace alloys.

“The project will undergo an accelerated environmental review by the Bureau of Land Management, with a completion timeline of 14 days. The expedited review is expected to significantly contribute to meeting urgent energy demands and addressing key threats to national energy security,” the DOI said.

The United States is currently “dangerously reliant” on foreign imports to meet the demand for uranium and vanadium, according to the agency.

As for vanadium, almost half of domestic consumption last year was accounted for by imports, the DOI said.

A key security risk posed by the lack of domestic uranium and vanadium production is that America is dependent on its rivals.

The declaration said the current inadequate development of domestic energy sources makes the United States “vulnerable to hostile foreign actors” and poses a national security threat to the country.

“America is facing an alarming energy emergency because of the prior administration's Climate Extremist policies,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said.

“President Trump and his administration are responding with speed and strength to solve this crisis.

Approval times will be reduced to a maximum of 28 days from the months or years it used to take, the department said.

The policy is applicable to a wide range of energy sources such as oil, gas, uranium, geothermal, biofuels, and coal. Solar and wind were not listed.

“The United States cannot afford to wait,” Burgum said. “By reducing a multi-year permitting process down to just 28 days, the Department will lead with urgency, resolve, and a clear focus on strengthening the nation's energy independence.”

“These arbitrary time limits make a complete review of the risks of potentially hazardous projects impossible,” said Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club's Lands Protection Program.

“A shoddy review means the true hazards of a project may only be known when the air or water thousands of people rely on is dangerously polluted.”

“Critical minerals are essential for U.S. military readiness, as they are key components in fighter jets, satellites, submarines, smart bombs, and missile guidance systems,” it said, adding that “financing, loans, and investment support will be provided for new mineral production projects.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"
