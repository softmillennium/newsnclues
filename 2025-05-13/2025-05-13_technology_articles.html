                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is not the first time Airbnb has tried such a feature — it paused an earlier version of experiences in 2023 to improve its core offering of stays. Now the company once again wants customers to go beyond planning a trip. During Airbnb's Q1 2025 call, CEO Brian Chesky said that its service was accessed by over 1.5 billion devices in the last year, but pointed out that many people come to the site and don't book a home. It also brings Airbnb more directly in competition with other travel companies such as Tripadvisor, Booking.com, Viator, and GetYourGuide, and service providers like Yelp. Initially, Airbnb allows you to book services across 10 categories, including chefs, catering, prepared meals, photography, massages, spa treatment, personal training, hair, nails, and makeup. The services will be offered in 100 cities worldwide across eight countries. These include things like pastry making at French Bastards bakery with chef Raphaelle Elbaz, or playing beach volleyball with Olympian Carolina Solberg on Rio's Leblon Beach. We think that these are natural extensions to home [stays]. We think about our new offerings the same way,” Judson Coplan, VP of Product Marketing at Airbnb, told TechCrunch over a call. Coplan believes that Airbnb Experiences may inspire people to travel and take a trip they might not have thought about. However, users will just see one price when searching for or booking either category. The company says hosts in these categories will go through verification and quality checks that include their experience, online presence, education, and required licenses. And, if travelers already have an upcoming trip booked, the app will suggest related experiences or services. Airbnb is also preparing to roll out social features later this year. The app today has a group messaging feature for trip planning, but it plans to add a group chat feature for people who have been to an experience together. That way, they can talk about the experience, share photos and videos, or make recommendations for another trip. The company says it's developing privacy features around these social connections to create a safe experience for users. The social features follow last year's launch of an updated profile page, which allowed users to describe more about themselves, including where they live, languages they speak, and other facts about themselves. There is especially, in this moment of time, a desire to connect with other people.” Mirroring comments made by Chesky, Coplan noted how Airbnb is using AI to provide customer service, and how, over time, its AI assistant will become a concierge that can handle trip planning and inspiration. Earlier this month, Chesky introduced Airbnb's AI-powered customer service agent. Later this year, the feature will become available to more countries and languages, Coplan told TechCrunch. Over time, he says Airbnb will add more features to its AI assistant, including personalized answers tailored to your trip and booking, and in-line action buttons for taking quick actions, such as canceling a booking.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On November 17, 2023, the board of OpenAI fired company CEO Sam Altman. His friend Chesky leapt into action—publicly defending his pal on X, getting on the phone with Microsoft's CEO, and throwing himself into the thick of Altman's battle to retake OpenAI. Five days later Altman prevailed, and Chesky—“I was so jacked up,” he says—turned his buzzing mind to his own company, Airbnb. The Chesky extended family had already held their turkey get-together a week earlier, and the Airbnb CEO had no holiday plan. Still wired out of his mind from the cathartic corporate rescue, Chesky began to write. Chesky had long believed that Airbnb should expand in a similar way. But things kept getting in the way—dealing with safety issues, fighting regulation, coping with the existential crisis of a global pandemic. Now Chesky was emboldened to lay out his vision. Home rentals are simply a service, so why stop there? Airbnb could be the platform for booking all sorts of services. While other apps cover specific sectors—food delivery, home maintenance, car rides—Chesky figured that Airbnb's experience in attractively displaying homes, vetting hosts, and responding to crises could make it more trustworthy than competitors and therefore the go-to option for virtually anything. Its users—now at 2 billion—would open up the app not only at vacation time but whenever they needed to find a portrait photographer, a personal trainer, or someone to cook their meals. Chesky reasoned that Airbnb would need to significantly strengthen its identity verification. If he could transform Airbnb into a storefront for real-world services, Chesky thought, he'd catapult his company from a nearly $10-billion-a-year business into one that boasted membership in tech's pantheon. Over the next few days, Chesky spilled these thoughts into an Evernote document. “I was basically going from room to room just pouring out this stream-of-consciousness manifesto, like Jack Kerouac writing On the Road,” he says, referring to the frenetically produced single roll of teletype paper that catalyzed the beat movement. “I dusted off all my ideas from 2012 to 2016,” Chesky tells me. '” By Friday he had around 10,000 words, “incomprehensible to anyone but me.” He began to refine it, and by the time the weekend was over, Chesky had distilled his document down to 1,500 words. After the holiday, Chesky gathered his leadership team into a conference room. He handed the team copies of his memo à la Jeff Bezos and waited as his direct reports took it in. “Usually when I share ideas, people aren't bought in,” he says. “But this time, there wasn't a lot of feedback. And two years later, that document will now be executed with an exacting detail to what I wrote.” After that comes a deep immersion into AI: Inspired by his relationship with Altman, Chesky hopes to build the ultimate agent, a super-concierge who starts off handling customer service and eventually knows you well enough to plan your travel and maybe the rest of your life. “Brian's been badly underrated as a tech CEO,” Altman says of his friend. “He's not usually mentioned in the same breath as Larry Page or Bill Gates, but I think he is on a path to build as big of a company.” That's a stretch—Airbnb is nowhere near the size of those oligarchic powers. In early April, I visited Chesky at the company's lavish San Francisco headquarters. The second floor—where signs warn employees not to bring visitors—had become a sprawling eyes-only command center. Another so-called principle was “Live and Alive,” referring to music venues and bat watching; a third was “Dam Lakes,” referring to various water sports. Other blindingly obvious notations included barbeque, tacos, and the two-step. The Paris poster painted a “revolutionary” city marked by slow living and enduring culture. Dressed in a slim T-shirt that exposed his swole physique, he bounced on his heels with a jittery energy that reminded me of the first time I met him, in January 2009. He had just joined Y Combinator's famous program for startups, and he and his classmates were at a party at the home of YC cofounder Paul Graham. His engineers and designers have rebuilt the app from scratch, and he waves around a stick of lip balm as a talisman as he talks me through the redesign. Also in the room is his product marketing head, Jud Coplan, while his vice president of design, Teo Connor, Zooms in from London. Which makes sense; both Chesky and his cofounder Joe Gebbia were students at the Rhode Island School of Design. Chesky explains that historically, people used Airbnb only once or twice a year, so its design had to be exceptionally simple. Now the company is retooling for more frequent access. Within minutes Chesky and his lieutenants are applauding the cheery, retro style of the icons—a house for traditional rentals, a hotel bell for services, and a Jules Verne-ish hot-air balloon representing activities. The icons were drawn by a former Apple designer whose name Chesky would not divulge. A less-secret weapon is Chesky's collaboration with the iconic, also ex-Apple, industrial designer Jony Ive. Chesky's north star, it should be said, is Apple. “Steve Jobs, to me, is like Michelangelo or da Vinci,” he says. By hiring Ive's LoveFrom company and working with Jobs' key collaborator, Chesky gets a taste of the famous Jobs/Ive dynamic. “There are certain tactical things where I hope that sometimes I'm of use to Brian, just as as a fellow designer,” Ive says. Airbnb has been vetting the new vendors, which it calls “service hosts.” For months, Chesky says, an army of background researchers has been scrutinizing the résumés, licenses, and recommendations of chefs, photographers, manicurists, masseuses, hair stylists, makeup artists, personal trainers, and aestheticians who provide spa treatments such as facials and microdermabrasions. For the next phase—turning Airbnb's user profiles into a primary internet ID—Connor and her team have engaged in some far-out experimentation. She rattles off a list of technologies they've been exploring, including biometrics, holograms, and the reactive inks used to deter counterfeiting on official ID cards. But it's far from easy to become a private identity utility (hello, Facebook), and even Chesky notes that getting governments to accept an Airbnb credential to verify identity is “a stretch goal.” Now that a whole slew of people will have new reasons to chat with each other and coordinate plans, Airbnb has also enhanced its messaging functions. “I don't know if I want to call it a social network, because of the stigma associated with it,” says Ari Balogh, Airbnb's CTO. “We think of it as a connection platform,” he says. “You're going to see us build a lot more stuff on top of it, although we're not an advertising system, thank goodness.” (My own observation is that any for-profit company that can host advertising will, but whatever.) Those now on offer seem designed to augment an Airbnb stay with all the stuff that drives up your bill at a luxury resort, like a DIY White Lotus. It will be interesting to see how the company handles the inevitable cases of food poisoning or bad haircuts (and skeezy customers), but Airbnb can draw on its 17 years of experience with dirty sheets, all-night discos on the ground floor, or a host who is literally terrorizing you. Eventually, Chesky says, Airbnb will offer “hundreds” of services, perhaps as far-ranging as plumbing, cleaning, car repair, guitar lessons, and tutoring, and then take its 15 percent fee. If the idea sounds familiar, that's because Airbnb launched a service by that name almost a decade ago, with pretty much the same pitch: special activities for travelers, like architects leading tours of buildings or chefs showing people how to fold dumplings. It flopped, although Airbnb never formally pulled the plug. Chesky's excuses include tactical errors: After a big initial splash, the company didn't follow up with more marketing, and it didn't establish a strong flow of new experiences. “It was like our Newton,” says Chesky, referring to Apple's handheld device that predated the iPhone. Chesky's crew has arranged for more than 22,000 experiences in 650 cities, including a smattering of so-called “originals,” with people at the top of their field—star athletes, Michelin chefs, famous celebrities. Taking a lesson from his earlier flop, Chesky has planned a steady cadence of these short-term promotional stunts, which, of course, is what the Conan experience ultimately is. He shows me how someone could take a trip to, say, Mexico City and book experiences instantly. “Fun fact—I've always dreamed of being a professional wrestler in Mexico. I want to be a luchador!” he tells me, then immediately regrets it. Regardless: In an Airbnb experience, he says, you can meet a real luchador, get in the ring with him, and learn some moves. Airbnb's planned transformation tracks with another reinvention: that of its leader. Chesky had originally taken the title of CEO over his two pretty-much equal cofounders because his personality was more forward facing—it wasn't even formalized until 2010. But then, in 2011, the company had its first real crisis when a host publicly shared a horror story about how an Airbnb guest from deep, deep hell pillaged and trashed her home. What wasn't stolen—the customer broke into a locked closet to grab a passport, cash, and heirloom jewelry—was ravaged and burned in the fireplace. It didn't help that Airbnb's initial response was clueless and weak. Over the next few years, Chesky cemented his alpha status. In 2018 his cofounder Joe Gebbia stepped down from daily duties, though he still sits on the board. When asked about it at a Q and A session with employees, Chesky said that Gebbia was free to have his own opinions, but they are not the company's. The third cofounder, Nathan Blecharczyk, is still with the company, though it's notable that as I sat in meetings with over a dozen executives, the only time his name came up was when I mentioned it. Now that bookings surpass pre-2020 levels, he thinks the company is stronger. “My first principle became ‘Don't apologize for how you want to run your company.' Most of all you should not apologize for being in the details. When Chesky shared some of these views at a Y Combinator event in 2024, Paul Graham was inspired to write an essay called “Founder Mode.” Graham used Chesky's story to argue that only the person who created a company knows what is best, and the worst mistake is to listen to management types who haven't built their own. The essay struck a nerve; people were stopping Chesky on the street and yelling “Founder mode!” Someone dropped off a baseball hat for him with those words; it now sits on a shelf in his conference room. Chesky, meanwhile, has been deep in the details, especially on this reinvention, itself kind of a classic founder move. “I did review work before the pandemic, but people kind of hated it. There were negative associations to a CEO reviewing everything; it's considered micromanaging.” Also, his idol Steve Jobs was famous—infamous?—for his unsparing criticism. Chesky contends that once he went all-in on dishing out criticism, with no sheepishness, people seemed happier. But even if they weren't, he'd do it anyway. Gathered in a conference room, the design and engineering teams presented near-final app tweaks affecting how hosts set up their services. Chesky seemed fairly pleased with what he was seeing—so much so that he apologized to me afterward that I didn't get to see him go animal with his underlings. The cursor is oddly centered … Those visual cues are a little confusing … We need a subtle drop shadow here … The next line doesn't seem centered vertically … That address input is pretty awkward … That button looks oddly short, is it supposed to be that short? Get rid of it … That top module doesn't make sense … We need to rewrite all the copy on this page … I think we need a better empty state … That title's not clear … The group shuffles out satisfied and a bit stunned that they got away so easy. But when I meet Chesky a day later to sum things up, he tells me that I'd just missed a spicier product review. Then he gets serious, explaining what the reinvention means to him. “I felt a little bit like the vacation rental guy,” he says. That said, his day dreams certainly involve a new kind of device. In his off hours he's helping with a secret project headed by his friends Altman and Ive to create a device that Altman says is the next step beyond computers. In the realm of products that actually exist in the world, Chesky will have to face competition from dozens of domain leaders including Yelp, Instacart, DoorDash, Ticketmaster, Hotels.com, Tinder, OpenTable, and Craigslist, to name but a few. You can probably add Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, since Chesky wants Airbnb to be a universal credential and what certainly looks like a social network. Let us know what you think about this article.

While PCIe 5.0 drives utilizing this high-performance controller are expected to be available later this year, Tom's Hardware has obtained an exclusive preview of the E28's capabilities. The tests evaluate everyday tasks, such as opening specific applications or games, and copying files of different formats from one destination to another. Although the results originate from a thoroughly vetted and trustworthy source, we advise exercising caution when interpreting them. It was approximately 18% quicker than the Samsung 9100 Pro and Micron 4600. The PCMark 10 storage benchmark also yielded two additional metrics worth examining. The software assessed each SSD's bandwidth and average access times. A higher score indicates better bandwidth performance, whereas a lower score is preferred for access times. The sequential performance difference between the Samsung Presto and Phison E28 controllers appears minimal on paper. The former has a 2% faster sequential read, and the latter has an 8% faster sequential write. The type of NAND is a huge differentiator. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The former leverages Micron 276-layer B68S FortisFlash NAND clocked at 3,600 MT/s, whereas the latter utilizes Micron 232-layer B58R FortisFlash at 2,400 MT/s. We cannot definitively declare a winner based solely on a single benchmark, and it would be wrong to do so. SSD controllers or SSDs in general may exhibit strong performance on specific workloads while demonstrating underperformance in others. Reviews hold significant value as they evaluate across a variety of workloads. As far as PCMark 10 is concerned, the Phison E28 appears superior to the Samsung Presto and Silicon Motion SM2508. Other manufacturers of SSD controllers, such as InnoGrit (commonly referred to as Yingren Technology in China), Marvell, and Maxio, are also present. Nonetheless, the competition for the leading PCIe 5.0 SSD controller primarily lies among the big three (Phison, Samsung, and Silicon Motion) unless InnoGrit presents a more competitive offering. Currently, Phison, with its E28 model, seems to possess a competitive advantage over the competition. Zhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google I/O is on May 20, but the annual developer conference will be so jam-packed with announcements that Google is opening the valve to release some news early. Some of these features will arrive first on Pixel phones later this summer—presumably Google's Pixel 10 series—but most will be a part of the big annual Android update, which is expected to arrive earlier than usual this year, in June. The last major redesign was four years ago when Material 3 debuted. Expressive is the “most researched update," through 46 studies with more than 18,000 participants. Google claims the expressive language sprinkled throughout the operating system is preferred by people of all ages, scoring high on attributes like playfulness, energy, creativity, and friendliness. You can expect subtle animation changes when you dismiss an app in the Recents menu, play around with the volume slider, or even when you bring down the quick settings shade—you'll see a blur effect over your home screen. Much of it is functional too—Google's letting you squeeze more settings into the Quick Settings drawer, so you can quickly access tools like the Flashlight or Do Not Disturb mode. Android 16 also takes a cue from Apple's Live Activities features, pinning ongoing notifications from apps like DoorDash, Uber, or Google Maps on the lock screen so you don't have to keep hopping into the app to check. Google says the animations are fluid while offering more depth, and buttons hug the display to make them more space-efficient and easily tappable. It's not just design changes in the wearable operating system update—power and performance optimizations mean existing devices that get the update will see a 10 percent battery boost. Apple is also expected to introduce a major redesign to its phone, tablet, and Mac operating systems during its WWDC developer conference on June 9. The main news ahead of Google I/O is that Gemini will replace Assistant on more platforms beyond just Android phones. In the coming months, Gemini will be the default voice assistant in Wear OS 6, Android Auto, cars with Google Built-in, Google TV, and Android XR. “Gemini can find you a charging station on the way to the post office that's also near a park, so that you can go for a walk before your errands while your car is charging.” It also supports Gemini Live, so you can have a free-flowing back-and-forth conversation with the assistant in the car. On Wear OS, you'll be able to ask Gemini to remember things on your behalf, and since Gemini can connect directly to apps, you can ask specific details about an email a friend sent and get the answer on the watch. Gemini on platforms like Wear OS and Android Auto uses the same models as what's on Android phones and will require an internet connection. That blocking prowess is making its way further into native Android. For example, if you're on a call on any phone running Android 16 with somebody who isn't in your contacts list, the phone will now block specific actions like disabling Google Play Protect, app sideloading, and granting accessibility permissions—actions that can help scammers access sensitive data stored on your phone. If you're on the phone with someone and sharing your screen with them, Android will prompt you to stop sharing when the call ends. Google's also piloting in-call protections for banking apps starting in the UK—you'll get a warning when you open a banking app while screen sharing and on the phone. Google says its on-device Scam Detection tech in the Google Messages texting app can now spot more text scams, from crypto to toll road scams. The company says it is using on-device AI to accomplish this. Within Google Messages, there's also a new Key Verifier tool so you and the other party can verify each other using public encryption keys, by scanning a QR code or number comparison in the Google Contacts app. And one-time passcodes will be hidden from your lock screen in high-risk environments, like when you're not connected to Wi-Fi and haven't recently unlocked your phone. In 2024, Google added some major updates that allowed offline devices and select phones with dead batteries to be tracked, and widened support to third-party trackers. More importantly, every Android phone can now help anonymously search for other people's missing gadgets, much like how Apple's system works. So the Find Hub name change makes sense—the app is no longer just for your devices, as loved ones can share their location so you can make sure they got home fine. Google says more third-party tracker support is on the way, from an integration with Peak to find lost skis, to upcoming ultra-wideband support with the Moto Tag from Motorola. Later this year, Find Hub will integrate satellite connectivity on compatible devices, and you'll be able to share your Bluetooth tracker's location with select airlines in 2026, a feature available with AirTags and iPhones.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Material 3 Expressive brings new springy animations that Google says will make your phone feel more fluid. You will see similar sorts of animation and feel haptics when you're doing things like dismissing an app in your recent apps screen, fidgeting with the volume slider, or flinging down the shade. In addition, you can now customize Quick Settings to add more of your favorite actions, such as Flashlight and Do Not Disturb. Android's new Live Updates feature will also help you easily track progress notifications from select apps. For example, if you place an Uber Eats order, you will start to see a glanceable Live Update to see the real-time progress of your order. With glanceable live updates, you can easily track your order and get back to real life. These real time updates from your favorite delivery, rideshare, and navigation apps are coming as part of the redesign later this year.” All of these new design improvements will first come to Pixel devices later this year with Android 16. As for Wear OS watches, Material 3 Expressive's design is more fluid with scrolling animations that trace the circular display. Just like on phones, the new design language will bring a sense of depth. “Now, the theme you choose for your watch face can theme the entire system in Google Apps so you can make it your own. And when it comes to getting things done, glanceability is one of the most important considerations for watch we've created a system of buttons that truly hug the display, making them that much more tappable and space efficient using an underlying polar grid.” These changes will be rolling out to the Pixel Watch first later this year with Wear OS 6.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than $470 million was stolen in scams that started with a text message last year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. And as the biggest mobile operating system maker in the world, Google has been scrambling to do something, building out tools to warn consumers about potential scams. Ahead of Google's Android 16 launch next week, the company said on Tuesday that it is expanding its recently launched AI flagging feature for the Google Messages app, known as Scam Detection, to provide alerts on potentially nefarious messages like possible crypto scams, financial impersonation, gift card and prize scams, technical support scams, and more. Combined with other AI security features for Google Messages—all of which run locally on users' devices and do not share data or message content with the company—Android is now detecting roughly 2 billion suspicious messages a month. “The fraud is truly heartbreaking,” says Dave Kleidermacher, vice president of engineering at Android's security and privacy division. Scammers operate all over the world, but Chinese scam groups particularly are behind millions of fraudulent messages, demanding things like “toll” payments or information for alleged postal service deliveries. In some cases, the scams are designed as a sort of smash-and-grab, where attackers quickly trick users into giving up some crumbs of information, like a pair of login credentials or a credit card number. The more complex challenge is in detecting highly involved investment or romance scams—often called pig butchering scams—that build and evolve over months of messaging while scammers build a rapport with their targets before tricking them into handing over their life savings or even going into debt to send more money. In a screenshot of the Scam Detection feature provided by Google, an encrypted RSC chat shows a typical scam message saying an EZ Pass toll payment is outstanding. The British telecom company O2, for example, created an “AI Granny” that is set up to keep scammers on the phone and waste their time. And the online scam baiter Kitboga has created a series of bots to make simultaneous calls to call centers that run scams. Meanwhile, in recent months, Meta, which owns WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, has started to introduce pop-up warnings when people are asked to make payments in chat messages. Elsewhere, cybersecurity company F-Secure has created a beta tool to help people identify if a message and sender are likely scammers and block messages. Putting a layer of friction in place that nudges people away from messaging accounts they don't know or replying to messages asking for details can reduce the chances that scammers are successful. Google's Kleidermacher says that the company is seeing “really positive impact” from using its machine learning systems to detect potential scam messages in real time. For now, some of that expansion is starting within Google's own products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former SpaceX employee Douglas Altshuler is taking aim at the Musk-owned company in a new federal discrimination lawsuit. The suit alleges that Altshuler's employers threatened to fire him for taking frequent bathroom breaks, even after he told them that he had Crohn's disease. According to the lawsuit, first obtained by The Independent last week, Altshuler was hired to handle customer support calls at SpaceX's Redmond, Washington, facility in June 2023. Altshuler reportedly provided his supervisor with a doctor's letter explaining that he has Crohn's disease, a form of chronic inflammatory bowel disease that often forces people to use the bathroom frequently, particularly during active flare-ups. Scientists Uncover Potential Major Cause of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Altshuler claims that he asked and was given assurance by two supervisors for a reasonable accommodation to use the bathroom as needed. Altshuler says he then pleaded his case to higher-ups at SpaceX, which reportedly led to retaliation from his supervisor during his next performance review; the lawsuit claims that the supervisor “alleged performance deficiencies which were never brought to [Altshuler's] attention before.” Though Altshuler was assigned to a new supervisor in October 2024, his issues reportedly continued. Altshuler alleges that he was potentially exposed to chemicals in November from “industrial parts being dried in the kitchen oven where employees cook their food.” He reported the incident to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and filed a worker's compensation claim over it as well. Afterward, he claims that he was further retaliated against, with his new supervisor reportedly threatening to fire him for using the bathroom “too often.” In early January, Altshuler was allegedly told by Human Resources at SpaceX that his “concerns of retaliation were unsubstantiated.” Soon after, on January 9, 2025, he was fired, reportedly for “alleged deficient performance.” This isn't the first time that former employees at SpaceX have alleged mistreatment and retaliation from the company's management. In January 2024, the National Labor Relations Board accused SpaceX of illegally firing eight employees after they began to circulate a letter in 2022 calling for SpaceX to distance itself from Elon Musk's behavior and comments at the time, which included allegedly sexually harassing employees at the company. These employees have since filed their own lawsuit in California State Court against Musk. Musk has also fired employees at X, formerly Twitter, since taking over ownership of the social media company. In speaking with The Independent, Altshuler's lawyers argue that his firing is a clear-cut case of discrimination against him for his disability, as well as an example of retaliation against him for trying to speak up about it. Altshuler has further claimed that he was often required to skip his meal breaks and work long hours without added pay.

Galaxy S25 Edge is Samsung's latest addition to its flagship line, and it is the thinnest and lightest flagship smartphone the company has ever produced. That “double the storage” offer is a Samsung hallmark launch discount, and it saves early adopters big money from day one. On top of that, you get a further $50 knocked off (“instant credit” which drops the price to $1,049. Cumulatively, these launch offers together equate to a total of $800 in savings which is over 65% below the standard price. This is a great opportunity, and you won't find any better deals on this phone until probably Black Friday. For example, the Galaxy Watch Ultra would cost you just $357 when it would cost $649 elsewhere, which is a discount of $300. These accessory bargains are so good that if you actually resell them, you can reasonably expect to earn back most of the cost of your new S25 Edge. Technically, the Galaxy S25 Edge does not really compromise on performance despite its incredibly thin build. It boasts a 200MP camera sensor borrowed from the S25 Ultra that provides excellent photo and video quality (especially in dark environments) thanks to advanced AI enhancements. The display is similar to that of the Galaxy S25+ with vivid colors, deep blacks and a high refresh rate for ultra-smooth scrolling and gaming. Galaxy S25 Edge's intro deal is probably one of the best we've ever seen in history: double storage space for same dollars, savings up to $800 total, and deep reductions on accessories. With its really thin profile, the Galaxy S25 Edge is the perfect choice for anyone interested in a stylish phone – especially if you're not into foldable phones like the stylish Galaxy Z Flip 6.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TechCrunch has seen one email message sent from an Indiana government department that claimed the recipient had an outstanding toll balance, and contained a disguised link that redirected to a malicious site. A statement from the Indiana Office of Technology said it was “working with the company that was used to deliver those messages to stop any further communication.” Indiana said a contractor's account was hacked and used to send the scam messages. When reached for comment, Granicus spokesperson Sharon Rushen told TechCrunch: “We are aware of the recent malicious emails sent via GovDelivery from Indiana's government domain.” The company confirmed the breach was caused by a compromised user account, but did not comment on Indiana's claims. Fake toll messages are an increasingly common scam, as the Federal Trade Commission warned in January. The scam email contained a link, which appears as an official govdelivery.com web address, but when clicked redirects to a malicious site impersonating the website of Texas' Department of Transport's road toll collection service, TxTag.

We don't know why this change has been made, however, there are some fascinating implications regarding what you might call mismatched hardware. For example, tech enthusiast Bob Pony observed that due to this driver change, "you could possibly pair an [Nvidia GeForce] RTX 5090 with [an Intel] Core 2 Duo." UPDATE: Recent NVIDIA drivers no longer require the POPCNT CPU instruction, this means old CPUs such as the Intel Core 2 Duo will be able to install the latest NVIDIA drivers without any issues.And yes, that also means you could possibly pair an RTX 5090 with Core 2 Duo now. In Pony's screenshot (unfurl the post embedded above) you can see what appears to be an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650 processor powered system running a version of Windows 11 Pro. However, Pony asserts that the latest Nvidia driver, version 576.40 which was released just yesterday, now plays nicely with systems packing old Core 2 Duo CPUs (introduced 2006) which lack POPCNT support. In fact, unfortunate users trying such an installation might face a 'soft brick' and have to wait through a number of boot loops before being able to recover Windows startup. Processors use it to determine how many bits are actively set in a given binary number. Notably, it is part of the SSE4.2 instruction set. Given that you have to go back more than a decade and a half to find processors without native POPCNT support, it doesn't really concern anyone who wants a practical workmanlike PC for typical 2025 workloads. POPCNT may seem like an obscure processor instruction, but it has been in the news previously, with popular software insisting upon it being supported by the system CPU. Case in point - Microsoft's Windows 11 24H2 introduced a requirement for POPCNT hardware support. That change came to light around a year ago, and alongside other requirements such as tech as secure boot and TPM support, it ruled out a host of older CPU generations from official Windows 11 OS compatibility.

AMD on Tuesday introduced its Zen 5-based EPYC 4005-series processors aimed at entry-level uniprocessor servers for small businesses, edge deployments, and hosting providers. AMD's EPYC 4005-series 'Grado' CPUs come in an AM5 form factor and feature up to 16 cores and 32 threads in a bid to offer maximum performance within the framework of the default Windows Server 2025 license, which base price covers CPUs with up to 16 cores. AMD's EPYC 4005-series processors resemble the company's Ryzen 9000 processors and therefore carry two eight-core Zen 5 core complex dies (CCDs) with 8 MB of L2 cache (1 MB per core) and 32 MB of unified L3 cache as well as one I/O die. In addition, the flagship EPYC 4585PX model features 64 MB of 3D V-Cache. When it comes to security, the new EPYC 'Grado' platform offers a dedicated processor with TrustZone compatibility and support for secure boot, TPM 2.0, and memory encryption capabilities. Just like AMD's Ryzen 9000-series processors, EPYC 9005 processors feature 28 PCIe 5.0 lanes (four are used to connect to the chipset), software RAID 0, 1, 5, 10; DisplayPort 2.0; HDMI 2.1; USB 20G Type-C; and optional USB4. "With the latest AMD EPYC 4005 series CPUs, we are delivering the right balance of performance, simplicity, and affordability, giving our customers and system partners the ability to deploy enterprise-class solutions that solve everyday business challenges." AMD aims its EPYC 4005 CPUs at diverse workloads, from small businesses, branch, and storage servers to dedicated systems for tasks like video editing, code compilation, cloud gaming, and e-commerce. Essentially, EPYC 4005-series processors can be used for all performance-demanding tasks that also require robust security and extended availability. As a result, AMD's offerings provide tangibly higher performance across the board. Performance benchmarks conducted by AMD using the Phoronix test suite show that AMD's 16-core EPYC 4565P outperforms Intel's eight-core Xeon 6369P by a factor of 1.83.

AMD says that its EPYC 4005-series processors will be available from leading server OEMs, cloud service providers, and retailers, including Altos, ASRock Rack, Gigabyte, Lenovo, MiTAC, MSI, Newegg, OVHcloud, Supermicro, and Vultr. Systems with AMD's Grado CPUs will be available in a variety of form factors to meet the requirements of diverse clientele. Pricing of the new CPUs varies from $289 to $699.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Part soundbar, part home theater in a box (HTB), the System 6 eschews the status quo of single-bar solutions with fancy Dolby Atmos speakers and networking features for a callback to budget home theaters of yesteryear. The system's collection of 5.1 surround components includes a beefy subwoofer, two tall and musical surround speakers, and a small center soundbar that performs much better than you'd expect based on its thin frame and mundane design. The mostly wired configuration feels more Vizio than Sony, while its layout evokes '90s A/V vibes. Without Wi-Fi, the System 6 is a pain to update and misses out on modern extras like smart assistants and Apple AirPlay, but features like Sony's virtual 3D surround engine and controller app give you more to work with than vintage plug-and-play solutions. Most importantly, the System 6's cinematic oomph is a blast for movies, gaming, and everything in between. The System 6 may be all-in-one, but it's still something of a bear to set up, starting with lugging the massive L-shaped box into your TV room. Flipping open the side reveals a sprawling collection of components, including five main pieces, dual power cables, and flat-wire cables for connecting the surrounds and main bar. It's all pretty intuitive, but you'll want to block out some solid setup time. Props to Sony for including the same attachable soundbar feet found in its flagship Bravia Theater 9 to help it sit above TV stands All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The sub is the system's anchor in more ways than one, offering serious thunder from its 15-inch tall cabinet, the lone LED display, and an input hub for optical, 3.5-mm analog (a rarity these days), and HDMI eARC. Unfortunately, there's no spare HDMI input to connect a game console or other video sources directly. The Bravia Connect app walks you through the main setup, including ensuring the system properly reads your TV over HDMI eARC to control power and volume with your TV remote. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The app makes it easy to balance the well-matched components, adjust settings, or swap to Bluetooth streaming once you've paired your phone. Not long after setup, the app notified me of an update to fix a short audio delay when starting a show or movie and minor lip sync issues (which I didn't notice). Instead of an app-based update, Sony continues the old-school theme, making you download a zip file onto a USB drive and follow multiple steps. Newer units will ship with the latest software, but this doesn't exactly bode well for future updates. It has taut detail, foundational bass, and surprisingly adept surround speakers. The System 6 does a bang-up job immersing you in sound with fluid handoff between the bar and surrounds, and burly power from the sub that brings every explosion, gunshot, roaring engine, or rhythmic soundtrack home. It's not as musical or articulate as the fancy Sonos Sub 4, sometimes getting too boomy, but turning it down a few notches worked wonders in my room. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It supports virtually every major sound format, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and clicking the Soundfield button on the remote or app with supported content notably changes the vibe. You won't hear pointed overhead effects like with true upfiring speakers, but it's a nice option. You can even see the format change from 5.1 or 7.1 to Dolby Atmos or DTS:X with Soundfield engaged. I don't recommend using it for regular surround or stereo content, especially music, which is the System 6's weak point. Streaming from your phone sounds good for most genres, but like a lot of surround configurations, the system is at its best when fed cinematic content, even if it's just the laugh track in a sitcom or a well-mixed sporting event. I had a similarly transportative experience playing the new co-op game Split Fiction, which served up a feast of potent effects, immersive environments, and traceable enemies to help my wife and me navigate the landscape. Sony's System 6 is more of a hassle than many of the best soundbars, and I'm still annoyed by my firmware failures. Conversely, for its nearly $800 cost, you could get a more traditional home theater setup, like this one from Klipsch. Still, the System 6 is more convenient and compact than multi-speaker setups, filling its own niche with thrilling cinematics in a fun and approachable package. Sometimes it pays to zig when everybody else zags. If you are after an aesthetic and great-sounding system for your living room, it's worth considering.

The AOC Q27G4ZD has a few flaws in its HDR component but it leaves nothing under the table when it comes to performance. Premium OLED black levels and contrast deliver a crisp image Excellent video processing for smooth motion and quick response In many OLED gaming monitor reviews, I've spoken about their consistent performance and image quality. In the 27-inch QHD 240 Hz category, you can expect to pay at least $550 to 600, with the best OLED gaming monitors approaching $800. I'm not here to tell you that AOC has smashed price barriers, but its newest QD-OLED, the Q27G4ZD, is a bit less damaging to one's wallet, selling for $469 at this writing. Despite only being slightly less expensive than its competitors, the Q27G4ZD is a value bomb. The panel is QHD 2560x1440 resolution running at a native (not overclocked) 240 Hz. It also has Quantum Dot technology, and my tests show that it covers over 108% of the DCI-P3 color gamut thanks to some bonus red and green. It also includes G-Sync and FreeSync, with seamless operation observed in my tests. It also has USB ports, something rarely seen on budget displays. Nothing is missing here unless LED lighting and internal speakers are essential to you. One thing I did not find here was variable brightness. When an OLED has variable brightness, output levels change based on content. This makes for bright highlights, but black levels do not change. Since it's an OLED, contrast is the same whether you have variable brightness or not. But when you want the most from HDR content, variable brightness lends some extra pop. But it still looks amazing since its black levels are infinite and color is highly saturated. And like all OLEDs, its gaming feel is at the next level. 240 Hz is well above the threshold needed for blur-free motion. And QHD resolution presents a lighter load for video cards, so you'll have less trouble maintaining 240fps in your favorite games. There is no black frame insertion or anti-flicker feature, but in my time with the Q27G4ZD, I saw no need for either option. On paper, the price/performance ratio here is exceptionally high. The Q27G4ZD doesn't represent a massive price drop, but its cost of $469 at this writing is around $100 less than its closest competitors. You can buy a nice gaming mouse with that. The Q27G4ZD comes in a clamshell box that opens to reveal its contents packed securely in molded pulp rather than crumbly foam. Up first is a nice cable bundle with HDMI, DisplayPort, USB and IEC for the internal power supply. There's a small base, then you'll find the upright and panel underneath. I rarely see a new styling element on a computer monitor, but AOC has managed one with its offset cable hole. The back features angular styling, and you won't find a curve or taper anywhere. It's a great gaming monitor look that whispers rather than screams for attention. There are two version 3.2 ports on the right side, two more on the bottom, and an upstream port as well for full hub functionality. Movements are very firm with no play or wobble. The bottom input panel features one DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 ports. A 3.5mm jack accommodates headphones or powered speakers with volume and mute in the OSD. The Q27G4ZD's OSD is loaded with features for gaming and convenience. It departs from AOC's traditional ribbon menu and presents a more familiar tree with three columns. Signal info is always displayed up top and button functions are at the bottom. Additional options in the Game Setting menu include Shadow Control to brighten dark areas, Adaptive-Sync toggle, Dial Point (aiming point), Sniper Scope with three magnification levels and a Frame Counter that can live in any corner of the screen. The Picture menu contains full calibration controls with five gamma presets, three color temps, and a user mode with RGB sliders. You can also select between Native, sRGB, and DCI-P3 color spaces. Native covers 108% of DCI-P3 and is the only way to keep other picture adjustments available. sRGB and DCI-P3 are very accurate, but only allow brightness changes. There's also Eco Adjustment, which is another set of picture modes. Combined with the Gaming Mode, it can yield dozens of possibilities. It's reasonably effective but does depart from industry standards for gamma. They enhance some content, but should be used with personal preference in mind rather than accuracy. Despite their names, they both render the same peak output, around 250 nits. Display HDR tracks very well, and I'll tell you more about it on page five. AOC takes the Q27G4ZD's OLED panel care very seriously with eight different settings that can be used altogether, all turned off, or in any combination desired. I only use pixel orbiting for my OLED screens, which have never shown signs of burn-in. It can be enjoyed as is, though neutral tones are a tad warm. Gamma measured a tad light, but the presets are too far apart to get it right on 2.2. In all cases, color is spot on with a little extra red and green that makes the picture vibrant and lively. If you need sRGB or a more exact DCI-P3, those modes are provided but without calibration control. Reds and greens are particularly vivid, and you can tell the difference right away when comparing them to a non-QD OLED or a wide gamut LCD. The image is super crisp, even though it's QHD. 109ppi pixel density is plenty for a 27-inch screen and I had little trouble making out the finest details in text and graphics alike. Video processing is also on par with other OLEDs. I often talk about their consistency and that means you won't get better motion resolution or faster response just because you spend more money. QHD resolution makes high frame rates easy to achieve and I never saw anything but 240fps in the games I played. The Q27G4ZD lacks extra features like anti-flicker and black frame insertion, but they were not missed. Control response is perceptually free of lag, and I expect there will be no gamer who doesn't like this monitor. Like any OLED, it's capable of next-level gameplay. I noted that HDR content was slightly undersaturated in red. This was confirmed in my tests, which you can check out on page five. Even though the Q27G4ZD is fully capable of going beyond 100% red in the DCI-P3 color space, it doesn't quite get there in HDR mode. It would be good for AOC to address this with a firmware update. I've already mentioned the Q27G4ZD's lack of a variable brightness option. This didn't impact my use experience at all. HDR had plenty of impact but there, it would be nice to have the extra pop in highlights afforded by variable brightness. Physically, the Q27G4ZD gives nothing away to its more expensive competition. The bits of red trim are just enough to make it work aesthetically. And the extra side USB ports are a nice bonus that few monitors include today. It has enough brightness, pixel density and color saturation to match image quality with the very best and, in some cases, for half the price. It truly doesn't get much better in the 27-inch category. Christian Eberle is a Contributing Editor for Tom's Hardware US. He's a veteran reviewer of A/V equipment, specializing in monitors.

Sandisk has just unveiled its brand new WD Black NVMe SSD, which it says is the world's fastest PCIe Gen 5.0 NVMe SSD on the market. Not only is it rapid, but Sandisk says the Gen 5.0 model is 100% more power efficient than its PCIe Gen 4.0 SSD. The new SN8100 also features Sandisk BiCS8 TLC 3D CBA NAND technology, which brings a lower profile and should improve thermal performance. Sandisk also promises 2,300,000 IOPS of random performance on the 2TB and 4TB models, all while averaging just 7W of power draw. Coming later this fall will be a heatsink version for each capacity costing $20 more, and the 8TB versions are expected to be available later this year. The heatsink version offers a new integrated, low-profile passive cooling design built from anodized aluminum and also features customizable RGB LED. Naturally, whether the SN8100 stacks up to its touted performance figure remains to be seen, but we'll be sure to bring you our performance results in our full review.

On May 12, Samsung officially unveiled its latest innovation: the Galaxy S25 Edge, an ultra-slim smartphone that (once again) pushes the boundaries of mobile tech and design. Thin as 5.8mm and made from feather-light titanium, the S25 Edge is Samsung's thinnest phone yet but also among the most state-of-the-art in its field. Samsung is also offering a $50 instant rebate which brings the price down to $1,049. The biggest savings come from Samsung's trade-in scheme: trade in a qualifying phone, and you can receive up to $630 credit toward your next S25 Edge. First off, its ultra-slim build differentiates it from a sea of clunky flagships: it measures only 5.8mm thick and weighs a paltry 163 grams, the S25 Edge feels almost ridiculously light and thin in hand but its titanium construction gives it toughness and an air of high-endness. Samsung's design team has managed to achieve this without compromising on key features, and the S25 Edge is the most portable and stylish Galaxy S phone yet. Second, the S25 Edge boasts a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate which unleashes vibrant colors deep blacks, and ultra-smooth scrolling. The near bezel-less design provides maximum screen real estate and Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 offers industry-leading scratch protection. Fourth, the camera hardware remains breathtaking: The 200MP main sensor produces crisp, sharp images, and Samsung's Galaxy AI brings new artistic potential with AI-powered scene awareness and photo editing capabilities. While less forgiving of alternative configurations than the Ultra's camera hardware, it still produces pro-level results for all but a few users. The battery, smaller than on the Ultra but still benefiting from Samsung's efficiency gains, should comfortably last you through a whole day with most users. Thanks to Samsung's pre-order deal, this fantastic Galaxy S25 Edge is now an affordable option for hundreds of dollars less. If you want a phone that stops people in their tracks (and slips into any pocket with ease), there's never been a more desirable time to switch.

I've been reviewing smartphones for a decade, and it's rare for a new device to wow me. But that was the only word that came out of my mouth after I picked up Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge. Preorders are also live, starting at $1,100, with official sales kicking off on May 30. Samsung says this pricing includes the uncertainty on tariffs, so there may be a realm where the phone could have come in under $1,000 before the exorbitant China tariffs. Samsung says it's been wanting to make an ultrathin phone for some time, but it's only now able to achieve this feat without compromising on core features. Various phone makers over the years have dabbled in this space to earn the title of “World's Thinnest Phone”—even earlier this year, we saw a concept device from Tecno that claimed to be a mere 5.75 mm thick. The Galaxy S25 Edge comes very close, measuring 5.8 mm and weighing just 163 grams. For context, the iPhone 16 is 7.8 mm thick and weighs 170 grams—the difference might not sound like much, but remember that the iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch screen; the Edge has a 6.7-inch display, so you're getting far more screen. And you can—Samsung says the Edge will be paired with a new, lighter security bracket at retailers like Best Buy and carrier stores, so interested buyers can get a better sense of the phone without a bulky thing in the way. The phone's edges are so thin that it might affect how you hold it for a long period, because there's just not much for your fingers to grab. But once the wonder of the thinness fades away, you'll start wondering about battery life. It's a laughably small capacity compared to similar-sized phones these days. Still, Samsung says it's done a lot of work to optimize the display's power, and with the efficiency of the 3-nanometer Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset inside, you should get “all-day” battery life. With average use, you can probably eke out a day, but power users may have to tote along a battery pack. Nothing like slimming a phone down, then forcing you to carry around a portable charger. It's worth noting that Samsung isn't using silicon-carbon battery technology, which offers denser batteries in a thinner design found in new devices like the OnePlus 13. This is the big question: Do you want a thin phone? I'd bet most people will say the latter. Samsung says its research found that people who bought its Ultra phones found the phone too big and heavy, but didn't want to downsize to the Galaxy S25+ or S25, as they didn't want to lose out on some features. It also employs Corning's new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, which is similar to what's on the Ultra, minus the anti-reflective coating used to reduce glare. Instead of the usual triple-camera setup on most Samsung flagship phones of the last few years, you get a dual-camera system. All the cameras have autofocus, so you can use macro mode for close-up shots with the ultrawide, and even the selfie camera has a wider field of view, so more people can fit in the frame. Much of the other specs match up with the Galaxy S25 series, including 256 GB of starting storage, 12 GB of RAM, and the Qi2 Ready wireless charging system. This phone can also take advantage of all the same Galaxy AI features and will receive seven years of software updates. As much as Samsung says it's not compromising with the Galaxy S25 Edge, it still is. There's no third or fourth zoom camera here, and battery life likely won't match up to similar-sized peers. Still, if you prefer big phones but hate the associated weight and heft, you now have a new option from Samsung's lineup. Leaks suggest it'll be 5.5 mm thick, one-upping Samsung. Holding the iPhone 17 Air will likely be just as astonishing, but get ready to be disappointed with its battery stats.
