                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With just over a month to go until kickoff at the CONCACAF Gold Cup, U.S. Men's National Team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has seemingly hinted at some impending changes to his roster for the competition. Following the USMNT's disastrous defense of their Nations League title in March, which saw them lose back-to-back games to Panama and Canada to secure a fourth-place finish, the pressure is on for Pochettino to spark some life in his previously listless team. Speaking to CNN ahead of the Gold Cup, which will be preceded by friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, Pochettino explained that the Gold Cup is a major opportunity for his players. “For them, maybe it's a good opportunity for one year before the World Cup to give [them] some rest, because I'm trying not to be involved in these friendly games or in the Gold Cup,” he explained, seemingly referring to his stars. “Or maybe a great opportunity to see players that we are following and we believe that they can add some quality. And yes, I think our knowledge now is much better than a few months ago. Exactly what changes lie ahead for the USMNT remains to be seen, although the wait won't last a great deal longer, with Turkey coming to Rentschler Field in Connecticut on June 7. That being said, assuming their clubs decide to keep hold of them for the Club World Cup, that would rule out Juventus' Weston McKennie and Tim Weah, Borussia Dortmund's Gio Reyna, Inter Miami's Benjamin Cremaschi, and the Seattle Sounders' Jesus Ferreira among others. What's more, with LAFC and Club America set to battle it out for the final spot in the competition, following Club Leon's expulsion, this list of unavailable players could yet grow. Some players who may well have played their way into a more prominent role with the USMNT could include Real Salt Lake's winger Diego Luna, who has scored seven goals in 11 MLS games this season, Vancouver Whitecaps forward Brian White, whose eight goals are a league best, and his teammate Sebastian Berhalter, who has excelled in Vancouver's midfield this season, scoring four goals and prodiving five assists. Looking ahead, Pochettino was also asked what his message to the fans would be, with many having heavily criticized him in recent weeks and months. I think in the next two friendly games and then in the World Cup, I think we need their support,” he said. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Including those launched for England, Nike unveiled new home and away kits for eight different women's national soccer teams this week. The kits were revealed en masse on Wednesday, May 13. According to Nike, the jerseys “bring forward the brand's pinnacle standard of performance apparel in striking uniform designs that speak to the tradition, diversity and championship aspirations of each country and its athletes.” In designing the kits, Nike says it used “overlapping maps with rich data specific to women athletes to guide the placement of mesh and ribbed textures throughout the uniforms — delivering specific performance attributes, such as enhanced stretch or compression, exactly where it's needed most. This approach led to a new side panel, for example, enabling increased stretch, breathability and movement throughout the athlete's core.” All the Nike swooshes and trim on the uniforms are made from Nike Grind, a material composed of “pre-consumer manufacturing scraps, recycled post-consumer shoes and unsellable footwear.” Here's a closer look at each of the kits, along with what Nike had to say about them in their press release: Abstract stars are integrated into lighter, denim-inspired blues, a shift from the classic all-white kit of former teams. A subtle, ribbed texture and classic dark blue and red trims add dimension to the clean, modern lines of the kit. The 2025 secondary kit features a stealth obsidian background. This season, the yellow is updated into a more saturated hue, inspired by Brazil's vibrant wildlife, landscape and architecture, like the Maracanâ stadium in Rio de Janeiro. The 2025 secondary kit incorporates both new and traditional shades of blue in its palette, symbolizing joyful expression and vitality. An all-over print, designed in a diamond grid pattern, includes various geometric and organic shapes, like Jaguar print, tropical plant silhouettes, an interpretation of Brasiliadade (the elegant, harmonious movement on the pitch) and more. A micro-dot treatment, influenced by national art movement of the ‘90s, also nods to the team's famous Total 90 jersey. The 2025 secondary kit draws from a palette that is an elegant contrast to the primary kit, with an arrangement of blue, black, university red, white and game royal. The combination of black ribbing against the white collar are integrated with graphics featuring traditional national motifs like bojagi, stamps and bank notes, reflecting Korea's cultural heritage in a multifaceted way. Neon accents are used across the cuff, neck rib and short. Both the primary and secondary kits bring modern twists to reference the five cardinal colors of Obangsaek in Korean culture. The 2025 secondary kits are inspired by Sokoto's lively streets, using a diverse green palette and stripes to reflect the bold spirit and textures of its local markets. The 2025 primary kit embraces bold, deep reds, complemented by accents of blue and white to create an unmistakable connection to national pride. Throughout the kit's graphics and trims are stylistic nods to traditional methods of Norwegian knitting. The 2025 secondary kit takes as its foundation the creativity of contemporary Norwegian architecture, particularly the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which safeguards hundreds of millions of seeds from every corner of the world to ensure crop diversity for future generations. The 2025 secondary kit is designed to challenge familiar design palettes with a bold, modern design that features an unexpected flood of black, highlighting other features like the Hyper Royale blue numbers, specks of color on the side gusset and a blue crest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Morgan may have retired from playing soccer last year, but she hasn't stepped away from the game by any means. This week, the two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist became the newest minority investor in her former club, San Diego Wave FC. "I believed in Wave FC before a single match was played, and I still believe this club has the power to change the future of women's sports. Morgan, 35, is from Southern California and lives in the San Diego area with her family. She recently gave birth to her second child. Morgan has always been advocate for women's sports and growing the game. The USWNT legend is also an entrepreneur and has made purposeful investments in other sects of women's sports. She's part of a strong group of investors in Unrivaled, the 3-on-3 women's professional basketball league that started earlier this year. And before Morgan retired, she launched the Alex Morgan Foundation and co-founded TOGETHXR, a media company dedicated to the next generation of women's sports. Savy King ‘stable' after collapsing on the field "Savy left the field in stable condition, and currently remains stable and will be undergoing further evaluation," the league said. "League protocols were followed from both a medical and game operations perspective. We are grateful to the Angel City medical staff as well as to local paramedics who handled this difficult situation seamlessly. After the match concluded – Angel City won 2-0 – both teams gathered on the field and Utah defender Alex Leora (who previously played with King at Bay FC) led the group in what appeared to be a prayer. Royals coach Jimmy Coenraets told reporters later that perhaps the match should not have resumed after King collapsed. "In those moments, I'm not sure if we should have continued the game," Coenraets said. That's the decision other people have taken, which is fine. King played one year for the North Carolina Tar Heels before being drafted second overall by Bay FC in 2024. The Women's World Cup will expand from 32 to 48 teams for the 2031 tournament after a proposal was unanimously approved during a FIFA Council meeting last Friday. The 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil will still have 32 countries competing. "This is not just about having 16 more teams playing in the FIFA Women's World Cup, but taking the next steps in relation to the women's game in general by ensuring that more FIFA Member Associations have the chance to benefit from the tournament to develop their women's football structures from a holistic point of view," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a statement. "The FIFA Women's World Cup 2023, the first in which teams from all confederations won at least one game and teams from five confederations reached the knockout stage, among many other records, set a new standard for global competitiveness. This decision ensures we are maintaining the momentum in terms of growing women's football globally." Batson told reporters previously that the federation would be in favor of it as well. Chelsea clinched its eighth WSL title – and sixth in a row – over the weekend following a 1-0 win over Liverpool. In doing so, the Blues also became the first club in league history to go unbeaten, winning 22 straight games this season. While winning titles is nothing new for Chelsea, it was the club's first with coach Sonia Bompastor. "As a manager, players and staff, you only live these moments maybe once in your life," Bompastor said after the match. Hayes congratulated her former team on social media, while current Chelsea and USWNT players Naomi Girma, Catarina Macario and Mia Fishel celebrated their victory on the pitch. Chelsea was eliminated from Champions League competition after losing to Barcelona 8-2 on aggregate, but still has a chance to win more trophies this year when it faces Manchester United in the FA Cup final on May 18. She previously wrote for Sports Illustrated, USA Today and The Indianapolis Star. She is the author of "Strong Like a Woman," published in spring 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary of Title IX.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Human Rights Watch says football's governing body should be prepared to “reconsider” choice of U.S. as tournament co-host. Human Rights Watch urged FIFA President Gianni Infantino to be “prepared to reconsider the hosting decision” if the safety of fans and players can't be guaranteed, according to a letter seen by POLITICO. But as U.S. President Donald Trump cracks down on some foreign arrivals — with tourists even detained at the border on minor grounds — the world's premier sporting event now risks being overshadowed again by politics. Last week, POLITICO reported that Infantino is in lockstep with Trump behind closed doors, privately telling top football officials that tough border policies would not affect the competition. In the letter dated May 5, Human Rights Watch Director of Global Initiatives Minky Worden told Infantino that FIFA must “establish clear benchmarks and timelines for U.S. immigration policy changes needed to ensure respect for the rights of players, fans, and other participants in the World Cup.” The world football governing body anticipates that as many as 6.5 million people could attend the tournament next summer, with another 3.7 million coming for this summer's Club World Cup, which will be held entirely in the U.S. “Every part of the U.S. government will be working to ensure that these events are safe and successful, and those traveling to America to watch the competition have a seamless experience during every part of their visit,” Trump said during a World Cup task force event in Washington last week. But Human Rights Watch worriedly detailed Trump's potential visa bans on some countries, the possibility of detention, interrogation and denial of entry at the U.S. border, “prohibitively” long visa waiting times, new laws targeting LGBTQ+ people, and the potential for “chilling limits” on free speech and peaceful protest as policies threatening the competition. “What actions does FIFA plan to take in the event any players, fans or journalists are subject to discrimination, wrongful interrogation or arbitrary arrest while in the U.S.?,” it added. FIFA did not provide a response to POLITICO's request for comment. Gianni Infantino told top football officials the White House's insistence that fans go home after the tournament was in tune with other nations' border policies. The White House risks becoming a historical “joke,” Beijing warns. Hipster beer and pub food in a conveniently central location.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Soccer has two exciting new National Team kits that will be worn for the first time in the coming months, and one of them is specifically for the USWNT. The Nike kits were developed in collaboration with USWNT players Lynn Biyendolo, Naomi Girma, and Sophia Wilson and USMNT players Kellyn Acosta, DeAndre Yedlin and Walker Zimmerman. It features a white background of stars with red and blue details. “This collection represents Nike's deep commitment to women's soccer as an undeniable force that continues to elevate the game globally,” said Maggie Gauger, Vice President/GM, Nike North America Women's Business. “To me, the kits represent the USWNT mentality of always pushing forward,” said USWNT player Lynn Biyendolo. “I know I can speak for my teammates when I say that every time we put on the uniform, it brings a great sense of pride. The Brilliant Kit is just another way to honor our past and the women who played before us.” The second kit, a dark kit called “Heartbeat,” will be worn by both the USWNT and USMNT. It features vertical red and blue stripes on a dark background. According to a press release, the kit is dedicated to fans and features a “heritage-meets-streetstyle aesthetic.” “There's a modern edge to this (Heartbeat) kit, a sleekness that catches the eye. But it doesn't lose sight of what this crest stands for, the history etched in the red, white, and blue threads. Not much more you can ask for!” The Brilliant kit will be debuted by the USWNT on May 31st in Saint Paul when they play China PR. The Heartbeat kit will be worn by the USMNT on June 7th at their game in East Hartford, Connecticut against Turkey. The USMNT will continue to wear their current home kits.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It took Peter Moore about 30 minutes at a Xerox machine in 1993 to create the most iconic piece of design in American soccer history. He'd helped grow the sportswear and shoe brand from a tiny Oregon startup to a global titan before leaving for Adidas in the early 90s. There, he'd continued knocking almost every design out of the park. This was not Moore's first soccer project. Moore, remembers his close friend and associate Mary McGoldrick, had kept the circle close on this one. Barely anybody at Adidas' U.S. headquarters in Portland had any idea what he was up to, and even fewer at the company's global headquarters in Germany. Moore took a piece of denim – Levi's, he remembered before his death in 2022 – and laid out some paper stars on it. In other words, we got our hands dirty.” He'd just created the “denim kit,” and over 30 years later, those kits remain iconic. They are held aloft by some as the pinnacle of American soccer design and they are derided by others, reduced to a frivolous example of gauche 90s fashion, chucked in a bin alongside the purple and teal designs of the day. On sun-drenched fields in California and under the roof of the Silverdome, the 1994 USMNT exceeded all expectations, emerging out of a very tough group and fighting gallantly against eventual champion Brazil. Years later, the kit's popularity has only increased. You see it everywhere at national team matches and it has become wildly bootlegged and emulated, maybe the ultimate mark of relevance. Tuesday, with another World Cup on home soil just over a year away, we got our first look at the USMNT's latest kit – a red and blue pinstriped number dubbed the “heartbeat kit” that frankly may be its best offering in recent years. It's simple and bold without being boring, feels highly wearable off the pitch and seems an ideal stopgap between the USMNT's current shirts and the 2026 World Cup designs, which they'll presumably release closer to the tournament itself. There's a new complete women's set as well, including the lighter “brilliant kit.” Both were designed in collaboration with women's players Lynn (Williams) Biyendolo, Naomi Girma and Sophia (Smith) Wilson, and men's players Kellyn Acosta, DeAndre Yedlin and Walker Zimmerman. The men's kit, which they'll debut on June 7 in a friendly against Turkey, is evocative of the 2007 “Copa” kits that were only worn for a single year. It's a vintage design that remains a favorite these days, and Nike and U.S. Soccer have done well to emulate it, even if perhaps unintentionally. The women's “brilliant” design, which will be debuted on May 31 in a friendly vs. China, frankly would not make a bad men's World Cup shirt. One thing feels certain enough: whatever the USMNT ends up wearing in 2026 needs to be daring and bold and brash. It feels easy enough to argue that this tournament could prove the most pivotal moment in the history of American men's soccer – maybe even bigger than the ‘94 tournament – and the U.S. needs to be equipped with something memorable. The opposite, of course, also holds true. Fans adore the bomb pops not only because they broke the trend of “clean” design, but because of Clint Dempsey or John Brooks celebrating goals in it at the 2014 World Cup. Fans love it because of Wynalda, Lalas, Harkes and the lot on those sun-drenched fields. Nike can only get so close to the denim kit before it runs into copyright and intellectual property issues with Adidas, a chief competitor. And it's worth noting that as design cycles go, much of the design work for the men's kit is likely already done, leaving precious little room for adjustment. But we can always hope they get it right. The task at hand for the USMNT and Nike is two-fold: create an iconic design, and live up to it. If they come up with something forgettable – and if the team itself puts on a forgettable performance – the shirts will only prove as evidence of a painful, embarrassing memory. His writing and photography have been featured in National Geographic, Smithsonian Magazine, Gothamist and a variety of other outlets.</p>

Argentina's minister of national security Patricia Bullrich sent a list to the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires on Monday that included the names of more than 15,000 violent soccer fans who will be banned from attending this summer's Club World Cup. "The list includes more than 15,000 people who will be banned from stadiums," Bullrich said, per Reuters. "For us, this is extremely important because no violent person who has committed any crime in Argentine stadiums will be able to attend this sporting event." The list of names was created through the "Tribuna Segura" program, which detects people who have been banned from stadiums in Argentina. "Since the beginning of this government, 'Tribuna Segura' has monitored more than four million people in 1,328 matches," Bullrich, who has been in her current role since 2023, when Javier Milei became the president of Argentina, said. The Club World Cup, which will take place in the U.S. from June 14 to July 13, will have two teams from Argentina taking part – Boca Juniors and River Plate. Boca Juniors were placed into Group C and will take on Germany's Bayern Munich, Portugal's Benfica and New Zealand's Auckland City in the group stage. River Plate, meanwhile, are in Group F and will play Italy's Inter, Mexico's Monterrey and Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds in the group stage. There is no gambling offered on this site.</p>

Local artist John Rego chosen to illustrate FIFA World Cup 2026 poster

New England has been selected to host the FIFA World Cup in 2026, and Rhode Island native John Rego has been selected to illustrate the event's official poster.

John Rego, originally from Warren, Rhode Island, now lives in Boston as an illustration professor at the Massachusetts College of Art. Rego both illustrates and paints, and ultimately chose an illustration for this project. Together with the help of students at the school, Rego compiled a Boston Harbor-themed illustration for the poster, showcasing some of New England's most iconic representations. The poster includes depictions of a lobster, the Bunker Hill Monument, the Tall Ships, the Tea Party, and the Gloucester Sea Monster, to name a few.

"We invited illustration students to help with the poster and get a firsthand look at the process of working as a professional artist. While I created the illustration, the poster aimed to elevate the student's voices and depict what Boston means to them," said Rego.

You will see his poster used to promote the World Cup taking place in June and July 2026 across the United States and Mexico.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The upcoming FIFA World Cup runs globally through June and July of 2026. For die-hard fans looking for a summer road trip, there are an additional six in San Francisco and eight in Los Angeles. Whether you stick close to home or book an immersive soccer staycation, you're sure to have a kickin' good time without missing any of the action. When it's time to take a break from watching your favorite team, a stay in Grays Harbor means long, sunny days at the beach enjoying bonfires, s'mores, kite flying, beach-combing, hiking, or splashing in the waves! The Westport Light State Park has a picturesque lighthouse for those holiday-card photo shoots but you can also take surf lessons each May through September. In Aberdeen, check out the wildly wonderful Mermaid Museum, which both kids and adults will enjoy. Next door is Westport Winery, with wine tasting for the adults. Pacific Paradise Park in Ocean Shores is nonstop miniature golf, bumper boats, panning for gems and arcade fun.

Consider booking a soccer staycation at Seabrook or the Quinault Beach Resort Casino where there's something for everyone. With meals, rooms, fun and friends under one roof, it's win/win…even if Team USA doesn't. Or combine your football frenzy with a local festival to keep everyone engaged.

It has not been the easiest start to life for Mauricio Pochettino as Head Coach for the United States Men's National Team as the Argentine would have envisaged. Results have been disappointing as the one year to go mark to the 2026 World Cup quickly approaches, a tournament which will be hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. At CNN's Techwood location recently in Atlanta, Poch sat down with TNT Sports' Melissa Ortiz to discuss a range of topics, starting with the importance of the team's upcoming friendly matches against Türkiye and Switzerland.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MANCHESTER CITY have unveiled their kit for the 2025/26 season and dropped a hint over Jack Grealish's future. Pep Guardiola's side will wear the new home shirt at this summer's Club World Cup in the US. Puma have gone for a white sash across the club's iconic sky blue jersey. The diagonal stripe is a nod to City kits from the 70s as it has been seen on old away strips. And fans reckon having him as the poster boy suggests he is staying at City beyond the summer. It comes amid rumours of Grealish's departure after a tough season in which he has scored just three goals and started only seven Premier League games. Tottenham, Aston Villa and Napoli are all interested in signing him. The clip stars actor John Thompson hosting a talent show as stars like Foden, Haaland, Manuel Akanji, Oscar Bobb and Ederson take to the stage to perform. Former players Micah Richards, Joleon Lescott and Mike Summerbee also have cameo roles. Puma say the sash home shirt "creates a connection to the past with a futuristic design, bridging the gap between different generations of City fans". The German sportswear brand's chief Marco Mueller said: “We're so excited to be featuring the iconic sash, made famous from away days of old, on the home kit for the first time. "Both in this kit and all our kits for this upcoming season, fans across the world will be reminded that with our partnership we do things differently and want to push the boundaries in terms of design, creativity and innovation”. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. This service is provided on News Group Newspapers' Limited's Standard Terms and Conditions in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Englishman may be leaving but he is still needed in Bavarian. Eric Dier's move from Bayern Munich to AS Monaco on a free transfer is more or less a done deal, with Bayern already confirming the Englishman's departure and reports indicating that Dier has already signed a deal for the 2017 Ligue 1 champions. Still, his time at Bayern may not be over just yet. Despite moving Dier on, the club has short term injury concerns in the center of defense. Dayot Upamecano is currently battling to return from a months long injury, Kim Min-Jae has been fighting with Achilles problems for months and needs a break and Hiroki Itō broke his metatarsal again and will be out for an indefinite period of time. Bayern has already wrapped up the Bundesliga title, but the start of the FIFA Club World Cup is just about a month away, at the time of writing, and there is a chance none of the other center backs will return in time. So Bayern may still need Dier for a little longer and are willing to make the necessary concessions, via Maximilian Koch (and captured by @iMiaSanMia): Due to the injury concerns in defense, Bayern are considering giving Eric Dier a short-term contract in order to be able to play at the Club World Cup. Board member for sport Max Eberl recently hinted that outgoing players may not be required to stay at Bayern for the Club World Cup, but Dier's contract in Munich lasts until end of the group stages of the tournament. But would Monaco allow this to happen? Would Dier be willing to wait two weeks to start his adventure in France? Check your inbox for a welcome email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drama, passion and joy are set to fuel another summer as the World Cup takes over iconic North American stadiums in Los Angeles (LA) for the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) 2026 tournament. While many dedicated soccer fans around the world look forward to this event every four years, there is criticism from the public about the expenses associated with building large stadiums to support crowds that are frequently abandoned, despite massive investment. However, with California's stable economy, facilities to support urban populations and stadiums capable of hosting large crowds, the 2026 FIFA World Cup will bring significant economic gains without the hefty price tag that has damaged past host countries. The event will be an economic boost for LA as it will generate revenue through increased tourism, provide new job opportunities and bring recognition to the soccer industry, not just as a sport, but as a global event worth celebrating. The FIFA World Cup will bring more money off the field due to a substantial boost in tourism revenue, directly benefiting California's economy. It is expected to generate $343 million in direct spending just from an estimated 179,200 out-of-town visitors drawn in by the grandeur of the tournament. With increasing global recognition for soccer and an influx of tourists pulled in by the World Cup celebrations, LA is expected to gain an extra $230.4 million in future tourism revenue. The average tourist will spend $2,35 on travel, food, housing and shopping, generating much-needed tax income for the state to support companies and their staff. Eventually, the original amount spent by tourists cascades through local businesses to hotel employees, drivers, waiters and food vendors, creating economic incentives surrounding this event. The additional money from new sales and occupancy tax revenues — taxes collected from hotel stays and short-term lodging — can be directly used to improve diminishing urban infrastructure, support upgrades to local public transportation and provide funding to alleviate the homelessness crisis in LA. Some of these new revenues can also be used to fund long-term solutions to aid the reintegration of the state's homeless population into the workforce, such as transitional housing programs and mental health care. By investing money in long-term interventions, LA can better address issues of homelessness while simultaneously increasing employment opportunities and improving overall quality of life. Tourist-generated revenue can yield more economic opportunities than drawbacks, which will improve consumer and investor confidence in purchasing goods, investing in companies and overall business growth. As a result, California's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will increase, demonstrating how the FIFA World Cup 2026 will help build a better LA. Furthermore, the 2026 FIFA World Cup is expected to be a great investment for California's economy by increasing the availability of employment and wages. In hosting just eight World Cup games in LA, wages will increase by $243.2 million from new jobs and added working hours for existing employees. While much of the increased workload will be temporary in hospitality, food service and transportation, these jobs can still provide valuable experience and transferable skills for future employment. As the tournament is scheduled for summer, the boost in employment opportunities will be particularly beneficial for students, teachers and seasonal workers with specific scheduling restrictions. Many of these new jobs will not require a college degree, making them more accessible to individuals from low-income backgrounds, as a large proportion of young United States (U.S.) workers without a college degree are concentrated in customer service representative and construction laborer occupations. With extra work hours, employees will gain more disposable income, which will be pumped back into the local economy, driving further consumption and stimulating economic growth. Increased Major League Soccer (MLS) audience and merchandise sales in LA would economically benefit the local population. The MLS revenue would provide the cash to pay for the wages of those who work for clubs such as LA Football Club (LAFC) and LA Galaxy (LA Galaxy), supporting hundreds of households. In addition, local sports firms gain monetary value from the revenue created by LA MLS teams because many of their goods and merchandise are handled by third-party sellers like soccer shops and sports stores. Expenses associated with playing soccer, such as facility fees and access to specific athletic gear, can also contribute to local sporting goods stores and boost local market economies. Soccer's unique position as a global sport can bring communities together and promote collective celebrations in the form of watch parties. Other positive externalities or indirect benefits from the growing popularity of the soccer industry also include improved public health and greater community engagement. In previous host countries, the money needed to successfully run this competition became an unbearable burden due to significant infrastructure construction and wage costs, which tend to rest in the hands of unwilling owners of private stadiums or a struggling government. Qatar spent $220 billion to build brand new stadiums, housing, parking and sporting facilities for the entire competition. It will provide a lasting boost through increased tourism, expanded employment opportunities and growth in the soccer market by introducing the sport to new players.</p>

The four sides booked their tickets following hard-fought quarter-final victories in a day filled with tension, drama, and high stakes. Morocco were the first to punch their ticket, edging Sierra Leone 1-0 after extra time thanks to a late own goal. The tightly contested match was decided in the 115th minute, ending Sierra Leone's impressive debut campaign. Hosts Egypt joined them after a thrilling comeback against Ghana. Trailing 2-0, the young Pharaohs forced penalties with a last-gasp equaliser and held their nerve in the shootout to win 5-4 and book a return to the global stage. Nigeria, the continent's most decorated U20 side, advanced after defeating defending champions Senegal on penalties. The Flying Eagles kept calm under pressure to seal their record 14th appearance at the U20 World Cup. South Africa completed the quartet with a 1-0 extra-time win over DR Congo, thanks to Thabang Mahlangu's decisive strike deep into added time. The FIFA U-20 World Cup takes place in Chile from 27 September to 19 October.</p>
