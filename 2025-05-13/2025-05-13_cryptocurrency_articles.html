                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USDT dominance could drop to 2022 lows, indicating an accelerating capital rotation into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Technical charts and market sentiment align to suggest that May 2025 might start a broader altcoin rally, driven by key indicators and shifting capital flows. The TOTAL2 chart, representing the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, has broken above a downtrend line in place since January 2025. This breakout is accompanied by a bullish break of structure (BOS) on the daily chart, forming higher-low patterns. This shift signals capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. Michael Van Poppe, founder of MN Capital, highlighted this trend, noting a bearish divergence accompanied by declining volume. XRP price gained 400% the last time whale flows flipped The tether (USDT) dominance chart has dropped to its lowest level since early February, at 4.59% on May 13. A bearish breakout could lead to new lows since 2021, matching previous altseason levels. USDT dominance declines imply capital rotation occurs in other assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Complementing the recovery with a deeper analysis, crypto trader ZERO IKA observed that many altcoins have formed a higher time frame break of structure above their February and March highs. The analyst noted that despite recent upside, most altcoins remain 70% to 90% below their all-time highs, indicating a "relatively early" opportunity for a recovery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Saudi Arabia's DataVolt moves forward with its $20 billion U.S. investment in AI data centers and energy infrastructure, crypto analysts are closely watching the implications. The interaction between blockchain systems and artificial intelligence research is changing quickly. Another eye-popping figure is the $80 billion co-investment by companies like Google, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD, and Uber. While most associate these brands with Web2 infrastructure, several are making strategic moves into blockchain and digital assets: This $80 billion in technology investment will likely strengthen the infrastructure layer supporting crypto adoption and developer tooling. Saudi Arabia's pivot toward advanced technology investment mirrors broader regional support for blockchain. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), for instance, has already positioned itself as a global crypto hub with pro-blockchain regulations, free zones for Web3 startups, and a digital dirham under development. The project successfully demonstrated cross-border payments using distributed ledger technology, suggesting that crypto rails are not only under consideration—they're in active development. With its new $600 billion commitment, Riyadh is doubling down on digital transformation. At the forefront of tokenization trends, these industries are where real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate, commodities, and even carbon credits are being represented as digital tokens on-chain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CryptoPunks Have New Home as Nonprofit Acquires Ethereum NFT IP From Yuga Labs The Infinite Node Foundation, a newly established nonprofit endowment, announced Tuesday that it has acquired the IP of influential Ethereum NFT collection CryptoPunks from previous owner and Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs. CryptoPunks General Manager Natalie Stone told Decrypt that financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed. We are excited to announce CryptoPunks have found a permanent home at The Infinite Node Foundation. @nodefnd is a non-profit committed to the preservation and expansion of contemporary digital art. “By pairing museum-grade conservation with an evergreen endowment, we intend to future-proof this landmark work and make it easier than ever for scholars, curators, and collectors to engage with it.” “When Yuga acquired CryptoPunks' IP, it wasn't just about ownership—it was about honoring a cultural icon we believed in,” said Yuga Labs CEO and co-founder Wylie Aronow in a statement. Seeing that vision come to life with the NODE Foundation feels like a full-circle moment. Aronow will join Art Blocks founder Erick Calderon and original CryptoPunks creators creators Matt Hall and John Watkinson of Larva Labs on an advisory board helping the Infinite Node Foundation to achieve its goals. In collaboration with Hall and Watkinson, the Foundation's first move will be to host a major exhibition of the entire collection at its exhibition space in Palo Alto, California. Arguably the most prominent NFT collection of all time, and an inspiration to many collections that followed (including the Bored Apes), CryptoPunks trading volume has eclipsed more than $3 billion lifetime since its creation in 2017, according to data from Punks.wtf.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Institutional adoption of digital assets is rising, but mainstream financial players are hesitant due to unresolved issues around risk exposure, accountability and lack of control within decentralized systems. Traditional finance demands robust risk management, yet public blockchains and smart contracts often lack the safeguards, recourse and regulatory clarity needed for institutions to operate at scale with confidence. Infrastructure providers are embedding risk frameworks, and regulatory efforts are advancing, but until risk becomes transparent, manageable and assignable, digital assets will struggle to move beyond their current limitations. Institutional adoption of digital assets like cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities is increasingly seen as inevitable. Banks, asset managers and payment processors must know who bears the liability when things go wrong. But digital assets — especially those on public chains — break that model. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS in April. “Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable in using stablecoins at scale,” he added. There's often no clear path to indemnity when a smart contract fails or when money is stolen via a protocol exploit, which means that traditional players are being asked to take on new risks without any of the traditional controls. See also: Crypto Firms Chase Bank Charters as Circle Launches Stablecoin Orchestration Layer Infrastructure providers are working to embed risk management into the fabric of digital asset platforms. Chain analytics firms are helping institutions monitor wallet activity and flag suspicious transactions in real time. “This isn't about replacing existing systems,” FV Bank CEO Miles Paschini told PYMNTS in January. Where stablecoins offer superior benefits, customers will naturally gravitate toward them.” “As more banks integrate blockchain capabilities, customers will have greater choice in transferring value,” he added. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Blockchain's Benefits for Regulated Industries” found that blockchain technology has numerous potential benefits to serve the unique needs of regulated industries, including finance. Even so, risk is not just a matter of auditability or reserve backing. To do that, the industry must make risk visible, manageable and assignable. Until then, the digital asset revolution could remain stuck in a holding pattern.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking in a recent interview on the Conversations with Leaders podcast, Hoskinson hinted at plans to develop a privacy stablecoin on Cardano. He asserted that some users may not be comfortable with traditional stablecoins due to their lack of privacy. Notably, the Cardano founder proposed an initiative he termed ‘selective disclosure and season freeze regime' for stablecoins. He suggested that these solutions would enable users to shield their stablecoin-related transactions, including counterparties and amounts, from the public. Despite this, regulators can still access these transactions through a regulatory directive or court order. Further, Hoskinson echoed his support for privacy stablecoins with selective disclosure, adding that Cardano might be the first blockchain to roll out one. Thanks to its privacy-focused sidechain, Midnight, Cardano could become one of the first blockchains to launch a stablecoin that keeps users' transactions private. Cardano also supports a handful of stablecoins, like DJED, USDA, and USDM. According to data from DeFiLlama, stablecoins on the Cardano network have a combined market cap of $31.69 million. Hoskinson believes some users might not be comfortable with this lack of privacy, so he is considering introducing a privacy-enabled stablecoin with selective disclosure functionality. Meanwhile, regulators have remained cautious about privacy-focused projects like Monero and Zcash. Although these projects have tried to balance regulatory demands with user privacy, multiple crypto exchanges, including Binance and OKX, have delisted them from their platforms. Despite this regulatory bottleneck, Hoskinson believes a privacy-enabled stablecoin on Cardano is possible. DisClamier: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The top crypto has seen gains of 23.3% during this period and its yearly performance swung to positive territory as a result. Trading volumes have been quite high lately with $76 billion worth of BTC exchanging hands on May 7 along with $60+ billion flowing through the system on both May 8 and yesterday. Open interest (OI) for BTC futures has now increased to its highest level since January 21. When OI is at such high levels, a strong pullback typically occurs as market participants prompt a long squeeze to flush out excess leverage and gather enough liquidity to push the price higher. Back in January, macroeconomic conditions were actually not unfavorable. Can a strong downtrend begin in the next few days? Let's look at Bitcoin's price action and historical patterns. We have been keeping track of Bitcoin's price action in relation to its 21-day and 200-day EMAs, as a bullish crossover between the two indicators has resulted in big gains for the top crypto just a few months later. However, it is worth noting that there have been some false positives along the way. These are bullish crossovers that don't end up propelling BTC to higher highs. In a previous article, we shared a bullish price target of $140,000 if this turns out to be one of those crossovers that push BTC to new all-time highs. However, two other scenarios can still unfold where the outcome will be different. Interestingly, every time this happened, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) failed to reach overbought levels. In contrast, the ‘golden crosses' that ended up propelling BTC to higher highs were followed by a strong push in the RSI to overbought territory. The price has only dropped below this marker one time in the instances that have pushed BTC to new all-time highs. Hence, as long as the price stays above that threshold – or the price action pulls a bear trap, as it happened once – BTC will remain on track to reach this long-term target of $140,000 per token.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It would seem that the money-making days for CryptoPunks, one of the oldest and most valuable NFT brands, are well and truly over. After acquiring the non-fungible token collection from Larva Labs in 2022, Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs is now selling CryptoPunks to Infinite Node Foundation — a non-profit focused on preserving digital art. CryptoPunks, alongside brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoKitties, is frequently credited for kicking off the NFT craze in 2021. Several tokens have been sold for millions, including one in 2022 that was purchased for more than $23 million worth of Ethereum cryptocurrency, but the sales charts have largely stagnated since. It was also never clear how much Yuga Labs spent to acquire CryptoPunks in its heyday, but being sold to a non-profit is probably not a good sign for, well, profitability. Now that NFT's are a shambling shadow of their former glory, the focus is turning to making CryptoPunks relevant in the mainstream art industry. “We've worked to elevate and protect their legacy, but we always knew Punks needed a permanent home built for preservation,” Yuga Labs co-founder Wylie Aronow said in the announcement release. “Seeing that vision come to life with the Node Foundation feels like a full-circle moment. They are best positioned to protect the Punks legacy.” Node Foundation chair Micky Malka said that “CryptoPunks sparked a cultural movement,” and that the non-profit intends to “future-proof this landmark work” and make it more accessible for scholars, curators, and collectors to engage with.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robinhood Markets (HOOD), the California-based financial services company, said it agreed to buy Canadian crypto firm WonderFi (WNDR) for $178.98 million. The all-cash acquisition values WonderFi at 36 Canadian cents per share, a 41% premium over its closing price prior to the Tuesday announcement. “WonderFi has built a formidable family of brands serving beginner and advanced crypto users alike, making them an ideal partner to accelerate Robinhood's mission in Canada,” said Johann Kerbrat, head of Robinhood Crypto, in the official announcement. Kerbrat will be speaking at Consensus Toronto on Friday. Robinhood, a popular commission-free brokerage platform, has been looking to expand its international footprint for some time and struck a deal to acquire cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp last year. The latest acquisition will help it win over Canada-based customers. The deal will bring Robinhood into Canada, ramping up competition for exchanges such as Coinbase and Wealthsimple Crypto. Last Week, Nasdaq-listed Coinbase made a bold bet on digital assets derivatives segment, acquiring crypto options giant Deribit in a landmark $2.9 billion deal. UPDATE (May 13, 14:43 UTC): Adds executives' appearances at Consensus Toronto. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bitcoin mining venture with ties to US President Donald Trump's family announced on Monday, May 12, that it is all set to become a publicly traded company. American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency firm backed by President Trump's sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq after its all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining that is set to close by the third quarter of 2025, according to an investor presentation posted on its website. The US president's two eldest sons will own about 98 per cent of the new entity along with existing shareholders of American Bitcoin. The other 2 per cent will belong to existing shareholders of Gryphon. Eric Trump is also listed as a co-founder and member of the  management team at American Bitcoin. Experts have warned that these crypto ventures could lead to overt conflicts of interest within the Trump administration. However, the company has said that existing shareholders of American Bitcoin will own a majority stake. Trump is also facing backlash for planning to accept a $400 million luxury jumbo jet as a gift from Qatar's ruling family to be used as the official US presidential plane, Air Force One. Meanwhile, the American Bitcoin announcement did not elicit much of a reaction in the crypto market as bitcoin continued to trade flat at around $104,000, according to CoinMarketCap. In February this year, investment firm Dominari Holdings announced the creation of a new venture called American Data Centers to develop computing infrastructure for the AI industry. Then, the two Trumps partnered with an energy infrastructure company called Hut 8 to establish a new venture called American Bitcoin, with the more immediate objective of creating a large stockpile of cryptocurrency by mining bitcoins. “Every single sophisticated country is using their excess power to mine bitcoin […] We won the space race. We better win the crypto race,” Eric Trump was quoted as saying by CNBC. But simply buying Bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity,” Donald Trump Jr was quoted as saying by The New York Times. Gryphon Digital Mining is now acquiring American Bitcoin via a reverse triangular merger in a 100 per cent stock-for-stock transaction, according to an investor presentation posted on its website. The proposed merger with Gryphon carves out American Bitcoin from Hut 8′s broader energy and AI infrastructure platform in order to separate the bitcoin mining operations and potentially unlock new capital. American Bitcoin brings together an outstanding leadership team and a clear strategy to build a premier institution in this fast-evolving industry,” Steve Gutterman, Chief Executive Officer of Gryphon, said. Time-to-market was a critical factor, and this transaction enables an efficient path to public markets by combining with an entity that is structurally aligned with American Bitcoin's mining-focused launch strategy,” Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut, said. It is a branch of the crypto industry and requires large amounts of energy that are consumed by mining machines to process bitcoin transactions. In return, they earned new bitcoins as a reward. Today, the process of mining bitcoins is carried out by publicly traded companies like Hut 8 which owns several data centres packed with servers. Bitcoin mining farms have also been linked to an increase in noise pollution. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump and his sons launched a crypto company called World Liberty Financial that offers two types of digital currencies. It has launched so-called governance tokens with the symbol WLFI. World Liberty Financial also unveiled its own stablecoin last week. Besides this, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched their own sets of memecoins on the eve of the presidential swearing-in ceremony in January this year. More recently, Trump announced that top holders of the $TRUMP memecoin would have the opportunity to attend a private dinner with him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will social networks soon awaken to a new digital era? Have you ever dreamed of a world where your likes on social networks could be transformed into stable digital currency? So, are we on the eve of a revolution in the world of social networks or is it simply another digital mirage? Let's dive together into this fascinating adventure that could reshape the contours of our online life. After the noticeable failure of Diem, its cryptocurrency project abandoned in 2022, Meta is not giving up. Integrating these digital currencies into its flagship applications: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. In 2019, Libra (later renamed Diem) promised a global digital currency. Facilitate payments and democratize access to the global financial system. At the time, Mark Zuckerberg encountered much greater resistance than anticipated. Indeed, regulators feared that this currency would escape all control, creating risks for the global economy. Today, Meta is focusing on another approach: stablecoins. Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, stablecoins are backed by solid assets (such as the dollar or the euro), thus offering valuable stability. This characteristic makes them particularly attractive for digital transactions. Imagine paying for an NFT artwork on Instagram or sending money via WhatsApp! Discussions are underway with major players in the sector such as Circle or Tether, famous for their popular stablecoins, USDC and USDT. The recent recruitment of Ginger Baker, a recognized crypto expert, also shows that Meta is taking this turn very seriously. These initiatives are part of a broader trend in the digital market. Giants such as Standard Chartered and Fidelity are also exploring the uses of stablecoins, confirming their potential. If Meta manages to overcome the technical and regulatory challenges, the synergy between stablecoins and social networks could be a real game changer. Regulators, still wary of the Diem adventure, will closely monitor this new attempt. Furthermore, market volatility in the crypto market could play an important role in the adoption (or not) of these stable currencies on such popular platforms. With this relaunch, Meta hopes to restore its reputation in the crypto field while transforming its social applications into even richer ecosystems. It remains to be seen whether this attempt will bear fruit or if the tumultuous history of Diem will come back to haunt this new chapter.</p>

Under UK data protection law, GB News had one month to respond. Despite acknowledging receipt of the request, it failed to provide a full response altogether. Following an official complaint, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has now ruled that GB News “failed to comply with its data protection obligations.” Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), organisations that breach data protection laws can face enforcement action from the ICO. This can include mandatory audits, enforcement notices and risk financial penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of a company's annual global turnover, whichever is greater. It seems they thought the rules didn't apply to them. For a broadcaster that claims to care about free speech, their internal culture says otherwise.” Kaur, who first rose to fame on ‘Big Brother' in 2001 and now regularly appears on ITV's ‘Good Morning Britain' and Channel 5's ‘Jeremy Vine', was a familiar face across GB News programmes, including ‘Farage', ‘Jacob Rees-Mogg's State of the Nation' and ‘The Camilla Tominey Show'.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The altcoin market has become difficult to navigate during Bitcoin's (BTC) bull cycle, with fragmented narratives, isolated rallies, liquidity crunches and colossal token unlocks. A recent K33 Research report states, "a broad-based altseason is unlikely for now, as capital is concentrating into selective winners rather than lifting all tokens indiscriminately." In other words, select crypto projects could rally extensively. At the same time, altcoins that do not exemplify real-world utility and market fit products or even those that fail to attract users could miss the altcoin season. Altcoin season refers to a period in the crypto market when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperform Bitcoin, supported by prominent rallies across the board. This indicates that while early signs of an altcoin season are emerging, a full-fledged rally is likely still some way off. Based on the altcoin market capitalization chart, a golden cross pattern is coming into play, exacerbating the dream for a full-fledged altcoin season. As observed on the chart below shared by crypto analyst and investor OxNobler on X, a golden cross is coming into play for the first time since 2021. Bitcoin's price has sustained strong bullish momentum since the April 7 tariff-triggered crash low of $74,508 to $105,819 on Monday, demonstrating renewed strength driven by macro tailwinds, including easing trade and tariff tensions, and the dovish Federal Reserve's (Fed) stance on the policy informing decisions on interest rates. The bounce back aligns with broader risk-on sentiment that has seen Bitcoin outperform equities. "Capital rotation into Bitcoin appears sustained, as reflected in the realised cap, reaching a new all-time high and ETF inflows exceeding $920 million over the past two weeks. On-chain data also confirms a significant drop in coins held at a loss, with over 3 million BTC returning to profit," the latest Bitfinex Alpha report stated. Bitcoin upholds a solid technical structure, reinforced by surging spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) inflows and institutional interest. Short-term drawbacks will likely be absorbed quickly as investors buy the dip, potentially resulting in a sustained leg up to fresh highs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), representing BTC's market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap, sharply dropped to 62.2% from the May 7 peak of 65.37%. The decline occurred following a market-wide rally on risk-on sentiment due to progressive trade talks between the United States (US) and China. A decline in Bitcoin dominance often signals an altcoin season because capital flows from BTC into altcoins. In 2021, Bitcoin dominance peaked at 73.62% before correcting, boosting altcoin rallies. Historically, this trading pair has been viewed as a bellwether indicator for altcoins' performance, with a persistent downtrend suggesting that widespread rallies in altcoins are a pipe dream, at least in the short term. The ratio currently stands at 0.0239, reflecting a 26.4% increase, portraying Ethereum's growing strength relative to Bitcoin. Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - FOX5 learned new information about a kidnapping and crypto-robbery in November last year.

Three teenagers are accused of kidnapping a man at gunpoint after he returned home from hosting a crypto event in downtown Las Vegas. They were identified as Belaf Mohamed Ashraf, Austin Jay Fletcher and Hassan Elsama Hassan by Las Vegas Metro Police.

The teens are accused of forcing the victim to hand over his passwords and abandoning him in the desert. Police say they stole $4 million in cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens.

The teens then took the victim to a remote desert area in Arizona, about 26 miles away from the state border where he was released. 

The victim told police he walked five miles to the nearest gas station and called police. The suspects were arrested and are now being tried as adults.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bitcoin mining firm backed by President Trump's son Eric will go public this year, the company announced Monday, deepening the Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency. American Bitcoin — which lists Eric Trump as its co-founder and has its roots in a company backed by Donald Trump Jr. — is merging with the publicly-traded Gryphon Digital Mining. The company's goals, according to an overview posted Monday, are to mine new bitcoin "below market cost" and to build up a reserve of the cryptocurrency. "Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market," Eric Trump said in a statement. American Bitcoin was launched in March, with crypto mining firm Hut 8 owning a majority stake. It's the successor to American Data Centers, a venture backed by Eric Trump, his older brother Donald Trump Jr. and publicly traded Dominari Holdings. Crypto mining also has a stamp of approval from Eric and Donald Trump Jr.'s father. Mining is an essential part of how bitcoin operates. The currency isn't centralized, and instead relies on independent actors — known as miners — who carry out complicated math problems to verify bitcoin transactions and list them on a public ledger known as a blockchain. The value of a bitcoin stands at around $102,000, and the reward for mining decreases over time as the number of bitcoin in circulation increases, making mining a lucrative endeavor. But mining is controversial because it's extremely energy-intensive, with miners operating gigantic data centers filled with server racks that carry out the mathematical operations necessary to mine. A team from Cambridge University estimates bitcoin uses about 187.9 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, more than the entire country of Egypt. The president and his two eldest sons are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, which got a multi-billion dollar boost earlier this month from an Abu Dhabi-based firm, and Mr. Trump launched a highly volatile "meme coin" called $TRUMP in January. Crypto investments make up about $2.9 billion of the family's net worth, one report estimates. Last week, Senate Democrats blocked a crypto regulation bill from moving forward and pushed for it to include new limits on elected officials participating in some types of crypto ventures, with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accusing Mr. Trump of "crypto corruption." White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said last week Mr. Trump's "assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest."
