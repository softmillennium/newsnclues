                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dave Franco and Alison Brie were sued for copyright infringement over their body horror film Together Both projects include a couple whose bodies fuse together The lawsuit filed Tuesday, May 13 by production company StudioFest alleges that Together is a "blatant rip-off" of Better Half, while also claiming Franco, 39, and Brie, 42, penned a script for Together alongside writer-director Michael Shanks after declining to star in the studio's 2023 Sundance indie film, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter and Variety. Named in the complaint are costars and producers Franco and Brie; Michael Shanks; WME, which represents all three; as well as Neon, the film's distributor. "This is not a generic comedic trope — it is a highly specific, artistic choice that plays out in a nearly identical fashion with both works framing the scene using a visual shot of the minor character's feet peeking out from just outside the door,” the complaint states, per those outlets. The facts in this case are clear and we plan to vigorously defend ourselves," PEOPLE has reached out to representatives of all other parties for comment. Franco also directed Brie in Somebody I Used to Know. During an interview with PEOPLE at the 2025 SXSW Film & TV Festival in Austin, Texas in March, Brie told husband Franco that working with him is "very attractive." “I am always so in awe of you when we're on set together,” added the Community alum, who has been married to Franco since 2017.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Claims that spruce trees synchronize their responses to a solar eclipse were widely reported recently — but many researchers are sceptical of the results. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The idea that trees communicate with each other during an eclipse and synchronize their behavior — as has been widely reported recently — is a compelling one. The fascinating idea sprang out of research detecting bioelectric signals in spruce trees (Picea abies) in Italy's Dolomite mountains during a 2-hour-long partial solar eclipse. But many researchers aren't convinced, saying the number of trees studied is tiny and that there are more plausible explanations for the results. Some 6,600 feet (2,000 meters) above sea level, Alessandro Chiolerio, a physicist at the Italian Institute of Technology, Monica Gagliano, an ecologist at Southern Cross University in Australia, and their colleagues attached remote sensors to three healthy spruce trees — two of about 70 years old and the other around 20 years old — and to five tree stumps. "Our results demonstrated that spruce trees exhibited synchronized changes in their bioelectrical activity in anticipation of a solar eclipse," Gagliano told Live Science. "Remarkably, this synchronization began several hours before the eclipse occurred, suggesting not just a passive reaction to darkness but an active, anticipatory response." "The strongest signs of this early response were observed in older trees, hinting at a memory-like capacity linked to their age and environmental history," she said. "This study provides the first evidence that trees in a forest can behave as a coordinated collective system — functioning more like an integrated network than just as isolated individuals." So, what exactly is going on in this work published April 30 in Royal Society Open Science, and how seriously should we take it? "There is strong concern among my colleagues that this paper was published," James Cahill, a plant ecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, told Live Science. Its sample size is three, which is very low and they have a super large number of variables that they're testing — over 10 — and you're always going to find a pattern if you do something like that."

Related: Tropical tree in Panama has evolved to kill its 'enemies' with lightning Many plants and animals respond to the day-night cycles of light and dark, so plants responding to approaching darkness shouldn't be a surprise, he said. "If you turn off the lights in a greenhouse at or at night, every plant will show reduced water transpiration and reduced photosynthesis. This would also alter their bioelectrical signals, and every biological material has bioelectrical signals, he added, so there's nothing fancy in detecting changes to these. It's also unlikely there's an evolutionary survival advantage to responding to an eclipse, Cahill pointed out, given how briefly and infrequently they occur. Instead, he thinks the plants are responding with capabilities that have evolved for a different reason. And when it comes to the bioelectrical signals changing before the eclipse rather than during it, there's also a simple possible answer, he said. A lot of plants will start changing their photosynthetic machinery before sunrise," said Cahill. "It's disappointing that this paper is getting so much press because it's just an idea and there's not much here other than assertion," said Cahill. "I don't think anything can be concluded from an experiment that does not include replicates," Justine Karst, a forest ecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, told Live Science. There are three living trees in the study and there are assertions about young versus old, said Cahill, "but they only have one young plant and it's in a different site. "Due to the complexity of the field setup — monitoring trees 24/7 in alpine conditions — we focused on a small number of carefully selected individuals. "Still, this is an early study, and we view it as a foundation for broader research." Karst compared the new findings to experimental studies that seemed to reveal a wood-wide web in which trees communicate and share resources via underground networks of mycorrhizal fungi. Cahill is in favor of studying plant behavior to probe whether these organisms have cognition — he is doing work in that area himself — but says the level of evidence needs to be very high before claims are made. I'm sympathetic to the idea of a different approach, but papers like this make it really hard to do very strong science in a controversial area," said Cahill. "It's very disappointing because the Royal Society has had a great reputation. "All research published by Royal Society Open Science goes through thorough peer review before being accepted." They also noted the role post-publication discussion plays in their process. "We encourage academic debate and constructive criticism of the research published in our journals. Any reader is able to submit a comment on research published in Open Science, this will be peer reviewed and published alongside an invited reply from the original authors."

The video, posted on Facebook by Singaporean engineer Htin Aung, comes from GP Energy Myanmar's Thapyawa solar farm, located near the town of Thazi, according to Aung's post. The feed is centered on a concrete-and-metal gate, which shudders and slides open as the earth begins to move. Vidale told Live Science he knew of no other videos that show such a ground rupture. Rick Aster, a geophysicist at Colorado State University, concurred. "To my knowledge, this is the best video we have of a throughgoing surface rupture of a very large earthquake," Aster told Live Science. This fault slices through central Myanmar in a straight line, north to south. It's a transform fault, just like California's famous San Andreas, where the two plates move side by side against each other.

Below that, the crust still moves, but the crust is more malleable and deforms rather than cracks. —Scientists find hidden mechanism that could explain how earthquakes 'ignite' —Huge earthquake 2,500 years ago rerouted the Ganges River, study suggests Seismologists get good measurements of such ruptures from seismic stations that use GPS to quantify even tiny movements of the crust. "But we don't really understand the dynamics of what happened, exactly how things move," he said. The video might be useful for researchers who are trying to understand those unusual dynamics. "I have no doubt that seismologists will take a very close look at this," Aster said. "It will probably lead to some kind of a publication at some point, if the location and other details can be sorted out."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In his duties with the CBP, Army veteran Bob Thompson was part of the Tucson, Arizona sector's special operations detachment mobile response team and was tasked with coordinating airspace along the border. “I've seen orbs that were off in the distance. He also discussed “a very large triangle” that an agent who was near Yuma, Arizona out on patrol saw fly over him. “The way he described it was at least 100 feet maybe 50 to 100 feet wide, silent, flying right over him,” said Thompson. One video Thompson and Coulthart discussed was taken in November 2019 by an infrared camera on a RC-26B surveillance aircraft that was tracking a group of people who had crossed the border illegally in the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Area. That UFO's thermal signature also didn't match known planes or drones. “They seemed to think it was searching for something,” Thompson said. The new never-before-seen UFO video that Thompson shared reveals a short, cylindrical object moving quickly without any visible wings or propellers, nicknamed “The Cigar.” That video was shot by a Customs and Border Patrol reconnaissance plane in the same vicinity where the rubber duck video was taken. “There's obviously something going on in Arizona along the border areas, more than just illegal immigration,” said Thompson. “No one likes to talk about it freely. Are all of these UFO sightings made by Bob Thompson and other U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents part of the ongoing mystery known as the “Phoenix Lights?” That's what he and others are trying to find out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recent disclosures from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents reportedly confirm a troubling pattern of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) sightings over Arizona's US Air Force training ranges. These encounters, some involving swarms of fast-moving objects, have been reported by active-duty pilots and raise operational, strategic, and homeland security concerns, according to NewsNation. In one documented incident, an object collided with the canopy of an F-16 Viper, a $63 million frontline multirole fighter, causing physical damage and temporarily grounding the aircraft. While the object's origin remains officially undetermined, defense insiders and border intelligence analysts are increasingly pointing to high-tech cartel-operated drones as a plausible source of the disruption. Speaking to NewsNation, he said, “There has been a lot of activity, particularly on the Arizona border. However, the evolution of drone technology, particularly the integration of advanced French and Russian agricultural UAVs, has allowed stealthier reconnaissance missions that are difficult to intercept with current US counter-UAS systems. These platforms are quieter, faster, and often fly under the radar.” The strategic rationale is clear: persistent surveillance of US border operations provides cartels with a critical intelligence advantage. What better way to do that than by infiltrating airspace around military installations?” Former acting ICE Director Tom Homan has also pointed to a growing intelligence nexus between cartel operations and transnational surveillance. The use of drones for real-time reconnaissance over US soil, especially near sensitive military zones, marks a paradigm shift like cartel tactics. In late 2024, mysterious drone sightings over New Jersey caused alarm across multiple counties. Despite weeks of investigation, authorities could not determine the aircraft's origin or operators. “They don't know where the drones are coming from. They don't know who's doing it,” said New Jersey State Assemblyman Brian Bergen at the time. The Department of Defense has yet to provide a conclusive public statement. As technology proliferates and adversaries evolve, the United States may face a new front in asymmetric aerial warfare, where criminal syndicates, not nation-states, conduct intelligence operations over sovereign airspace with near-impunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. If you're a fan of chaos, you surely loved what went down in the NBA Draft Lottery on Monday night. The San Antonio Spurs and the Philadelphia 76ers -- who both were long shots to get top-three picks -- followed at No. And with that settled, let's take a look at some of the big winners and losers on lottery night. The Mavericks have to be thanking their lucky stars that they lost to the Grizzlies in their last Play-In Tournament game. If they win that game, they fall out of the lottery all for the right to get blasted in the first round by top-seeded OKC. Instead, they lose that game, and give themselves a 1.8% chance of landing the No. But I'll be damned if that horse didn't come through, and suddenly a team that traded Luka Dončić, then saw Kyrie Irving blow his ACL, and was right about at the edge of needing to blow the whole thing up, finds itself in prime position to build an immediate contender. The Mavericks have all kinds of options now. They can just draft Cooper Flagg, a player who's probably ready to contribute on a contender right away (sort of like a Chet Holmgren) and who also while locks in Dallas' future as the sort of two-way building block Nico Harrison can't stop telling the world he covets. If Kyrie Irving can come back around January, which Dallas is optimistic about, an Irving-Flagg-Anthony Davis trio with shooters and a bunch of defenders around them is, dare I say, probably a more complete and capable team than one that was going to be led by Dončić. 1 pick on the open market and see what comes back. Giannis Antetokounmpo is going to be up for discussion. Can you imagine a Kyrie-Davis-Giannis trio? This is absolutely crazy how this has flipped, on a 1.8% chance, from a franchise on fire to a top-tier contender that has stumbled onto an almost impossible pathway to both short- and long-term success. 1 pick, the Hornets would've palatable if only for the chance to team up with LaMelo Ball, and the Jazz are in good hands with Danny Ainge and figure to be capable of building a small-market winner. Going to Washington would've been the worst. But now Flagg doesn't have to mess with any of those losing teams. He's either heading to a good team in the Mavericks with a chance to compete right away or he's going to be in a trade, perhaps to Milwaukee, which is fading as a desirable destination but, alas, isn't Washington. After signing Paul George with the expectation that it would catapult it into top-tier contention, Philadelphia saw its season turn into an unmitigated disaster. Joel Embiid only played in 19 games. George only played in 41 and wasn't even close to good enough even in that limited action to justify his four-year, $212M price tag. When the Sixers finally gave up on winning and turned their attention to upping their lottery odds as high as possible, the only thing that could salvage their season was landing a top-six pick. If they landed anywhere outside the top six, they would've lost the pick to OKC. Not only did Philly stay in the top six, it landed the No. Once we knew it was in the running for Flagg, sure, it's a little bit of a disappointment that it didn't get No. But beggars can't be choosers. This is a deep draft and Philadelphia can do a lot with the No. 3 pick, either with a quality young player or, perhaps more likely, as a trade asset. Two years ago they drafted Victor Wembanyama, who feels destined to be one of the greatest players ever barring injury. And now they land the No. 2 pick in this summer's draft despite coming in with just a 6.3% chance of that happening. Just like the Mavericks and Sixers above, the Spurs now have the option of using this pick on yet another young prospect as they build toward one of most promising futures in the league, or they can use it as a trade asset to hit the fast-forward button on their contention timeline. Giannis Antetokounmpo is in play here. San Antonio has the draft assets, young players and matching money to make something happen. Gregg Popovich, now officially off the sidelines and into the top front-office spot, has a major decision to make with this pick, and all the options sound pretty damn good. There were a few teams who started out the season trying to win and went to the tank late, notably the 76ers, Spurs and Pelicans. But the teams that were on the tank from the start, whose sole mission all season was to lose enough games to win the lottery, came up bust. If you're a team without absolutely no chance of competing for a playoff spot, and even more if you're not what we've come to refer to as a destination franchise that can build a winner through free agency, tanking still makes sense. This year that team was the Jazz, who fell to No. It happened to the Pistons in both 2023 and 2024. Finally something didn't go Oklahoma City's way in the draft. Nobody's crying for the Thunder, who still have a treasure trove of assets in addition to one of the most talented and youngest rosters in the league, but had they added another lottery pick here, in this draft, it would've been too crazy to deal with. Good on the Thunder, who have made their own luck, but at least a little bit of it ran out on Monday. This guy was about to go into witness protection after trading Dončić for, relatively speaking, a pathetic return, only to watch Anthony Davis get immediately injured and Kyrie Irving tear his ACL. This guy was done in Dallas. And the next thing you know he steps in you know what and lands Cooper Freaking Flagg -- who, just to repeat everything from above, can either be Dallas' future franchise player or its ticket to Giannis Antetokounmpo. Players like Luka might come around every couple decades. When you just give one away, as Harrison and the Mavericks did, you are signing up for the possibility that a player like that will never wear your uniform again. But Harrison, on a 1.8% prayer, gets gifted a basketball miracle to start the cover-up process for what will always be one of the dumbest trades in sports history. If you like to trumpet NBA conspiracy theories -- that the league rigs playoff games, lottery spots, et cetera for business purposes -- then Monday night was your time to shine. Let's be honest, the league did not want to see Cooper Flagg dying a slow basketball death in Washington or Charlotte or even Utah. It was also watching the Mavericks, a pretty premier franchise, go up in flames. It also has every incentive to make the Spurs as good as possible, as quickly as possible, to maximize the marketing bonanza that Victor Wembanyama stands to be. And clearly the Sixers, another high-profile team, getting a top pick to put a tourniquet on their bleed out is in the best interest of the league. And what do you know, against extraordinary odds ... it all happened. Not one of those things. Put all those outcomes together, and the chances of it happening are miniscule.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2000s were a television golden age for both cable and network programming. While prestige dramas like The Sopranos and Breaking Bad produced legendary antiheroes navigating shades of gray with grit and realism, genre shows such as Lost and Supernatural escalated the stakes, exploring similar themes by transforming characters into literal deities. It was a bold narrative dichotomy, challenging viewers with network episodic television like never before. The veteran character actor performed a rare spiritual twofer in the late 2000s, embodying both divine protector and fallen angel across two genre-defining series. As Jacob, the actor watched over the Lost island with a relaxed yet all-powerful presence, while his Lucifer terrorized Supernatural with a mellow, patient menace. Lost, ABC's groundbreaking mid-aughts TV drama, famously followed survivors of a plane crash stranded on a mysterious island with supernatural tendencies. When Pellegrino finally appeared as Jacob, a heavily hinted-at character before his debut in the Season 5 finale, audiences got a proxy to address these thematic and plot-forward puzzles head-on. Throughout its six season, Lost introduced massive and mind-blowing plot twists changing the show in irrevocable ways and these are some of the best. What makes the performance significant isn't technical virtuosity but tonal control. Jacob carries the burden of immortality without broadcasting it. Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker complained that Pellegrino made Jacob "more of a pious simp than a sturdy conveyor of Lost wisdom." Others recognized something more nuanced—a world-weary guardian tired of human folly but bound to protect it anyway. Supernatural, The CW's super-long-running fantasy-horror series, followed brothers Sam and Dean Winchester as they hunted monsters across America. After years of build-up, Supernatural Season 5 introduced a climactic event befitting its title: the literal biblical apocalypse, catalyzed by Lucifer being freed from Hell, seeking to destroy humanity. Two years after Jacob's introduction, Pellegrino stepped into another metaphysical archetype, albeit on the opposite side of the sanctity spectrum. Joining another rabid fan-base-boasting program, Supernatural, Pelligrino played Lucifer himself. Though the role showcased the actor as a dynamo, Pellegrino's Satan didn't rely on scenery-chewing excess like most do. Instead, he built something more disturbing: a calm, collected Devil with legitimate grievances, not so far removed from Jacob in Lost. His Lucifer didn't rage, but rather pervaded and persuaded. The Supernatural series finale divided fans, but four years before then, it had the perfect ending for Sam and Dean Winchester with "Alpha and Omega." -The garden scene with Sam in "The Devil You Know" -Return from The Cage in Season 11's "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" Pellegrino found an unexpected approach to playing the supreme evil: making him empathetic. "Lucifer's problem is very human," he told Smashing Interviews. Despite the ethical polarity of Jacob and Lucifer, Pellegrino portrays them as fundamentally similar. Both gently manipulate characters, occupying the margins and operating unseen, all to achieve their brand of cosmic balance. Pellegrino brought immediate authority to both of his mythic roles. Lucifer's presence implied an invasion of personal space without overacting or active intimidation, thanks to Pellgrino's imposing figure and subtly insidious demeanor. Both characters possess quiet power but deploy it to achieve opposite ends. "They were very different takes on the world and not so different takes on how to go about getting what you want because I think Jacob was very mission-oriented as well. And wouldn't stop until he finished his experiment, so there was a certain synchronicity between the parts." Supernatural introduced several characters in memorable ways that revealed to the audience who they truly are in a single scene. In limited, late, or mid-series appearances as Jacob and Lucifer, Pellegrino became an embodiment of evidence that the distance between heaven and hell might not be so far after all. As two sides of the same cosmic coin, each convinced of its rightness, each blind to its flaws, Pellegrino's performances proved that morality is, mostly, about perspective. And though the actor hasn't headlined a prestige series or won major awards, his ability to transform archetypes into fully-realized beings makes him television's most unsung secret weapon—screentime and accolades be damned. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth. The survivors of a plane crash are forced to work together in order to survive on a seemingly deserted tropical island. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Supernatural had an unofficial crossover with The Walking Dead, introducing alternate worlds and creating a great way to bring Negan into the revival. When Crowley died in Supernatural Season 12, Mark Sheppard left the series on not-so-great terms with one or more of the executives. The Last of Us makes a dent in Ellie's mission to find Abby by killing the first of her friends, only to reflect two scenes involving her enemies. Buffy the Vampire Slayer has many great characters, but there are still some that deserve way more screen time. Andor is a series for adult fans, but those interested in the full Mon Mothma story need to watch her episodes in the animated Star Wars: Rebels show.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tassili n'Ajjer is a vast plateau in south-east Algeria at the borders of Libya, Niger and Mali, covering an area of 72,000 sq. From 10,000 BC to the first centuries of our era, successive peoples left many archaeological remains, habitations, burial mounds and enclosures which have yielded abundant lithic and ceramic material. However, it is the rock art (engravings and paintings) that have made Tassili world famous as from 1933, the date of its discovery. Algeria's Sahara Desert, a barren and mysterious expanse spanning millions of square kilometers, reveals secrets that will forever change our view of the universe. Archaeologists and scientists who have conducted research in this remote region of southeastern Algeria continue to question the possibility of an extraterrestrial presence. The dating of these astonishing figures goes back to at least 12,000 years BCE, if not much earlier. The transition from one cultural style to another should never be imagined as a clear and brief break. One can imagine a sort of cross-fade of images, like in the cinema, to give the impression that many inseparable events are occurring. For some, perhaps an extraterrestrial visit to Earth in the distant past. Could the Sahara, once a verdant region crisscrossed by rivers and populated by life tens of thousands of years ago, have been a point of contact with a civilization from the stars?
