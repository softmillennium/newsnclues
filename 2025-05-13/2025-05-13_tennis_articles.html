Swiatek left Jim Courier shocked after she fell to Danielle Collins, although world number one Aryna Sabalenka remains on track for success at the WTA 1000 event. Discussing American women other than Gauff who they think can shine at Roland Garros, Johnson said on the Nothing Major podcast: “I am going to go off the beaten track here and say Peyton Stearns can make a bit of a run. READ MORE: WTA Italian Open 2025 – how to watch, top players, prize money & predictions She is going to be flying completely under the radar, unless she titles this week, because there are so many American women ahead of her. As Johnson mentioned, Stearns has picked up some huge wins at the Italian Open, knocking out Osaka and Keys. Both players are Grand Slam champions, with Stearns having also beaten Nuria Brancaccio and Anna Kalinskaya in Rome. Discussing her chances at the French Open later this month, Isner said: “She is playing well. Early on in the season she lost a lot of close matches. “But winning two matches in a row, 7-6 in the third is going to do her confidence a lot of favours going forward. I like her game and she could certainly be someone who can make a lot of noise at the French Open.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — Novak Djokovic is splitting with coach Andy Murray just two weeks ahead of the French Open, following a dismal start to the clay-court season. Murray's representatives announced Tuesday that the two former No. “Thanks to Novak for the unbelievable opportunity to work together and thanks to his team for all their hard work over the past six months,” Murray was quoted as saying. The decision comes after Djokovic lost his opening match in his last two tournaments in Monte Carlo and Madrid, both on clay. Djokovic thanked Murray in a post on social media “for all the hard work, fun & support over last six months on & off the court.” “I really enjoyed deepening our friendship together,” Djokovic wrote. Djokovic and Murray joined forces ahead of the Australian Open in what initially was seen as an unlikely pairing. After Murray retired last year, Djokovic reached out with the coaching proposition. Djokovic said in February that Murray had agreed to stay on for an “indefinite” period, including “some clay-court tournaments” this season. Djokovic has yet to win a tournament this season after having to retire from the Australian Open semifinals with a hamstring injury and losing in the final in Miami to leave him one shy of 100th career title.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS (AP) — Three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka and French veteran Richard Gasquet were among eight men given wild-card entries Tuesday for the French Open. Wawrinka, who turned 40 in March, won the Australian Open in 2014 for his first Grand Slam singles title and added major wins at the French Open in 2015 and the 2016 U.S. Open. The Swiss player has battled injuries in recent years and has dropped to No. 132 in the ATP rankings. Gasquet will be playing his final tournament in Paris. The 38-year-old Frenchman, who reached a career-best ranking of No. 7 back in 2007, was once regarded as a potential Grand Slam winner but could never get past the semifinals at any major. Gasquet reached the Wimbledon semifinals twice and was also a semifinalist at the U.S Open. He claimed 16 tour titles and was a member of the France team that won the 2017 Davis Cup. The French Open runs from May 25 to June 8. French Open wild cards: Women's singles (main draw) Iva Jovic, United States. Tiantsoa Sarah Rakotomanga Rajaonah, France. Men's singles (main draw) Emilio Nava, United States.</p>

Their split comes after the 24-time grand slam champion lost the first match at his past two tournaments

Andy Murray will no longer coach former rival Novak Djokovic, ending their six-month partnership, the pair announced on Tuesday.

Djokovic stunned the tennis world in November when he said he had hired the retired Murray, who had no track record as a coach, to lead his off-court team.

But the two 37-year-olds have already parted company, with Britain's Murray thanking Serbia star Djokovic for an “unbelievable opportunity”.

Their split comes after Djokovic, the winner of a record 24 men's grand slam singles titles, endured a difficult start to the season – including losing the first match at his last two tournaments.

“Thanks to Novak for the unbelievable opportunity to work together and thanks to his team for all their hard work over the past six months,” Murray said in a statement.

“I wish Novak all the best for the rest of the season,” added the Scot, who defeated Djokovic in the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon finals to win two of his three grand slam titles.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner has played so far in Rome like he never left, but he is about to face a stern test in Francisco Cerundolo. Fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti will also be in round of 16 action against Daniil Medvedev. 1 has been playing throughout the entire spring. He dropped into the Internazionali BNL d'Italia last week and has plowed his way into the round of 16. But the fact is that he had a three-month layoff and his fourth-round match against Francisco Cerundolo is the first time he will be put to the test. Cerundolo, a scrappy Argentine, is playing fantastic clay-court tennis. Still, it's hard to draw too many conclusions based on that alone. Their last meeting was in 2023 before Sinner became the major-winning champion he is today. Look for Cerundolo to challenge Sinner in this one. Yes, the Italian will be playing in front of an enthusiastic home crowd–but Cerundolo is just playing too well to give in too easily. Sinner should pull through, but not without some effort. Daniil Medvedev has had some good success on the clay courts of Rome. It's also his only career clay title. But whether it will be enough to overcome his comparatively lackluster form remains to be seen. Medvedev played pretty well in Monte-Carlo a few weeks ago, when he reached the quarterfinals. But he has just come up short more often than not in 2025. That he faces Lorenzo Musetti in the fourth round is not good news for the Russian. Musetti Is enjoying some of the best form of any player on the ATP Tour right now. All of this spells trouble for Medvedev's prospects to make it into the business end of the tournament.
