                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pioneering research study published today in Cell Metabolism details how the hormone FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21) can reverse the effects of fatty liver disease in mice. University of Oklahoma researcher Matthew Potthoff, Ph.D., is the lead author of the study, which provides valuable insight about the mechanism of action of the hormone, which is a target for a new class of highly anticipated drugs that are in Phase 3 clinical trials. It can progress to MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis) during which fibrosis and, ultimately, cirrhosis can occur. MASLD is becoming a very big problem in the United States, affecting 40% of people worldwide, and there is currently only one treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat MASH. A new class of drugs, based on FGF21 signaling, is showing good therapeutic benefits in clinical trials, but until now, the mechanism for how they work has been unclear," said Potthoff, a professor of biochemistry and physiology at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine and deputy director of OU Health Harold Hamm Diabetes Center. The hormone also sent a separate signal directly to the liver, specifically to lower cholesterol. Similar to the family of weight loss drugs known as GLP-1s (glucagon-like peptide 1), which help regulate blood sugar levels and appetite, FGF21 acts on the brain to regulate metabolism. In addition, both are hormones produced from peripheral tissues – GLP-1 from the intestine and FGF21 from the liver – and both work by sending a signal to the brain. It is interesting that this metabolic hormone/drug works primarily by signaling to the brain instead of to the liver directly, in this case. FGF21 is quite powerful because it not only led to a reduction of fat, but it also mediated the reversal of fibrosis, which is the pathological part of the disease, and it did so while the mice were still eating a diet that would cause the disease. Now, we not only understand how the hormone works, but it may guide us in creating even more targeted therapies in the future." FGF21 reverses MASH through coordinated actions on the CNS and liver.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) from brain scans using AI could support future stroke care, according to a recent study published in the Karger journal Cerebrovascular Diseases. A new study recently published in the journal Cerebrovascular Diseases shows that artificial intelligence (AI) may help physicians detect a common, but often hidden, cause of stroke by analyzing brain scans. The condition in focus is atrial fibrillation (AF) - a type of irregular heartbeat that increases stroke risk by five times. Because AF may not initially present symptoms, it often goes undiagnosed until a stroke has already occurred. Traditional detection methods, such as prolonged heart monitoring, can be expensive, invasive, and time-consuming. This new research from the Melbourne Brain Centre and the University of Melbourne takes a different approach. By training a machine learning model on MRI images from patients who have already had strokes, the team taught the algorithm to recognize patterns linked to AF. The researchers found that their AI model had "reasonable classification power" in telling apart strokes caused by AF from those caused by blocked arteries. In testing, the model achieved a strong performance score (AUC 0.81), suggesting that AI could become a valuable tool in helping doctors identify patients who might need further heart testing or treatment. As the study notes, "machine learning is gaining greater traction for clinical decision-making and may help facilitate the detection of undiagnosed AF when applied to magnetic resonance imaging." Because MRIs are already a routine part of stroke care, this method doesn't require extra scans or procedures for patients - making it a low-cost, non-invasive way to support more targeted care. "Early detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) is important to offer patients the best chance of preventing a serious cardioembolic stroke. However, many patients first present with an acute ischemic stroke for which the underlying cause of AF is silent because it is asymptomatic and intermittent," says Craig Anderson, Editor-in-Chief of the journal Cerebrovascular Diseases. "The work by Sharobeam et al. presents a novel approach to use AI-based algorithm to inform the diagnosis of AF according to the pattern of cerebral ischemia on MRI." Detecting atrial fibrillation by artificial intelligence enabled neuroimaging examination.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Each year, millions of women undergo mammography to screen for breast cancer, yet tiny calcium specks—known as microcalcifications—often evade detection or are misread, leading to delayed diagnoses or unnecessary biopsies. Conventional computer-aided tools rely on hand-crafted rules and struggle with the sheer variety of imaging devices and lesion patterns. In a recent study led by Dr. Ke-Da Yu from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, a novel deep-learning approach that automatically finds and classifies microcalcifications across different machines and patient populations was developed—bringing both accuracy and consistency to breast-cancer screening. "Microcalcifications can be just a few pixels wide. "We wanted a system that adapts to any mammogram and never overlooks early warning signs." The team's innovation rests on two key advances: In blind testing, the pipeline processed each mammogram, achieving approximately 75% overall accuracy at the microcalcification-lesion level with 76% sensitivity for malignant lesions and about 72% accuracy at the breast level. "This solution can be deployed directly on standard radiology workstations," adds Dr. Yu. "By pre-marking suspicious regions on each mammogram, it enables radiologists to quickly focus on areas of concern, significantly reducing both missed diagnoses and unnecessary biopsies—thereby easing patient discomfort and lowering healthcare costs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation (TIBI) have developed a technique that could help advance treatments in tissue engineering. Using a simple light-based 3D printing method, the team created microgels with controlled internal architectures. These structures helped guide how cells behave and grow, mimicking the way cells naturally behave in the body. This breakthrough addresses a major challenge in creating realistic, functional tissue environments critical for tissue repair and regeneration. Our technique enables the production of microtissue with precise structural control, which is essential for engineering tissues such as muscle, and retina. We're enabling a new class of modular biomaterials that can actively guide tissue formation and engineering organ through the bottom-up approach." The study showed that these microgels could be used in a variety of ways. In one example, the team placed muscle cells inside rod-shaped gels, which helped the cells align and form muscle fibers, a promising step towards injectable treatments for muscle injuries. In another case, they used the gels to hold photoreceptor cells, which naturally organized themselves into layers similar to the outer retina, offering potential for future retinal therapies. The researchers also added angiogenic peptides to the gels which encouraged new blood vessel growth, both in vitro and in vivo. The microgels maintain their shape during injection and are designed to support cell growth, new blood vessel formation, and tissue growth. Their flexible design supports customization for various medical uses, making them a promising tool for wound care, organ repair, and studying diseases. "This work represents a significant step toward creating structures that can form functional tissues" said Dr. Ali Khademhosseini, CEO of TIBI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The results of an international study led by researchers from Queen Mary University of London's Precision Healthcare University Research Institute (PHURI) shed new light the underlying biological mechanisms which cause differences in health risks, symptoms and outcomes between males and females. Using data from UK Biobank and the Fenland study, the team carried an in-depth analysis of the genetic links between ~6,000 proteins and hundreds of diseases in 56,000 males and females. The team found that for two-thirds of these proteins, their levels differed between males and females. Further examination revealed that only a very small fraction, around 100 proteins out of the 6,000 studied, had differences in the genetic 'switches' which control their levels, when compared between males and females. These findings, which may have implications for drug development, indicate that while there are differences between the sexes in relation to how much they express certain proteins, what's causing these differences isn't solely down to differences in their genetics. Their findings indicate that non-medical factors such as where people work and live, their education, financial situation, access to resources, as well as their lifestyle also contribute to the health differences experiences between the sexes and so should be explored further and considered more when exploring sex differences in health. Mine Koprulu, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary's PHURI, said: "For the first time in history, we are able to study human biology at this level of detail-across genes, proteins, and more. This is the largest study to date exploring the similarities and differences in how our genetic code regulates blood protein levels between sexes. Our findings highlight the need to better understand the factors that impact health differences - at the genetic level and beyond- to create more tailored and equitable healthcare for everyone." Professor Claudia Langenberg, Director of the PHURI at Queen Mary and Professor of Computational Medicine at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Germany, said: "Drug development pipelines increasingly incorporate information on genetic differences in protein levels and function and this has led to large investment in human cohorts, such as UK Biobank. From this perspective, better understanding of population differences in the regulation of proteins, such as those between males and females, is essential to guide precision medicine approaches and identify where one size may not fit all. Our results clearly show that with very few exceptions, protein regulating genetic variants identified so far behave in a very similar way in males and females. This provides evidence for an important implicit assumption – that insights arising from studying these variants apply to both sexes." The authors acknowledge that chromosomal information does not always align with an individual's gender identity. However, for the purposes of this study (genetic and protein-level scientific analyses), this categorisation was necessary, and data on gender identity was not reliably recoded meaning it could not be consistently used across all data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine furthered research on semaglutide, exploring how the drug affected outcomes for people with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, a type of liver disease. The results suggest that semaglutide may help resolve steatohepatitis and decrease fibrosis. This research was a phase 3 clinical trial involving people with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). As described in this study, MASH is a severe type of what used to be called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Steatohepatitis, which involves fat buildup and inflammation in the liver, can then contribute to tissue scarring or fibrosis. This study involved participants from hundreds of clinical sites in thirty-seven countries. Participants received 2.4mg injections of semaglutide each week, and they followed a 16-week dose escalation schedule. Other exclusion criteria included components like alcohol consumption over a certain amount and use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the three months leading up to screening. Participants got two liver biopsies to help evaluate the effects of semaglutide. The researchers evaluated participants for two main outcomes: resolution of steatohepatitis, where liver fibrosis didn't get worse, and improved fibrosis, where steatohepatitis did not get any worse. Researchers also evaluated participants for weight changes, pain, adverse events, and labs. Almost 63% of participants who received semaglutide had steatohepatitis resolution without their fibrosis getting worse. Only 34.3% of participants in the placebo group experienced this outcome. Results were similar in sensitivity analyses that considered components like age, diabetes, and how bad fibrosis was. The semaglutide group also experienced an average 10.5% decrease in body weight compared to only an average 2% decrease in the placebo group. While it did not reach statistical significance, participants taking semaglutide also appeared to experience pain decreases more than the placebo group. Participants in the semaglutide group had better outcomes from non-invasive testing as well. However, researchers found that “no new or liver-related safety signals emerged.” Overall, the results of this study indicate that semaglutide may help improve liver outcomes for people with MASH. There may be a need for more diversity in future research, and it's unclear how the use of semaglutide benefits lean individuals with MASH. Researchers did not have data on biomarkers for alcohol consumption. They also acknowledge that genetic variations are part of what determines how someone responds to treatment. Thus, researchers did not share some information about clinical outcomes in this paper for reasons of study integrity. This part of the study included 800 randomized participants, and this did not have to do with how well participants were following taking semaglutide or the placebo or certain medication changes. Researchers acknowledge that semaglutide helped to address problems of metabolic dysfunction that drive liver problems and holistically helped address “liver disease and associated cardiometabolic illness.” Mir Ali, MD, board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, who was not involved in the study, noted the following to Medical News Today: We see significant improvement in MASH in our surgical weight loss patients, and it seems to be directly related to the amount of weight lost. The clinical implications are that this shows another benefit to weight loss associated with use of semaglutide.” This research holds promise for helping people with MASH and suggests another potential benefit of semaglutide. Ian Storch, DO, an osteopathic physician specializing in gastroenterology and internal medicine and an American Osteopathic Association member, who was also not involved in the study, explained to MNT: “MASH (Metabolic Associated Hepatitis) is such an important disease, which didn't get much attention in the past for two reasons, one being our deficiency in cost-effective noninvasive imaging modalities to assess fibrosis and the second being our lack of treatment modalities. Ozempic (semaglutide) is a prescription injection that helps manage blood sugar levels and lower risk of cardiovascular problems in adults with type 2… In this edition of Medical Myths, we focus on diabetes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unprecedented progress in reducing the number of women smoking during pregnancy in England could be put at risk by NHS funding cuts, according to a UEA addiction expert. A new BMJ article, co-authored by Prof Caitlin Notley from UEA's Norwich Medical School, reveals that the proportion of women smoking during pregnancy in England has almost halved in the last decade. And they are calling for continued investment to give every child a smokefree start in life. It shows how the amount of women smoking during pregnancy dropped from 11.7 per cent in 2014/15 to 5.9 per cent as of Q3 2024/25. The progress on reducing rates of smoking in pregnancy has accelerated in recent years, thanks to the focused efforts of all healthcare professionals involved in the pregnancy care pathway. However, there remain significant inequalities, as rates of smoking remain higher in deprived areas - suggesting that we need innovative targeted approaches for those who really struggle to quit." Prof. Caitlin Notley, Professor of Addiction Sciences at UEA Stop smoking support in some hospitals and mental health services has already been cut, according to the group, with further cuts expected. Prof Linda Bauld, director of the SPECTRUM Research Consortium, co-chair of the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group and co-author of the BMJ article said: "The evidence is clear that stop smoking support for pregnant women has played a vital role in reducing rates of maternal smoking and saving babies' lives. Without continued investment in these services there is a real risk that this decline could stall, or even start to reverse, with tragic consequences for parents and families." Dr Clea Harmer, chief executive of Sands and co-chair of the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group, said: "As the government sets its sights on a smokefree generation, now is not the time to be cutting investment in these services. Instead, they should be going further and faster to ensure every child has a smokefree start in life." John Waldron, policy and public affairs manager at Action on Smoking and Health and co-author of the BMJ article said: "The 2024 Labour manifesto committed to ensuring that all hospitals integrate smoking cessation support into routine care. The government must deliver on this commitment by protecting funding for these lifesaving services." Learn how experts are advancing benzodiazepine analysis and detection using insights from the lab.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study of U.S. adults finds that excess central fat, measured by LAP, is linked to lower spinal bone density, only after reaching a certain tipping point, suggesting a new early warning sign for osteoporosis. Study: The association between lipid accumulation products and bone mineral density in U.S. In a recent study in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers evaluated the association between a new indicator of lipid accumulation, 'lipid accumulation products (LAP)', and bone mineral density (BMD). The study dataset comprised 3,883 (mean age = 39.33 yrs; 45.48% women) NHANES participants with analyses including subgroup, interaction, and threshold analyses, adjusted for covariates. Study findings revealed a non-linear negative relationship between LAP and lumbar BMD, with the negative association observed only above a specific LAP threshold (ln-LAP ≈ 2.85); below this value, no significant association was found. Interaction analysis indicated no influence of subgroups, suggesting that the observed pattern held across demographic and health characteristics. These findings suggest the clinical utility of LAP as a bioindicator and predictor of osteoporosis, providing valuable insights that may lead to earlier intervention strategies in treating these chronic diseases. The chronic condition is a growing public health concern, with an estimated 158 million adults (>50 yrs) living with the condition. Alarmingly, prediction models suggest that this number will only double by 2040, highlighting the need for prevention, early detection, and intervention against this societal burden. Interestingly, validated studies have revealed that body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) – obesity's most common metrics – are insufficient predictors of osteoporosis due to the latter's nuanced relationship with adipose tissue and lean tissue. Lipid accumulation products (LAP) is a relatively novel lipid accumulation scoring system that combines serum triglyceride (TG) levels with WC to compute an estimate of central obesity. The measure has been at the center of recent scientific discussion and research due to growing evidence that it can potentially predict the risks of several health conditions, including diabetes and other metabolic syndromes, insulin resistance, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and even osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, the association between LAP and osteoporosis (bone mineral density [BMD]) has never been formally established. The present study aims to address this knowledge gap and inform future research on interventions against osteoporosis by evaluating the relationship between LAP and BMD on a nationally representative United States (U.S.) cohort. The study hopes to facilitate improved recognition, early detection, and enhanced prevention of future osteoporosis incidence. Study data were obtained from participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) program conducted by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Participants younger than 20 and those with missing lumbar BMD, LAP, or covariate data were excluded from subsequent analyses. The exposure variable (LAP) was computed using the following formula: Men – WC (cm)–65 × TG (mmol/l), Women – WC (cm)–58 × TG (mmol/l). Data for these computations were obtained from serum sample triglyceride measurements. The outcome variable (lumbar BMD) was measured using a fan-beam densitometer conforming to International Society for Clinical Bone Densitometry (ISCD) guidelines. Covariates of interest included age, race, gender, BMI, education, poverty income ratio (PIR), laboratory blood assays, smoking and alcohol status, and chronic disease status. Of the 39,156 NHANES records initially enrolled in the study, 16,539 and 18,374 were excluded based on age and missing data, respectively, leaving a final dataset of 3,883 participants (mean age = 39.33 yrs; 45.48% female). Regression models revealed a negative association between LAP and lumbar BMD, confirmed via threshold analyses that identified a threshold value for LAP (ln-LAP ≈ 2.85). Importantly, the negative association between LAP and BMD was only observed when LAP values were above this threshold; below this point, no significant association was found. Notably, associations between LAP and BMD were observed to be non-linear. The study authors note that, while the analysis used a large, nationally representative dataset and adjusted for many potential confounders, it is cross-sectional in nature and therefore cannot establish causality. Additionally, the analysis was limited to lumbar spine BMD, as relevant data for femur BMD were unavailable in the used NHANES cycles. Further research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms linking LAP and bone density and to verify these findings in prospective studies. The present study uses a large, nationally representative U.S. dataset to establish and describe the relationship between LAP and BMD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review in Genes and Diseases explores the central role of MYC, a master regulatory protein, in the development and progression of cancer, spotlighting its potential as a multidimensional therapeutic target. MYC is dysregulated in nearly 70% of human cancers, where it influences a vast network of biological processes including cell cycle control, metabolism, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. The article underscores how MYC not only drives aggressive tumor behavior but also contributes significantly to drug resistance, making it one of the most compelling yet complex targets in oncology. Researchers are now devising strategies to target MYC directly by interfering with the MYC-MAX protein complex, which activates numerous cancer-related genes. Promising compounds, such as OMO-103, have demonstrated early clinical potential by disrupting this interaction and halting tumor proliferation. Beyond direct approaches, the review also emphasizes indirect targeting strategies, including inhibition of MYC transcription or translation, promotion of protein degradation, and synthetic lethality-wherein pathways essential to MYC-overexpressing cells are selectively disrupted. These methods aim to exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells that depend heavily on MYC for survival, while sparing healthy tissues. The therapeutic potential of MYC targeting is further enhanced by innovations in small molecule inhibitors, protein degradation technologies like PROTACs, and combination therapies that integrate MYC inhibition with existing treatments. These approaches are being designed with an eye toward precision medicine, tailoring interventions based on tumor-specific MYC activity and associated molecular pathways. Because MYC interacts with a wide array of partners and affects diverse signaling cascades, context-dependent effects must be carefully considered. Targeting MYC too broadly might risk unintended consequences, such as impairing normal regenerative processes or inducing premature cellular aging. Still, with improved molecular understanding and refined drug design, the tide is turning in favor of MYC-directed interventions. This review calls attention to MYC as not just a notorious oncogene, but a gateway to novel, more effective cancer treatments-redefining what is therapeutically possible for one of the most elusive yet consequential drivers of malignancy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health professionals will have access to national clinical practice guidelines to help assess and diagnose fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), following a 4-year research project led by The University of Queensland. Dr. Natasha Reid from UQ's Child Health Research Centre, who led the collaborative project involving more than 40 organizations, said it is a groundbreaking development in the assessment and diagnosis of FASD, which is the leading cause of non-genetic disability in Australia. "FASD is a lifelong disability arising from prenatal exposure to alcohol, but every individual is unique with areas of both strength and challenges," Dr. Reid said. Dr. Reid said having access to assessment and diagnosis will help people understand their unique challenges and strengths, enabling them to better access individualized support. "We hope these new guidelines will enhance assessment and diagnostic practices, improve service accessibility, reduce stigma, and ultimately improve the quality of life for all people living with FASD in Australia," Dr. Reid said. "FASD has typically been diagnosed in specialist clinics, but these guidelines encourage all practitioners, regardless of setting or discipline, to contribute where they can to the assessment. Associate Dean (Research) Professor Karen Moritz, from UQ's Faculty of Health, Medicine and Behavioral Sciences, said a key feature in the development of the guidelines was extensive consultation involving more than 120 health professionals, researchers, cultural experts, along with families and carers of people living with FASD. Through collaborative networks and extensive stakeholder engagement, these new national guidelines for assessment and diagnosis of FASD have the potential to change the life-course for individuals living with FASD."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pilot study suggests that adding gravitational load via a weighted vest during dieting may help older adults maintain weight loss by preserving metabolism, hinting at a novel biological pathway for long-term weight control. A pilot study in older adults living with obesity and osteoarthritis. In a recent article published in the International Journal of Obesity, researchers investigated whether wearing a weighted vest over six months during a calorie restriction intervention to promote weight loss could influence longer-term weight regain among older adults with obesity. They found that participants wearing weighted vests lost similar amounts of weight over the six months but regained only half of the lost weight over 24 months, while those who did not wear the vests regained all of it. Obesity is a considerable public health concern, particularly among older adults. Weight loss through lifestyle-based interventions, which typically result in 8–10% weight loss in a year, is the standard treatment but often fails to maintain long-term results. This failure is mainly due to biological changes following weight loss, such as reduced energy expenditure and increased hunger due to hormonal shifts. Recently, researchers have considered gravitational loading, or how body weight exerts force on the skeleton, as a factor in weight regulation. While most evidence comes from animal studies, one human study showed that increasing gravitational load can lead to small but statistically significant losses in fat mass and body weight over a short period, although the magnitude of weight loss in that study was less than what would be considered clinically meaningful. This study analyzed data collected during follow-ups of a randomized controlled trial that assessed whether wearing a weighted vest during a six-month weight loss intervention is feasible and beneficial for older adults with obesity and arthritis. For this pilot analysis, 18 participants (two groups of nine people), who had finished the six-month program, returned voluntarily for a follow-up over 24 months. All participants followed the dietary plan that was delivered between 1100 and 1300 kcal daily, as well as weekly nutrition and behavioral counseling. The treatment group wore an adjustable weighted vest for at most 10 hours daily during active periods. They did not receive further study protocol or support after the intervention period. RMR was assessed using indirect calorimetry after 12 hours of fasting and no recent exercise. This pilot study involved older adults with an average age of 70.4 years, 83.3% of whom were female, with obesity, who underwent a six-month weight loss intervention, followed by an 18-month follow-up. Both groups achieved similar and significant weight loss during the initial six months; those who wore the vest lost an average of 11.2 kg, while those who did not lost 10.3 kg on average. Approximately one-quarter of this weight loss comprised lean mass. After 24 months, the group wearing vests regained only about half the lost weight, with a net loss of 4.8 kg from baseline, while the group not wearing vests reverted to baseline weight. Lean mass remained lower in the group wearing vests at 24 months, whereas it returned to baseline in those who did not. Notably, RMR decreased less in the group wearing vests at six months, by 16.3 kcal per day, compared to the control group, which showed a decrease of 237.5 kcal per day. Both groups' RMR reverted to baseline by 24 months. A modest inverse correlation was observed between RMR reduction during active weight loss and weight regain during follow-up, suggesting that preserved RMR may support sustained weight loss. However, this association did not reach statistical significance (r = −0.39, p = 0.11). This study suggests that wearing a weighted vest during intentional weight loss may help reduce long-term weight regain, possibly by preserving resting metabolic rate. While both groups initially lost similar amounts of weight, the group wearing vests maintained more weight loss at 24 months. The findings support emerging research on gravitational loading as a factor in weight regulation. Key strengths include the novel intervention, randomized controlled design, and extended follow-up period. However, the study's small sample size and reliance on a convenience sample for the 24-month follow-up limit generalizability. Additionally, the study lacked detailed data on posture (such as standing vs. sitting) and dietary intake during vest wear, which may have affected outcomes. Overall, the pilot findings are promising and suggest that gravitational loading may help sustain weight loss in older adults. Larger, more comprehensive trials are needed to confirm these results and further explore mechanisms such as osteocyte signaling and appetite regulation.
