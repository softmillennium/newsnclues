                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the pair's public sparring and ongoing pranks since costarring on The Voice together, everyone knows that Adam Levine and Blake Shelton are best buds. Now that Levine is back as a coach after a long absence, some fans are missing the friendly bickering that was so prevalent between the two. Luckily, Shelton has announced that he's returning to The Voice, though not as a judge, and Levine has some choice words for his frenemy. A post shared by Adam Levine (@adamlevine) News asked Levine how he felt about Shelton returning to The Voice to perform for the Season 27 finale on May 20, Levine had a prickly reply ready. Even with Shelton gone from the show, Levine has been unable to escape his playful jabs and quips. New coach Kelsea Ballerini added some of Shelton's one-liners to her chair button for ‘backup.' “Adam's a big baby,” the chair speaker blares. She presses the button again, and “Adam won't shut up,” in Shelton's voice rings out. The last time she pushed it, viewers heard “Adam, you say a lot of stupid stuff,” which caused fellow judge, Michael Bublé, to crack up. “It's just been super fun, amazing.” But when asked “what's up their sleeves,” concerning Shelton returning for the finale, he returns to form. “I feel like the show is doing so well, you know? Like, why they would dumb it down — I don't know why they would have him on because it's so elevated right now. And I feel like he just kind of brings it, drags it down into the mud,” he deadpanned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift's longtime lawyers are asking a court to throw out a subpoena they were served by Justin Baldoni in his feud with Blake Lively over the movie It Ends With Us, just a few days after Swift's own reps slammed Baldoni for targeting the pop star with a similar subpoena. The Washington, D.C.-based law firm Venable, which has represented Swift for more than a decade, revealed in a Monday (May 12) motion that Baldoni's lawyers served it with a subpoena on April 29 seeking all communications between the firm on one side and Lively, the actress' husband Ryan Reynolds and/or their attorney Michael Gottlieb on the other. The subpoena specifically name-drops Douglas Baldridge, a Venable partner who's worked with Swift since 2013 and recently returned to the firm after a stint as general counsel at her company, 13 Management. “There is no reason for this subpoena other than to distract from the facts of the case and impose undue burden and expense on a non-party.” The law firm described Baldoni's subpoena as a “fishing expedition,” noting that “even if Venable were somehow involved (again, it is not),” the documents that Baldoni seeks should be sourced from Lively and Reynolds themselves. The actor power couple is supporting Venable in its quest to throw out Baldoni's subpoena, calling it an “abuse of the discovery process” in a court filing on Tuesday (May 13). Revelations of the Venable subpoena come just a few days after Swift's representatives confirmed that she, too, had been served with a document request in the Baldoni-Lively feud. Mirroring the language in Venable's motion, a representative for Swift said she had no involvement in It Ends With Us and slammed the subpoena as “designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.”Venable did not immediately return a request for comment, nor did reps for Swift, Lively, Reynolds or Baldoni. The It Ends With Us legal battle began when Lively launched bombshell claims in December, alleging that Baldoni, her co-star and director on the movie released last summer, sexually harassed her on set and then orchestrated a public relations smear campaign to retaliate against her after she complained. Baldoni's suit said Lively leveraged her close relationship with a “megacelebrity friend,” presumed to be Swift, to take control of the movie. The Baldoni filing includes text messages concerning an alleged meeting attended by “Ryan and Taylor,” seemingly referencing Reynolds and Swift. He was also facing Lively's ‘dragons,' two of the most influential and wealthy celebrities in the world, who were not afraid to make things very difficult for him.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite being three decades since the two starred together in James Cameron's True Lies, the easy banter between Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger makes it seem like it was only yesterday. As Schwarzenegger spoke at Amazon's Upfront event, Curtis came up to playfully take him off the stage. It started with Schwarzenegger talking about his new Amazon film, The Man with the Bag, before he began rambling about getting tricked into speaking, and the best marketing strategies. “You can have the best product in the world, but if they don't know about it, you have nothing! As she grabbed his arm, he protested. Soon, both were off-script, reminiscing about True Lies. But as the two wrapped things up and senior ad executive Alan Moss began to walk out, she yelled, “Hold on, don't come!” She then turned to Schwarzenegger, who uttered “We'll be back,” before the two recreated a True Lies moment with a kiss. “Let me just say this because I'm here with all y'all, because of this man, I have the career I have,” the Freaky Friday actress told the audience. She then explained how significant Schwarzenegger's decision to put her name above the title was to her. “So Jim [Cameron] writes the part for me. So we make the movie and you know, they cut it together and we finished in April, [it] came out in July. I mean it was a really fast thing,” Curtis recalled (via People). And Jim said to me, ‘Jamie, I'm sitting here with Arnold in my office. “And in the contract, it says Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies starring Jamie Lee Curtis,” she continued. “And Jim said to me on the phone, ‘I asked Arnold if I could put you above the title because it's a movie about a marriage, and I think it would be appropriate,' and Arnold, a figure who clearly did not have to say yes, said yes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ABC‘s fall 2025 schedule has an 8 PM – 10 PM 9-1-1 block on Thursdays with the mothership series and the newest spinoff, 9-1-1: Nashville, starring Chris O'Donnell. Like its 9-1-1 predecessors — and in typical Ryan Murphy fashion — the rookie is expected to start with a bang, Craig Erwich, president, Disney Television Group, told Deadline, calling 9-1-1: Nashville, the only new ABC series for next season so far, “a huge priority.” You can watch 9-1-1: Nashville‘s fiery teaser below. The scheduling has potential crossovers written all over it; something 9-1-1 franchise's executive producer Murphy accomplished with 9-1-1 and his other ABC series, Doctor Odyssey, this season. “They have a really special event planned for 9-1-1: Nashville, and although we haven't discussed [crossovers], I think it's an incredible opportunity that I'm sure at some point we'll figure out how to capitalize on. What the 9-1-1‘s been able to do, it's really a master class in television, which is consistently event-izing that show to keep it fresh after all these many years, my hat's off to [showrunner] Tim {Minear] and Ryan for that.” The mothership 9-1-1 delivered a shocker this spring, with male lead Peter Krause‘s Bobby Nash dying as a result of a chemical lab leak, leaving his wife, Athena (Angela Bassett) and his team devastated. Erwich shared his thoughts about the plot twist as a viewer and as an executive who had to sign off on it. He's a beloved character, and there was so much grist for the mill for Angela Bassett, who I thought gave such an incredible performance in both the episode where he died and the funeral,” he said. “Ultimately, it's about the creative, and it was a decision that Tim Minear came to us with, and we supported him, as we always do. It was a really great night of television that created a massive amount — not just of viewing, but really social conversation. And I think it'll give us a lot of momentum going into Thursdays next year. 9-1-1: Nashville is an action procedural about heroic first responders, as well as their family saga of power and glamour set in Tennessee. It stars O'Donnell as Captain Don Sharpe, Jessica Capshaw, LeAnn Rimes and Kimberly Williams-Paisley. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. The high-rise restaurant disaster that kicks off “Final Destination Bloodlines” has a “Looney Tunes” quality to it that some critics will falsely pin on a single falling piano. Delivering the most visually impressive, emotionally compelling, and quick witted “Final Destination” to date, co-directors Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein work wonders with a reboot that shouldn't land nearly as well as it does. Premiere During New Jersey's Lighthouse International Film Festival: Get the Full Lineup Bob Odenkirk Battles Mob Boss Sharon Stone During a Summer Vacation from Hell in Action Sequel ‘Nobody 2' Trailer Twenty-five years since Flight 180 failed to reach Paris, New Line's freak accident series — infamous for its mass-casualty events and Rube Goldberg-inspired kill sequences — returns with an unconventional script written by Guy Busick and Lori Evans. Here, the same narrative scaffolding that brought Laurie Strode and Jamie Lee Curtis back to “Halloween” (2018) meets the more retro side of The Conjuring Universe… but in typical “Final Destination” fashion, there's no slasher villain in sight. “Bloodlines” is a prequel/sequel hybrid that introduces, torments, and revives a legacy final girl, who didn't exist at all before now, over the course of just one film playing opposite the invisible threat of Death. Ambition trips up this highly detailed resurrection just a handful of times, leaving behind a feat of nimble comedic tone and cohesive pacing that's even more effective than the iconic time-loop twist that directly precedes it at the end of the last sequel, “Final Destination 5.” Screws pop loose, glass panels break, and open flames collide with panicked dancers for a chain reaction so fatally funny it could have happened to Wile E. Coyote. It's all triggered by a careless flick of the wrist and cinema's least lucky penny: a fitting new totem for “Final Destination” that shines brightest the instant that crappy kid's piano flattening finally sticks. You can't cheat death without seeing your fate first, and signs have always played an essential part in the “Final Destination” universe. But filmmakers Lipovsky and Stein find their groove in a unique sort of bouncy brutality. Helping a toddler (Jayden Oniah) survive the Skyview carnage, Iris emerges as a fully formed, energized, and sympathetic horror heroine who seems like she's battled through her share of sequels before. Cook, who gets a solid shout-out in “Bloodlines”), new girl Iris Campbell seems to meet her sky-high maker when a piercing scream suddenly jolts “Bloodlines” into the present. Waking up confused in the middle of a college lecture hall in 2025, Stefani Reyes (Kaitlyn Santa Juana) has been having recurring nightmares about her estranged grandmother for months. “Iris.” One of several delightfully melodramatic reveals, that's the first clue this “Final Destination” puzzle won't operate like the earlier ones did. Soon, Stefani is speeding back to her childhood home, demanding answers about Iris and the bizarre fine-dining disaster she endured decades ago. How did Iris escape the certain doom foretold to her by that “Shout!” needle drop? And could that terrible night have something to do with why her only daughter, Darlene (Rya Kihlstedt), abandoned Stefani and her brother, Charlie (Teo Briones), years later? After a rushed reunion with her dad, Marty (Tinpo Lee), Stefani wastes no time contacting even more of her relatives about uprooting the planet's most fucked-up family tree. Haunted by his disturbed mother and her mysterious history, Uncle Howard (Alex Zahara) doesn't want to talk about it. His wife, Aunt Brenda (April Telek), isn't related to Stefani anyway. And as for Erik (Richard Harmon), Julia (Anna Lore), and Bobby (Owen Patrick Joyner) — the coolest cousins to grace a major horror sequel since Alexandra Daddario hit “Texas Chainsaw 3D” — the siblings are mostly loyal to each other. But when it comes to Stefani and her crazy theories about Grandma Iris (Gabrielle Rose), news of the Campbell family's supposed curse isn't welcome. Of course, “Final Destination” rarely wastes time explaining itself to victims who won't listen. The rare reboot with a decent title, “Bloodlines” uses direct confrontation between characters who know each other intimately to revitalize a torture format typically reserved for total strangers. It's vastly more exciting to watch relatives as they simultaneously battle Death's Design and their petty grudges than it is to see single-trait caricatures getting repeatedly yanked through a twisted public health crisis. Having loved these movies since the turn of the century, I'll debase myself with first-person references just long enough to admit that “Bloodlines” gave me everything I could personally need. Ranking these films is a nostalgia-laden minefield that's more sensitive than most, and yet each chapter seems to serve a distinct purpose(*) in retrospect. “Final Destination” (2000) delivers Jeffrey Reddick's original “X-Files” spec script idea in its purest form, but “Final Destination 2” (2003) enjoys the smartest arc of the first five films and has already gone down in history for its indelible highway disaster. Die-hard “Final Destination” obsessives will find plenty to pick apart when it comes to Iris' dubious survival strategy in “Bloodlines.” Suffice to say, Clear Rivers' padded cell has never looked smarter — and some tackier sequences near the end undercut that sparkling first impression from the Skyview. Clever enough to riff on the earlier films' spotty track record with digital effects, the newest “Final Destination” stays a smidge too true to its era by including at least one slow-mo explosion à la Michael Bay. It's a fiery splash of nonsense that's as boring to look at now as it would have been then, but the underwhelming effect feels even more maddening in the middle of near-miss climax that needs all the help it can get. Narrowly saved by a truly genius kicker (one that's oddly reminiscent of Sam Raimi's “Drag Me to Hell,” by the way), “Bloodlines” is the only “Final Destination” that doesn't play both versions of its centerpiece emergency back-to-back. It's also the first of these philosophical kill-a-thons that feels like watching a real flesh-and-blood movie. An emotional death by a thousand darkly comic cuts, “Bloodlines” wracks up little character wins along its way to rendering an impeccable kill featuring the best-written death in the entire series. Intertwining humor, horror, and heart into a jester's crown of thorns, the magnetic actor sacrificed at the main altar of that kill should be immediately canonized a “Final Destination” saint. Silly, delicate, sharp, and mean, “Bloodlines” has its flaws but nevertheless confirms Death's Design as a force worthy of its own special place in the horror hall of fame. A flawless goodbye for Tony Todd, whose enduring affection for the genre community oozes from the screen like a warm hug, “Bloodlines” should appear high on any list of the Candyman's most enchanting performances regardless of when he passed. Instead, this wonderfully weird and lyrical film — a crackling ode to the perverse operatics underpinning accidents no human can explain — lands with the full weight of a frenzied jazz band.

Bob Odenkirk is back as Hutch Mansell AKA the anonymous assassin whose identity was compromised during the ass-kicking 2021 action hit film “Nobody.” Now, four years later, Odenkirk reprises his role for “Nobody 2” and has more than a few enemies to battle onscreen… After inadvertently taking on the Russian mob, Hutch is still $30 million in debt to the criminal organization and is working it off with an unending string of hits on international thugs. During his day job of being a suburban dad and husband to his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen), he realizes that his role as a family man is also in danger. And so, Hutch and his kids decide to go on a vacation, one that quickly turns into a bloodbath as Hutch has to not only protect his family but also his identity from hit men.

But when a minor encounter with some town bullies yanks the family into the crosshairs of a corrupt theme-park operator (John Ortiz) and his shady sheriff (Colin Hanks), Hutch finds himself the focus of the most unhinged, blood-thirsty crime boss he (or anyone) has ever encountered (Sharon Stone).” Timo Tjahjanto directs from a script by Derek Kolstad and Aaron Rabin. He also told The New York Times at the time that “Nobody” was inspired by two real-life break-ins that he experienced. The character was also an extension of his titular “Better Call Saul” role, as Odenkirk explained. “My hope is we get to do a trilogy, and he ends up with nothing,” Odenkirk said of his dreams of a franchise for the character.

While serving as a guest on The Jennifer Hudson Show Tuesday (May 13), Kesha recalled being blown away by the success of “Tik Tok” after it dropped in 2009. “Which was confusing, because I like to think of myself as a fairly intelligent human being. Regardless, there was nothing dumb about what the track would do for her career. “Tik Tok” would launch the California native to superstar status, becoming not just her first solo Billboard Hot 100 entry, but her first No. Fifteen years later, the musician is gearing up to release her sixth studio album, . Her departure from Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records — the founder of which also produced much of Animal — comes after a yearslong legal battle with Dr. Luke over Kesha's claims that he drugged and raped her in 2005, after which he sued her for defamation while calling the allegations “false and shocking.” Their ensuing legal battle continued for nine years before the two parties finally reached a settlement in 2023. Of finally getting to release music fully on her own terms, Kesha told Hudson, “I'm really excited for the world to hear this, because I've been in control of everything.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to details published today by Axios, in Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, Thompson and Tapper write that concern about Biden's declining health was so acute among his staff that “there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.” “Given Biden's age, [his physician Kevin O'Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,” the book adds. Fears over the optics of a president in a wheelchair in the middle of a reelection campaign ultimately stayed their hand, but Thompson and Tapper write that the former president's team began taking precautions to avoid falls or other incidents, including decreasing the amount of walking expected of him, briefing him on routes, and having him wear sneakers more often. In a statement to Axios, a Biden spokesperson said that the former president's stiff gait toward the end of his term had been “caused, in part, by wear and tear to his spine — but that no special treatment was necessary and that it had not worsened.” “Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity … We are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline. “Thank you for being here,” Biden told Clooney, apparently unaware he was speaking to the A-list actor. “You know George,” an aide reportedly told Biden, to no avail. “It was not O.K.,” a Hollywood VIP who saw the exchange told Tapper and Thompson. Another source who spoke to Tapper and Thompson said that staff had “attempted to shield [Biden] from his own staff so many people didn't realize the extent of the decline beginning in 2023.” Trump Is Trying to Take Control of Congress Through Its Library Sean Combs Prosecutors Led with ‘Shock and Awe,' Legal Experts Say Cassie Testifies on Freak-Offs at Sean Combs Trial: 'I Felt Disgusting. When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A year and a half after Casandra “Cassie” Ventura filed her explosive lawsuit against ex-boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs, the R&B singer took the stand Tuesday in front of a packed courtroom to testify against the man she claimed emotionally, physically, and sexually abused her for more than a decade. Ventura's court appearance marks the first time she and Combs have seen each other in person since their 2018 breakup. She arrived in court wearing a long brown dress with brown suede heels, and when she walked in, Combs turned around and stared at her. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts against him. Ventura also described the nature of the “freak-offs,” sexual encounters Combs allegedly orchestrated, and which could last anywhere from 36 hours to four days. Ventura said she was 22 years old when she had her first freak-off, adding, “eventually it became a job for me.” She called the encounters “a very choreographed experience,” testifying that there would be sometimes be blood on the sheets because Combs forced her to have sex while menstruating. I was humiliated” about the freak-offs, breaking down in tears. “My self-worth took a hit,” she testified at one point. Of the copious amount of drugs she said Combs made her take, including cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, and ketamine, she said they were “dissociative and numbing” when used during the freak-offs. Prosecutors asked Ventura to detail the beginning of her relationship with Combs. They had sex for the first time two years later during a trip to Miami, not long after Ventura's 21st birthday.

Ventura went on to describe the control Combs wielded over her life. He kept tabs on her whereabouts and sent staffers out to look for her; decided what she wore and where she lived; and often gave her, what she described, as types of “busy work” — random tasks that kept her occupied when she wasn't with Combs. “He had control over what I did every minute of the day,” Ventura added. Sean #Diddy Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering criminal trial began yesterday.

On Monday, Agnifilo asked U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian if Ventura could already be sitting in the witness box when jurors entered. It also is a source of potential sympathy.” Prosecutors objected, arguing it would be “deeply inappropriate” for the court to treat any witness with a medical condition differently. She'll provide testimony that mirrored her harrowing and graphic civil lawsuit from November 2023 that launched the federal investigation that saw Combs go from a seemingly untouchable billionaire mogul who now faces the possibility of life in prison if he's convicted of the counts against him. Prior to her testimony, Combs' team asked that Ventura's husband, Alex Fine, be barred from hearing her testimony, noting they may want to call him as a witness, per media reports. The two sides agreed that Fine could listen to a majority of Ventura's testimony, but not the allegation that Combs raped her in 2018. On Monday, jurors heard from Israel Florez, a former security manager who worked at the since-shuttered InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles. Florez testified he was present in the immediate moments after Combs kicked and dragged Ventura by a set of elevator banks in March 2016. Surveillance video of the attack, which CNN published last year and was shown to jurors on Monday, shows Combs chasing after Ventura before throwing her to the ground. Florez claimed that Combs had a “devilish stare” and offered what he described as a cash “bribe” to keep the incident quiet, which he refused. Although initially excited by being “involved with people with such notoriety,” Phillip testified that his enthusiasm waned the first time he claimed to witness Combs attack Ventura during a freak-off. Combs then allegedly dragged a screaming Ventura by her hair back to the room, where he heard sounds of slapping and Ventura apologizing and saying, “I'm sorry, I'm sorry!” After that incident, Phillip said he had trouble performing sexually during freak-offs with Ventura and Combs. During one moment they were left alone in another freak-off, Phillip said he tried to warn Ventura of the “danger” that he perceived she was in, asking why she was staying with Combs when he was “hitting” her. Phillip said Ventura attempted to reassure him, saying she'd be OK. Eventually, prosecutors said, Combs forced Ventura to engage in sex with male escorts while he watched and masturbated. Ventura claimed she would have to camp out in hotels and Combs' mansion until the bruising from physical beatings faded. Outside the bedroom, Combs allegedly controlled all aspects of Ventura's life and career. While Combs' team admitted in opening statements that the mogul was physically abusive to Ventura, they reminded jurors that Combs was not being prosecuted for domestic violence in this case. Instead, they claim Ventura was a consenting adult and had personal motivations for being in a relationship with Combs and later pursuing litigation against him.

Orlando Bloom and Domhnall Gleeson also star in the movie about two sisters so close that they start digging a tunnel through a mountain range that HanWay is promoting to buyers at the Cannes market.

Bucking Fastard, the new feature film written and directed by the legendary Werner Herzog (Grizzly Man, Fitzcarraldo) and starring sisters Kate Mara (House of Cards, The Martian) and Rooney Mara (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Carol), as well as Orlando Bloom (The Lord of the Rings) and Domhnall Gleeson (Ex Machina), now has a first-look image. 


	It shows the sisters who star in the “deeply intertwined lead roles of Jean and Joan Holbrooke,” marking the first time they have appeared on screen together.




	Bloom plays their rowdy ex-lover, Gareth Mulroney, while Gleeson portrays Timothy, their government-issued social worker/mender who is trying to help them “adapt to modern life after the two become tabloid sensations.”

	A synopsis of the movie reads: “Set in both contemporary urban modernity and against the epic untamed wilds of Ireland, Bucking Fastard is about two sisters who are so close to each other that they speak in unison, love the same man, and have the same dreams. They even make the same slip of tongue in unison. In search of an imaginary land, the Orkneys – where true love is possible – they start digging a tunnel through an entire mountain range.”


	The film is produced by Clara Wu Tsai (Blue Bayou), Ariel Leon Isacovitch (Theater of Thought), and Agnes Chu (Spiderhead), with Kieran Corrigan, Emanuele Moretti and Andrea Bucko. 


	Principal photography wrapped in late April, with HanWay Films having boarded the movie to handle worldwide sales. HanWay said it would be sharing first footage from Dublin and Sligo, Ireland and Slovenia with buyers at the Cannes film market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Queens of the Stone Age have announced a new concert film. Alive in the Catacombs documents a largely acoustic performance that the band—accompanied by a three piece string section—recorded in the Catacombs of Paris last July, around the time frontman Josh Homme underwent emergency surgery that led the group to cancel some tour dates. Directed by Thomas Rames, the film will premiere June 5 via Queens of the Stone Age's website. “We're so stripped down because that place is so stripped down, which makes the music so stripped down, which makes the words so stripped down… It would be ridiculous to try to rock there,” Homme said in a press statement. “All those decisions were made by that space. That space dictates everything, it's in charge. You do what you're told when you're in there.” He also described the catacombs' several million human remains as “the biggest audience we've ever played for.” Revisit Zach Schonfeld‘s review of Queens of the Stone Age's 2023 album, In Times New Roman....

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, the fallen rap mogul's trial began in earnest with opening statements followed by testimony from two witnesses, with Cassie Ventura's testimony pushed to Tuesday. On Monday, the trial began in earnest with opening statements followed by testimony from two witnesses. Combs — the 55-year-old rapper, producer and fashion mogul whose rags-to-riches-to-near-billionaire status New York fairytale came to an abrupt end last year with his arrest and a five-count indictment — stood up in the court on Monday morning when lead attorney Teny Geragos described him in her opening statements. The second lead defense attorney told the jury that Combs, accused by federal prosecutors of two decades of abuse of women, trafficking of sex workers, and turning his music and fashion empire into a criminal enterprise, is no saint and that he's by all accounts guilty of domestic abuse; but that's not what he's charged with and why he should be found innocent. Defense Concedes That Sean "Diddy" Combs Had Violent Outbursts But Says It Wasn't Sex Trafficking Sean "Diddy" Combs Trial Sees Jury Finalization Kicked to Monday So No One Gets "Cold Feet" “Hi, mom, I love you,” he mouthed to her. Prosecutor Emily Johnson spent significantly less time — about half an hour to Geragos' hour — laying out the feds' case against the fallen superstar to the jury: Over two decades, Combs conspired to use his business and loyal staff to stalk, harass and abuse via forced sex and drug use with male prostitutes, two women in his life — ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and a women he met in 2020 who is being referred to as Jane. Johnson opened the case against Combs by telling what the feds say is a tale of one single night in the defendant's life: learning that Ventura was out with another man, he and a bodyguard went out to find them. In the process, the government says he woke and kidnapped one of his staffers and stalked his on-and-off girlfriend and when she was found, Combs “beat her brutally, kicking her in the back and flinging her around like a rag doll.” Other descriptions of his alleged abuse in court on Monday included an account of Combs tossing Ventura to the floor of a vehicle and stomping on her face, then directing a cover-up handled by his staff to ensure she stayed at home for a week while healing. Ventura was allegedly forced, by Combs, into participating in “freak-offs,” mostly in hotel rooms where she was force fed drugs, primarily Ecstasy or MDMA, and engaged in sex with “dozens upon dozens” of male escorts over the years as Combs would masturbate as he looked on. In a bid for coercive control over his girlfriend, Combs, who had signed Sunderland to his Bad Boy Records label for a 10-album deal (of which only one saw the light of day), threatened to ruin her music career by releasing videos of her engaging in sex with male escorts, the feds claim. When she discovered his other love interests were taken on trips and out for meals, Jane confronted him. Prosecutors say Combs beat her mercilessly in this moment, kicked down several doors as she ran and hid from him, then put her in a chokehold and kicked her to the ground before dashing off, late for a previously scheduled “freak-off.” The defense told the jury that this is merely the story of a wealthy Black man with eccentric sexual proclivities and jealous women in his orbit who have become greedy for a piece of his fortune. Geragos, who repeated the defense's talking points several times over her hour-plus statement, put a fine point on the fact that Ventura did not file a police report but did file two multi-million dollar lawsuits against Combs. Jury members also saw the contentious footage brought by prosecutors of the hotel attack, in which Combs beats and kicks Ventura, then throws a hotel vase at her. Florez also described the fear he felt Ventura was experiencing after the attack and that he believes he was offered a bribe from Combs when the mogul handed him a stack with a $100 bill on top. “Don't tell nobody,” Florez testified Combs told him. Florez recalled telling Combs, “I don't want your money. Wearing red lace lingerie when he arrived, Ventura first told him that she wanted to do something special for Combs. The night started with a baby oil massage, he told the court.The night, which led to him having sex with Ventura as Combs watched in a white robe, netted him a few thousand dollars and he was hired repeatedly to recreate the encounter, he said. At one point, he testified, Combs demanded that a photograph be taken of Phillip's driver's license; the sex worker testified that he saw this as an intimidation tactic. Another night, he says he witnessed Combs become violent with Sunderland, dragging her by the hair and slapping her in another room after she told him to “hold on a second.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
