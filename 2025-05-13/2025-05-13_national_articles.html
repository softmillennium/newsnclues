                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Cassie Ventura on the stand: Cassie Ventura, the former girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs and one of his accusers, is testifying in his federal criminal trial. • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Cassie Ventura testified that she used drugs at every “Freak Off,” and took “all kinds” of drugs — including ecstasy, marijuana, and mushrooms. I couldn't imagine myself doing any of that without having some sort of buffer or just way to not feel it for what it really was,” she said. Combs provided the drugs and sometimes his staff would drop them off, she testified. “Someone would drop off drugs to me, wherever I was,” Ventura said. Cassie Ventura described how she would vet a new escort if they hadn't used them before. “Sean would want me to clarify if the person was a cop,” she testified. “I learned that this whole situation was not legal,” Ventura said. Cassie Ventura said escorts were typically paid between $1,500 and $6,000 after the “Freak Offs.” The escorts were almost always men, with a few exceptions, according to Ventura. Cassie Ventura testified that Sean “Diddy” Combs tasked her with finding escorts for the “Freak Offs,” and she noted that Combs had very specific physical requirements for the men. Ventura said she'd find escorts by responding to ads on Craigslist and Backpage at Combs' direction. He would send her photos of the men they could hire, she said. “I'd usually show them to Sean and see if that person was of interest for a ‘Freak Off,'” Ventura said. Ventura said she would talk with the escorts before they participated to try and make them more comfortable. “I would usually say that my husband is into something called voyeurism and he likes to watch me with another man,” she said. “It was just like a basic conversation I had with most of the escorts, and from there I would get a feel if they were willing to do it or not.” Ventura said Combs would usually be in the other room during these conversations, but he would be able to hear them. Cassie Ventura has spent the afternoon testifying, in part, about the power dynamic between her and former boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs as it relates to the sexual performances known as “Freak Offs,” which Ventura testified she felt she could not say no to. “It got to a point where I just didn't feel like I had much of a choice, didn't really know what ‘no' could be or what ‘no' could turn into,” she said on the stand. CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson on CNN said the prosecution's focus on the power dynamic during Ventura's testimony is “about consent, whether or not she was on board with it or whether she was coerced.” “And so I think what the prosecution is attempting to do, is to establish that because of the power dynamic, because she felt that she could not say no, that she ultimately had to say yes,” he added. As a result of that, Jackson added, “now you have your coercion, now you have your inducement, now you have your compelling her to engage in this even if she did not explicitly say no.” Prosecutors allege Combs created a criminal enterprise using his business empire where he engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice and is accused of coercing at least three women, including Ventura, to engage in sex acts with him during the so-called “Freak Offs.” Court is taking a short break and then Cassie Ventura's direct examination will continue in the federal criminal trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs. Cassie Ventura testified that the “Freak Offs” orchestrated by Sean “Diddy” Combs became “disgusting” and “overwhelming.” She told the jury how, at times, Combs himself would urinate on her or demand an escort do so. Many times, one of Sean “Diddy” Combs' staff members would go in and clean up more. Combs was often charged by hotels for the damages, Ventura said. One specific time, Ventura recalled the Intercontinental in New York charging Combs “a really high number” for damage to a hotel room. Cassie Ventura testified that they used “quite a bit” of baby oil in the “Freak Offs” because Sean “Diddy” Combs wanted them to be “glistening.” Ventura said Combs would instruct her to apply more oil if he felt like she didn't have enough on. There wasn't another way around it,” she said. When they ran out of lubricant during a “Freak Off,” Ventura said they'd call someone on Combs' staff or the hotel desk to bring more. Law enforcement seized more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant during searches of Combs' homes in Miami and Los Angeles last year, according to an indictment from that time. Sean “Diddy” Combs used aliases like “Frank White” or “Frank Black” for hotel rooms where they'd have “Freak Offs,” Cassie Ventura testified. His staff would provide materials — such as baby oil, lubricant and condoms, she said. Ventura went on to describe the ways she would alter her appearance for a “Freak Off.” Ventura said she would wear see-through, netted outfits and “extremely high heels.” Early in their relationship, Sean “Diddy” Combs wanted Cassie Ventura to call him by her grandfather's nickname, she said. And now I just feel like it was disrespectful.” He called her CC which she said stood for “Cassie Combs.” Cassie Ventura broke down in tears when prosecutor Emily Johnson asked what she enjoyed — if anything — about the “Freak Offs.” Cassie Ventura described how she'd stay awake for days at a time without sleep against her will for the “Freak Offs” that her former boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs organized. He'd tell her at some point a “session” would be the last one, and she'd think, “hopefully that would be the last one,” she said. Cassie Ventura is now testifying about the first time she participated in a “Freak Off.” Ventura testified Combs arranged for a male escort to participate and that they “took ecstasy and drank alcohol.” She said she took the narcotics Combs gave her before they started. Ventura said Combs managed every detail, even what she wore, including masks to disguise their appearances. “Every ‘Freak Off' was, like, directed by Sean, like he knew specifically where he wanted everyone to be, the lighting and such,” Ventura said. “So over that first session, we just kind of, like, ended up getting closer and closer, then eventually had to put oil on each other.” Ventura said she felt mixed emotions after the first “Freak Off.” “I was high, so there wasn't too much feeling,” she said, but recalls feeling “dirty and confusion.” But said she felt like, “okay, he's really happy with me.” Cassie Ventura testified about how she interacted with several of Sean “Diddy” Combs' assistants and staff during their relationship — an important part of the government's effort to prove that Combs engaged in racketeering, according to a former prosecutor. Julie Grant, a Court TV anchor and former prosecutor, said Ventura's testimony helps paint a picture for the jury “of the organization” and how people who worked for Diddy might have been involved in the allegations. Grant said Ventura can identify instances where she witnessed other people working “as agents” for Combs and “doing things on his behalf.” Grant said, “That all does to the charge of racketeering.” In the indictment, the government alleges Combs was using his business enterprises and “having these people who worked for him in various capacities help him exert that power and control to force women like Cassie to engage in unwanted sexual behaviors,” Grant said. Here are some of the things she said about Combs' staffers so far: Prosecutor Emily Johnson turned her questioning back to voyeurism. Cassie Ventura said Sean “Diddy” Combs presented it to her within the first six months or year of them dating as a fantasy he had. “He would want to see me with another male having sexual interaction,” Ventura testified. Ventura said she was “shocked” when Combs first told her about voyeurism. Cassie Ventura testified that Sean “Diddy” Combs was “rivals” with former rap mogul Marion “Suge” Knight, the former Death Row Records co-founder who was sentenced to prison for the death of a man during a hit-and-run incident on the set of the movie “Straight Outta Compton.” One time, she and Combs had a “Freak Off” at one of his homes in Los Angeles when one of his security guards came in and mentioned that Knight was at a diner closeby. “They quickly packed up and drove down there,” she said. I just was really nervous for them, I didn't know what it meant, what they were going to do,” Ventura said. Cassie Ventura said Sean “Diddy” Combs had a safe in every one of his homes, and she said she would occasionally would access them to get him money or something else. Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Cassie Ventura about several assistants that worked for Sean “Diddy” Combs. Ventura testified that in the first three years of her relationship with Combs, one of his assistants would regularly help Ventura with her finances. Ventura said she spoke to another assistant on a daily basis about everything from scheduling to what kind of mood Combs was in. “She knew a lot about my personal things,” Ventura said. I got kicked out of the house, my apartment. It was very random depending how he felt,” she said. Ventura said there were times when Combs personally took her electronics from her, and other times his security personnel did it. Cassie Ventura testified that Sean “Diddy” Combs was “very involved” in her physical appearance, and started making comments about the way she looked almost immediately in their relationship. “Appearance was very important to him — my appearance,” she said, adding that Combs would make comments about her hair and nails. “We had tons of conversations about my body at that time,” she testified. That included discussions about breast implants and “keeping my shape a certain way,” she said. “My self worth took a hit for the entirety of the relationship, just trying to establish who I was, who I wanted to be, who I was allowed to be,” Ventura said Cassie Ventura said that James Cruz, an employee of Bad Boy Records, managed her career after she started dating Sean “Diddy” Combs, but she added that decisions ultimately went through Combs. “His role in managing my career was that he was managing me with one hand tied behind his back,” she said of Cruz. She testified that any decision had to go through Combs. Prosecutors want to use her testimony to “bridge the gap” for the jury between Combs' public persona and who they say he is in this felony indictment, Coates said. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. Defense lawyers for Sean “Diddy” Combs indicated Tuesday that they may call Cassie Ventura's husband Alex Fine to the stand to testify about allegations that Combs raped Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend and one of his accusers, in 2018. Fine was allowed by Judge Arun Subramanian to sit in the courtroom to support his wife during her testimony, which began on Tuesday, until the 2018 allegations are brought up. Ventura and Fine wed in 2019 during a secret ceremony in Malibu, one year after Ventura and Combs' years-long relationship ended. After video footage emerged of Combs physically assaulting Ventura in a California hotel lobby in 2016, Fine issued an apparent response to the video in what he wrote was a “letter to women and children” posted to his Instagram page. Combs, who was seated, turned around in his chair and watched Ventura walk to her seat. She did not appear to make eye contact with him. As she testified, Ventura dabbed her nose and eye at times. As a reminder before we get into her testimony, some of the details below are graphic. Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Cassie Ventura testified that the “Freak Offs” could last 36, 48 or 72 hours, forcing her to spend  a “big chunk of her life” recovering from the drug use and dehydration. Ventura recalled the longest “Freak Off” continued for four or more days with some breaks. She didn't release nine of the albums that were included on her record deal. Combs lived “right down the block” from Ventura's apartment in California, she said. Cassie Ventura described her complicated relationship with Sean “Diddy” Combs. “I didn't get that he was him — he was Puff Daddy, and Puff Daddy has many women,” Ventura said, describing how she felt jealous about seeing him with other women. “He likes the company of women, and I had to just really learn that over time, despite what he would tell me just between us.” She continued, “He made me feel like we were in a monogamous relationship more often than not. It was really me figuring out that we were not.” On a typical day, Cassie Ventura said she talked to Sean “Diddy” Combs “all day, throughout the day.” She said sometimes she wouldn't answer his calls or messages right away, and he would be an “incessant caller” or he would have his staff call until she answered. There were times Combs' assistants or security personnel would locate her for him in person, she said. Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Ventura to give an example of how Combs' moods impacted her. Ventura said Combs' mood “swung different ways quite a bit.” Cassie Ventura said once she started dating Sean “Diddy” Combs, she broke ties with her management company, which also managed her former boyfriend. Ventura said that at this point, the relationship was “fun,” describing it as her “first adult, real adult relationship.” She also noted that Combs' lifestyle was “much different” than her own. Ventura testified that early on, she was “just enamored by him.” But later on, she began to “experience a different side of him, which was his abusive side.” She said Combs was “very controlling over my life and the things that I wanted to do, but there was still love there.” Control was kind of an all-around thing to a certain point,” she testified. Cassie Ventura testified that became one of Sean Combs' girlfriends after the Miami trip. Cassie Ventura is detailing the early phase of her relationship with Sean “Diddy” Combs. She said they started to develop a more comfortable relationship with each other. “I wanted to be around Sean for the same reasons as everyone else at the time — just this exciting, entertaining, fun guy that also happened to have my career in his hands,” Ventura said. “It felt special because not a lot of people got that time with him.” Ventura described herself as being sexually unexperienced at this time. During one of those New York visits, she said Combs performed oral sex on her and made her “feel crazy” for not reciprocating. “I was just so young, I didn't even have the vocabulary for some of the things that we talked about,” she testified. “I was also still in a relationship with someone else,” she added. Eventually, Combs, Ventura and other friends took a trip to Miami, she said. Ventura said she took ecstasy that Combs gave her while they were drinking and partying on a boat. Ventura said she and Combs had sex for the first time on this trip. Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Cassie Ventura how Sean “Diddy” Combs influenced her career at the time. He chose what was next for me basically,” Ventura said. Cassie Ventura testified that she saw Sean “Diddy” Combs about once a month at social outings in 2006. “I was just really confused at the time,” she said, noting that she was a “young, new artist” who “just didn't really know the lay of the land when it came to things like that.” “Did you want to kiss Sean at your 21st birthday?” Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Ventura. Cassie Ventura testified that she signed a contract with Bad Boy Records, Sean “Diddy” Combs' company, in early 2006. Prosecutor Emily Johnson then showed the jury a photo of Ventura and Combs together in 2006, the same year she signed her record deal. She also said, “Sean is a really polarizing person, also very charming so it's hard to be able to decide in that moment like what you need when he's telling you what he wants.” Cassie Ventura recalled on the stand when Sean “Diddy” Combs first proposed “Freak Offs” to her. It was him sharing something like that with me. Ventura said she didn't know how to refuse “Freak Offs.” “It got to a point where I just didn't feel like I had much of a choice, didn't really know what ‘no' could be or what ‘no' could turn into,” she said. “And I just didn't feel like I had much say in it at that time, being really super young, naive, total people pleaser,” Ventura said. Cassie Ventura said the image showed her leaving after “an encounter that we called a ‘Freak Off. Ventura was asked how she and her former boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs started doing “Freak Offs.” “Within the first year of our relationship, he proposed this idea, this sexual encounter that he called voyeurism where he would watch me be in intercourse with a third party, specifically with another man,” she testified. Ventura went on to say that a “Freak Off” would entail “hiring an escort and setting up this experience, so that I could perform for Sean.” “Eventually it became a job for me, pretty much, so I knew if it was something he wanted me to do, I had the contacts to set it up and get a hotel room and all of that, but in the beginning, Sean set it up. Johnson asked, “How frequently was shear physical with you during your relationship?” Ventura said she suffered injuries from the abuse, including knots on her forehead, busted lips, and “bruises all over my body.” Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Prosecutor Emily Johnson showed Cassie Ventura a photo of Sean “Diddy” Combs and asked her to identify him. Earlier today, Ventura's attorney Douglas Wigdor said she was “very ready” to take the stand, and told reporters she is “confident.” Sean “Diddy” Combs' attorney Teny Geragos said the defense may need to call Alex Fine to testify about allegations that Combs raped Ventura in the summer or fall of 2018. Ventura's husband can remain in court for her testimony until the 2018 allegations come up in her testimony, the judge ruled. Judge Arun Subramanian says going forward, the defense must give the government more notice if they intend to make applications like this. Assistant US attorney Emily Johnson said those allegations may not come up in her direct examination until tomorrow. Defense attorney Teny Geragos is making an application that Cassie Ventura's husband be barred from the courtroom for her testimony. Geragos says that Ventura's husband may be called in Combs' defense case if certain testimony comes up when Ventura takes the stand. Geragos says the defense will not make an application to bar any other family members of Ventura from the courtroom for her testimony. Judge Arun Subramanian just dismissed the jury for a 10-minute break. Daniel Phillip, the male revue manager, has wrapped up his testimony. On redirect examination, Prosecutor Maurene Comey asked Phillip to recount his recollection of the moments after he watched Sean “Diddy” Combs drag Cassie Ventura into a bedroom and then heard what he believed to be Combs beating Ventura. Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson is done cross-examining Daniel Phillip. Prosecutor Maurene Comey is now questioning Phillip on redirect examination. Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson is now reviewing parts of Daniel Phillip's testimony from yesterday, when prosecutors questioned him. We're not hearing any new information, as Donaldson is asking Phillip to confirm details he already said on the stand yesterday. Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson asked Daniel Phillip again about the time he saw Sean “Diddy” Combs assault Cassie Ventura at her home. Phillip confirmed that he went to Ventura's apartment after she sent him her address, and they had sex before the assault. Donaldson challenged Phillip's trial testimony with a report from a previous law enforcement interview he gave in 2023, when he told investigators that Combs told him, “Yo man, I'm going to need to deal with this, you need to get the f**k out.” On the stand, Phillip said he didn't recall telling investigators that. Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson asked Daniel Phillip again about the first day he had sex with Cassie Ventura in front of Sean “Diddy” Combs. Not long after he left the hotel room following their first sexual encounter, Ventura called him to ask if he'd come back that same day, Phillip testified. Phillip said he agreed to return to their hotel room at the Gramercy Park Hotel, where he and Ventura again had sex “for a few hours.” When asked, Phillip testified that Combs did not direct him and Ventura as to how they should have sex that day. When Donaldson asked if Ventura seemed “in complete control of everything she was doing” during that encounter, Phillip testified, “I cannot say that.” Daniel Phillip, the male revue manager who testified yesterday that he was paid to have sex with Cassie Ventura on several occasions, is back on the stand. Defense Attorney Xavier Donaldson will continue questioning Phillip soon. Estevao said the incident demonstrates that Ventura had substance abuse issues independently of her relationship with Combs. Ventura, who is also one of Combs' accusers, is expected to testify as a central witness for the prosecution about her years-long relationship with Combs, and her testimony could “really be the key” to the government's case, according to CNN legal analyst Jennifer Rogers. “Sometimes prosecutors put on an FBI agent, for example, to be kind of the narrator of what happened here, but in this case, Cassie Ventura is that narrator here,” Rogers told CNN, adding that the government needs “to show that this was not just sex — this was coercion, this was a concerted plan involving not just him but a lot of other people, including people who worked for him, to bring people across state lines for these big sex parties and that it was not voluntary.” Prosecutors claim Combs coerced her into having sex with male prostitutes during sexual performances called “Freak Offs,” according to the indictment. Judge Arun Subramanian said he's inclined to grant the media's motion for public access to sexually explicit footage and images that are expected to be submitted as evidence, but he said he hasn't made a decision yet. Two of the lead lawyers in the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial have recognizable last names, but they stand on their own. The prosecution and defense are going to address evidentiary issues before bringing in the jury to continue witness testimony this morning. Day two of the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial is getting underway, and first up we're expecting to hear from Daniel Phillip. Today, he'll be back on the stand to continue testifying under cross-examination. Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson says he still has about an hour of cross-examination for Phillip. If convicted on the most serious counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Cassie Ventura's attorney said she is “very ready” for today's proceedings in the trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs. Marc Agnifilo, one of Combs' lead defense attorneys, was also seen arriving this morning. Prosecutors indicated in court on Friday that they would call two witnesses before calling “Victim 1,” whose testimony will take up most of the first week. So far, the prosecution has called Los Angeles Police Officer Israel Florez and Daniel Phillip, a male revue manager, who will continue on the stand this morning. Prosecutors allege Combs coerced her into having sex with male prostitutes, according to the indictment. Combs' defense team said in court they plan to argue that Ventura had a propensity for violence toward Combs during their relationship, which lasted approximately 11 years, from 2007 to 2018. Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs' trial began yesterday in New York, where he faces five counts, including one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Here's what to know from the opening statements and first witness testimonies: Prosecution's opening statement: Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson said there was “another side” to Combs, the cultural icon, who “ran a criminal enterprise” with an inner circle of people who “helped him commit crimes and cover them up.” Here's what else she walked through: Defense's opening argument: Defense attorney Teny Geragos said that while Combs takes full responsibility for his violent behavior, “domestic violence is not sex trafficking.” Here's what else Geragos said: First witness testimony: Los Angeles Police Officer Israel Florez was a security official at the InterContinental Hotel in March 2016 when he got a call saying there was “a woman in distress.” Here's what he said on the stand: Second witness testimony came from Daniel Phillip, who described his role as managing male strippers for women.</p>

Jury president Juliette Binoche poses for photographers during the opening ceremony red carpet of the 78th international film festival, Cannes, southern France, Tuesday, May 13, 2025. Expectations are running high for a potentially banner Cannes. Over the next 12 days, Cannes will play host to megawatt premieres including those of “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” Spike Lee's “Highest 2 Lowest” and Ari Aster's “Eddington.” DiCaprio skirted the red carpet but drew a standing ovation when he presented De Niro with an honorary Palme d'Or. The moment, which brought together two of Martin Scorsese's most regular stars, came 49 years after “Taxi Driver” was crowned with the Palme d'Or. After thanking the festival, De Niro quickly turned to speaking about Trump, who recently said he wants to enact a tariff on films made outside the country. And now he announced a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States. On Wednesday, Tarantino will pay tribute to Western filmmaker George Sherman. Also in attendance: Sean Baker, the “Anora” director and last year's Palme d'Or winner. Cannes is coming off a 2024 festival that produced a number of eventual Oscar contenders, including “Emilia Pérez,” “The Substance,” “Flow” and the best picture winner, “Anora. ” Asked Monday if he's feeling the pressure this time around, festival director Thierry Frémaux said the only kind of pressure he believes in is in beer. (Beer on tap in France is “bière à la pression.”) Cannes launched the same day Gérard Depardieu, one of France's most famous actors, was found guilty of having sexually assaulted two women on a 2021 film set. In one of France's most prominent #MeToo cases, Depardieu was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence. This year's Cannes Film Festival, the premier international cinematic gathering, is also unspooling following Trump's call for tariffs on movies made overseas. “I don't know what to say, really, about that,” Binoche told reporters Tuesday. Jake Coyle has covered the Cannes Film Festival since 2012. To prepare for this year, he practiced eating crepes on the run and interviewed filmmakers on three continents who are in competition for Cannes' top honor, the Palme d'Or. Berry, responding to Cannes' new protocols on attire for the red carpet, said she had “an amazing dress” with a long train for the opening ceremony but wore something else instead. Cannes has outlawed nudity and dresses with long trains for its evening premieres at the Palais. “But the nudity part, I do think is probably also a good rule.” Cannes will follow up Tuesday's festivities with the return Wednesday of Tom Cruise. Twenty-two films will vie for Cannes' top prize, the Palme d'Or, to be presented May 24. Those films include Wes Anderson's “The Phoenician Scheme,” Richard Linklater's “Nouvelle Vague,” Lynne Ramsay's “Die, My Love,” Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value,” Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind,” Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound,” Julia Ducournau's “Alpha” and Jafar Panahi's “A Simple Accident.” In Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, three prominent actors are making their directorial debuts: Harris Dickinson (“Urchin”), Kristen Stewart (“The Chronology of Water”) and Scarlett Johansson (“Eleanor the Great”). Geopolitics are likely to play a starring role at Cannes, which began by screening three 2025 Ukraine documentaries: “Zelensky,” Bernard-Henri Lévy's “Notre Guerre” and The Associated Press-Frontline coproduction “2000 Meters to Andriivka,” by “20 Days in Mariupol” Oscar winner Mstyslav Chernov. On Tuesday, more than 350 filmmakers, actors and others in the film industry — including Richard Gere, Pedro Almodovar, Javier Bardem, Viggo Mortensen and Mark Ruffalo, published an open letter in the French newspaper Libération and in Variety calling on cinema institutions to more forcefully respond to what they called “genocide in Gaza.” Jake Coyle has covered the Cannes Film Festival since 2012.

Over the next 12 days, Cannes will play host to megawatt premieres including those of “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” Spike Lee's “Highest 2 Lowest” and Ari Aster's “Eddington.” Things get underway Tuesday with an opening ceremony that drew Quentin Tarantino (who'll pay tribute to Western filmmaker George Sherman on Wednesday), Eva Longoria, Heidi Klum and others to Cannes' famous red carpet.

(Steve Hockstein/NJ Advance Media via AP, Pool) NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Newark Mayor Ras Baraka briefly returned Tuesday to the gates of the federal immigration detention center where he was arrested last week on trespassing charges. Baraka, a Democrat running for governor in the June 10 primary, was turned away from Delaney Hall, the facility where he was arrested Friday. He departed and stayed about a half hour away from the building, according to NJ.com. Witnesses said the arrest last week came after Baraka attempted to join three members of New Jersey's congressional delegation, Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, in attempting to enter the facility. Baraka, an outspoken opponent of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and vocal opponent of the facility's opening, faces a court hearing on the trespassing charge on Thursday. He denied being on the detention facility's property, which is run by private prison operator Geo Group. Alina Habba, interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said on the social platform X that Baraka trespassed there again. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who said: “They're talking about coming back to arrest you.” They can't come out on the street and arrest me,” Baraka replied. Minutes later several ICE agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded him and others on the public side. As protesters cried out, “Shame,” Baraka was dragged back through the gate in handcuffs. Geo valued the contract at $1 billion, in an unusually long and large agreement for ICE.</p>

A view from inside Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland, Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023. The Minnesota Vikings get a double dip of international play in 2025 with trips to both Ireland and Britain as the NFL features a record seven overseas kickoffs this season, including forays into Germany and Spain. The Vikings will play the Pittsburgh Steelers at Croke Park in Dublin on Sept. 28 in Ireland's first NFL regular season game, and then they'll fly over to London to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium a week later on Oct. 5. “Our experiences in London have always been memorable, so to return in 2025 as the first team to play in back-to-back international games in different countries was something we could not pass up,” Vikings owner Mark Wilf said. That means they're going to go 24 years between trips to Cleveland, with the next on in 2033. That's also when the league will announce the Los Angeles Chargers' opponent and broadcast carrier for its first international game of the season in Brazil, on Sept. 5 at Corinthians Stadium in Sao Paulo. That's where the Philadelphia Eagles began their Super Bowl quest last year with a game against the Green Bay Packers on opening weekend. Overall, the NFL has played 39 regular season games in London. The six international matchups that were announced will all be on NFL Network and streamed on NFL+. The Colts-Falcons game in Berlin is the fifth regular season NFL game in Germany. Previous games have been played in Munich and Frankfurt. Peter O'Reilly, NFL executive vice president of club business and league events, said the largest-ever slate of international games “underscores our collective commitment to global growth as we continue our journey to becoming a truly global sport.” Also Tuesday, the NFL revealed on “Good Morning America” that the Super Bowl champion Eagles will play the Packers in Green Bay on Monday Night Football on Nov. 10. Green Bay has proposed a ban on the Eagles' short-yardage tactic, calling for the NFL to outlaw the quarterback sneak where teammates push him from behind. The issue is expected to be debated at the league's spring meeting next week. AP Pro Football Writer Dave Campbell contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Tuesday he is placing a blanket hold on all Justice Department political nominees, as he seeks answers related to the Trump administration's plans to accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family to use as Air Force One. “News of the Qatari government gifting Donald Trump a $400 million private jet to use as Air Force One is so corrupt that even Putin would give a double take,” Schumer said on the Senate floor, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “So, in light of the deeply troubling news of a possible Qatari-funded Air Force One, and the reports that the attorney general personally signed off on this clearly unethical deal, I am announcing a hold on all DOJ political nominees, until we get more answers,” he added. live updates Trump meets with Saudi crown prince as Middle East trip gets underway Only a simple majority vote is needed to overcome the hold. He also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi testify before the House and Senate “to explain why gifting Donald Trump a private jet does not violate the Emoluments Clause — which requires congressional approval — or any other ethics laws.” “President Trump has told the American people that this is a ‘free jet.' Why would we take the risk of trusting any foreign country to do this sensitive work? “What are the parameters of this deal, and which country brought it up first — us or them?

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the legal details on accepting the jet, which would be retrofitted and used as Air Force One, are “still being worked out.” “Any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law,” she added. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters in the Capitol that “there are lots of issues associated with that offer, which I think need to be further talked about.” The South Dakota Republican did not elaborate on what he sees as issues. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, for his part, declined to weigh in on the administration's plan, telling CNN earlier in the day: “I haven't had a chance to even look at that yet.” CNN's Manu Raju, Ted Barrett and Alison Main contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the book Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios's Alex Thompson, scheduled for release on May 20, advisers were fully aware by 2023 of Biden's deteriorating health, which was even worse than believed by outsiders. Biden's physician, Kevin O'Connor, reportedly suggested he use a wheelchair if conditions worsen, something Biden's advisers believed would be political suicide if done before the election. “Biden's physical deterioration — most apparent in his halting walk — had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election,” the authors wrote, according to an excerpt obtained by Axios. “Given Biden's age, [his physician Kevin O'Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,” they wrote. The book also alleged that Biden aides lied about the reason for the president's awkward gait when they claimed throughout 2024 it was a result of him fracturing his foot in November 2020 and refusing to wear his walking boot past a certain point. The claim contradicted O'Connor's assessment in 2021 that “both small fractures of his foot are completely healed” and that “this injury has healed as expected.” The primary reason for Biden's labored stride was “significant spinal arthritis,” a problem that led to aides changing his schedule. The book revealed that Biden's infamous fall in June 2023 at the Air Force Academy, a fall mocked by President Donald Trump and his allies, was more severe than previously thought. He often quipped that the then-president's aides were trying to kill him. On physical deterioration, a Biden spokesperson who declined to be identified told Axios in a statement that Biden didn't require any special treatment for his gait and that it hadn't worsened. “And so far,” it continued, “we are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline. However, other sections of the book allege that severe mental decline had been observed by aides since at least 2022. When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was also heavily critical of Biden, warning him in a July visit to his Delaware home that if he lost to Trump, 50 years of “amazing, beautiful work goes out the window. But it's worse than that — you will go down in American history as one of the darkest figures.”</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. House Republicans are moving to put stricter work requirements on food stamps in a bid to cut government waste and find taxpayer savings for President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill." Cobbling the vast piece of legislation together takes coordination by 11 different House committees, each working on a portion of it under their panel's jurisdiction. The portion released on Monday night would raise the upper age limit for work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), from certain able-bodied adults up to age 54 to those up to age 64. Whereas the current rules exempt people with dependents under age 18, the new provision would now include SNAP recipients with children above age 7 who otherwise qualify for work requirements. Republicans are working on President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill." The House Agriculture Committee, which oversees federal food programs in addition to America's farmers, was tasked with finding $230 billion in spending cuts out of a sum total of $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion dollars – cuts that conservatives had demanded to offset the cost of Trump's other priorities. "For far too long, the SNAP program has drifted from a bridge to support American households in need to a permanent destination riddled with bureaucratic inefficiencies, misplaced initiatives, and limited accountability," Committee Chairman Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., said in a statement. "This portion of the One Big, Beautiful Bill restores the program's original intent, offering a temporary helping hand while encouraging work, cracking down on loopholes exploited by states, and protecting taxpayer dollars while supporting the hardworking men and women of American agriculture." Currently, the federal government fully covers SNAP costs for all 50 states and half the states' administrative costs to run it. The bill would hike work requirements for food stamps. The new bill would impose a 5% baseline benefit cost share for all states, beginning in 2028. States with higher rates of erroneous payments would pay more as well. Fox News Digital first reported in late February that Republicans were looking to heighten work requirements for food stamps via reconciliation, when similar legislation was introduced by Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., a member of the Agriculture panel. House and Senate Republicans are working on advancing Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process this year. Reconciliation allows the party controlling both houses of Congress and the White House to move a massive piece of legislation, provided it addresses budgetary matters like spending, taxes or the national debt. Trump wanted Republicans to craft a bill advancing his priorities on the border, immigration, taxes, energy, defense and raising the debt limit. The House Agriculture Committee, along with two other top committees, are advancing their own portions of the bill on Tuesday. When that is done, all 11 House committees that have crafted individual reconciliation pieces will put them together into a massive bill, identical versions of which must pass the House and Senate before reaching Trump's desk. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wants the House to finish its portion of the effort by Memorial Day. Previous digital bylines seen at Daily Mail and CBS News.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Over the last decade, plant-based meat has gotten a lot more meaty. Dozens of startups have launched in recent years to develop more realistic-tasting burgers, nuggets, and sausages as an alternative to factory farmed meat, which causes billions of animals to suffer terribly, pollutes our air and water, and accelerates climate change. Recently published data found a seven percent drop in plant-based meat retail dollar sales from 2023 to 2024 and an 11 percent drop in the number of products sold. To better understand what consumers really think about plant-based meat, a few months ago one organization conducted a huge blind taste test, which I recently covered: In December and January, Nectar — a nonprofit that conducts research on “alternative protein,” such as plant-based meat — brought together nearly 2,700 people in a first- and largest-of-its-kind blind taste test. Without knowing which version they were tasting, the participants tried 122 plant-based meat products across 14 categories, like burgers, hot dogs, and bacon, alongside one animal meat “benchmark” product per category. Each product was tested by at least 100 participants, who then rated them on texture, flavor, appearance, and overall enjoyment on a 7-point scale from “dislike very much” to “like very much.” The products were all served as part of a dish, like they'd be eaten in regular life — vegan meatballs were served with spaghetti, for example, and deli slices in a sandwich with fixings. While some of these products don't taste identical to meat when eaten on their own, when prepared in a meal, differences in taste become much less important. US plant-based meat companies have reliably churned out meat-free burgers for decades, in part because they're a beloved American staple, but also because ground beef is easier for food scientists to replicate than, say, a steak's complex fibrous structure. You can now find plant-based burgers at the vast majority of US grocery stores, and even at a lot of restaurants. They're among the easiest foods to make plant-based because chicken nuggets are already highly processed and bear little resemblance to whole chicken meat. You can't go wrong with meat-free nuggs from the two Tasty award winners — Impossible Foods and MorningStar Farms — but I also recommend chicken nuggets from Beyond Meat and chicken tenders from Gardein. A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us. But blind taste testers have a preference for two companies' products: Impossible Foods and Gardein, a Canadian company that's launched a number of delicious plant-based meat products over the years, which are widely available in the US. The only plant-based meatballs and hot dogs to win a Tasty award are made by — you guessed it — Impossible Foods. Its hot dogs are even good enough for Joey Chestnut, the world's top-ranking competitive eater, who signed an endorsement deal with the company in 2024. The list above only includes products available in the US, but a number of Nectar's winners appear to only be available in Europe: While a blind taste test is the best measurement of a plant-based meat's quality, I also want to share some of my personal favorites — and those from friends and fellow Vox colleagues — that didn't win a Tasty award but deserve the limelight just as much: If you can't find a product near you, or want to try something not widely available in the US, there are a number of online food retailers, like Vegan Essentials and Thrive Market, that carry specialty plant-based products. Nectar's blind taste test demonstrated that, overall, plant-based meat still has a long way to go to compete with animal meat on flavor, texture, price, and other attributes. But that so many of the plant-based products were rated just as good or better than their animal meat equivalents shows how far the industry has come in recent decades. In the years ahead, as the problems of our food system — animal cruelty, climate emissions, water pollution, and more — grow and worsen, its alternatives will improve. If we're lucky, they'll come to be seen less as substitutes and more as ethical, and tasty, options to satisfy humanity's desire for meat.

Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier reflects on shifting relations in the Middle East since President Donald Trump's first visit to the region on 'Special Report.' President Donald Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for his first major overseas trip since retaking office, hoping to secure major deals on trade and diplomatic breakthroughs across the Middle East. The president is now expected to meet with Syria's interim president on Wednesday, with some analysts predicting the meeting could result in a big diplomatic win for Trump. "This is a historic opportunity, and it would be a shame if the U.S. lost it," Natasha Hall, senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Fox News Digital. President Trump seems open to renewed relations with Syria, including the possibility of lifting crippling sanctions imposed under the previous regime of Bashar al-Assad. President Donald Trump, left, walks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a welcoming ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 13, 2025. "We may take them off of Syria, because we want to give them a fresh start," President Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. The president added that "we want to see if we can help them out" and that a determination on Syria sanctions will be made at some point. "Syria now, for the first time, has a government in power that is not only no longer reliant on Iran to survive but is quite hostile to Iran, and so that would be a big opportunity lost if the U.S. didn't step up," Hall added. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syrian interim President Ahmad Al-Sharaa, pictured here, hold a press conference after their meeting at the Presidential Complex in Ankara, Turkiye, on Feb. 4, 2025. Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a non-profit helping to bring democracy to Syria, recently met with Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Damascus. Moustafa and others are pushing for a meeting between al-Sharaa and President Trump during his visit to the Gulf this week. For Syria's new government, this will be their opportunity to persuade the new administration to do business with a country coming out of a devastating 14-year civil war and mend ties with a leader who was once aligned with the Islamic State and al Qaeda. "Syria's objectives are quite clear on why they would want to meet President Trump in Saudi Arabia, to make headway on some of these core issues of cooperation and to alleviate any of the concerns the White House may have. And some of the things they've been trying to do is to show that they can be cooperative on intelligence issues, on business, and talking about companies seeking to do business in Syria," CSIS' Hall said. "Right now, Sharaa is not restricting political and civil liberties, but he's an authoritarian by nature." Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told Fox News Digital. Ford led the effort to put al-Sharaa on the terrorist list in 2012 and said, although he is pragmatic, he is leading an extremely weak government. "He doesn't control all of Syria yet. The government in Damascus that he leads is not very strong, and it will take time to reassert all of its authority over Syria," Ford said. Ford does not believe al-Sharaa will pursue terrorism as he did in the past, but while there have been some promising developments since taking power, the U.S. must keep its expectations relatively low. "Syria is so weak, militarily and economically, with lots of internal political divisions. A senior official in the Syrian Foreign Ministry told Fox News Digital that President al-Sharaa emphasizes "that the new Free Syria seeks to establish a strong strategic relationship with the United States, one grounded in mutual interests and shared partnership." The senior official added that "Damascus sees U.S. President Donald Trump as the leader most capable of achieving peace in the Middle East," noting that Syria hopes to become an active and influential ally to Washington on regional issues. Moustafa also met with members of the National Security Council and conveyed the Syrian president's desire for a new partnership. The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment. The new Syrian government has cooperated with U.S. intelligence agencies and foiled several ISIS plots to attack Damascus. Syrian intelligence services also arrested ISIS commander Abu al-Harith al-Iraqi in February. Moustafa added the deal would keep China, Russia and Iran out and allow U.S. troops to go home in the right way. Yet critics warn a potential deal with the United States is not without its obstacles. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, then jihadist group's chief Abu Mohamed al-Jolani, checks the damage following an earthquake in the village of Besnaya in Syria's rebel-held northwestern Idlib province at the border with Turkey, on February 7, 2023. Since becoming the country's leader, Jolani is now known as Ahmad al-Sharaa. He had a $10 million bounty for his capture that was lifted in February amidst the administration's efforts to talk to the new Syrian government. HTS is still a designated foreign terrorist organization, which complicates doing business in Syria. Rose, who recently traveled to Syria, noted that while HTS has been incrementally breaking away from affiliations with terrorist organizations and has adopted some moderate elements over time, there are still doubts that this will "stick," particularly with recent sectarian tensions. "Skeptics of lifting restrictions on Syria immediately fear that any move could be too premature and could risk the U.S.' credibility among its regional counterparts," Rose added. Since becoming president, al-Sharaa has formed a transitional government composed of close allies from the HTS rebel group and a mix of technocrats, former opposition leaders, civil society activists and even some former members of the Assad government. The temporary constitution signed by al-Sharaa in March guarantees basic freedoms such as freedoms of opinion, expression and the press. It also protects women's rights and promises equal rights for all Syrians regardless of ethnicity, religious sect or gender, yet it still leaves the country under Islamist rule during the transitional process. The president can unilaterally declare a state of emergency and suspend basic rights if national security is threatened.

(Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader via AP, File) Although there is a new sense of optimism within Syrian society about its future, civil peace and security remain elusive. Tensions have also escalated with Syria's Druze population as well, highlighting the delicate balance of Syria's complex ethnic divides and the new authority's ability to control various armed factions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump promised to declassify and release thousands of pages of documents related to the hottest topics in the Make America Great Again online world: Jeffrey Epstein files, President John F. Kennedy assassination secrets, Russiagate smoking guns, and more. Months later, most of the records remain snarled in layers of bureaucracy, and the few that have been released have notably underwhelmed. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has repeatedly pledged to release the full trove of Epstein-related materials, has come under scrutiny after months of delays and mixed signals. More speculation began around the time Bondi was caught on a hidden camera on April 28 by James O'Keefe's media group casually discussing “tens of thousands” of Epstein videos at a restaurant. The viral clip, released publicly after Bondi made a similar comment to the press on May 7, further fueled MAGA-aligned skepticism, especially after Bondi's February document drop turned out to contain largely public or redacted information. AG Pam Bondi Was Covertly Recorded on April 28, Revealing Previously Undisclosed Information About Epstein Regarding 'Tens of Thousands of Videos of Little Kids' to a Complete Stranger in a D.C. RestaurantYesterday, the AG Made an Almost Identical Statement Publicly After… pic.twitter.com/l1U89U9eji Law enforcement has acknowledged seizing extensive troves of CDs, hard drives, and nude photographs from Epstein's properties, but no legal filings or case evidence to date have detailed the scale or contents of these materials beyond general references. Around the time the undercover video was released last week, House Republicans, led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), began publicly pressing Bondi for answers. In a May 8 letter co-signed by Reps. Tim Burchett (R-TN), Eric Burlison (R-MO), and Eli Crane (R-AZ), Luna demanded the DOJ release the complete Epstein files by May 16, with only minimal redactions to protect survivors. The letter also questioned whether internal or external actors are deliberately blocking the release and accused Bondi's office of stonewalling congressional oversight. “The survivors of Jeffrey Epstein as well as the American people deserve to know who among the elite protected, enabled, or participated in Jeffrey Epstein's disgusting racket,” Luna said in a statement. “I think it goes much deeper than anybody really realizes,” he said. “These bastards, they generally do have tens of thousands [of files],” he said, citing his prior legislative work going after child predators in Tennessee and suggesting that he was not surprised by the high volume of videos Bondi claimed were in the government's possession. The Tennessee lawmaker said he has more confidence in FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino's leadership but raised concerns about a lack of cohesion with DOJ leadership. I just, my confidence in Ms. Bondi is waning,” he said. “President Trump has full confidence in Attorney General Pam Bondi,” White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said. Huston noted that Bondi has “swiftly restored fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law,” contrasting her leadership with what she described as Biden's “corrupt DOJ” that “focused on weaponizing law enforcement against their political opponents and appeasing violent criminals.” Huston added that Bondi is fulfilling her mandate by “expelling rogue actors and rooting corruption out of our system.” I'd like to update you on some things that I think are going well, and some things that we can, and will, do better. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has been closely monitoring the FBI's compliance with document requests. On Monday, he told the Washington Examiner he has maintained regular contact with the bureau to ensure full productions are made “without unnecessary redactions.” Meanwhile, House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) recently appeared on a popular right-wing podcast to air out his theories about the handling of the promised Epstein document release. “The attorney general does not have them or she would've turned them over,” Comer said, floating the possibility that “deep state actors” may have destroyed critical records before Trump returned to office. Beyond Epstein, Republicans on multiple committees still await key Biden-era documents. These include records related to the DOJ's handling of Trump-focused prosecutions, FBI memos targeting religious conservatives, and communications tied to school board investigations that predate Trump's second term. Burchett said those other investigations also deserve prompt responses. We stand a chance of never seeing it pass.” A spokesperson for NARA, which is operated by acting Archivist and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, confirmed to the Washington Examiner last week it is working “as quickly as possible” to comply with a request in a letter from Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) concerning what the senators describe as the Arctic Frost investigation over alleged collusion between the Biden White House and the Biden DOJ over Trump's indictments. With other congressional inquiries, such as the House Judiciary Committee's requests for documents related to the DOJ's communications with Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis, the FBI's anti-Catholic memo, and school board monitoring policies, began months ago and still have not yielded anything from the DOJ. While some Republicans, such as Comer, have raised concerns that Biden-era holdovers might still influence document release delays, the DOJ has notably fired nearly a dozen prosecutors who worked under former special counsel Jack Smith. Those prosecutors were dismissed within weeks of Trump taking office, and key communications staff tied to Smith were replaced in recent weeks. The DOJ has also moved quickly to install political appointees across senior roles, consistent with standard departmental transitions. Last week, the DOJ announced one of the largest fentanyl trafficking busts in recent history, a nationwide sweep of child predator arrests under Operation Restoring Justice, and a new civil rights investigation into an anti-Catholic state law in Washington. However, with key deadlines looming and Republican pressure mounting, the Trump DOJ faces a pivotal test of whether it can make good on its document release promises or whether internal inertia will erode one of the administration's signature political pledges.</p>

A Democratic National Committee panel voted to void its election of David Hogg as vice chair of the Democratic Party on Monday. The initial vote comes after mounting internal criticism of Hogg, though party officials say the vote was based on a procedural challenge made in February claiming Hogg and another official were improperly elected. The DNC will vote later this year on whether to remove Hogg. "Today, the DNC took its first steps to remove me from my position as Vice Chair At-Large. While this vote was based on how the DNC conducted its officers' elections, which I had nothing to do with, it is also impossible to ignore the broader context of my work to reform the party which loomed large over this vote," Hogg said in a statement reacting to the vote. David Hogg, gun control advocate and survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School tragedy, had his election to DNC vice chair voided on Monday. Monday's vote also ousted Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta as DNC vice chair. Christine Pelosi, a member of the credentials committee and daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., argued the vote was not in reaction to their performance. "First, I want to say clearly and explicitly that this decision has nothing to do with the service of any DNC officer, especially [Hogg] or [Kenyatta]. This is about a violation of parliamentary procedure that was raised in a challenge filed back in February by another candidate for Vice Chair." I have total faith in our DNC members to review this issue and vote their conscience." Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her daughter Christine Pelosi hold "We Love Joe" signs as he speaks on the first day of the Democratic National Convention in 2024. Hogg clashed with veteran Democratic strategist James Carville over the plan during a joint appearance on journalist Tara Palmeri's podcast. Carville criticized it as "abominable" and "jacka--ery of the highest level" for prioritizing pushing out Democrats over beating Republicans. Hogg shot back that the party is capable of both. Carville demanded Hogg focus on winning elections against the GOP. Hogg insisted that the point of his strategy is to "win elections." James Carville and David Hogg sparred on a political podcast. "It's not to win an election in Queens which you don't ever run against a Republican.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), whose support is crucial for Trump's legislative agenda but is contingent on preserving Medicaid, wants to see what House Republicans can muster with their thin majority first. “Let's see what they actually pass,” Hawley told the Washington Examiner on Monday evening. It's a significantly pared-back version of initial proposals to slash Medicaid benefits alone by more than $800 billion. Still, the text includes de facto cuts that, if passed, would be sent to the Senate, where Hawley and other Senate Republicans are seeking to safeguard the government-subsidized health insurance program that covers some 80 million poor adults and children. Hawley described the “move away” from more drastic cuts previously floated by fiscal hawks as a positive sign. So let's see where the House gets to on that,” he said. The proposal includes work, education, or volunteer requirements of at least 80 hours per month for able-bodied beneficiaries; more frequent verification of income and residency eligibility; a freeze on an arrangement that allows states to boost federal Medicaid funding by taxing healthcare providers; and increasing co-payments by up to $35 for those above the federal poverty line. Federal Medicaid spending has skyrocketed since the expansion of eligibility under former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Democrats lambasted policies that they said would “eviscerate” the program. “Republicans promised for months that they would protect Medicaid,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said. “But now Americans know the truth: Republicans never intended to keep that promise, and this confirms it.” In a New York Times op-ed published Monday morning that appeared to be written in the days prior to the House GOP's bill release, Hawley penned a scathing rebuke warning his party that Medicaid cuts would be “morally wrong and politically suicidal.” “Republicans need to open their eyes: Our voters support social insurance programs. More than that, our voters depend on those programs,” Hawley wrote. “And there's a reason for this that Republicans would do well to ponder. Our economy is increasingly unfriendly to working people and their families.” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) is opposed because he said the bill, which also deals with border security, taxes, and energy, failed to go far enough on spending cuts. Libertarian Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a deficit hawk, is an expected opponent. Murkowski was optimistic about the changes involving how states tax healthcare providers because she said Alaska likely wouldn't be affected.</p>

Like Kennedy, she is an insider turned outsider: She graduated from Stanford Medical School but dropped out of her residency program in 2019 shortly before completing it because she came to view the health care system as “exploitative.” She's since pivoted to focus on personal wellness, challenging the health care establishment along the way. In 2019, she started a health tech company called Levels that marketed at-home glucose monitors. Perhaps coincidentally, last month, Kennedy floated having the federal government cover the costs of such devices for some patients, rather than cover new weight-loss drugs, as one way to arrest the country's obesity crisis. Last year, Means published a bestselling book called Good Energy, co-authored with her brother Calley Means, that cemented her place as a MAHA champion who would take on the health care industrial complex. In their book, the Meanses advance a theory of “metabolic dysfunction” — that Americans' bodies are bad at producing energy because of our poor diets and sedentary lifestyles, and which is the root cause of chronic diseases, including not only obesity and diabetes but even schizophrenia and depression. Good Energy paints a grand conspiracy that the food and medical industries have little motivation to prevent diseases from occurring because once a person becomes ill, they start using medical services and making money for health care providers. Experts say Means's commentary on metabolism is often overly simplistic. She can also stray into sounding more like a spiritual guru than a medical doctor, prone to talking about “dark energy” and speculating that our brains may be more like receivers that tap into the divine. “Humans are out of alignment with the Earth and depleting its life force,” she wrote last year. To Means's public health critics, she is both anti-science — she frequently criticizes vaccines in her weekly newsletter — and fundamentally unqualified to be, as the surgeon general is often known, America's doctor. “Appointing Casey Means, a non-practicing doctor who has spent years peddling unproven ‘health interventions,' means a surgeon general that will put a fringe practitioner of unproven functional medicine in charge of educating the American people about their health and disease challenges,” Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University, told the New York Times. “Casey articulates better than any American the North Star of a country where we have eliminated diabetes, heart disease, and obesity through prioritizing metabolic health,” Kennedy wrote on X. “Casey will help me ensure American children will be less medicated and better fed — and significantly healthier — during the next four years. She will be the best Surgeon General in American history.” Vivek Murthy, President Joe Biden's surgeon general, released a widely covered report on the loneliness epidemic and called for cancer warnings on alcohol packaging during his tenure. Already Means has outlined what she'd like to see: less corporate influence in health and food, less ultraprocessed foods in the American diet, a reformed meatpacking industry, and more. Means's priorities are consistent with Kennedy's agenda, which is why it was so surprising when Means's nomination sparked outrage among some in the MAHA universe. But before we get into why not, here's what's going on: Means's critics have gotten a lot of attention recently by portraying her as insufficiently committed to MAHA's various goals — particularly in her opposition to vaccines — and suggested that nebulous dark forces may be at work against the movement. As journalist Helena Bottemiller Evich wrote in her newsletter Food Fix, some anti-vaccine activists have come to believe an emphasis on food wellness has overtaken vaccine safety as Kennedy's primary focus, and Means's nomination exacerbated those tensions. According to the Washington Post, one anti-vax influencer said Means's appointment showed Kennedy was actually “powerless” within the Trump circle. “I don't know if RFK very clearly lied to me, or what is going on,” Nicole Shanahan, who was Kennedy's vice presidential candidate during his presidential run, posted on X. Shanahan, after speculating that Kennedy had come under somebody else's influence, called the Means siblings “aggressive and artificial.” Far-right commentator and internet personality Laura Loomer called Means “a Witch Doctor” and insisted Trump could not have selected her of his own accord. But according to Trump, he picked Means because Kennedy recommended her for the position. So while the rift is eye-catching, it is probably better understood as interpersonal rivalries spilling into the open rather than any meaningful change in direction for Kennedy or the MAHA agenda he is implementing at HHS. Kennedy has nurtured a movement in which conspiracy theories are commonplace and now that he's disappointed some of his supporters by endorsing Means, they are seeing more conspiracies. The MAHA movement encompasses everything from vaccine skepticism and elaborate theories of chronic disease to eliminating environmental toxins and eradicating corruption in the health system. Means may bring a particular focus on food and wellness to the surgeon general position, but if you look at his record so far, Kennedy has begun working aggressively across a wide range of issues. At the same time, Kennedy has already sought voluntary commitments from food manufacturers to remove artificial dyes from their products and tried to crack down on more additives in ultraprocessed foods. Last week, the FDA and NIH launched yet another research initiative, this one on diet-related chronic disease, that aims to understand how certain foods affect metabolism, the cornerstone of Means's theory of our modern health problems. All of this drama over Means's nomination does clarify some things about the MAHA movement: The coalition is reactive and conspiratorial, but its key figures are moving at stunning speed to remake the country's approach to health care. Tapping Means is another step in that direction; her nomination isn't a sign of MAHA fracturing — it's a sign of Kennedy doubling down. MAHA's political potency, much like Trump's MAGA movement, is aided by its malleability: Make America Healthy Again could mean a lot of different things to different people, from hardcore anti-vaxxers to the kind of crunchy conservative wellness influencer that Means typifies. Even if you largely stick to the agenda you laid out in a campaign — as Kennedy has done so far — some members of your coalition are bound to feel alienated and start airing grievances in public. Uh oh, the quest for a safer cigarette may have backfired.﻿</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. On border security, support for Israel and diplomacy with President Donald Trump, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has bucked the Democratic Party on key issues since assuming office in 2022. A string of media reports emerged this month detailing Fetterman's alleged cognitive decline and waning support within the Democratic Party. A New York Magazine report sparked questions about Fetterman's mental stability. Subsequent reports by the Associated Press, detailing an outburst during a union meeting, and by Politico, which indicated he is losing traction among Pennsylvania Democrats, were slammed by several of his Capitol Hill colleagues as a coordinated smear campaign. In an era of partisan politics, Fetterman has embraced bipartisanship with newly elected Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa. When McComrick was elected in November, the Pennsylvanians traded jabs for joint dinners as Fetterman built his reputation for being willing to reach across the aisle. Fetterman also met with Trump's controversial Cabinet picks and worked with Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., to pass the Laken Riley Act this year. While Fetterman, who suffered a stroke during his 2022 Senate campaign, shut down questions about his mental fitness amid the relentless reports, it's not the first time a Democrat has been targeted after falling out of line with the party. Schumer, currently Senate minority leader, was slammed by progressive Democrats while the future of party leadership hangs in the balance. Former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., was once a Democrat but later registered as an independent. While she continued to caucus with her party, Sinema ruffled liberal feathers by opposing efforts to eliminate the filibuster rule and opposed former President Joe Biden's "Build Back Better" plan. In 2022, Sinema said she was leaving the party, adding that "nothing will change about my values or my behavior." Sinema became the first senator to switch parties since the late Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter – then Republican – famously announced that "my change in party will enable me to be re-elected" in 2009. Soon after Sinema came now-former West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Things came to a head in Charleston when then-Gov. Jim Justice held up his bulldog Babydog backward in the legislative chamber and told actress Bette Midler – who had trashed the state over one of Manchin's such votes – to "kiss her heinie." Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, is now President Donald Trump's director of national intelligence. Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard was once considered a rising star in the Democratic Party until her comments and behavior drew the ire of party elders like Hillary Clinton. An advisor later said Gabbard was the figure in question. Since then, Gabbard has gone on to make a full partisan 180, becoming a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. During Rep. Nancy Pelosi's, D-Calif., historic speakership, another Democrat famously bucked the party and ultimately retired soon after trying to proverbially oust the queen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dallas Mavericks fans have spent the last few months in something akin to open rebellion against the team's front office after franchise icon Luka Dončić was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. On Monday, that all might have just become incredibly turbulent water under the bridge. 1 pick, the Mavericks might have just lucked into one of the all-time great draft shocks in sports history. Consider this: in the period after the deal, the Mavericks went 14-21, lost Anthony Davis – the main player they received in return for Dončić – for weeks due to injury in his first game with the team, lost talisman Kyrie Irving to a season-ending ACL injury and watched a slew of other players go down hurt. Dončić is just 26 years old, led the team to the NBA Finals a season earlier, had been named All-NBA each year he had been in the league and was entering his prime. All reporting around the deal indicated that Dončić never planned to leave Dallas, and his emotional return to Texas indicated that the pain of the surprise move still lingers with him. Related article How trading Luka Dončić led to one of the bleakest stretches for any fanbase in modern sports history At Duke, Flagg sometimes looked like he was playing a different game than the opposition. There were few things he couldn't do, even though he was among the youngest players in the country; he didn't turn 18 until the season had already started. “It's been a rough year as you all know,” Rolando Blackman, Mavericks ambassador and four-time NBA All-Star, said in an ESPN interview after the lottery. “We'll get a chance to move our franchise forward … It's really, really a great honor, and it's an important piece of the puzzle because we want to hoop down in Dallas.” Blackman said that Flagg “can hoop, he can play,” adding, “There's a lot of great players in that draft class … We will see how the guys get together and being able to make our team better which is exactly what we want to do.” An outstanding two-way player, Flagg will hope to fulfill Harrison's oft-repeated pledge in the wake of the Dončić trade: that defense wins championships. Related article Mavs GM Nico Harrison admits he was surprised by Luka Dončić's level of popularity with fans following shock trade to Lakers Dončić was absolutely beloved by the Mavericks fanbase – “He was ours,” Dallas fan John Tarrant told CNN Sports earlier this year. It's hard to imagine that Flagg will completely replace the 6-foot-6-inch, 230-pound, Dončić-shaped gap in the hearts of Mavs fans – at least right away. But his anticipated arrival in the Metroplex is likely to begin to quell one of the most tumultuous periods for any team in recent memory. If the Mavericks find themselves making a deep playoff run in a year or two, the embattled GM will likely be telling anyone within earshot: “I told you so!” Whether he'd deserve to do so is a fair question. He and his team entered Monday with a 1.8% chance of getting the top pick and got a lucky bounce which was so unlikely that online conspiracy theories were immediately created to explain it. Instead, it's just cemented something we already knew: the Dallas Mavericks' 2025 is going down as one of the most unlikely rollercoaster rides in sports history. Surely, Harrison is going to make the easy choice and take Flagg with the top pick. But after the last few months, it'd be hard to blame any Mavs fans for being on the edge of their seats until the teenage star's name is called by commissioner Adam Silver in Brooklyn next month.</p>
