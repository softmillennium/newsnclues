                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Trump slams tariffs ruling: President Donald Trump said some Supreme Court justices are a “disgrace to our nation” after the high court ruled that his sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch joined with Chief Justice John Roberts and the three liberal justices in the 6-3 ruling. While these new levies can only take effect for a maximum of 150 days, barring congressional approval for an extension, Trump claimed, “We have a right to do pretty much what we want to do.” The president said yesterday he was giving Iran 10 to 15 days before deciding on potential military action. President Donald Trump began his address by calling the Supreme Court's decision, which ruled that his sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal, “deeply disappointing.” CNN's Kit Maher, Elisabeth Buchwald, Adam Cancryn and Kevin Liptak contributed to this reporting. Those agreements granted partners lower tariff rates compared to what the president had threatened in exchange for promises to purchase more American goods and increase investments in the US. President Donald Trump said he “couldn't care less” if the Supreme Court justices who ruled that his tariffs are illegal attend his State of the Union address next week. “They are invited barely, barely,” the president said, referring to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch. “Honestly I couldn't care less if they come,” he added. He added that the three justices who dissented are “happily invited.” CNN has reached out to the Supreme Court about Trump's comments. President Donald Trump said Friday he expects the Supreme Court's decision invalidating his tariffs to prompt an extensive legal fight over whether his administration now has to pay companies billions of dollars in refunds. “Wouldn't you think they would have put one sentence in there saying, keep the money or don't keep the money, right?” Trump said during a press briefing. We'll end up being in court for the next five years.” President Donald Trump said Friday he's immediately going to enact a 10% global tariff under a trade law known as Section 122 following the Supreme Court's landmark ruling earlier in the day. But unlike the prior tariffs Trump imposed, the new levies can only be in place for a maximum of 150 days, barring congressional approval for an extension. Trump also told reporters he will be initiating several new investigations that are necessary precursors to imposing tariffs under a separate trade law known as Section 301. President Donald Trump says there are alternative methods to apply tariffs that could potentially generate more revenue than the emergency powers now off limits. We have alternatives,” he told reporters at the White House. “Now I'm going to go in a different direction, probably the direction I should have gone the first time,” he said, calling it “even stronger than our original choice.” He cited various laws and sections that he would use, including the 1974 Trade Act and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, but said it would make for a longer process. A number of those avenues require investigations before tariffs can be applied. President Donald Trump called the Supreme Court's decision “deeply disappointing” and said he's ashamed of the Supreme Court justices — some of whom he appointed — who ruled against his tariffs. During his first term, Trump appointed conservative justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who joined with Chief Justice John Roberts and the three liberal justices in the majority. “They're against anything that makes America strong, healthy and great again. They also are a frankly disgrace to our nation those justices,” Trump said. “When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them.” At a time when the United States is short millions of homes, new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have pushed building costs even higher. But many tariffs on the raw materials used to build new homes — such as those on lumber, steel and aluminum — will stay in place, despite the Supreme Court's decision today. : That's because they were imposed under separate laws allowing tariffs on national security threats or unfairly dumped imports. “With the nation facing a housing affordability crisis, NAHB urges the president to exempt building materials as part of his tariff strategy because they raise construction costs, impede supply chains and result in market and business uncertainty that make it difficult for builders to price their homes,” NAHB chairman Bill Owens said in a statement after the Supreme Court's decision. No one knows,” said Michael Wieder, co-founder of the baby and toddler product company Lalo. Wieder told CNN's “One Thing” podcast last spring that Trump's massive tariffs on China were hurting his bottom line and had to raise prices on some of their products as a result. Now that the Supreme Court has taken away the bulk of President Donald Trump's tariff-wielding authority, what does that mean for your prices? “Nothing,” said Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. That's because Trump has other tariff levers to pull. And even if the administration is ultimately required to refund companies that paid the overturned tariffs (a question that remains unsettled), that doesn't mean you'll get a refund for the higher prices you paid for sneakers, furniture or other items that grew more expensive because of Trump's policies. “Companies are highly unlikely to start trimming their prices as a result,” Roth said. So prices aren't likely to fall because of the ruling Friday. “There won't be a dramatic overnight change in prices,” she said. He declared eight of them in his first 100 days — about as many as other recent presidents had declared in entire four-year terms. And the reason is clear: They unlock emergency powers that Trump likes because he can exercise them on his own. But the justices seemed to have a warning for him, saying in no uncertain terms that emergency powers shouldn't be treated as some kind of cheat code. “'Emergency powers,' after all, ‘tend to kindle emergencies,'” they wrote. “And as the Framers understood, emergencies can ‘afford a ready pretext for usurpation' of congressional power,” they added. At another point, they summarized the Trump administration's argument as: “All it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a Presidential declaration of emergency, which the Government asserts is unreviewable.” And it's inauspicious for Trump, given how much of his agenda is built on claiming emergency powers and how many of those claims could go before these same justices. “No one can deny that the President's use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America's trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades. Senate GOP Leader John Thune said that tariffs “can be an important and effective tool,” but did not criticize the Supreme Court's ruling. Senate Republicans will continue working with the administration and our colleagues in the House to advance our shared goal to strengthen rural America, including South Dakota's farm and ranch communities, and the broader U.S. economy,” Thune said in a statement posted on X. Trump became enraged Friday morning when he learned about the decision, which declared his tariffs illegal, according to sources familiar with the matter. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the briefing will begin at 12:45 p.m. “For those who think it important for the Nation to impose more tariffs, I understand that today's decision will be disappointing,” he begins. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises,” Gorsuch says. He then suggests that Trump's tariffs, which often shifted by the day or even by the hour, are a good example of why legislation is preferable. American industry groups applauded the Supreme Court ruling Friday that struck down President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs. The National Retail Federation, which represents retailers including Walmart, Kroger and Costco, said the decision provided “much-needed certainty for US businesses and manufacturers.” “Clear and consistent trade policy is essential for economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for American families,” said David French, NRFs executive vice president of government relations. The US footwear industry said this decision “provides relief at a time when cost pressures have been significant.” “By removing these widespread tariffs, the footwear industry can redirect billions of dollars toward innovation, job creation, and affordability for families across the country,” said Matt Priest, president and CEO of FDRA. “Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year,” said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce. Following today's SCOTUS ruling that President Donald Trump's sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal, California Gov. Gavin Newsom called on the administration to “immediately” issue refund checks “with interest.” “ These tariffs were nothing more than an illegal cash grab that drove up prices and hurt working families, so you could wreck longstanding alliances and extort them. Every dollar unlawfully taken must be refunded immediately — with interest. CNN reported Thursday that Trump is still weighing his options for strikes if he goes ahead with military action, ranging from more limited, target strikes to sustained operations that could last weeks. The US has been engaged in a massive buildup of military assets in the Middle East, deploying fighter jets and refueling tankers, as well as flowing in dozens of cargo planes worth of equipment including additional air defense systems. The Supreme Court's decision to restrict some of President Donald Trump's tariff powers could end up being a gift to US consumers and businesses caught in the crossfire of higher import prices and skyrocketing uncertainty, economists said Friday. “It will force a reset in tariff policy that is likely to lead to lower overall tariff rates and a more orderly imposition of future tariffs,” Heather Long, Navy Federal Credit Union's chief economist, wrote Friday. “This will boost economic growth and provide some relief for American consumers. Smaller firms will be especially helped by this ruling.” However, while Friday's decision could force a more straightforward approach to enacting tariffs, it might only end up stoking already high uncertainty, cautioned Olu Sonola, head of US economics at Fitch Ratings. “However, the bigger macro takeaway is not just ‘lower tariffs,' but ‘higher tariff-regime uncertainty,'” he wrote Friday. “The odds that tariffs reappear in a revised form remain meaningful. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hailed the Supreme Court's ruling on the president's ability to impose tariffs as a victory. “We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks before he signs a presidential memorandum imposing tariffs and investment restrictions on China in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, March 22, 2018, in Washington. NEW YORK (AP) — The nation's highest court struck down some of U.S. President Donald Trump's most sweeping tariffs on Friday, in a 6-3 decision ruling that he overstepped his authority when using an emergency powers law to justify new taxes on goods from nearly every country in the world. Trump has launched a barrage of new tariffs over the last year. Despite Friday's ruling, many sectoral levies remain in place — and the president has already said that he'll turn to other options for more import taxes. But the Supreme Court decision upends a core set of tariffs that Trump imposed using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. IEEPA authorizes the president to broadly regulate commerce after declaring a national emergency. Here's a look at the now-overturned tariffs Trump imposed using IEEPA — and other levies that still stand today. Trump used IEEPA to slap import taxes on nearly every country in the world last spring. But the bulk of Liberation Day's higher levies got delayed by several months, and many rates were revised over time (in some cases after new “framework” agreements). Still, goods from countries with which the U.S. runs a trade surplus also faced taxes. Major trading partners impacted by Liberation Day tariffs include South Korea, Japan and the European Union — which combined export a range of products to the U.S., like electronics, cars and car parts and pharmaceuticals. Following trade talks, Trump's rates on most goods stood at 15% for the EU, Japan and South Korea ahead of Friday. But just last month, Trump threatened to hike levies on certain South Korean products to 25% — and countries worldwide still face sector-specific, non-IEEPA tariffs. At the start of his second term, Trump used IEEPA to impose new tariffs on America's three biggest trading partners: Mexico, Canada and China. To justify these tariffs, Trump declared a national emergency ostensibly over undocumented immigration and the trafficking of drugs like fentanyl and the chemicals made to use it. The levies were first announced at the start of February 2025, but went into effect over time — and were at times delayed, reduced or heightened through further retaliation. Ahead of Friday's decision, “trafficking tariffs” on Canadian and Mexican imports were 35% and 25%, respectively, for goods that don't comply with the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. That's down from 20% imposed by Trump earlier last year. Chinese goods also once saw sky-high levies after Liberation Day, but rates have since come down during trade talks. Canada is also the U.S.'s largest supplier of crude oil. Trump also used IEEPA to slap steep import taxes on Brazilian imports over the summer, citing the country's policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The Bolsonaro-related duties added another 40%, bringing total levies to 50% on many products ahead of Friday. But earlier this month, the U.S. and India reached a trade framework deal. Meanwhile, India said it would “eliminate or reduce tariffs” on all U.S. industrial goods and a range of agricultural products. Indian's top exports to the U.S. include pharmaceuticals, precious stones, clothing and textiles. Despite the Supreme Court knocking down sweeping import taxes Trump imposed with IEEPA, most countries still face steep tariffs from the U.S. on specific sectors. Citing national security threats, Trump has used another law — Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act — to slap levies on steel, aluminum, cars, copper and lumber worldwide. He began to roll out even more Section 232 tariffs in September, on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture. Amid pressure to lower rising prices, Trump has rolled back some of his tariffs recently. Beyond trade frameworks, that's included adding exemptions to specific levies and scrapping import taxes for goods like coffee, tropical fruit and beef. Still, Trump has threatened more sectoral levies are on the way. And following Friday's decision, he said that he would sign executive order to enact 10% global tariff — using another federal law, known as Section 122. Those tariffs would be limited to just 150 days, unless they are extended legislatively. AP Writers Paul Wiseman, Seung Min Kim and Lindsay Whitehurst contributed to this report.</p>

United States' Hunter Hess reacts during the men's freestyle skiing halfpipe qualifications at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Livigno, Italy, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026. LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — American freeskier Hunter Hess got to the end of his successful run in Olympic halfpipe qualifying, then leaned into the camera. He bent his left thumb and forefinger into the shape of an “L,” lifted it to his forehead and pointed at it with the other hand. Fired up after nailing his first run, he flashed the “L” sign, then explained he has used the entire episode as motivation. “I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this happen,” Hess said. “I'm not going to let controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. My original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn't take it that way. Hess was one of four Americans to qualify for the 12-man final, all of whom have a chance to give the U.S. team its first gold medal over nearly two weeks of skiing and snowboarding at the Livigno Snow Park. Hess' response: “If it aligns with my moral values, I feel like I'm representing it. Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the U.S.” “Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn't represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics. If that's the case, he shouldn't have tried out for the Team, and it's too bad he's on it,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social account. After a few days, that died down. Hess conceded it wasn't the easiest time. “I had a week that was pretty challenging,” he said. There was a lot of noise and I've never been subject to that kind of criticism. Skiing has saved my life time and time again and it seems to have done so again.” All those people are super entitled to their opinion, and I respect it.” I love the United States of America.</p>

An illegal immigrant is behind bars after police say he ambushed a woman on a popular Florida beach and attempted to drown her before leaving her for dead in a late-night attack. Said Alexander Hernandez Gonzalez, a 26-year-old Venezuelan national, was arrested on Sunday for his alleged role in the "unprovoked" attack at Tiger Shores Beach in Stuart, according to the Martin County Sheriff's Office. "This is an extremely alarming case," Martin County Sheriff John Budensiek told WEPC. "Random acts of violence like this are some of the most difficult crimes to solve — and that's exactly what this was." Said Alexander Hernandez Gonzalez, a 26-year-old Venezuelan national, was arrested on Sunday for his alleged role in the "unprovoked" attack at Tiger Shores Beach in Stuart, according to the Martin County Sheriff's Office. "About five minutes after passing him, she was brutally attacked," Budensiek reportedly said. "She was grabbed around the throat, dragged into the ocean, and held down as she struggled to break free." Said Alexander Hernandez Gonzalez remains in custody in the Martin County Jail, where he is being held without bond on charges of attempted first-degree premeditated murder. When she gained consciousness, the victim walked over a mile to nearby Stuart beach, where she was able to locate a sheriff's deputy. Upon being interviewed by police, he reportedly showed no remorse when told the victim survived the alleged attack. Said Alexander Hernandez Gonzalez entered the United States illegally in 2023, and was paroled and granted Temporary Protected Status by the Biden administration, according to the Department of Homeland Security. "When asked if he felt any remorse, his response was, ‘No, I don't feel nothing,'" Budensiek reportedly said. Hernandez Gonzalez remains in custody in the Martin County Jail, where he is being held without bond on charges of attempted first-degree premeditated murder. DHS has placed an immigration detainer against Hernandez-Gonzalez to ensure he remains in custody. "Said Alexander Hernandez Gonzalez — a product of the Biden administration's open-border policies — brutally attacked a woman on the beach and attempted to drown and kill her," Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. "She bravely fought back and survived this wicked attack. ICE has lodged an immigration detainer with the Martin County Sheriff's office, and because of Florida's cooperation with ICE, this sicko will never walk American streets again. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S." The Martin County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited decision in Learning Resources v. Trump on Friday, with a total of six justices concluding that a wide range of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal. Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican, wrote the opinion. At least some of his opinion was joined by five other justices, including Republican Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, along with the Court's three Democrats. But the Democratic justices withheld their support from seven key pages of Roberts's opinion, which discuss a recently created legal doctrine that consolidates power within the judiciary, thus denying a broader doctrinal victory to the Court's right flank. Trump's tariffs are gone, at least for now. And none of the Democratic justices needed to compromise on anything. Roberts's opinion lays out two separate rationales for striking down the tariffs. '” But it does not mean the power to tax. And thus Trump cannot use IEEPA to impose a tax on imports. It is likely that Trump will attempt to reinstate at least some of his tariffs by relying on other statutes. But, as Roberts points out, the federal laws that give the president more explicit authority to impose tariffs also limit his power to do so. One statute, for example, permits Trump to impose import taxes of no more than 15 percent, and for no longer than 150 days. Before Roberts lays out the statutory argument against the tariffs, however, he also claims they violate a controversial new legal doctrine known as “major questions,” which the Court first mentioned in a 2014 opinion. Because the major questions doctrine is so new, and because it's only ever been used against a Democratic president, many legal observers – including myself – had criticized it as an unprincipled effort to choke off the authority of Democratic administrations. In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Elena Kagan explains that she and her fellow Democrats believed it was unnecessary to invoke the major questions doctrine in Learning Resources because “the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today's result.” But three justices — Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett — all signed onto the seven pages of Roberts's opinion which argue that the tariffs violate this major questions doctrine. So that shows that half of the Court's Republicans are willing to use this doctrine against presidents of their own party. At a Federalist Society conference on executive power last spring, several speakers hosted by the powerful conservative legal group spoke out against the tariffs and questioned their legality. One of the lead lawyers challenging the tariffs was Michael McConnell, a former George W. Bush appointee to a federal appeals court. What's more, several prominent Republicans joined briefs opposing the tariffs. Learning Resources pitted Paul Ryan-style economic libertarians against MAGA-style Republicans who seek a more interventionist approach. And it pitted Republicans who have principled views in favor of free trade against Republicans who either had a shockingly rapid change of opinion about tariffs or believe that being a good partisan means following the leader. From Venezuelan oil to the Board of Peace, Trump is constantly looking for new sources of cash he can control. How Trump is signing off on his own new ballroom. Don't expect a war to end as quickly this time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump still has options to keep taxing imports aggressively even after the Supreme Court struck down the tariffs he imposed last year on nearly every country on earth. The Justices didn't buy the president's sweeping claims of authority to impose tariffs as he sees fit. But Trump can re-use tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression. “It's hard to see any pathway here where tariffs end,” said Georgetown trade law professor Kathleen Claussen. Trump had claimed nearly boundless authority to impose tariffs under 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Tariffs have been a cornerstone of Trump's foreign and economic policy in his second term, with double-digit “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on most countries, which he has justified by declaring America's longstanding trade deficits a national emergency. The average U.S. tariff has gone from 2.5% when Trump returned to the White House in January to nearly 17% a year later, the highest since 1934, according to calculations by Yale University's Budget Lab. The United States has long had a handy cudgel to wallop countries it accuses of engaging in “unjustifiable,” “unreasonable” or “discriminatory” trade practices. And Trump has made aggressive use of it himself — especially against China. In his first term, he cited Section 301 to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports in a dispute over the sharp-elbowed tactics that Beijing was using to challenge America's technological dominance. There are no limits on the size of Section 301 tariffs. They expire after four years but can be extended. But the administration's trade representative must conduct an investigation and typically hold a public hearing before imposing 301 tariffs. Experts have said Section 301 is useful in taking on China. But it has drawbacks when it comes to dealing with the smaller countries that Trump has hammered with reciprocal tariffs. In striking down Trump's reciprocal tariffs in May, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that the president couldn't use emergency powers to combat trade deficits. The administration doesn't even have to conduct an investigation beforehand. But Section 122 authority has never been used to apply tariffs, and there is some uncertainty about how it would work. He also plastered Section 232 tariffs on autos, auto parts, copper, lumber. In September, the president even levied Section 232 tariffs on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture. Nearly a century ago, with the U.S. and world economies in collapse, Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930, imposing hefty taxes on imports. Known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs (for their congressional sponsors), these levies have been widely condemned by economists and historians for limiting world commerce and making the Great Depression worse. They also got a memorable pop culture shoutout in the 1986 movie “Ferris Bueller's Day Off.” Section 338 of the law authorizes the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that have discriminated against U.S. businesses. Those tariffs have never been imposed — U.S. trade negotiators traditionally have favored Section 301 sanctions instead — though the United States used the threat of them as a bargaining chip in trade talks in the 1930s. In September, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that the administration was considering Section 338 as a Plan B if the Supreme Court ruled against Trump's use of emergency powers tariffs.

Actor and comedian Kevin James recently opened up about the harsh realities of life on the road. He said he'd driven eight hours for a one-night stand-up gig that paid very little — especially after factoring in travel costs. Exhausted from the trip, James checked into what he described as a "crappy motel-type thing." His plan was to take a quick nap before the show. And, he went on — "there's a roach in the blanket." James said he didn't ask for a new room. "I literally just put the blanket back," he said. After finishing the set, he made another decision. "Man, I'm not staying with a roach. James, shown with Adam Sandler, recently shared a surprising anecdote about a motel room experience during an early-career comedy trip. While he decided to leave the room immediately in the circumstances he described, pest experts say travelers who encounter a roach should take specific precautions. First, "to help reduce pest risks when checking in, keep your belongings elevated and away from soft surfaces — the bathroom is a smart place to store luggage, especially in the bathtub — while you inspect the room for signs of pest activity," Shannon Sked, national technical director at Orkin, told Fox News Digital. The pest control company is headquartered in Atlanta. Sked added that common hotel pests such as roaches and bedbugs are "excellent hitchhikers" — and inspecting a room before settling in can help prevent them from spreading through luggage. Next, "if you see a roach or a bedbug, notify the front desk right away," she said. Pest experts say travelers should inspect their hotel room before settling in — and should keep luggage off soft surfaces to avoid bringing any pests home. Fox News Digital reached out to James' team for comment. James is best known for his starring role on the long-running sitcom "The King of Queens" — and for appearing alongside Adam Sandler in films such as "Grown Ups." He currently stars in the new film "Solo Mio," which also features Jonathan Roumie. Kelly McGreal is a production assistant with the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

She discusses Russia-Ukraine peace efforts led by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and the potential for a ceasefire. For weeks, the U.S. military has quietly amassed what President Donald Trump has described as an "armada" in Iran's backyard. Mapped out across the Persian Gulf and beyond, the deployment tells its own story — one of calculated pressure backed by credible capability. The buildup coincides with indirect negotiations between Washington and Tehran over Iran's disputed nuclear program. Trump has warned that the regime must fully dismantle its nuclear infrastructure — or face consequences. President Donald Trump has demanded that the Iranian regime dismantle its nuclear weapons program. At the heart of America's force projection is another carrier strike group: USS Abraham Lincoln — a mobile fortress at sea, guarded by destroyers and equipped to unleash precision strikes at a moment's notice. On deck, F-35 fighters and F/A-18 attack aircraft sit within range of dozens of key Iranian military and nuclear targets. Meanwhile, in the Eastern Mediterranean, destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Roosevelt provide additional strike capability and missile defense coverage — and could potentially assist Israel in defending against any Iranian counterattack. Farther south, in the Red Sea, USS Delbert B. A U.S. destroyer there not only protects commercial traffic but also gives Washington the flexibility to respond quickly to threats moving between the Middle East and Europe. Their presence signals that the U.S. can both defend that vital choke point and, if necessary, strike Iranian targets from close range. Beyond naval forces, U.S. air power is spread across multiple Middle Eastern bases, giving commanders the ability to strike, defend and sustain operations quickly. Several types of combat aircraft are operating from regional bases, including F-15s, F-16s and the radar-evading F-35. The A-10 specializes in close-air support missions against armored threats. Those fighters are backed by a network of support aircraft. EA-18G electronic warfare aircraft can jam enemy radar and communications. E-3 Sentry aircraft serve as airborne command centers, tracking threats across wide areas. P-8 Poseidon planes patrol and monitor maritime activity. The assets give U.S. commanders flexibility to operate across air, sea and land. Taken together, the air and naval deployments create overlapping strike capability, missile defense coverage and control over major maritime routes. For Iran, it means U.S. forces are not concentrated in a single vulnerable location — they are distributed, layered and positioned to operate from multiple directions at once.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court handed President Donald Trump a major loss on Friday, striking down his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs as unlawfully implemented. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, finding that the law Trump cited to impose his “Liberation Day” tariffs on most countries and on Canada, Mexico, and China over the fentanyl crisis does not confer the sweeping power he claims it does. “Based on two words separated by 16 others in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA—'regulate' and ‘importation'—the President asserts the independent power to impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time,” Roberts wrote. “When Congress grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints,” Roberts wrote for the majority opinion. Roberts's majority ruling was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Kagan, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Jackson each wrote their own opinions concurring with the judgment. The three justices who dissented from the ruling were Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh, all conservatives. Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Alito and Thomas, while Thomas filed a separate dissenting opinion as well. “Rather, it empowers the President to regulate imports during national emergencies with the tools Presidents have traditionally and commonly used, including quotas, embargoes, and tariffs.” “The Court today nonetheless concludes otherwise and holds that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs to deal with the declared drug trafficking and trade deficit emergencies,” he added. Trump used the IEEPA to implement his sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” for most countries, with a 10% baseline rate and higher rates for select countries, along with his tariffs aimed at Canada, Mexico, and China over their role in the fentanyl crisis. Other tariffs imposed by the president on aluminum, steel, and cars, among other products, are not affected by the ruling, because they were implemented using a different law. Selections, were appealed after a trio of losses for the Trump administration in two federal district courts and one federal appeals court. Sotomayor plainly said she did not “understand this argument” from the DOJ that the tariffs did not impose a tax, a power given to Congress under the Constitution, during the November arguments, while Gorsuch expressed concern over future uses of such a sweeping tariff power.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump stands with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on his visit to the White House, Nov. 18, 2025, in Washington. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia could have some form of uranium enrichment within the kingdom under a proposed nuclear deal with the United States, congressional documents and an arms control group suggest, raising proliferation concerns as an atomic standoff between Iran and America continues. U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden both tried to reach a nuclear deal with the kingdom to share American technology. Nonproliferation experts warn any spinning centrifuges within Saudi Arabia could open the door to a possible weapons program for the kingdom, something its assertive crown prince has suggested he could pursue if Tehran obtains an atomic bomb. Already, Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan signed a mutual defense pact last year after Israel launched an attack on Qatar targeting Hamas officials. Pakistan's defense minister then said his nation's nuclear program “will be made available” to Saudi Arabia if needed, something seen as a warning for Israel, long believed to be the Middle East's only nuclear-armed state. Saudi Arabia did not respond to questions Friday from The Associated Press. The deal with Saudi Arabia could be worth billions of dollars, it adds. It listed enrichment, fuel fabrication and reprocessing as potential areas. “This suggests that once the bilateral safeguards agreement is in place, it will open the door for Saudi Arabia to acquire uranium enrichment technology or capabilities — possibly even from the United States,” Davenport wrote. “Even with restrictions and limits, it seems likely that Saudi Arabia will have a path to some type of uranium enrichment or access to knowledge about enrichment.” Saudi Arabia is a member state of the IAEA, a Vienna-based agency which promotes peaceful nuclear work but also inspects nations to ensure they don't have clandestine atomic weapons programs. The IAEA told the AP in a statement on Friday that it “maintains regular contact with both parties and is able to apply verification measures in connection with bilateral cooperation agreements.” Enrichment isn't an automatic path to a nuclear weapon — a nation also must master other steps including the use of synchronized high explosives, for instance. But the UAE did so without seeking enrichment, something nonproliferation experts have held up as the “gold standard” for nations wanting atomic power. The push for a Saudi-U.S. deal comes as Trump threatens military action against Iran if it doesn't reach a deal over its nuclear program. The Trump military push follows nationwide protests in Iran that saw its theocratic government launch a bloody crackdown on dissent that killed thousands and saw tens of thousands more reportedly detained. In Iran's case, it long has insisted its nuclear enrichment program is peaceful. Tehran also had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90% — making it the only country in the world to do so without a weapons program. Iranian diplomats long have pointed to 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's comments as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran won't build an atomic bomb. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's day-to-day ruler, has said if Iran obtains the bomb, “we will have to get one.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a marked departure from the highly visible and aggressive tactics employed by top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino. That approach, documented in Hollywood-style social media videos and touted by senior Trump officials at the time, is being tabled, for now, following the scenes that unfolded in Minneapolis, including the shooting deaths of two American citizens. “No more Bovino bullsh*t. That show is shut down,” a Homeland Security official told CNN. The return to ICE's typical immigration enforcement tactics, which include identifying targets ahead of time, instead of broad sweeps in areas trafficked by immigrants, comes amid waning public support for how the administration has been conducting immigration arrests. …  Under Secretary Noem's leadership, nearly 70% of ICE arrests are of illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S.,” a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement, citing more than 700,000 deportations under the Trump administration. While the administration has said it is prioritizing people with serious criminal records, many of those detained over the last year do not fall in that category. DHS also issued a recent memo stating that immigration authorities should detain refugees who have not yet obtained a green card and detain them for additional screening. Sources told CNN that late last year, agents had been more focused on developing targets rather than only relying on street encounters. But that changed with an unprecedented surge of thousands of federal agents to Minneapolis over a welfare-fraud scandal that ensnared the Somali community. And two other officers are under investigation over their accounts about what unfolded in an operation where one of the officers shot a Venezuelan man in the leg. Homan announced a federal drawdown in Minneapolis last week, citing agreements with local officials allowing additional cooperation. Current and former Homeland Security officials stressed that the latest move toward a more targeted enforcement approach doesn't mean that the crackdown is softening, as some cities may still see larger footprints of ICE agents. “What they were doing was hoping that high visibility enforcement operations would scare enough illegal aliens to increase self-deportation. I think that's part of what they were thinking,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for limited immigration. “What they didn't take into account is that people, even though they still back deportation of illegal aliens, they want to see less of the militarized type of action,” he added. After Trump dispatched Homan to Minneapolis, Bovino was sidelined and returned to his post as chief patrol agent of the El Centro sector. He's since confirmed on X that he was recently at Mammoth Mountain, the California ski resort, saying in a reply to a user: “Katie, the powder was excellent, and some shredding did take place!! Mammoth is an excellent mountain and looking forward to going back!!!! Bovino's bravado and heavy-handed arrest tactics in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and Minneapolis captured the administration's aggressive approach to its mass deportation pledge — and penchant for public sparring with critics over controversial actions. It also marked a pivot from the way enforcement responsibilities are generally divided between Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with the latter charged with interior immigration arrests. Bovino's enforcement style had been backed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Homan has generally taken a more stringent approach to immigration enforcement, wanting to focus on public safety and national security threats, as well as so-called “collaterals,” meaning undocumented immigrants that may be in the vicinity of a targeted operation. “ICE has been doing interior enforcement before Bovino got involved. They prefer to conduct their ops without the optics,” another Homeland Security official told CNN. “(Border Patrol) never wanted anything to do with these interior ops and will go back to focusing on the border.” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN in a statement, “The President's entire team is working together to implement his immigration enforcement agenda – which has always focused on prioritizing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens. The successful deportations, dropping crime rates, and historically secure border prove that. As always, anyone in the country illegally is eligible to be deported.” In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” Homan said he increased the presence of internal affairs officers in Minnesota since arriving in the Twin Cities to address misconduct allegations among immigration enforcement officers. “In any instance where there have been allegations of misconduct or working outside the policy, it has been referred to internal affairs,” he said. Homan said Sunday he doesn't agree with Noem “on everything,” but added that the pair regularly have discussions, and he described the administration's efforts as “one team one fight.” We bring different ideas to the table and then agree on a mission,” Homan said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawmakers who oversee the Department of Homeland Security say the agency has repeatedly stymied their requests for information in recent months, with even some Republicans alleging they've had phone calls go unanswered and data requests left to languish. As the Department of Homeland Security has found itself embroiled in controversies across the country over high-profile killings by immigration agents and the resulting bitter policy disputes, lawmakers say they've stepped up their efforts to try to get answers for the public. “I'm not going to sit here on bended knee hoping to God that somebody returns the call,” GOP Rep. Mark Amodei, the Republican who oversees the DHS budget in the House told CNN, after his request to speak with White House Border Czar Tom Homan went unanswered for days. One Republican staffer told CNN that the stonewalling extends beyond just thorny policy questions about immigration enforcement. Requests to the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the status of federal disaster funding and questions over potential crimes committed by those detained by federal officers have also been met with silence or evasiveness, the staffer said. “It's really a shame that DHS has taken such an adversarial posture on sharing data. In some areas, like on immigration and the border they have a great story to tell, and we could be helping them tell that story,” the staffer explained. “In other areas where the story is not so good, like FEMA, we could also help. But they choose to go at it alone, so it's on them to defend, which is hard to do when no one believes a word they say or a number they put out. Democrats, meanwhile, say they have received virtually no response from their inquiries to DHS. At least 15 letters sent by members of the party to the department have either been ghosted, received a cursory acknowledgement or were given a non-answer, a Homeland Security Committee Democratic aide told CNN. Another Democratic staffer told CNN that when they've asked for specific FEMA updates, whether it's on mitigation projects, staffing plans or briefings on various press releases, they've gotten no response. A DHS spokesperson told CNN the department works through “official channels” and would “not be litigating our relationship” with Capitol Hill through the press. “Any suggestion that DHS has ‘refused' to engage with lawmakers is simply false,” the spokesperson said in part, adding that “this administration has been the most transparent administration in history and has spent the last year clearing out congressional correspondence that went unanswered under the last administration.” Some Republicans told CNN they've been able to leverage their personal relationships with Trump administration officials to get their questions answered and others said they had no issues getting quick responses from DHS – “I communicate with them all the time,” GOP Rep. Andy Ogles said. But two top Republican congressman specifically tasked with overseeing DHS are among those who say they've run into issues. Amodei, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, sought to speak directly with Homan about the operation in Minneapolis shortly after federal officers' fatal encounter with Alex Pretti there, as well as to receive a broader status update on the administration's deportation efforts. Amodei's office put in the request in January and was redirected to White House Office of Legislative Affairs Director James Braid to coordinate the conversation. But Amodei, who projected confidence he'll get the information another way, suggested it was a question of respect. “I wish they were more professional with how they dealt with the people who handled their budget,” he told CNN from his Capitol Hill office. After withdrawing his initial request, Amodei has recently spoken with Braid about arranging a call with Homan, the congressman's office told CNN. Another Republican chairman — Rep. Andrew Garbarino of the House Homeland Security Committee — tried for weeks to schedule DHS Secretary Kristi Noem for testimony for the annual worldwide threats hearing before his panel, and eventually resorted to asking the White House in December to lean on her to agree on a date, according to a US official familiar with the discussions. Noem finally agreed to a hearing, where she was excoriated by Democrats for her handling of immigration, FEMA and other issues. The administration official declined to comment on any coordination with Garbarino, saying they don't discuss private conversations with members. Garbarino said at the eventual December hearing that he made “numerous accommodations” for Noem's appearance. CNN has reached out to Garbarino's office for comment. According to a data analysis compiled by ProQuest Congressional Data and shared with CNN, there has been a 28.7% decline in appearances of DHS officials before congressional committees in 2025, compared to the first year of previous administrations. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said he's never seen it this bad. I've met every secretary since the department was created in my office or in a number of occasions,” Thompson said. Witnesses before a hearing are required to submit their written testimony to Congress the day before a hearing, but Thompson said the ICE director came to his meeting with his prepared testimony in hand and said he was still working on it. If they're not forthcoming with the information, then it's almost impossible for the legislative branch to basically provide any road maps for future success because we don't have access to the data,” Thompson said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) criticized President Donald Trump on Thursday night for announcing he would be releasing government files related to aliens. “They've deployed the ultimate weapon of mass distraction, but the Epstein files aren't going away,” Massie said in a post on X. They've deployed the ultimate weapon of mass distraction, but the Epstein files aren't going away… even for aliens. Trump announced he would “begin the process” of releasing government files “related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena, and unidentified flying objects” in a Truth Social post on Thursday night. “Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,” Trump said in his Truth Social post.

Massie, along with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), has been one of Congress's most fervent supporters in demanding transparency regarding the Epstein files. Khanna introduced the Epstein Files Transparency Act on July 15, 2025, and Massie cosponsored it on the same day. Trump signed the bill into law in November.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would direct all relevant agencies to release government files related to aliens and any information “connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.” Trump cited a heightened interest in extraterrestrials as the reason for his new order in a Truth Social post. NASA also has a department dedicated to researching UAPs. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) backed Trump's move and called it a “bipartisan thing.” If he's going to release all of The X-Files, I think that could be a bipartisan thing,” Fetterman told Jesse Watters on Fox News, saying he believes alien life exists given the trillions of planets in the universe. During a recent interview, former President Barack Obama said aliens are real but that they aren't being held at Area 51 as online discourse has suggested for years and has been depicted in films and TV shows. Obama later clarified that during his tenure, he saw no evidence of aliens. Trump called Obama's comments “a big mistake” and said the former president was disclosing classified information. Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, previously said that the president already has a speech prepared to announce information about life beyond Earth. A reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt about the supposed speech, but Leavitt said she is not aware of such a thing but that she would “check in” with the president's speech writers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Retail mogul Les Wexner's lawyer scolded him over the lengthy answers given during a House oversight committee hearing on Wednesday. The video of Wexner's nearly five-hour deposition, where he was questioned about his association with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was released Thursday, and Wexner's lawyer could be heard telling him to tighten up his answers. The remark came after Wexner was asked how Epstein could have other clients when managing Wexner's extensive wealth portfolio, to which he began explaining the breakdown of his employees who manage his personal finances. Questions about President Donald Trump's relationship with Epstein also came up during the deposition. I always thought it was kind of odd … because [Trump] had nothing to do with fashion.” Wexner did not place Epstein and Trump together at the same fashion show, “I have no specific recollection.” He also said he didn't think of the two as friends and said Epstein “held him out as a friend.” Wexner answered questions from his home in New Albany, Ohio. Throughout the deposition, Wexner maintained that he was unaware of Epstein's involvement with underage girls and said their association ended when Epstein was being investigated in 2006. Wexner, the founder of LBrands, which owns clothing lines such as Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch, called Epstein a “conman” and said he was not aware of Epstein's crimes. He said Epstein called the services “favors” in a con to gain Wexner's trust.</p>
