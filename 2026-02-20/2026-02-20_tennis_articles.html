                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Pegula improved to 5-0 against Amanda Anisimova, and advanced to her 21st career final, after coming from a set and a break down to win their Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships semifinal. 4 seed Jessica Pegula pulled off a comeback from 6-1, 3-1 down to maintain her perfect record against No. 2 seed Amanda Anisimova, advancing to the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships final 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 in 2 hours and 2 minutes. Pegula now leads her head-to-head against Anisimova 5-0, backing up her wins in the 2020 Western & Southern Open second round, 2024 Charleston second round, 2024 Toronto final and last month's Australian Open quarterfinals. The 31-year-old booked her spot in her 21st career final on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, and 10th at WTA 1000 level or above. She is a three-time WTA 1000 champion (Guadalajara 2022, Montreal 2023 and Toronto 2024), a four-time WTA 1000 runner-up (Madrid 2022, Cincinnati 2024, Miami 2025, Wuhan 2025), and was also a finalist at the 2023 WTA Finals Cancun and 2024 US Open. She leads her head-to-head against Gauff 5-3 (including 3-1 on outdoor hard courts) and against Svitolina 5-3 (including 5-2 on outdoor hard courts). Pegula can usually be relied upon for concise and accurate match analysis as soon as her on-court interviews. She was playing some incredible tennis, and I just came out a little slow. And when you come out slow against Amanda, she can really just wipe you off the court, which is what she was doing. "I held on to my serve there in the second set. I had some break points in the first set, even though it was convincingly the other way, and I knew I could get some break points back. Indeed, there was no single, dramatic turning point. To break it down further, here are the key moments: Even though Pegula hadn't fully turned the scoreboard in her favour at this point, her tactics were beginning to wrest the match away from Anisimova's first-strike territory. Pegula was beginning to draw overhead errors with sky-high defensive lobs, and disrupt Anisimova's timing with defensive slices. She levelled again at 4-4 -- and this time, ran away with the momentum. "I was running a lot," Pegula said in her press conference. "I knew I had to use my legs, get my feet under me ... get my feet under and stay in the points because she was hitting a really big ball. I was just having trouble, like, starting the points. Then obviously at the end when I gained that momentum, it felt like there was a little bit of a lull in the energy where she was maybe, I don't know, a little tired. It was definitely mental and physical at the end." The end result was a turnaround in Anisimova's fortunes -- just 24 hours earlier, she had pulled off a comeback of her own, defeating Mirra Andreeva 2-5, 7-5, 7-6(4) from 6-2, 2-0 down. Pegula modestly claimed bafflement on this front, too. "It's not like we have easy matches. "I'm able to hit a low, flat ball, and not let her set up and go for her big shots, which is what she's good at. I try to utilize that the best I can and then mix in some variety, change things up. We had a lot of cat-and-mouse points, and they mostly went my way. And even if Pegula isn't taking it for granted, her perfect history against Anisimova is a reminder that, even when the scoreline's against her, she's never out of the match. "I'm sure it helps me," she said in her press conference. She was doing a very good job of not letting me get there ... Once I dug in, maybe she lost her timing a little bit, I was able to take my opportunity to do what I know probably bothers her." Jessica Pegula improved to 5-0 against Amanda Anisimova, and advanced to her 21st career final, after coming from a set and a break down to win their Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships semifinal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten are beginning to turn the tide in their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry with Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, following a composed championship-match victory at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open on Friday. Also winners in Adelaide, they became the second team to win multiple titles this season, joining Montpellier and Dallas champions Theo Arribage and Albano Olivetti. DOUBLES DELIGHT IN DOHA 🤩Heliovaara and Patten secure the trophy 🏆 #QatarExxonMobilOpen pic.twitter.com/EpZJ5PpTSy After losing their first four meetings against Cash and Glasspool, Heliovaara and Patten have now reduced the deficit to 2-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “We finished the end of 2025 really strong and just to keep that form in 2026, it's been a dream six months for us,” said Heliovaara, who won his maiden Nitto ATP Finals trophy with Patten in November. I had my family here in Doha this week — my wife and two kids — so it's always special to travel with them.” Heliovaara and Patten saved all seven break points they faced in the 69-minute final, according to Infosys ATP Stats. They are now up eight spots to No. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I just kept believing,” Tien said in his on-court interview. “I got broken on kind of a bad game at four all, but just tried to put that behind me as best I could, and just made him beat me.” But Tien played great defence, turning into a brick wall at the most critical moment. Tien is fresh off a run to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, where he beat a former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Daniil Medvedev, and pushed Alexander Zverev to a fourth-set tie-break. The lefty will next take on Frances Tiafoe, who won the first ATP Tour title of his career in Delray Beach in 2018. Obviously he's a totally different player," Tiafoe said. "I'm excited to get up and play him. Now I'm the underdog in that match, so I'm happy to get out there and play against him." The eighth-seeded Tiafoe clawed past qualifier Zachary Svajda 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 to reach his first quarter-final since July of last year. "It's nice to put some matches together. Happy I get to play another match tomorrow. Top seed Taylor Fritz also battled through a tough test, eliminating #NextGenATP Spaniard Rafael Jodar 7-6(4), 6-4 in the last match of the day. The home favourite hit 15 aces and saved two of the three break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Fritz has shown good form since returning to the United States, advancing to the Dallas semi-finals last week. The 2023 and 2024 Delray Beach champion will continue his title chase against close friend Tommy Paul, a 7-6(11), 6-3 winner against lucky loser Adam Walton.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff employed a classic strategy to deal with an enthusiastic crowd at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Thursday, most of whom there to support Gauff's opponent Alexandra Eala.“I had a similar match at French Open last year so I brought that mindset today,” Gauff explained on court after defeating Eala, 6-0, 6-2. I think that it helped me a lot!“If you can't beat ‘em, you've got to join them,” the American added with a laugh.This bit of reverse psychology has become popular for taking on tough crowds over the years, most notably from 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, who often found himself up against fan favorites like Roger Federer.“I have to say, it's great to be on a crowded court,” said Gauff, who hailed Eala's exploding fanbase as “great for tennis” ahead of their Dubai quarterfinal. “I've played this tournament for many years and to see the stadium full means a lot.” “I had a similar match at French Open last year so I brought that mindset today,” Gauff explained on court after defeating Eala, 6-0, 6-2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After winning an epic quarterfinal against defending champion Mirra Andreeva at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Thursday, Amanda Anisimova couldn't stop thinking about her opponent.After seeing Andreeva come back from 5-3 down in the third to force a winner-take-all tiebreaker, Anisimova confessed she was almost in tears. But when Andreeva's final backhand went long to hand Anisimova the hard-fought  2-6, 7-5, 7-6(4) win, the 18-year-old could hardly contain the emotions of seeing her chance to become the first woman since Elina Svitolina in 2017-18 to win Dubai in back-to-back years end.She doubled over with her hands on her knees, and after hugging it out with Anisimova, left the court teary-eyed. And in her on-court interview, the American offered a metaphorical shoulder to cry on. "It was such a tough battle, and I thought we played incredible tennis," Anisimova, who has been open about her own mental health struggles, said. We both fought so hard today, and it made me emotional seeing her like that. She was playing so well, she's the defending champion and I feel like we both won on the court today. "In her press conference, Anisimova expanded on what she said on court, saying that Andreeva is doing "all the right things" despite the dramatic defeat, and two earlier-than-expected exits from her last two events following a title at the Adelaide International.

You seemed really touched by when she broke down at the end. Can you talk about that moment.AMANDA ANISIMOVA: Yeah, made me like really emotional because I feel like we both sort of felt that way throughout the match probably because it was such a roller coaster, so up and down. Despite whichever way it was going, I feel like we were both fighting with everything we had and trying our best.Yeah, it's not easy to see someone that gives their all and then to react like that. In my mind, I was just, like, thinking if she keeps playing like this, there's a title around the corner for her. Obviously she's going to have a great year. She seems to be doing all the right things. Yeah, not easy to be a defending champion. I mean, there will be many more matches for us to come, I'm sure.For a spot in the final, Anisimova will face No. 12 seed and defending finalist Clara Tauson in another three-set quarterfinal. Anisimova will hope for some revenge after losing in two sets to Pegula in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open.

"I feel like that feels like such a long time ago for me because every week we have a lot going on. It's another challenge for me, another opportunity for me to learn more about myself and my game and see how things have changed since that match that I played at Australia. It's another chance for me to see how I've developed as a player and give my best."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Losses have been rare for Jannik Sinner in recent years. That is why when the Italian does fall short, it grabs plenty of people's attention. Jakub Mensik, last year's Miami champion, upset the No. This was straight off the back of a semi-final defeat to Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open. You May Also Like: Mensik stuns Sinner in Doha for biggest win of his career It had been a year and a half since Sinner lost before the final at two consecutive tournaments. For context, Novak Djokovic owns the best tour-level winning percentage on record at 83.3 per cent. His five championship-match defeats came against Carlos Alcaraz. So while Sinner has now lost in consecutive events before the final, that speaks to his consistency in recent years. Mensik will play Arthur Fils Friday for a place in the Doha final.
