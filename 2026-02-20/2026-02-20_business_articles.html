                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Friday he will sign an executive order imposing a new 10% "global tariff," hours after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping "reciprocal" import duties in a major rebuke of his trade agenda. The new "Section 122" tariffs will come on top of the existing levies that remain intact following the high court's decision, Trump said as he raged at the "deeply disappointing" ruling during a White House press briefing. "I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country," Trump said. Trump was adamant that he will find other ways to impose tariffs without Congress. "I don't have to," Trump said when asked why he did not want to work with the legislative branch. "I have the right to do tariffs." Trump's remarks vacillated between defiant and scathing. He even went after Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he nominated, after they voted with the majority in the 6-3 tariff ruling. "I think their decision was terrible," Trump said. He said he will sign an order later Friday imposing the new 10% duties, which are being invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Tariffs conjured using that statute can only last for 150 days, with any extension requiring congressional approval. Asked at the press briefing about that time limit and about getting congressional buy-in, Trump said, "We have the right to do pretty much what we want to do." Trump also declared that all the tariffs active under statutes known as Section 232 and Section 301 will remain "in full force and effect." The Trump administration is also wielding Section 301 to launch several investigations into potentially unfair trade practices, which could result in additional new tariffs, Trump said. Trump's reciprocal tariffs and his drug-trafficking-related duties both hinged on that law. The high court majority ruled Friday that IEEPA "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs." Trump said Friday, "other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected." "We'll take in more money, and we'll be a lot stronger for it," he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking at the Economic Club of Dallas shortly after Trump, said that the administration will replace the rejected IEEPA tariffs by leveraging a number of other existing tariff laws. "No one should expect that the tariff revenue will go down." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The collision, which occurred in Key Largo, Florida, killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides and severely injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. Tesla owner George McGee was driving his Model S sedan while using the company's Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system. During the trial, McGee said that when he dropped his phone while driving and scrambled to pick it up, he thought the system would brake if an obstacle was in the way. McGee's car instead accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 mph, hitting a nearby empty parked car as well as Angulo and Benavides, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle. A jury determined last year that Tesla should be held partially responsible for the fatal crash. In her order out Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom wrote that "evidence admitted at trial more than supports the jury verdict," and there was no error previously, or additional argument introduced justifying a new trial or change to the earlier verdict. "We are of course pleased, but also completely unsurprised that the honorable Judge Bloom upheld the jury's verdict finding Tesla liable for the integral role Autopilot and the company's misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed Naibel and permanently injured Dillon," Brett Schreiber, lead trial counsel for the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement. Tesla is way behind Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China, as both companies offer commercial ride-hailing services. Musk said last month that Tesla will have a "widespread" network of driverless robotaxis in the U.S. by the end of 2026, but the company doesn't yet offer driverless ride-hailing services widely and only operates a handful of robotaxis in Austin, Texas. Gibson Dunn, which represented Tesla, had argued that compensatory damages in the Florida case should be steeply reduced from $129 million to no more than $69 million, which would have resulted in Tesla having to pay a $23 million award. The firm also said punitive damages should be eliminated or reduced to, at most, three times compensatory damages due to a statutory cap in the state of Florida.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The student loan delinquency rate is surging, new research finds. Nearly 25% of student loan borrowers with a payment due are now behind, compared with around 9% in 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term, according to a report published Friday by The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank. The foundation used data from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel, a 2% nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with credit records, for its analysis. "By blocking access to the very programs designed to help struggling borrowers, Donald Trump is trapping millions in a spiral of debt that is destroying their credit scores and locking them out of homeownership, buying a car and other life milestones," said Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and lead author of the study. Ellen Keast, press secretary for higher education at the Education Department, said the Biden administration had masked delinquency rates with its relief measures for student loan borrowers. "The Trump Administration is once again reporting full and accurate data on student loan repayment instead of extending so-called flexibilities related to a pandemic that ended five years ago." More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service. Student loan borrowers are facing a recent barrage of changes to the lending system, including the end of the Biden administration's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That plan was designed to be the most affordable repayment plan to date, but faced Republican-led legal challenges and was ultimately blocked in court. For roughly five years, starting with the Covid pandemic, student loan borrowers who missed their payments were also shielded from collection activity and negative credit reporting. Around 2 million student loan borrowers with delinquent loans have seen their credit scores fall, with an average drop in score to 580 from 680, the Foundation estimates. Credit scores, which impact people's ability and costs to borrow, typically range from 300 to 850, with around 670 and higher considered good. The Education Department announced last year that it would begin collection activity against defaulted borrowers, but has repeatedly paused those enforcement efforts. The Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce have likely also exacerbated student loan borrowers' repayment struggles, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. In March, Trump officials terminated thousands of the Education Department's staffers, including many who helped borrowers. The administration has also rolled back the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's enforcement activity and sought to reduce the agency's staff and funding, although many of those actions have been challenged in court. "When you get rid of people who help borrowers face financial challenges, is it any surprise that these borrowers encounter problems dealing with debt?" More than 600,000 federal student loan holders remain in a backlog of applications for an affordable repayment plan, the Education Department disclosed in a recent court filing. More than 86,000 borrowers are waiting for a decision from the department on their student loan forgiveness. Student loan delinquency rates are especially high in several Southern states, according to the Century Foundation's analysis. In Louisiana and Mississippi, the analysis found, nearly 40% of federal student loan borrowers with payments due are delinquent, the largest shares nationwide. Black borrowers are struggling most, the researchers found. The law phases out several affordable repayment plans and lengthens terms for others. The median U.S. household, with a family of four and an income of $81,000, could see its monthly bill surge to $440 from $36, due to the legislative changes, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit organization that promotes college affordability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. trading partners offered a cautious welcome to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to strike down large parts of President Donald Trump's flagship trade policy on global tariffs — but global trade bodies warned of lingering uncertainty surrounding import levies. Trump's tariff regime impacted a swathe of countries from the U.K. to India and the European Union. Some governments, like Vietnam and Brazil are still in negotiation. "This is a matter for the U.S. to determine but we will continue to support U.K. businesses as further details are announced," the spokesperson said. The U.K. agreed a wide-ranging trade deal with the U.S. in May last year, which imposed a broad 10% levy on many goods, but also included certain carve-outs on steel, aluminium, cars and pharmaceuticals. William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the move "does little to clear the murky waters" for British businesses, warning that the President still has "other options at his disposal" to retain his current regime on steel and aluminium tariffs. "The court's decision also raises questions on how U.S. importers can reclaim levies already paid and whether U.K. exporters can also receive a share of any rebate depending on commercial trading terms," Bain said in a statement. Olof Gill, European Commission spokesperson for trade and economic security, said businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on "stability and predictability." "We remain in close contact with the U.S. Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling," Gill said. "We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them." Meanwhile, Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for U.S.-Canadian trade relations, said the decision "reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified." Elsewhere, Swissmem, Switzerland's technology industry association, welcomed the ruling — but warned that the Trump administration could invoke other laws to "legitimize tariffs," and called on Swiss policymakers to strengthen the competitiveness of the country with new free trade agreements. However, today's ruling doesn't win anything yet," Swissmem said. "The crucial thing now is to quickly secure relations with the U.S. through a binding trade agreement." The International Chamber of Commerce noted that many businesses will welcome the ruling given the "significant strain" that has been placed on balance sheets in recent months. "But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of U.S. import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex. Today's ruling is worrying silent on this issue and clear guidance from the Court of International Trade and the relevant U.S. authorities will be essential to minimise avoidable costs and prevent litigation risks," the ICC said. — CNBC's Jackson Peck and Greg Kennedy helped contribute to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're a 10-minute walk from the Palace of Versailles. My wife attends ISIPCA, one of the most prestigious graduate perfumery programs in the world, and I'm an American writer living right outside Paris. It may sound glamorous, but my daily routine hasn't really changed. After our move, my life has looked pretty much the same. I must admit, there was a wide-eyed part of me that thought the lifestyle of an American expat living outside Paris would all but confirm my Great American Novel, but the reality was much more boring. Although there are major differences in etiquette, architecture, food, and language, as a work-from-home writer, I was surprised to find myself mostly insulated from them. I arrived here knowing nobody but my wife. Most of the time, I'm alone all day. Sometimes I FaceTime friends and family back home, but the six-hour time difference forms a barrier. By the time they're getting off work, it's midnight in Versailles. I can go days without speaking French, unless you count Babbel. When I do, it's in 60-second batches, ordering a baguette at the nearby boulangerie or picking up a cheap bottle of Beaujolais at the local épicerie for a carb-heavy dinner. Then, I return to the apartment to write in English for hours on end, which is the same way I spent my time in New York. Granted, there are reminders even in my apartment that I'm in a different place: The hot water doesn't last long, the kitchen tile is a dark terra-cotta with darker grout, and the labels of the spices and sauces left behind in the kitchen are, naturally, all in French. After a while, though, even these charming distinctions recede into the furniture of daily life. I made an effort to tap into the community of expat writers in Paris. I went to the event, read some of my work, and met fellow English-speaking writers, mostly American and British. Another invited me to a literary journal launch event in Le Marais. Earlier that week, I didn't know anyone in Paris. My wife leaves first thing and doesn't return until dark. I welcome chores and errands, which break up the lonely monotony. When my wife comes home and asks me how my day was, I don't know how to respond. Some days are punctuated by heartwarming messages or small wins, like a friend reaching out or an editor accepting one of my stories. The bulk of my daily activities, however, remains unchanged. Admittedly, this malaise may be more a function of remote work than being alone in a strange place; I felt a similar isolation working remotely in New York, after all. It took my wife and me years to start to find a sense of community in our neighborhood. Around the time we were figuring that out, my wife got her acceptance letter. I suppose the repetitiveness of daily life is hardly unique, but I was surprised to find how similar it was here. Living in Versailles has put into focus something that was starting to come into view back in the US: The life you want doesn't come knocking on your door, regardless of where you are. You have to go out and find it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congressional Democrats rejoiced on Friday and Republicans remained divided in the wake of a momentous Supreme Court decision striking down a large portion of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda. Markets swung wildly," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement following the decision. "We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. The ruling is a major hit to Trump, who used a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to slap a barrage of tariffs on American trading partners. Tariffs and the economy more broadly will be a key messaging issue for Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections. Primaries start next month leading up to the November general election. The Supreme Court decision sets up additional potential showdowns in Congress over how to handle Trump's trade war after the U.S. House voted last week to overturn tariffs on Canada. For Republicans, Trump's tariffs, which have proven largely unpopular in a pivotal election year, are a more complicated issue. "SCOTUS's outrageous ruling handcuffs our fight against unfair trade that has devastated American workers for decades. These tariffs protected jobs, revived manufacturing, and forced cheaters like China to pay up," Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, posted to X. "This betrayal must be reversed and Republicans must get to work immediately on a reconciliation bill to codify the tariffs that had made our country the hottest country on earth!" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has voted with Democrats in opposition to Trump's tariffs, celebrated the decision. He and other opponents of the trade policy have argued that it is Congress, not the president, that has the constitutional authority to enact taxes and tariffs. "In defense of our Republic, the Supreme Court struck down using emergency powers to enact taxes," Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., posted on X. "This ruling will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism." The court ruled a little over a week after a small group of House Republicans joined most of their Democratic colleagues to overturn Trump's 35% tariff of Canada, though the resolution was largely symbolic since it would requires approval from the Senate and the White House to take effect. "The Constitution's checks and balances still work. Article One gives tariff authority to Congress," Bacon wrote on X. Some Democrats suggested Trump would look for other mechanism to impose tariffs, while some Republicans said that he should do so. The Supreme Court has struck down many of Trump's tariffs. Sadly, this President is absolutely dedicated to making you pay these taxes. "I will continue voting to block Trump's reckless tariffs in the Senate." In the House, Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., touted his legislation, dubbed the RELIEF Act, that would trigger tariff refunds to small businesses. "These taxes stole money from working families and small businesses who were forced to pay them from the very beginning. Now, it's time to start repairing the economic damage these Trump taxes have caused," Horsford posted to X. The legislation is symbolic because its success would require significant Republican buy-in in the GOP-controlled House and Senate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers after the Supreme Court ruled Friday in a 6-3 decision that tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal, a new estimate says. The potential refunds to a broad range of companies would be for tariffs already collected by the government since Trump slapped on the duties without authorization from Congress. Multiple importers already have pending lawsuits seeking refunds of their tariffs, citing lower-court rulings that found Trump's tariffs are not legal. The Supreme Court ruling on Friday did not say that the federal government could keep the money it has already collected from those tariffs but didn't explicitly address refunds. He was the first president to ever use IEEPA for that purpose. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three conservative members of the high court to dissent from Friday's ruling, warned about the potential logistical difficulty of having to refund tariffs already collected. "The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others," he wrote. "As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process is likely to be a 'mess,'" Kavanaugh wrote. "In addition, according to the Government, the IEEPA tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars — including with foreign nations from China to the United Kingdom to Japan, and more," he wrote. "The Court's decision could generate uncertainty regarding those trade arrangements." Brian LeBlanc, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group, in a LinkedIn post Friday said "we estimate" that the IEEPA-related tariffs that have been ruled illegal constitute "roughly 60% of the tariffs issued to date. Until President Trump replaces those tariffs with alternative authorities, the tariff rate just dropped from around 9.5% to around 5%," LeBlanc wrote. "Refunds are going to be tricky, and we expect the Trump administration to replace most (but not all) of this lost tariff revenue." U.S. Customs and Border Protection in December said the amount of tariffs collected that would be at risk of having to be refunded was $133.5 billion. That tally would have risen since then because of the ongoing collection of duties. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. importers will be facing many hurdles trying to recover billions in tariff costs now that the Supreme Court has ruled President Donald Trump's International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, tariffs are illegal. Companies large and small may be eligible for refund payments that in total could reach hundreds of billions of dollars, but trade attorneys have warned that tariff refunds could be denied or delayed, depending on how U.S. courts rule and how the legal system and U.S. Customs and Border Protection go about issuing any eligible payments. Record tariff revenue has been recorded by the U.S. government, with tariff collections surging in January to $30 billion and reaching a year-to-date total of $124 billion. That is up 304% from the same period in 2025. The Supreme Court decision could mean as much as $175 billion sought in refunds, according to estimates, but the ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded. In his dissent from the majority Supreme Court decision on Friday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote: "the Court's decision is not likely to greatly restrict Presidential tariff authority going forward. But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument." Trump wrote in a social media post back on Jan. 12 that "it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay." He added, "It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay." At a White House press conference on Friday afternoon, Trump raged against the Supreme Court decision and said of paying the refunds, "I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years. ... We'll end up being in court for the next five years." Trump also said he would sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, "over and above our normal tariffs already being charged. And we're also initiating several section 301, and other investigations to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies," Trump added, referring to another section of the 1974 act. Lori Mullins, director of operations at Rogers & Brown Custom Brokers, says her initial view of the Supreme Court decision is that it does not grant or guarantee refunds. Without knowing for certain, many believe that the refunds will not be issued retrospectively," she said. For importers hoping for refunds, "the answer is yes, we have a ruling but we do not have a ruling on if any refunds will be granted. "Keep in mind also that several countries have also already signed written agreements with specific tariff rates such as the signed agreement with the UK for a flat 15% tariff. This does not impact those already signed agreements so we are not sure, right now, how those country specific agreements will be impacted if at all," Mullins added. Timothy Keeler, partner and co-head of international trade practice at Mayer Brown and former chief of staff for U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, believes refunds will ultimately be due to companies. "It's just not clear what the process will be to get refunds. It's not clear if companies will have to file in court and become a plaintiff to get refunds, or whether it'll end up being an administrative process," handled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, he said. For starters, the Court of International Trade and litigants who file cases against the tariffs, in coordination with the U.S. government, would need some time to figure out how to manage any refund process. Even if courts ultimately rule refunds are required, importers betting on a cash infusion from tariff refunds should be aware there's no set timeline and any rush for refunds could overwhelm the system and likely lead to long delays. Joyce Adetutu, international trade lawyer at Vinson & Elkins, said her firm is telling clients it is going to be difficult to issue a broad-scale refund with the "push of a button." "I don't think that is going to be the scenario here," Adetutu said. "I think what's more likely is that the CIT and the government, Customs, are going to work together to try to allow those who have preserved their claim for a refund to seek that refund ... and those who don't protest will forfeit any refund," she added. "We believe it may take months, if not years, to be decided by the CIT," said Greg Tompsett, vice president of customs brokerage USA at logistics company Kuehne + Nagel. "The extended period of time may also result in additional subsequent lawsuits, which may drive that back to the Supreme Court. Companies will not only be seeking billions in tariff refunds, but billions that are tied up in customs bonds and collateral. International trade experts told CNBC that with some tariffs increasing from 10%-25% or more for certain products, importers are facing customs bond amounts that now range from the minimum bond amount by regulation of $50,000 to as high as $450 million. The rise in tariffs and related need for bonds and collateral has led to a historic number of "bond insufficiencies." CBP told CNBC it identified more than 24,000 customs bond "insufficiencies" valued at nearly $3.6 billion. That's double the 2019 level when insufficiencies first soared due to Trump's first-term tariffs under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. Importers have told CNBC because tariffs are itemized, as are their customs bonds and collateral documentation, in theory they should be able to receive their refunds quickly. However, trade attorneys also say it may be difficult for companies to get any refunds on bond overpayment or collateral quickly because the insurers will want to make sure they are not exposed to any tariff payments. Vincent Moy, international surety leader for Marsh Risk, recently told CNBC that companies should expect some lag time in receiving these customs bond funds due to insurance paperwork requirements. "If you are hoping that the collateral will just be returned in due course, the squeaky wheel may make this happen a little bit faster," Jennifer Diaz, board-certified international attorney at Diaz Trade Law, recently told CNBC. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asking for details on administration plans to refund businesses that paid the illegal tariffs. "Many American businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses, have struggled to pay these illegal tariffs and, for some, the financial strain has placed them on the brink of bankruptcy," wrote Cantwell. "It is essential Treasury implement an expeditious and transparent process to remediate the financial harm that resulted from these illegal tariffs."

The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority. Those IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. "What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms," he wrote. Every time Jacob publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the "major questions doctrine" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance. At a White House press conference, he said "foreign companies that have been ripping us off for years" were "ecstatic" about the rulings. He blasted the justices who ruled against him as "fools" and "lapdogs" for opposing political interests. Two groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. IEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to "regulate" importation in times of emergency. Lawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president. Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs. "Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies," he wrote. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty." The Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion. But his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a huge chunk of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, delivering a major rebuke of the president's key economic policy. The ruling is a massive loss for Trump, who has made tariffs — and his asserted power to impose them on any country at any time, without congressional input — a central feature of his second presidential term. Trump's legal stance "would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy," the majority concluded. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented. The decision noted that before Trump, no president had ever used the statute in question "to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope." To justify the "extraordinary" tariff powers, Trump must "point to clear congressional authorization," the court wrote. The ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded. That sum could total $175 billion, according to a new estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent that the refund process "is likely to be a 'mess,'" after predicting that the short-term impact of the court's tariff ruling "could be substantial." Since retaking the White House, Trump has rapidly reshaped America's long-standing trade relationships by imposing a staggering array of import duties that have touched nearly every country on earth. Many of those tariffs were invoked using a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. They include Trump's near-global "reciprocal" tariffs, and separate duties related to the alleged trafficking of deadly drugs into the U.S. Instead, it allows the president to "regulate … importation" of foreign property transactions after declaring a national emergency in order to deal with certain "unusual and extraordinary" threats. The Trump administration has argued that language empowers the president to impose tariffs on foreign goods. A federal trade court and a federal appeals court both found Trump's IEEPA tariffs illegal before the Supreme Court took up the case. "This ruling is a victory for every American family paying higher prices because of Trump's tariff taxes," Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the House Budget Committee's top-ranking Democrat, said in a statement. "The Supreme Court rejected Trump's attempt to impose what amounted to a national sales tax on hardworking Americans." Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a U.S. sneaker industry group, said Friday's ruling "marks an important step toward creating a more predictable and competitive environment for American businesses and consumers." "This ruling provides relief at a time when cost pressures have been significant," Matt Priest, president and CEO of the footwear group, said in a statement. The Distilled Spirits Council, an advocacy group for U.S. liquor makers, responded to the ruling by urging the Trump administration to "secure a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs" with top trade partners. Doing so "would provide much needed certainty for American spirits exporters while helping ease financial pressures on bars, restaurants and retailers at a time when affordability remains a major concern for consumers," said the council's president and CEO, Chris Swonger, in a statement. Trump last April unveiled his sweeping reciprocal tariff plans at a much-ballyhooed White House event marking what he had dubbed America's "liberation day." That announcement stoked a sudden market panic, and the tariffs were quickly put on pause. They have since been repeatedly tweaked, delayed and reimposed, adding confusion and further complexity to the administration's tangled web of trade policies. Other IEEPA-based tariffs include a set aimed at Mexico, Canada and China related to allegations that those countries have allowed the deadly drug fentanyl to flow into the U.S. Trump, a fierce critic of America's recent history of making free trade deals, has repeatedly praised tariffs as both a bountiful source of federal revenue and a key tool in negotiations with foreign partners and adversaries alike. He has claimed foreign countries bear the cost of his tariffs, and he has downplayed concerns that the taxes lead to higher prices for Americans. His administration, however, has admitted that the duties are paid by U.S. importers. He has also floated the idea of sending Americans $2,000 tariff dividend checks. Other estimates are significantly lower: The Bipartisan Policy Center, for instance, tallied U.S. gross tariff revenue in 2025 at about $289 billion. For the IEEPA-specific tariffs, the administration said it has collected about $129 billion in revenue as of Dec. 10. "If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED!" U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have stated they believed the Supreme Court would not undo the president's "signature" economic policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Forty minutes before the federal government revealed that economic growth slowed sharply in the last quarter, President Donald Trump dropped a hint that the incoming data would be weaker. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post at 7:50 a.m. At 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025. That's a decline of 3 percentage points from the previous three-month period. Trump's Friday morning post referred to last year's record-length government shutdown, which began Oct. 1 — the start of the fourth quarter — and lasted 43 days. The federal funding lapse was expected to take a toll on GDP. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that, depending on its length, the shutdown would shrink annualized real GDP growth in Q4 by up to 2 percentage points. But economists from Dow Jones were still estimating a 2.5% gain for the period. Trump has previously revealed economic data before its official release, raising questions about possible policy violations and concerns that traders may be getting a heads-up from the president, who can be briefed on the data before it comes out. The Office of Management and Budget not only prohibits executive branch officials from commenting early on such releases, but forbids public statements about them until 30 minutes after they have come out. A White House official defended Trump's post, telling CNBC on condition of anonymity that the president has consistently pointed out how the shutdown has been a drag on the economy, including by sharing GDP percentage figures "consistent with his 2% Truth this morning." In a Truth Social post in January, Trump indirectly revealed forthcoming nonfarm payrolls data. The White House at the time admitted that there was an "inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data" while attacking the media for "grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy." During his first presidential term, Trump signaled optimism about a blowout jobs report shortly before its release. Trump's post Friday morning also reiterated his long-running criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates as sharply or quickly as the president wants. He has previously branded Powell with the derisive nickname "Too Late"; it was unclear if the president meant to misspell the nickname in Friday's post.

Big Tech and watch fans could own the crossover piece of their dreams. Two custom timepieces made by Swiss watch brand Tudor for employee watch collector clubs at Apple and Google are up on the market. Silicon Valley is a place where flashy watches can be spotted on the wrists of leaders like Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison. A watch made for an employee group at Apple is up for bidding on watch auction house Loupe This, through February 25. The current bid as of Thursday afternoon stood at $13,500. The style is part of Tudor's Black Bay collection. About 82 of these "pirate" watches were produced around 2021, according to the Loupe This listing. It's also the character in a game you can play on Google Chrome. A similar model sold at an auction on Loupe This last week for $10,451. Other Pelagos models are reselling for around $4,000 on pre-owned watch marketplaces. Apple, Google, and Tudor did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Loupe This cofounder Eric Ku said these sorts of collaborations come together through groups reaching out to companies like Tudor for customized watches with their logo and other changes, like an engraving. "For tech nerds like myself, the pirate flag is a symbol that has a long tradition of being used by the Apple folks," Ku said. "Also, the imagery of that pirate flag is quite charming."</p>

Blue Owl Capital, a leading investor in the data center boom, was unable to arrange financing for a $4 billion data center it is co-developing in Pennsylvania after pitching lenders to help bankroll the project in recent months. An executive who arranges debt for major data center deals told Business Insider that the lack of interest in the Lancaster project was due to growing caution among lenders and investors about taking on sizable exposures to AI players with less-than-sterling credit.

A spokesman for Blue Owl said that the company had "considered" third-party financing for the Lancaster project "as we would with any transaction as we explore alternatives before choosing the most attractive path forward." The spokesman added that the project, which he said is already under construction, "is fully funded, on time, and on budget." It is unclear whether Blue Owl has been funding construction entirely from its own capital. Brennan Hawken, an equity analyst at BMO Capital Markets who covers Blue Owl, said that difficulties to raise debt for the Lancaster project would raise concern. "I'm not familiar with this deal, but if there is a struggle to find the debt financing, that's a bit of a red flag that I would want to drill into," Hawken said. Last summer, CoreWeave announced it would lease 100 megawatts of initial capacity at the Lancaster data center and potentially expand its commitment to 300 megawatts. The company said it would pour up to $6 billion into the project to equip it with chips and other cloud infrastructure. A month later, in August, Chirisa Technology Parks announced it would partner with Blue Owl and Machine Investment Group to develop the project. Last year, it structured a deal to partner with Meta in the ownership of a large data center campus that Meta will build and operate in Louisiana. Blue Owl utilized Meta's strong credit to raise $27.3 billion of investment-grade corporate bonds against its share of the project's equity, proceeds that will be used to help pay for construction, according to S&P. Blue Owl could arrange a similar type of vehicle that could attempt to tap the credit of an investment-grade customer of CoreWeave's who might use the Lancaster facility or Nvidia, the chipmaker that has purchased large stakes in CoreWeave. It could also potentially raise cash for construction debt by tapping large institutional investor clients to pool together a loan, Hawken said.Blue Owl is facing questions after reports emerged that it had permanently halted withdrawals on one of its retail private credit funds. Fluidstack signed another similar-sized lease in December with the data center builder TeraWulf that will also provide "investment-grade credit support."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Social media's most influential tech reviewer said Tesla keeps leaving him on read. "Tesla stopped talking to me," Brownlee said in a recent TikTok, filmed as he picked up the SUV from New Jersey EV dealer George Saliba. "It's not cause I gave them a negative review." Tesla stopped talking to @Marques Brownlee, so he's borrowing one of ours to review #cardealership #carreview #tesla Automakers typically offer loan cars to influencers and journalists for weeklong test drives, and Tesla has supplied Brownlee with its vehicles in the past. In 2023, Brownlee spoke out after the Cybertruck's delivery event. Brownlee said Tesla's reveal was "straight up not delivering" on its promises. And in September 20205, Brownlee publicly canceled his $50,000 deposit for two long-awaited Tesla Roadsters. "Tesla has been sitting with my 50 grand for eight years and hasn't done anything with it, obviously," he said on his "Waveform Podcast." Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. After spending time with the refreshed Model Y Performance — a dual-motor SUV with about 460 horsepower and a starting price of about $59,130 — Brownlee said Tesla still leads in several key areas. Brownlee said he wants more physical controls and argued that the trim doesn't meaningfully sharpen the steering or overall driving feel in sport mode. He also said Tesla's lead isn't as commanding as it once was, pointing to rising competition from Lucid, Rivian, and General Motors. It's not the first time Brownlee has turned to Saliba's lot when a carmaker didn't provide a vehicle. In 2024, he picked up a Fisker Ocean from the same dealership and called it the "worst car I've ever reviewed," setting up a PR firestorm for Fisker. Fisker filed for bankruptcy three months later.</p>

An esteemed American economist isn't feeling good about where things are headed. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and Columbia economist, said he believes the US economy would continue to weaken when speaking to CNBC about his macro outlook on Thursday. That's largely due to a handful of issues he sees hanging over the US, he said, pointing to tariffs, a decline in jobs, and interest rates in particular. "Not great right now, and the prospects are that we're just going to get worse," Stiglitz said of his economic outlook. His downbeat sentiment regardi g the US economy doesn't square with recent growth figures. Here's what explains his pessimistic view about where the US is headed: "If you look at who is paying these tariffs, it is the lower-end people in terms of percentage of their incomes," Stiglitz said. President Trump has said that tariffs would help jump-start a revival in America's manufacturing sector, but a recovery isn't yet visible in broad-strokes employment data, Stiglitz said. Employment in the manufacturing sector has declined for more than two years straight, according to data from the Labor Department. "The decline in blue-collar jobs is even larger," Stiglitz said. In particular, he pointed to recent comments from Kevin Warsh, Trump's Fed Chair nominee, who said that AI could unlock a productivity boom in the US. In that scenario, the economy could grow without stoking inflation, meaning the US could have room to lower interest rates more than markets expect. Stiglitz said he was "most disturbed" by Warsh's comments. "I don't think there's any significant body of thought that thinks that AI productivity increases are going to percolate into the macro economy fast enough to justify any significant or with any impact on rate increases.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok superstar Khaby Lame's $975 million deal is getting squeezed. Hong Kong-based Rich Sparkle Holdings last month unveiled plans to merge with Lame's social media and e-commerce business. The deal made Lame's payout dependent on Rich Sparkle's share price, which has plunged to $11.19 as of market close on Thursday from a high of over $180 last month. He is now the world's top TikTok influencer with over 160 million followers. As part of the deal, Rich Sparkle — formerly a financial printing company — planned to create an AI avatar of Lame to do brand deals and sell products on social media while earning a commission. The same is true if it goes up.) Rich Sparkle's drop-off isn't affecting Lame's current wealth, as there have been no formal filings indicating that the deal has closed or been approved by the Nasdaq. Paul Nary, a management professor at Wharton, said it's hard to know what will happen next. Public details about the business are scarce, and the company's value — based on a projection of how much Lame's fame could be worth — is hard to assess. If Lame's team and Rich Sparkle shared more financial information, it could boost confidence in the company, Nary said. "Normally, you'd have more specifics on the asset being acquired," he added. The Lame example highlights the friction many solo creators face in trying to translate their social media fame into big, sustainable businesses. Chinese platforms like Baidu, JD.com, and Alibaba's Taobao have become hubs for digital avatars to sell on livestreams. The avatar for one Chinese influencer, Luo Yonghao, drove over $7 million in sales during a more than 6-hour selling session last year, CNBC reported. While humans can appear more authentic to viewers, AI avatars can sell 24 hours a day without breaks and answer viewers' questions in real time. "After an hour, you start to lose your concentration, you start to lose your voice," said Alexandre Ouairy, Director of PLTFRM, a marketing, advertising, and e-commerce agency in China. "He's got a great following, but it doesn't translate to a parasocial relationship like Mark Rober or Jimmy Donaldson does," said Jim Louderback, a creator economy advisor, name-checking the popular science influencer and creator behind MrBeast. "Because the character he built on TikTok is separate from himself, if he decides to pull back, his character lives on in the digital twinning." Rich Sparkle's plan, in partnership with a Chinese marketing agency known as Three Sheep Group, is to use Lame's likeness to craft brand deals and sell products on apps like TikTok Shop, primarily in the US, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. As avatars become "the latest style of livestreaming in China," a lot of Chinese companies believe they can "copy the same format and do it in other countries," said Ophenia Liang, cofounder of the agency, Digital Crew, which helps Western brands break into the Chinese market. No matter how skilled Lame's partners are at cloning his likeness, it still may be very hard to translate his fame into $4 billion in annual live-commerce sales, the figure that Rich Sparkle said it could hit in its acquisition announcement, the marketers said. Whatnot, a buzzy platform focused on livestream commerce in the US and a few other markets, said it drove a total of $8 billion in 2025 product sales, as measured by gross merchandise value (GMV). Sales on other top US social commerce platforms like TikTok Shop are growing quickly, but are still a far cry from those in the Chinese market. During the busiest four-day stretch of the holiday shopping season last year, TikTok Shop said its total US sales were around $500 million. "Using his digital clone, there would be good revenue," Liang said of Lame, but he's unlikely to drive $4 billion in sales. While the influencer economy is a buzzy category among investors, it has yet to produce an enduring IPO success story, aside from social media giants like Meta and Reddit. That isn't stopping some creators from dreaming of going public. MrBeast's team has hinted at plans to IPO, for example. The top YouTuber's company was valued at around $5 billion in its latest funding round. Lame is looking to enter the public markets through a reverse merger. "I always think of reverse mergers as a poor man's IPO, because I don't have to spend all this money to get listed, and it's much cheaper than going through the IPO process," said Tim Loughran, a professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. Other creator economy firms have opted for reverse mergers to list on public markets, including the video app Triller and the Los Angeles influencer collective Clubhouse Media Group. Clubhouse shrunk down to a penny stock and is now traded over the counter. Triller was delisted by the Nasdaq in December after failing to file its SEC paperwork on time. One risk of running an influencer-fronted public company is reliance on a single personality to drive revenue. Gaming and esports company FaZe Clan, which went public in 2022 via a special-purpose acquisition company valued at $725 million, relied on one creator for about 20% of its revenue. "It would be very difficult to have an IPO for a company that's based entirely on an influencer and personality," Wharton's Nary said. "This is precisely a case of an asset that would be very hard to value and take through a standard IPO process.</p>

If you want to know one of the biggest rivalries in AI, just ask for a show of hands. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei provided what is sure to become an iconic image of their feud. In July 2015, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Altman, and a group of elite AI researchers all gathered at the swanky Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, California. According to The New York Times, Musk had a falling out with then-Google CEO Larry Page. Weeks later, Musk, Altman, Amodei, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, and others discussed the formation of a new AI lab to ensure Google had a worthy competitor in the AI space. Musk invited Amodei, per tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz. Their vision became OpenAI, though Amodei initially elected not to join the startup research lab. Roughly a year later, he changed his mind and joined OpenAI as "Team Lead for AI Safety." Amodei quickly moved up the ranks at OpenAI. In September 2018, the startup named him its research director. Altman, who cofounded OpenAI while still serving as president of Y Combinator, began to devote more time to the startup. In March 2019, Altman stepped down as YC's leader. He then became CEO of OpenAI and led the startup's pivot to a capped for-profit structure. A month later, OpenAI named Amodei as its Vice President of Research. To address safety concerns, OpenAI initially controlled access through a private beta. Hagey wrote that Amodei's stunning power within OpenAI had started to ruffle feathers. Differences continued to escalate over Amodei's long-held views on safety, Hagey wrote, especially regarding slowing the pace of updates to prevent malicious uses of the AI models. Amodei told friends that he "felt psychologically abused by Altman," Hagey wrote. Amodei has since suggested that his vision became incompatible with OpenAI's direction. "It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision," Amodei told podcaster Lex Friedman in 2024, when asked why he left OpenAI. With seven other former OpenAI employees, Amodei founded Anthropic in early 2021. The group was extremely close and included Daniela Amodei, Dario's sister. Daniela Amodei later said the name was chosen to emphasize their company's focus on humans. Only one of Anthropic's initial employees hadn't worked at OpenAI, according to AI Business. Amodei said he was worried about what the release of a powerful AI could mean. "I suspect it was the right thing to do," Amodei told Time Magazine in 2024. Months later, OpenAI released ChatGPT, kicking off the AI race and making Amodei's former employer a household name. During an appearance at a Bloomberg event, Amodei noted how Anthropic had kept its leadership intact. "Three and a half years later, we're all still at the company." While never calling out by name, OpenAI was experiencing upheaval at the time. Months earlier, Andrej Karpathy, an OpenAI cofounder, had left the company. And in November 2023, Altman was briefly pushed out of OpenAI, an effort fellow cofounder Ilya Sutskever assisted. He formally left OpenAI just days after Amodei's jab, though there had been months of speculation surrounding Sutskever's standing.) Journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Amodei about OpenAI's decision to declare a "code red" to marshal resources for ChatGPT amid Google's rising strength. We have a little bit of a privileged position where we can just keep growing and just keep developing our models, and we don't have to do any code reds," Amodei told Sorkin during an appearance at The New York Times' DealBook summit. Earlier in their conversation, Amodei appeared to take another swipe at Altman when he talked about some players "who are YOLOing" by making too risky bets on future demand based on their current revenue. "I'm not going to answer that," Amodei replied. Anthropic used the biggest stage available to take its most direct shot yet at OpenAI. Ahead of the Super Bowl, Anthropic revealed it was spending millions on an advertising campaign to denounce AI chatbot ads. The ads featured real human actors mimicking the voice of product-pushing AI chatbots when asked questions like how to get a six-pack quickly or how to better connect with your mom. "First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed," Altman wrote in a lengthy post on X." But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest." "Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people," he continued. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the opportunity to orchestrate a classic image of unity: competing CEOs with their hands raised together. (It's something Modi has done before with other world leaders, and politicians have been doing forever.) While Altman held the prime minister's hand, the OpenAI CEO didn't grasp Amodei's hand, who was positioned to his other side.</p>

The AI boom isn't just lifting chipmakers and Big Tech. As demand for AI chips surges, investors are piling into companies that sit inside the semiconductor supply chain — even if they're better known for bathrooms and soup stock. Toilet maker Toto, famous for its high-tech bidets and heated seats, has drawn investor attention. Memory prices have climbed sharply in recent months, driven by AI-related demand. Last week, UK-based activist fund Palliser Capital called Toto "the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary," according to reports by Bloomberg and the Financial Times.

After news broke on Tuesday that Palliser Capital had taken a stake and was pushing Toto to promote its chip-parts business, the toilet maker's stock jumped more than 5%. Japanese food giant Ajinomoto, better known for its umami seasonings and soup bases, has become an unlikely AI infrastructure play.

After Ajinomoto posted its earnings on February 5, the company's stock rose 13%. Not all non-tech companies are benefiting equally from the AI boom. Daikin, best known globally for its air conditioners, supplies high-purity chemical materials used in semiconductor manufacturing.

President Donald Trump says he is directing federal agencies to declassify UFO files. For traders betting on aliens, that could mean a very earthly payday. Earlier on Thursday, Trump took aim at former President Barack Obama, accusing him of improperly discussing classified material when speaking about extraterrestrial life on a recent podcast. Obama said in a tongue-in-cheek exchange with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen last week that aliens are "real" and that they're not "being kept" at Area 51.

On the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, guessing about aliens has become a high-volume betting category. The market has drawn more than $4 million in trading volume as of Thursday. Betting activity has also centered on whether a Trump administration would declassify UFO files before 2027, with odds climbing above 80% in December. Polymarket users also placed bets on other extraterrestrial theories, including whether mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey were aliens. If the files are released and contain anything definitive, longtime alien bettors may finally cash in. In November 2024, unidentified drones were seen flying at night over New Jersey and other East Coast states. At that time, Trump said the government "knows what is happening" but wasn't sharing it. I think they'd be better off saying what it is. A Facebook group titled "New Jersey Mystery Drones — let's solve it" has grown to more than 81,000 members as of writing.</p>
