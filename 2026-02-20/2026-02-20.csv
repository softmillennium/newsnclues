            House Speaker Mike Johnson has denied a request for the late Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. to lie in honor at the United States Capitol, citing past precedent over how the deaths of other high-profile figures were handled, according to sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The civil rights icon died this week at the age of 84. Jackson was praised by both Republicans and Democrats alike for his decades of activism and work in politics and international affairs. President Donald Trump repeatedly described Jackson this week as a “good man.”
    


            One of the sources told CNN that the decision to reject the request to lie in honor – which had been made on behalf of Jackson's family – was in keeping with precedent and was not political. The source said that requests for conservative political activist Charlie Kirk and former Vice President Dick Cheney were also denied, and that the general practice is for presidents, select military officials and select government officials to lie in honor. It was last done for former President Jimmy Carter.
    


            Lying in honor generally involves laying the casket of the deceased in the Rotunda of the US Capitol, where the public can come and offer final respects.
    


            Jackson's family has announced that next week, he will lie in repose at Rainbow PUSH headquarters in Chicago. That will be followed by formal services in his home state of South Carolina and in Washington, DC.
    


            Jackson, a fiery orator whose worked shaped the Democratic Party and America, twice made a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, inspiring Black America and stunning some with his ability to attract White voters. He rose to national prominence in the 1960s as a close aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
    


            His Rainbow Coalition, an alliance of Blacks, Whites, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans and LGBTQ people, helped pave the way for a more progressive Democratic Party.

            The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump violated federal law when he unilaterally imposed sweeping tariffs across the globe, a striking loss for the White House on an issue that has been central to the president's foreign policy and economic agenda.
    


            The decision is arguably the most important loss the second Trump administration has sustained at the conservative Supreme Court, which last year repeatedly sided with the president in a series of emergency rulings on immigration, the firing of the leaders of independent agencies and deep cuts to government spending.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion and the court agreed 6-3 that the tariffs exceeded the law. The court, however, did not say what should happen to the more than $130 billion in tariffs that has already been collected.
    


            “The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Roberts wrote for the court. “In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”
    


Trump's emergency tariffs are illegal, Supreme Court rules



            The emergency authority Trump attempted to rely on, the court said, “falls short.”
    


            Trump received the news of the tariffs in a note while he was meeting with governors at the White House on Friday morning.
    


            After he read the note, he said aloud “that's a disgrace” and then left the room shortly after, according a governor in the room.
    


            The president and Justice Department officials had framed the dispute in existential terms for the country, telling the justices that “with tariffs, we are a rich nation” but that without them, “we are a poor nation.” A group of small businesses who challenged the duties similarly warned that Trump's position represented a “breathtaking assertion of power” to effectively levy a tax without oversight from Congress.
    


            Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch joined with Roberts and the three liberal justices in the majority. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.
    


            In his opinion, Roberts brushed aside an argument from the administration that the president had power to use tariffs to regulate commerce. That was an issue that came up during the oral arguments last year as Trump suggested the president had inherent authority to issue the tariffs.
    


            “When Congress grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints,” Roberts wrote. “It did neither here.”
    


            “We claim no special competence in matters of economics or foreign affairs,” Roberts wrote. “We claim only, as we must, the limited role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution. Fulfilling that role, we hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.”
    


            The 6-3 majority offered no clarity on the specific practical question of what to do with the money the administration has already collected through Trump's tariffs. The issue of refunds has loomed large over the case, with Trump administration officials saying that potential repayments could have devastating consequences for the US economy.
    


            As of December 14, the federal government had collected $134 billion in revenue from the tariffs being challenged from over 301,000 different importers, according to United States Customs and Border Protection data as well as a recent filing submitted by the agency to the US Court of International Trade.
    


            That question will likely need to be sorted out by lower courts.
    


            In his dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that the court said “nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers.”
    


            “That process is likely to be a ‘mess,'” Kavanaugh wrote.
    


            “Even though the Supreme Court has already ruled in dozens of cases involving the second Trump administration, those all involved emergency applications; this was the first Trump-related case to which the Court gave full review – and it's an overwhelming loss for Trump on both the specific legal question and the more general ability to broadly use statutes like IEEPA,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
    


            “What that underscores is that, for as controversial as the court's grants of emergency relief to the Trump administration have been over the past 13 months, the court is still willing to assert itself when these cases reach the merits – something that we're likely to see again later this term in the birthright citizenship and Lisa Cook cases.”
    


            The case was the most significant involving the American economy to reach the Supreme Court in years, challenging the legality of Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs, as well as duties he imposed on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. At stake were tens of billions of dollars in revenue the government has already collected.
    


            The so-called “reciprocal” tariffs raised duties as high as 50% on key trading partners, including India and Brazil, and as high as 145% on China in 2025.
    


            Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to levy the import duties at issue in the case. That law allows a president to “regulate … importation” during emergencies. The administration argued the word plainly includes the power to impose tariffs, but the businesses noted that the words “tariff” or “duty” never appear in the law.
    


            That raised a series of difficult questions for the Supreme Court itself, which in case after case involving controversial policies from former President Joe Biden, ruled that an administration cannot take certain executive actions unilaterally without explicit authorization from Congress. That is particularly true, the court repeatedly ruled, when policies involve “major” political or economic questions.
    


            In 2023, for instance, the conservative majority relied on the “major questions doctrine” to block Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. A year earlier, the court stopped Biden's vaccine and testing requirement for 84 million Americans, concluding that Congress never explicitly gave the government the power to demand those measures during the Covid-19 pandemic. Even some conservatives said the same logic should apply when it came to Trump's tariffs.
    


            Trump offered several counter-arguments, most notably that the tariffs implicate foreign affairs, where courts have traditionally referred to the executive branch.
    


            Roberts did not accept that position.
    


            “Taxes, to be sure, may accomplish regulatory ends,” the chief justice wrote. “But it does not follow that the power to regulate something includes the power to tax it as a means of regulation.”
    


            The president has other more established authorities to levy tariffs without input from Congress. But each of those come with strings attached, such as time limits, that would make it harder for Trump to pursue his on-again-off-again strategy of raising and then lowering barriers as a negotiating tactic.
    


            Another provision of law, for instance, clearly allows a president to raise tariffs — but only up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days. Another authority gives the president the power to impose higher tariffs for national security reasons. It can only be used to target specific industries and requires an investigation by the Commerce Department.
    


            Every lower court that has reviewed Trump's emergency tariffs found they violated federal law, though for different reasons. In one case, led by a New York-based wine importer called V.O.S. Selections, the US Court of International Trade concluded in May that IEEPA didn't authorize Trump's emergency duties. That decision was affirmed months later by an appeals court in Washington, DC.
    


            In a separate case, an Illinois-based educational toy company, Learning Resources, sued in a federal district court in Washington, which also ruled against Trump. The case quickly went to the Supreme Court, leapfrogging the DC Circuit.
    


            The courts in both cases put their rulings on hold temporarily, allowing the administration to continue to collect the tariffs while the appeals played out.
    


            A significant question looming over the arguments was whether all businesses would be entitled to tariff payment refunds if the justices rule against the Trump administration's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs.
    


            The filing was in response to a group of importers, including Costco, requesting a preliminary injunction to prevent CBP from finalizing their tariff payments, a process formally known as liquidation. The importers argued that it was imperative for their payments to be unliquidated to get refunds down the road. Their request for a preliminary injunction was denied, however.
    


            The three-panel judge explained that their verdict was supported by the administration's promise to refund IEEPA tariff payments, if it came down to it, even if entries were liquidated. However, the administration has stated that it would likely be a laborious process.
    


            Justice Elena Kagan wrote a concurrence, joined by the two other liberals, to rebuff some of the reasoning that the three conservative justices ruling against Trump put forward for blocking the tariffs.
    


            She specifically took aim at their use of a judicial doctrine known as “major questions,” which says that if Congress is giving the president the power to take an action with major economic or political consequence, it must use specific legislative language saying that it is doing so. The conservative court repeatedly relied on the major questions doctrine to shoot down major policies enacted by the Biden administration, including his efforts to forgive student loans.
    


            Kagan has in the past criticized the conservative majority's use of the major questions doctrines to halt executive actions on environmental regulations. Likewise, she was wary of using that tool to strike down Trump's tariffs, even though she agreed with the decision to do so.
    


            “The use of a clear-statement rule here is unnecessary because ordinary principles of statutory interpretation lead to the same result,” she wrote. ” It is not just that the Government's arguments fail to satisfy an especially strict test; it is that they fail to satisfy the normal one.”
    


            She said that the normal tools of statutory interpretation pointed to the ruling against tariffs, because the relevant law gives the President the emergency authority to “regulate” the importation of goods and nothing in the definition of that word “naturally refers to levying taxes”
    


            For that and other reasons laid out in her concurrence, “straight-up statutory construction resolves this case for me,” Kagan wrote. ” I need no major-questions thumb on the interpretive scales.”
    


            In a rare statement, former Vice President Mike Pence praised the ruling against Trump as “a Victory for the American People and a Win for the Separation of Powers enshrined in the Constitution of the United States.”
    


            “Our Supreme Court has reaffirmed that the Constitution grants Congress – not the President – the power to tax,” Pence wrote in a post on X.
    


            “American families and American businesses pay American tariffs – not foreign countries. With this decision, American families and businesses can breathe a sigh of relief,” the post continues. “With this historic decision, America can now return to the pursuit of Free Trade with Free Nations under the Constitution of the United States!”
    


            GOP Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Don Bacon have both faced the president's ire for criticizing his tariffs and backing legislation aimed at blocking them.
    


            Bacon was one of only a handful of House Republicans to rebuke President Donald Trump's tariffs in a vote on the House floor last week.
    


            “I feel vindicated as I've been saying this for the last 12 months,” Bacon said in a statement. “In the future, Congress should defend its authorities and not just rely on Supreme Court. Besides the Constitutional concerns I had on the Administration's broad-based tariffs, I also do not think tariffs are smart economic policy. Broad-based tariffs are bad economics.”
    


            Shortly after the Supreme Court decision landed, Trump signaled he had a backup plan.
    


            The court only struck down one method for imposing tariffs – the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
    


            There are other provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the Tariff Act of 1930 that he could try. He already used some of these in his first term.
    


Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for example, allows tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days under certain circumstances.
    


            Another possibility is Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, commonly known as “Smoot-Hawley.” It allows tariffs of up to 50% for five months on a country that “discriminates” against US commerce. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cited this as a possible backup.

            When scientists with the National Center for Wildlife in Saudi Arabia were surveying caves in search of wildlife in 2022 and 2023, they came across something unexpected: seven naturally mummified cheetahs in five caves near the northern city of Arar. The remains were largely intact with well-preserved soft tissue and skeletons.
    


            Now, an analysis of three of the mummies' DNA has revealed something that could help reintroduce cheetahs to the Arabian Peninsula wilderness, researchers say.
    


            Cheetahs once inhabited much of Africa and parts of Asia, but now they are found in only 9% of their historic range. It was previously believed that the Asiatic cheetah, called Acinonyx jubatus venaticus, was the only subspecies ever present in Saudi Arabia. The species is now critically endangered, with a small wild population remaining in Iran. Across the peninsula, cheetahs were deemed locally extinct in the 1970s.
    


            But when the researchers analyzed three of the mummies, they found that two of the oldest specimens were genetically closer to the subspecies Acinonyx jubatus hecki, known as the Northwest African cheetah.
    


            The findings, published in January in the journal Communications Earth & Environment,  reveal that at least two subspecies of cheetah once roamed the Arabian Peninsula. The discovery could help reintroduction efforts as scientists now know which cheetah lineages once lived in the peninsula and have evidence of their success in the area.

            “It was highly surprising,” said lead author Ahmed Al Boug, an ecologist researcher and deputy CEO of the National Center for Wildlife in Saudi Arabia. “This finding represents the first documented case of natural mummification in cheetahs, and first physical evidence that cheetah subspecies occurred in the Arabian Peninsula.
    


            “Moreover, cave use by cheetahs is extremely atypical behavior, making both the discovery itself and the context in which it occurred entirely unexpected,” he added in an email.
    


            The researchers are investigating why the cheetahs entered and used the caves; they do not believe it was accidental or for isolation as they neared the end of life. Nonetheless, the cave environment and its hyper-arid conditions contributed to the mummification of the cheetahs, Al Boug said.
    


            Alongside the seven cheetah mummies, the researchers came across skeletal remains of 54 additional cats within the caves. The study authors dated five of them and found the oldest to be about 4,000 years old. Two mummies that were analyzed date from about 130 to 1,870 years ago, according to the study. The authors plan to investigate further the remaining mummies and skeleton fragments to potentially identify the subspecies of additional samples, Al Boug said.
    


            “This discovery is significant in that it represents the easternmost record of an African cheetah subspecies and demonstrates that northern Saudi Arabia was occupied by multiple cheetah lineages over millennia,” Al Boug said. “Together, these findings refine our understanding of cheetah landscape use, clarify timelines of regional extirpation, and improve resolution on the subspecies historically present in this region.”
    


            To identify the subspecies of the mummified cheetahs, the authors extracted complete genome sequences from three of the seven remains. It was the first time DNA has been extracted  from naturally mummified cheetahs or large felines, according to a news release from the journal.
    


            Adrian Tordiffe, a veterinary wildlife specialist based in India, said it is surprising that some of the cheetah remains were only about a century old as it reveals that these cats lived in Saudi Arabia far more recently than people realized.
    


            “Even more striking is that the remains show different subspecies of cheetahs lived there at different times,” said Tordiffe, also a lecturer at South Africa's University of Pretoria, in an email. He was not involved with the study.
    


            “This tells us the Arabian Peninsula was once an important natural bridge for cheetahs, not an ecological dead end.”
    


Arabian oryx: Back from the brink



            Tordiffe added that the discovery gives conservationists clear evidence of what species lived in the area in a not-so-distant past. “Because we now know which cheetah lineages lived in Arabia, reintroduction efforts can focus on using animals that are ecologically appropriate, rather than bringing in cheetahs from completely different environments.
    


            “The remains also include young animals and adults, showing that cheetahs weren't just passing through, they were breeding and thriving. That tells us the landscape once supported full cheetah populations, especially alongside prey species like gazelles, which are now being successfully restored in Saudi Arabia. This research turns cheetah reintroduction from a hopeful idea into a well-informed plan based on real evidence,” Tordiffe said.
    


            Wildlife populations in the Arabian Peninsula were historically diminished  by the impact of humans, including overhunting and land-use changes, Al Boug said. But now, with large, protected areas in the Middle East, many of the primary threats to cheetahs, such as habitat degradation, human disturbance and competition with lions have been reduced, he added. As a result, Al Boug said he believes that Saudi Arabia is well-positioned to support the recovery of a species once widespread across the region.
    


Animal sacrifices and astral tombs: The mysteries still emerging from the Saudi deserts



            “Showing the length of time the cheetah lived in Saudi Arabia shows that they were an important part of the ecosystem and not just passing through,” said Laurie Marker, founder and executive director of the Cheetah Conservation Fund, a nonprofit that acts to prevent the extinction of cheetahs. Marker was not involved with the new study, but the fund is partnered with the National Center for Wildlife for cheetah reintroduction efforts in Saudi Arabia.
    


            “Cheetahs and other top predators play important roles in the ecosystem. Cheetahs are great hunters and eat rapidly then   also leave remains for feeding other species. Therefore where we find top predators there is a greater amount of biodiversity as they feed the other small mammals, birds and insects,” she added in an email.
    


            “As the Saudis are bringing back their wildlife species, the cheetah will be an important addition to rewilding, bringing back a healthy ecosystem to the desert once again.”

The promotion of transgender ideas: OK or dangerous for society? Sanchez Effect features a debate between Steven Bonnell ll, the streamer known as ‘Destiny', and RT's Chay Bowes!

Rick wonders if recent mass shootings by transgender people could be driven by the ideology itself. Steven Bonnell II calls this idea nonsense and says that recent violence has nothing to do with transgenderism or its aggressive promotion, claiming more shootings are carried out by conservative white people. The host of RT's Moscow Mules Chay Bowes says many people have been left sad and depressed after being indoctrinated into changing their gender, leading some to radicalization.

Our guests cover many additional facets of this hotly debated topic, such as the exposure of children to transgenderism, its place in a democratic society and much more. Share your thoughts with Rick after watching the full episode here, on RT International.

A former Conservative Party member of the British parliament has announced that he has joined Ukraine's Azov Brigade. 

The unit was formed in 2014 by far-right activists and football hooligans and was subsequently incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. Azov's first commander was white supremacist Andrey Biletsky. Many of the unit's members hold ultranationalist views and have neo-Nazi tattoos.

Jack Lopresti, who represented the constituency of Filton and Bradley Stoke in Gloucestershire between 2010 and 2024, posted a photo on X on Thursday that shows him standing against the background of the brigade's banner featuring an SS symbol known as the Wolfsangel rune. 

“I am honoured to begin my service with the 12th Special Forces Brigade ‘Azov' of the National Guard of Ukraine, a unit that has become a symbol of resilience and uncompromising principle,” Lopresti wrote.

Lopresti joined the Ukrainian military in early 2025 after losing his seat in the House of Commons the previous year. A corporal with the UK Army Reserve, he first served as an intelligence officer in Ukraine's International Legion. 

The Azov Brigade has been accused of committing war crimes and criticized for using symbols associated with Nazi Germany's Waffen-SS. 

In October 2025, Ukrainian police announced they were dismantling a criminal gang reportedly linked to the brigade that was involved in abducting, torturing, and extorting civilians. 

Russia has repeatedly condemned the brigade and insisted that a peace settlement should include the “denazification” of Ukraine. Moscow considers all foreign nationals fighting for Kiev to be mercenaries and legitimate targets on the battlefield.

Elon Musk's X platform has filed an appeal against a €120 million ($141.5 million) fine handed down by the EU for alleged breaches of its Digital Services Act (DSA). Musk has accused the EU of deliberately targeting his platform over its refusal to censor users.

Three appeals were filed in the EU's Court of Justice this week: two by X and its AI subsidiary, and one by Musk himself. Back in December, the European Commission addressed the first non-compliance fine issued under the DSA.

The commission claimed that X breached the DSA's transparency requirements, and that its provision of blue verification checkmarks to paying users is a “deceptive” practice.

“This EU Decision resulted from an incomplete and superficial investigation, grave procedural errors, a tortured interpretation of the obligations under the DSA, and systematic breaches of rights of defence and basic due process requirements suggesting prosecutorial bias,” X's Global Government Affairs team said in a statement on Friday. 

Musk has accused the EU of deliberately trying to shut down X, claiming in 2024 that he was approached by the commission and offered an “illegal secret deal.” The billionaire claimed that he was told “if we quietly censored speech without telling anyone, they would not fine us.”

When the fine was issued in December, Musk called for the abolition of the EU. The US State Department sanctioned five EU officials in response, including former Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, who in 2024 threatened Musk with legal action if he broadcast an interview with then presidential candidate Donald Trump on X. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Breton and his colleagues “activists,” who “coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints.”

Documents published by the US House Judiciary Committee last month revealed that the EU used the threat of DSA fines to compel multiple social media platforms to suppress political content, including “anti-migrant” posts and “populist rhetoric.”

X is facing dozens of investigations in Europe, including parallel EU, UK, French, Irish, and Spanish probes into explicit images generated with its Grok AI bot.

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. India has resolved to continue purchasing Russian oil despite US pressure; gas reserves in the EU have fallen to a four-year low, heightening concerns about potential supply shortages and price increases; and the United States is assembling its largest regional naval and air presence since the Iraq invasion near Iran. These stories topped Friday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

India has made a definitive decision regarding Russian energy resources. New Delhi will continue purchasing oil despite pressure from the United States, India's Ambassador to Russia Vinay Kumar told Izvestia. On August 21, the foreign ministers of Russia and India are set to meet in Moscow to discuss deepening their strategic partnership. Earlier, Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Indian imports in response to India's purchases of Russian oil. According to experts, Washington is attempting to leverage these measures to secure more favorable terms and gain broader access to the Indian market.

India is not considering an embargo on Russian oil, Ambassador Vinay Kumar said. ""No, India buys what is best for itself. <…> The question is not whether to ban it or not. It is a matter of its security, of the country's economic and energy interests, particularly the energy needs of its people. Therefore, we will continue to purchase your oil depending on economic benefit. Our government has made it clear that India will take all measures to protect its national interests. And this is a national interest — the energy security of 1.4 bln people of India,"" the diplomat told Izvestia.

According to him, the country is highly sensitive to any measures or actions by those who ""infringe on India's sovereignty.""

Given the strong ties between Russia and India, which are also bound by close cooperation within BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the United States is unlikely to compel New Delhi to prohibit incoming supplies. However, Washington could trigger a substantial reduction in purchase volumes, Head of the Center for the Indo-Pacific Region at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Alexey Kupriyanov told Izvestia. In his view, such a development would slow the growth of India's oil refining sector and drive up domestic gasoline prices.

Moreover, it would create a supply shortage in the oil market and push global prices higher, Indian political scientist Rakesh Bhadauria noted. ""If India stops purchasing Russian oil, it will signal that it has yielded to US pressure and will undermine the country's policy of strategic autonomy,"" the expert said.

 

As of February 18, gas reserves in the underground storage (UGS) facilities of the European Union countries had fallen below 33%. Across Europe, with at least another month of the heating season remaining, only about 35.04 bln cubic meters of natural gas remain in storage. According to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), this is the lowest level recorded on this date in the past four years. Experts interviewed by Rossiyskaya Gazeta believe there is a moderate risk of a summer gas crisis in the EU, driven by low storage levels, restrictions on short-term Russian LNG imports, and pricing dynamics in the United States that could incentivize suppliers to keep elevated European gas prices.

Europe is placing its hopes on US liquefied natural gas (LNG), the production capacity of which is expanding. However, the United States itself has recently faced an unexpected challenge in its domestic gas market, the newspaper writes. Due to rising exports to the EU, gas prices in the US have increased by 50%, causing significant dissatisfaction among Americans. Although export restrictions have not been introduced, discussions about such measures are underway.

Russia is unlikely to return to the European gas market in the near term, but it could derive certain benefits if gas prices in the EU rise. First, pipeline deliveries of Russian gas to Europe will continue through September 30, 2027. Currently, prices for these supplies are generally linked to average quarterly exchange quotations. Export duties are levied on pipeline gas supplied to the federal budget of the Russian Federation, and the size of this duty depends on the gas price. Deliveries via the TurkStream pipeline to Europe are ongoing, providing an opportunity for additional revenue.

Experts surveyed by Rossiyskaya Gazeta assess the likelihood of a gas crisis in the EU this summer as moderate. Maria Belova, Research Director at Implementa, told the newspaper that low gas reserves in European underground storage facilities, combined with the forthcoming ban on short-term imports of Russian LNG, create a risk of supply shortages and rising gas prices in the coming summer months.

According to Alexey Grivach, Deputy Head of the National Energy Security Fund, much will depend on gas prices in the United States. Suppliers may have an interest in maintaining high gas prices in Europe despite an increase in supply.

 

A second US strike group, led by the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, is expected to reach the eastern Mediterranean by the coming weekend, which would enable its air wing to take part in a potential attack on Iran, experts told Izvestia. The United States is assembling the largest air grouping in the region since the invasion of Iraq. However, Iran possesses the means to respond to possible aggression — it has a sufficient number of ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as long-range drones, to simultaneously strike US military bases in the Middle East and targets in Israel.

According to monitoring resources, the aircraft carrier Gerald Ford is already in the Mediterranean Sea. It will require two to three days to reach the eastern part of the basin and assume its position there.

""It is believed that until this group arrives in the area near Iran, the United States is unlikely to initiate any active operations,"" military expert Dmitry Kornev told Izvestia. ""However, nothing actually prevents them from breaking that rule, since their decision-making will apparently be guided by short-term political motives known only to them,"" he added.

According to various estimates, more than 600 Tomahawk cruise missiles are currently deployed aboard US ships and submarines operating in the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the eastern Mediterranean.

Iran's retaliatory actions could include strikes using ballistic missiles and long-range kamikaze drones of the Shahed type. According to assessments by US and Israeli intelligence services and analytical centers, in 2025 Iran possessed the largest ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle East — up to 3,000 missiles.

""Iran will use all of this against targets in Israel and against American bases in the Persian Gulf region and across the broader Middle East. To defend its own territory, Iran will employ its air defense systems. It plans to repel the majority of US and Israeli air strikes. However, in June 2025, its air defense actions proved ineffective: the Americans and Israelis conducted several hundred sorties, yet not a single aircraft was downed,"" Dmitry Kornev said.

It is entirely possible that even the US military command does not know whether an operation will be launched, military expert Yuri Lyamin believes. ""Perhaps President Trump has already made a political decision, and they are simply concealing it. But it is also possible that no decision has yet been made, and it is impossible to say when it will be,"" he told Izvestia.

In the expert's view, once the concentration of forces in the region is completed in the coming days, a window of opportunity lasting several weeks will emerge for the United States.

 

Commenting on the recent trilateral negotiations in Geneva on a peaceful settlement of the military conflict with Russia, Vladimir Zelensky once again called on Western allies to prioritize a ceasefire, while also presenting this demand as backed by Washington. He justified the idea by citing the need to hold elections. Zelensky also proposed arranging a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss territorial and security issues. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta believe Zelensky's ceasefire and election proposals are largely rhetorical responses to Western political signals, while a direct meeting between Putin and Zelensky is viewed as highly unlikely.

If Western partners, together with the United States, helped deprive Russia of the necessary resources, this would make it possible to end the large-scale armed confrontation with the Russian Federation that has continued since February 2022, former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vladimir Ogryzko told journalists on Thursday following the trilateral consultations on February 17-18 in Geneva concerning a peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian conflict.

Oleg Barabanov, a professor at MGIMO University and Program Director of the Valdai International Discussion Club, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that Zelensky's references to the need for a temporary truce may also have been voiced in response to US President Donald Trump's proposal to hold new elections in Ukraine as soon as possible. Previously, officials in Kiev had pointed to the necessity of lifting martial law and allowing for a six-month preparation period for an electoral campaign. Now, however, Zelensky has stated that Kiev is ready to hold elections, but that doing so would require a ceasefire, even if only for two months. Russian representatives have mentioned only the possibility of halting hostilities for one day.

""However, the issue of elections does not appear to be central to the negotiating agenda. Nor is it central to Kiev's consultations with Western partners, which are primarily focused on security guarantees for the Ukrainian side. So, it seems that this was more of a rhetorical response by Zelensky in his interview,"" Barabanov suggested.

In the expert's view, the proposed negotiations between Putin and Zelensky will not take place in any format. ""In my opinion, such a meeting is psychologically impossible for the Russian side. Zelensky understands this and therefore regularly raises the issue,"" the expert believes.

 

Brent crude oil prices have returned to levels above $71 per barrel for the first time in six months. Over the past two days, quotations have risen by more than 6% amid reports that the United States is building up its military presence in the Middle East and that military action against Iran is expected. Should a negative scenario materialize, prices could reach $80 per barrel, as occurred in June 2025 during the exchange of missile strikes between Israel and Iran. On Russian markets, the situation has had a limited impact - however, experts do not rule out a reduced discount on Russian oil in the event of a reduction in global supplies from Iran, Kommersant writes.

The latest surge to a multi-month high was triggered by active US preparations for potential military operations against Iran, despite ongoing negotiations between the two countries.

""The strengthening of the US military presence in the Middle East and the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations increase the risk of supply disruptions, primarily through potential export restrictions or logistical risks in the region,"" investment banker Ilya Sushkov told Kommersant.

Iran remains a significant supplier of oil to the global market, with its exports estimated at 1.5-2 mln barrels per day. ""Any threats of tightening sanctions or physically restricting supplies directly affect the balance. The market is already at a sensitive juncture amid the geopolitical situation in another part of the world,"" Ruslan Klyshko, Director of the Wealth Management Department at AF Capital Asset Management, noted.

The principal concern for investors centers on the risk of a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which approximately 20 mln barrels of oil per day are transported — about 20% of global demand for crude — originating not only from Iran but also from Iraq, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.

Further developments in the region will remain a key factor for the oil market. According to Ruslan Klyshko, even a limited military operation could rapidly propel prices into the $80-85 per barrel range.

The recent rise in oil prices has had a limited impact on Russia's equity and currency markets. ""Given that the volume of Russia's external energy exports is declining both in physical terms and in value, the ruble's position is likely to deteriorate,"" Head of the Analytical Service Division at Zenit Bank Vladimir Evstifeev believes.

US president to hold news conference after 6-3 ruling against his tariffs; conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh dissented

Full report: Trump's tariffs are illegal, supreme court rules

Business live: Stock markets rally after Trump tariffs lose in court

Donald Trump is due to hold a press briefing at 12.45pm ET in what will be his first public remarks since the supreme court ruled against the legality of his sweeping global tariffs.

The only response we've had from the president so far is a comment he reportedly made at this morning's White House breakfast meeting with US governors. According to CNN he called the decision a “disgrace”.

We'll bring you all the key lines from the briefing once it gets under way.

Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, also welcomed the decision, slamming Trump's tariffs as “reckless, unconstitutional and costly” and “an abuse of executive power that unlawfully taxed millions of Americans”.

She said on X:

double quotation markTrump's sweeping tariffs were reckless, unconstitutional and costly for America's working families. Today, the Supreme Court rightfully struck them down, upholding the Constitution and rejecting an abuse of executive power that unlawfully taxed millions of Americans. The Court was clear. Tariffs cannot be enacted without the explicit authorization of Congress.

Another Republican senator, Susan Collins, of Maine, has welcomed the supreme court's ruling. She said on X:

double quotation markToday's Supreme Court ruling reaffirms that only Congress has the constitutional authority to impose tariffs, and the President can only do so under a clear and limited delegation of authority from Congress. My votes against the President unilaterally imposing tariffs on Canada reflected the same conclusion as well as my belief that these tariffs often harm Maine's economy and consumers.

We'll bring you all the key lines from the briefing once it gets under way.

Republican senator John Curtis, from Utah, welcomed the supreme court's ruling and, while not calling explicitly for refunds for consumers and small businesses, he also raises the question of “what happens to the revenue already collected”.

In a post on X he said:

double quotation markToday's ruling affirms, despite all the noise of the moment, that the Founders' system of checks and balances remains strong nearly 250 years later. Several questions remain unanswered, including what happens to the revenue already collected and how the Administration may use alternative authorities to impose tariffs. Looking ahead, it is critical that we provide the clarity and predictability businesses need.

California governor Gavin Newsom has also responded on X:

double quotation markEven Donald Trump's Supreme Court agrees: His tax on the American people is illegal. A huge win for families and small businesses across the country who have been suffering under this man's ego.

In a subsequent post, he added:

double quotation markIssue an immediate refund to all Americans for your illegal tax. Now.

However, as Shrai noted earlier, Elizabeth Warren has made the point that there is “no legal mechanism for consumers and many small businesses to recoup the money they have already paid”. She said:

double quotation markGiant corporations with their armies of lawyers and lobbyists can sue for tariff refunds, then just pocket the money for themselves. It's one more example of how the game is rigged.

Any refunds from the federal government should end up in the pockets of the millions of Americans and small businesses that were illegally cheated out of their hard-earned money by Donald Trump.

Democratic senator Tim Kaine has not minced his words in his response to the supreme court's ruling that Trump illegally used executive power when he imposed his sweeping global tariffs.

In a post on X, the Virginia senator wrote:

double quotation markWe told Trump his tariffs were illegal, dumb, and harmful to families, farms, and small businesses. Americans don't want tariffs, they want lower costs. Go back to square 1 and focus on US – not overseas invasions!

Dave Townsend, a lead attorney at Dorsey & Whitney who represents the US and foreign clients in trade litigation and disputes, said that it was “hard to overstate” the scale of the IEEPA tariffs as “they touch virtually every industry in one way or another”.

“Never in US history have tariffs been imposed by the executive branch so broadly. And likewise never in US history has a court invalidated tariffs on such a grand scale,” he added.

On the key question of refunds for those subjected to the now-invalidated IEEPA tariffs, Townsend noted that there are more than 2,000 lawsuits have already been brought seeking refunds, “but this is a small fraction” of US importers that may be entitled to them. A reminder that while that litigation was on pause during the supreme court's deliberation, legal experts say we could now see a “groundswell” of claims following today's ruling.

“The United States has said in litigation that more than 300,000 US importers have paid IEEPA tariffs. There are various ways that the refunds could be issued, and the supreme court did not say how the process should work,” Townsend said.

Mike Pence, the former vice-president during Donald Trump's first administration, welcomed the supreme court's decision that the president's global tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are illegal. 

“Our Supreme Court has reaffirmed that the Constitution grants Congress – not the President – the power to tax,” Pence said in a statement. “With this decision, American families and businesses can breathe a sigh of relief.”

Senator Rand Paul – a Republican who often bucks his party in Congress – welcomed the supreme court's ruling today.

“The Supreme Court makes plain what should have been obvious: ‘The power to impose tariffs is ‘very clearly a branch of the power to tax',” he wrote on social media, referring to the court's decision that Trump could not use the IEEPA and side-step Congress to implement the sweeping global tariffs.

Stephan Becker at Pillsbury notes that the big question is what happens next to the tariffs that are invalidated by the supreme court's ruling today.

“The administration will be keen to maintain the special bilateral agreements it previously struck with countries such as the UK in exchange for reducing tariffs,” Becker said.

He noted that the “broad speculation” is that Donald Trump would try to use the “previously obscure” Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which lets the President impose tariffs up to 15% for up to 150 days to address balance of payments problems. These levies would, however, require Congress's approval to extend beyond the deadline.

“This would allow the administration to quickly impose replacement tariffs while it takes the required procedural steps to impose tariffs under the other statutes,” Becker added.

The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, has said the supreme court's ruling that many of the president's global tariffs are illegal is “a win for the wallets of every American consumer”.

The administration's “chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable”, Schumer said. “Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly.”

Joining the chorus of lawmakers heralding the court's decision today, Schumer called on Donald Trump to “end this reckless trade war for good and finally give families and small businesses the relief they deserve”.

Reporting on international trade

Donald Trump is unlikely to abandon his tariff strategy on account of the supreme court ruling, say legal experts.

Basil Woodd-Walker, disputes and investigations partner at global law firm Simmons & Simmon said he can just switch focus from the blanket “liberation day” reciprocal tariffs he opposed on dozens of countries to sectoral tariffs.

“Most commentators had expected the supreme court to strike down Trump's IEEPA tariffs. But President Trump has made it clear that he is not going to abandon his international trade policy, and will find other ways to implement it,” he said. “The US administration may pivot to other tariff regimes or trade barriers to replace the lost income.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Mayor says Japanese city will respect donor's specification that £2.7m gift must be used to repair dilapidated system

Osaka has received a hefty gift of gold bars worth 560m yen (£2.7m) from an anonymous donor and a request for its specific use: to fix the Japanese city's dilapidated water pipes.

The gold bars, weighing a total of 21kg (46lb), were given to the Osaka City Waterworks Bureau in November by the donor who wants to help improve ageing water pipes, the mayor, Hideyuki Yokoyama, told reporters on Thursday.

“It's a staggering amount and I was speechless,” Yokoyama said. “Tackling ageing water pipes requires a huge investment, and I cannot thank enough for the donation.”

The mayor said the city –Japan's third largest, with 2.8 million people – would respect the donor's wishes and use the gift to improve waterworks projects.

Most of Japan's main public infrastructure was built during the rapid postwar economic growth, but urban development in Osaka, a regional commercial hub, started earlier than many and its water pipes and other infrastructure are ageing earlier, the city's waterworks official, Eiji Kotani, said.

Osaka needed to renew 160 miles (260km) of water pipes, he said. Renewing a 1.2 mile segment would cost about 500m yen, Kotani said.

Osaka had 92 cases of water pipe leaks under city roads in the fiscal year ending March 2025, Kotani said.

Concern over the safety of Japan's waterworks systems grew after a truck fell into a sinkhole last year, killing the driver. It was linked to a damaged sewer in Saitama, north of Tokyo.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukrainian president calls for another round of talks to be held “very soon, as early as this February”.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just posted a big update after he had a chance to get a debrief on this week's peace talks with Russia and the US in Geneva.

He said “real opportunities to end the war with dignity still exist,” and called for another round of talks to be held “very soon, as early as this February”.

Zelenskyy said “Ukraine's responses to the most difficult questions ahead of the next meeting are ready,” and they still want to raise some issues at the leaders' level with Trump and Putin.

“It is the leaders' format that could prove decisive in many respects, and Ukraine is ready for such a format,” he said.

He also pointedly thanked his team for showing patience in all conversations with Russians, saying they “have not always been easy or reasonable”.

The Ukrainian president also said that “Europe is actively engaged in the process of ending the war,” and it's role “must grow”.

… and on that note, it's a wrap for today!

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has insisted that “real opportunities to end the war with dignity still exist,” as he called for another round of talks with Russia and the US, and moving some issues to the leaders' level (15:39).

His comments come just days before the fourth anniversary of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, with some EU leaders expected to visit Kyiv (12:11), and others joining online for a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing (15:26).

The EU is also racing to adopt the latest, 20th, package of sanctions against Russia before the anniversary (12:47), after EU ambassadors failed to reach an agreement today (11:58).

Meanwhile, Kyiv said Friday that 10 people were arrested in Ukraine and Moldova on suspicion of planning to assassinate senior Ukrainian political figures on Moscow's orders, with payouts of up to $100,000 (10:43).

Ahead of the anniversary, the Guardian's Shaun Walker prepared a detailed account, largely reported for the first time, of how the US and Britain uncovered Vladimir Putin's plans to invade, and why most of Europe – including the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – dismissed them.

In other news,

German defence minister Boris Pistorius suggested the E5 group could establish a European version of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (12:53).

German chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Germany must assert itself and take on greater responsibility as a new world order rapidly takes shape (13:35).

The European Commission has dismissed criticism of its participation in Donald Trump's Board of Peace event in Washington DC, rejecting suggestions that it had no mandate for attending (12:25).

The European Commission's chief deputy spokesperson Olof Gill has now responded to the US ruling on behalf of the bloc, saying:

“We take note of the ruling by the U.S. supreme court and are analysing it carefully.

We remain in close contact with the U.S. administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling.

Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on stability and predictability in the trading relationship.

We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.”

The EU has repeatedly been threatened with punitive tariffs by the US administration, including, most recently, over the status of Greenland.

Meanwhile, the US supreme court has issued a sharp rebuke against the Trump administration and ruled against the legality of the president's sweeping global tariffs.

It is a primarily US news story, but will no doubt be closely followed by many across Europe amid Trump's semi-regular threats of punitive tariffs against the EU.

We spent a big part of yesterday looking at Donald Trump's Board of Peace, which continues to cause controversies in Europe (12:25).

What it is, what it is trying to secure, and will it really help Gaza?

Here's a short video explainer:

We are just getting a line from the Élysée Palace, via Reuters, that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will preside over a video conference meeting of the Coalition of the Willing on 24 February, the fourth anniversary of the Russian full-scale aggression on Ukraine.

UK's prime minister Keir Starmer will be the co-host.

France and Germany's plan to build a fighter jet of the future, planned to come with a swarm of drones and a “combat communications cloud”, is collapsing.

Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, said this week that the €100bn programme no longer worked for him. He insisted it was “not a political dispute”, but a technical one. France needs a jet that can carry nuclear weapons and launch from aircraft carriers, while Germany does not. However, the problems go back much further.

Known as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), the programme was announced to great fanfare in 2017 by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and then German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Spain joined in 2019.

The jet was meant to replace France and Germany's existing fighters by 2040, equipped with stealth capabilities and surrounded by drones scouting ahead or drawing enemy fire, all sharing data in real time.

Europe already fields three competing fighter jets – the Eurofighter Typhoon, France's Rafale and Sweden's Gripen. Successive chief executives of the pan-European aerospace company Airbus have warned the continent must consolidate these projects. Yet the collapse of FCAS would do the opposite, with a British-Italian-Japanese Tempest project and a mooted Gripen successor already in the mix.

For a bloc that collectively spent €381bn (£333bn) on defence last year but struggles to turn that into military capability, the stakes are high. Threats from Russia are mounting and Donald Trump has told Europe it is time to pay for its own security.

But for years, the companies building the Franco-German jet have not been able to agree who is in charge.

Let's briefly go back to the E5 defence minister's words on closer cooperation and all great things they can achieve together (12:53, 13:02).

As Alex Daniel will explain in a moment, it does not always work out that smoothly.

Over in the UK, the papers are focusing on the arrest of the 66-year old former prince, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and the consequences for the royal family.

My colleague Sam Jones looked also at the coverage in Europe, and discovered that neither the shock nor the historical significance of the event was lost on the European press.

And if there was one thing that correspondents and leader writers around the continent could agree on, it was that the former prince's detention had plunged the British monarchy into a place of unprecedented danger and vulnerability.

Separately, German chancellor Friedrich Merz has addressed the national party conference of his CDU party earlier today, telling members that Germany must assert itself and take on greater responsibility as a new world order rapidly takes shape, Reuters reported.

He repeated his claim from last week's Munich Security Conference that the rules-based international order “as we knew it no longer exists.”

“This will result in a new grand strategy for Germany in a united Europe. We are showing courage, the courage to shape the future, and the courage to assert ourselves,” he added.

Merz also reaffirmed his pledge that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.

“We will not allow these people from the so-called Alternative for Germany to ruin our country,” he said, adding that “this party cannot be a partner of the CDU.”

Germany's Pistorius was also asked about recent talk about Europe establishing its independent nuclear deterrence systems.

He says that while Europe needs to take more responsibility for its conventional deterrence and defence, but broader nuclear protection “is provided and will be provided by the US, at least for the foreseeable future.”

Picking up on Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz's comments on nuclear deterrence at the Munich Security Conference last week, he said that Germany was legally bound to not have nuclear weapons.

But he said it could support defence capabilities of France and other allies “by conventional measures, but not in terms of nuclear participation – and that I think is quite clear.”

Meanwhile, UK's junior defence minister Luke Pollard hailed the E5's new initiative to work on advanced low-cost air defence systems, such as autonomous drones or missiles, as part of the ‘Low-Cost Effectors & Autonomous Platforms' initiative, known as LEAP.

Its first focus will be on a new surface-to-air weapon – a lightweight, affordable weapon designed to counter the drone and missile threat, the UK's Ministry of Defence said.

Speaking in Kraków, Pollard said that “it's actions, not words, that will deter Putin,” adding that he feels confident that “this is the very first step of what we hope will be a series of initiatives under LEAP to look at how we can have ground to air and other capabilities that pulls our collective experience.”

Pollard also specifically wanted to send a message “to the people of Poland” and the Poles back in the UK, saying that they should “be in no doubt that when you need us, the UK will be there for you.”

German defence minister Boris Pistorius suggested the E5 grouping of Europe's five countries – France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom – could expand its cooperation to have a joint tanker fleet or even establish a European version of the Five Eyes alliance.

“What can we do next? One idea could be to consider the idea of a joint tanker fleet or multi-domain taskforce, or even a European version of Five Eyes,” he said at a press conference in Kraków, Poland.

The Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing alliance including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US.

Pistorius also said that Russia's continuing attacks on Ukraine amounted to “not simply a war,” but “terror against the civilian population of Ukraine.”

He said that “only maximum pressure from sanctions” can make Putin “back down” from his attacks.

Not much on sanctions from Brussels, but the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, is speaking at the E5 meeting in Kraków and she says that the bloc still aims to pass the 20th package of sanctions on Monday, despite ambassadors failing to agree on them today (11:58).

“Next Monday, we aim to adopt the 20th sanctions package against Russia,” she said.

She insisted:

“Sanctions are working.

They are severely hurting Russia's economy, and each new measure further limits its ability to wage the war. Moscow is not invincible. Its army is suffering record casualties, and its economy is under heavy strain.

But Putin won't end this war until the costs are higher than the benefits, and that is the point we must reach.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A general strike protesting Argentine President Javier Milei's flagship overhaul of the country's labor law disrupted public transport, hospitals, ports and schools across Argentina on Thursday, and intensified a standoff between the libertarian leader and long-powerful workers' unions.

The lower house of the Argentine Congress yesterday approved the bill, which grants employers greater flexibility in matters of hiring, firing, severance and collective bargaining, in a 135-115 vote.

As lawmakers debated the reform, bus lines and subways ground to a halt. Factories paused production, banks closed, airlines canceled hundreds of flights and public hospitals postponed all but emergency surgeries. Uncollected garbage lined streets and shopping areas.

A march to the Argentine Congress by radical left-wing unions briefly turned violent as police fired water canons at protesters throwing stones and bottles.

Milei considered the changes to Argentina's half-century-old labor code crucial to his efforts to lure foreign investment, increase productivity and boost job creation.

Unions said the law would weaken the workers' protections that have defined Argentina.

The bill limits the right to strike, reduces the bargaining power of unions and makes it easier for companies to fire workers by extending their probation periods and curbing their ability to sue employers when they are dismissed.

The legislation also cuts Argentina's traditionally high severance pay and empowers employers to mandate 12-hour workdays, up from eight.

Fierce union backlash has derailed previous government attempts at shaking up Argentina's archaic labor system, widely seen as among the most costly to companies in Latin America.

“Members of Congress, hear this message: Voting against working people does not come without consequences,” the General Confederation of Labor, Argentina's largest trade union group, wrote on social media, alongside photos showing Buenos Aires deserted because of the strike. “Jobs are not up for negotiation; hard-won gains are not raffle prizes to be given away.”

The show of force from labor unions comes as economic frustration simmers. Milei's drastic campaign to slash the size of the state has brought fiscal stability to a nation once plagued by runaway inflation, but struggled to address stubborn unemployment, stagnant wages and sluggish growth.

“To grow, we need more than just labor legislation. We need infrastructure, energy, universities,” Argentine lawmaker Pablo Outes said, criticizing the uneven economic recovery under Milei even as he endorsed the labor bill. “Milei's model is failing. It is showing cracks.”

Duterte, who is embroiled in a bitter feud with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, was impeached last year only to see the country's Supreme Court throw the case out over procedural issues.
Her announcement comes just days before her father, former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, begins a pretrial hearing at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Netherlands over crimes against humanity allegedly committed as part of a brutal crackdown on drugs.

England's Hull Kingston Rovers on Thursday overcame a ferocious second-half fightback by Australian NRL champions Brisbane Broncos to win rugby league's World Club Challenge 30-24.

Reigning Super League title-holders Hull KR, once on the brink of going out of business before winning a domestic treble last season, led by 26 points early in the second half.

Mikey Lewis' kicking game led to a succession of Broncos' errors, with tries from Tom Amone, Elliot Minchella and Joe Burgess leaving Hull KR 18-4 ahead at halftime in front of their own fans.

Gehamat Shibasaki scored the Broncos' lone try before the break against a Hull KR side transformed after starting their Super League title defense with a shock loss to promoted York City Knights last week.

Any thoughts of a fightback by Brisbane, playing their first match since beating Melbourne Storm in the NRL Grand Final in October last year, appeared fanciful as Hull KR's Oliver Gildart and Peta Hiku added further tries in the second half to extend the hosts' lead to 30-4. Yet the Broncos, who came from behind three times in last year's NRL final series, hit back with four tries in 16 minutes through Patrick Carrigan, Deine Mariner, Shibasaki and Kotoni Staggs to the despair of Robins supporters at the MKM Stadium in Hull, but the increasingly exhausted hosts clung on as they became the first club since Wigan in 2024 to hold the four major titles an English club can win at once.

Australia completed a 3-0 Ashes series clean sweep of England in November last year, reinforcing concerns about a gap in standards between two of the 13-a-side code's leading nations, but Hull KR coach Willie Peters told the BBC: “I'm proud of everyone involved in our club. I'm happy for our owner Neil Hudgell and the people of Hull. We had a responsibility for more than our local community, it was for Super League and the British game, and we did them proud.”

Brisbane Broncos coach Michael Maguire had no complaints about the outcome.

“They came out quick and fast, and we made some errors in the first part of the game and put pressure on ourselves,” Maguire said. “We conceded some soft tries, but you've got to respect everything in the game. It's a good wake-up call and a realization of what this game demands.”

The UN yesterday called on governments to clamp down on scam centers, which have mushroomed in Southeast Asia and where hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked into forced labor.

The agency released a report documenting torture, sexual abuse, forced abortions, food deprivation, solitary confinement and other abuses at scam centers in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates between 2021 and last year. 

“The litany of abuse is staggering and at the same time heart-breaking,” UN Human Rights High Commissioner Volker Turk said, calling on governments to act against corruption that was “deeply entrenched in such lucrative scamming operations, and to prosecute the criminal syndicates behind them.”

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in a 2023 report said that hundreds of thousands of people were forced to work in the centers that other investigations have found are responsible for billions of dollars of online fraud. 

The new report said satellite imagery and on-ground reports showed that nearly three-quarters of the scam operations are in the Mekong region, and have spread to some Pacific Island countries, South Asia, Gulf States, West Africa and the Americas.

Forced laborers had described being held in immense compounds resembling self-contained towns, made up of heavily fortified multi-story buildings with barbed wire-topped walls and armed guards, the report said.

“A victim from Sri Lanka related how those who failed to meet monthly scamming targets were subject to immersion in water containers [known as ‘water prisons'] for hours,” the report said. “Victims also recounted being forced to witness or even conduct grave abuse of others as a means to ensure compliance; one Bangladeshi victim said that he was ordered to beat other workers and a victim from Ghana recounted being forced to watch his friend being beaten in front of him.”

A Vietnamese woman described how she was starved for a week after trying to escape, it said.

People said police and border guards were sometimes complicit in the scam centers.

The UN said that many of the forced laborers were wrongly treated as criminals once freed.

The victims “require coordinated timely, safe and effective rescue operations, respect for the principle of non-refoulement, as well as available support mechanisms to ensure torture and trauma rehabilitation, and address risks of reprisals or retrafficking,” Turk said.

1:09 JST, February 21, 2026

WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) – The U.S. Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs that he pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies, handing a stinging defeat to the Republican president in a landmark opinion on Friday with major implications for the global economy.

The justices, in a 6-3 ruling authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, upheld a lower court's decision that Trump's use of this 1977 law exceeded his authority. The justices ruled that the law at issue – the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA – did not grant Trump the power he claimed to impose tariffs.

“Our task today is to decide only whether the power to “regulate … importation,” as granted to the president in IEEPA, embraces the power to impose tariffs. It does not,” Roberts wrote in the ruling, quoting the statute's text that Trump claimed had justified his sweeping tariffs.

The White House had no immediate comment on the ruling. Democrats and various industry groups hailed the ruling.

Part of the Supreme Court's majority also declared that such an interpretation would intrude on the powers of Congress and violate a legal principle called the “major questions” doctrine.

The doctrine, embraced by the conservative justices, requires actions by the government's executive branch of “vast economic and political significance” to be clearly authorized by Congress. The court used the doctrine to stymie some of Democratic former President Joe Biden's key executive actions.

Roberts, citing a prior Supreme Court ruling, wrote that “the president must ‘point to clear congressional authorization' to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,” adding: “He cannot.”

Roberts wrote that if Congress had intended IEEPA to bestow on the president “the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs, it would have it would have done so expressly – as it consistently has in other tariff statutes.”

Trump has leveraged tariffs – taxes on imported goods – as a key economic and foreign policy tool. They have been central to a global trade war that Trump initiated after he began his second term as president, one that has alienated trading partners, affected financial markets and caused global economic uncertainty.

The Supreme Court reached its conclusion in a legal challenge by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 U.S. states, most of them Democratic-governed, against Trump's unprecedented use of this law to unilaterally impose the import taxes.

The three dissenting justices were conservatives Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh. Joining Roberts in the majority were conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, both of whom Trump appointed during his first term in office, along with the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The liberal justices did not join the part of the opinion invoking the major questions doctrine.

The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, previously had backed Trump in a series of other decisions issued on an emergency basis since he returned to the presidency in January 2025 after his policies were impeded by lower courts.

Trump's tariffs were forecast to generate over the next decade trillions of dollars in revenue for the United States, which possesses the world's largest economy.

Trump's administration has not provided tariffs collection data since December 14. But Penn-Wharton Budget Model economists estimated on Friday that the amount collected in Trump's tariffs based on IEEPA stood at more than $175 billion. And that amount likely would need to be refunded with a Supreme Court ruling against the IEEPA-based tariffs.

The U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. But Trump instead turned to a statutory authority by invoking IEEPA to impose the tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner without the approval of Congress. Trump has imposed some additional tariffs under other laws that are not at issue in this case. Based on government data from October to mid-December, those represent about third of the revenue from Trump-imposed tariffs.

IEEPA lets a president regulate commerce in a national emergency. Trump became the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials, domestic military deployments and military operations overseas.

Kavanaugh, who also was appointed by Trump during his first term as president, in a written dissent said that IEEPA's text, as well as history and prior Supreme Court rulings supported the Trump administration's position.

“Like quotas and embargoes, tariffs are a traditional and common tool to regulate importation,” wrote Kavanaugh, whose dissenting opinion was joined by Thomas and Alito.

“The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy,” Kavanaugh added. “But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful. I respectfully dissent.”

Kavanaugh also said the decision could impact current trade deals.

“Because IEEPA tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars—including with foreign nations from China to the United Kingdom to Japan, the Court's decision could generate uncertainty regarding various trade agreements,” Kavanaugh wrote.

Trump described the tariffs as vital for U.S. economic security, predicting that the country would be defenseless and ruined without them. Trump in November told reporters that without his tariffs “the rest of the world would laugh at us because they've used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us.” Trump said the United States was abused by other countries including China, the second-largest economy.

Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said the decision was a legal ruling, not a reset of U.S. trade policy.

“Canada should prepare for new, blunter mechanisms to be used to reassert trade pressure, potentially with broader and more disruptive effects,” Laing said in a statement.

After the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in November, Trump said he would consider alternatives if it ruled against him on tariffs, telling reporters that “we'll have to develop a ‘game two' plan.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other administration officials said the United States would invoke other legal justifications to retain as many of Trump's tariffs as possible. Among others, these include a statutory provision that permits tariffs on imported goods that threaten U.S. national security and another that allows retaliatory actions including tariffs against trading partners that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative determines have used unfair trade practices against American exporters.

None of these alternatives offered the flexibility and blunt-force dynamics that IEEPA provided Trump, and may not be able to replicate the full scope of his tariffs in a timely fashion.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the decision a “victory for the wallets of every American consumer,” adding: Trump's illegal tariff tax just collapsed. He tried to govern by decree and stuck families with the bill. Enough chaos. End the trade war.”

Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said the ruling left many questions unanswered.

“The Court has struck down these destructive tariffs, but there is no legal mechanism for consumers and many small businesses to recoup the money they have already paid. Instead, giant corporations with their armies of lawyers and lobbyists can sue for tariff refunds, then just pocket the money for themselves,” Warren said.

Trump's ability to impose tariffs instantaneously on any trading partner's goods under the aegis of some form of declared national emergency raised his leverage over other countries. It brought world leaders scrambling to Washington to secure trade deals that often included pledges of billions of dollars in investments or other offers of enhanced market access for U.S. companies.

But Trump's use of tariffs as a cudgel in U.S. foreign policy has succeeded in antagonizing numerous countries, including those long considered among the closest U.S. allies.

IEEPA historically had been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets, not to impose tariffs. The law does not specifically mention the word tariffs. Trump's Justice Department had argued that IEEPA allows tariffs by authorizing the president to “regulate” imports to address emergencies.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that if all current tariffs stay in place, including the IEEPA-based duties, they would generate about $300 billion annually over the next decade.

Total U.S. net customs duty receipts reached a record $195 billion in fiscal 2025, which ended on September 30, according to U.S. Treasury Department data.

On April 2 on a date Trump labeled “Liberation Day,” the president announced what he called “reciprocal” tariffs on goods imported from most U.S. trading partners, invoking IEEPA to address what he called a national emergency related to U.S. trade deficits, though the United States already had run trade deficits for decades.

In February and March of 2025, Trump invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States as a national emergency.

Trump has wielded his tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a weapon to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters. These have ranged from Brazil's prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, India's purchases of Russian oil that help fund Russia's war in Ukraine, and an anti-tariffs ad by Canada's Ontario province.

IEEPA was passed by Congress and signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter. In passing the measure, Congress placed additional limits on the president's authority compared to a predecessor law.

The cases on tariffs before the justices involved three lawsuits.

The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with five small businesses that import goods in one challenge, and the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont in another.

Separately, a Washington-based federal judge sided with a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources.

Ten people were detained in Moldova and Ukraine for allegedly plotting contract killings of prominent Ukrainians on Russia's orders, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Feb. 20.

The Moldovan Police and Ukrainian law enforcement agencies announced a day earlier that they had launched a criminal investigation into an alleged plot to assassinate several public figures in Ukraine. The probe is being carried out by a joint investigative team formed by the two countries.

The operation, codenamed ""Enigma 2.0,"" was carried out jointly by the SBU, Ukraine's National Police, and Moldova's Police.

The suspects were reportedly planning attacks targeting Ukrainian journalists, public activists, the head of a strategic enterprise, and personnel of Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR), including members of the International Legion, according to the SBU.

Andrii Yusov, representative for strategic communications at the Main Intelligence Directorate, deputy head of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, was one of the targets of the attackers, Prosecutor General Ruslan Kravchenko said.

The suspects considered various assassination methods, including shootings and car bombings. The Russian organizers of the alleged plot promised payments of up to $100,000 for each target, the report read. 

In a joint operation, Ukrainian and Moldovan law enforcement agencies arrested the alleged leader of a criminal group — a 34-year-old man — along with several accomplices operating in Ukraine, EU member states and Transnistria, a Kremlin-occupied region in Moldova.

The SBU said the leader had been recruited by Russian special services while serving a prison sentence in Russia. He was tasked with forming and coordinating the group under Moscow's supervision.

The network was divided into surveillance and assassination teams. Some members entered Ukraine as tourists and stayed in rented apartments across different regions.

The suspects allegedly used cryptocurrency wallets and foreign bank cards to finance preparations. To monitor potential targets, agents posed as delivery couriers, conducted photo and video surveillance, marked geolocations on digital maps, and reported to their coordinator.

The detainees have been charged with preparation for premeditated murder and illegal weapons. They face potential life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

Ukraine's National Police described the case as an example of effective international cooperation against hybrid threats.

""Russian aggression takes many forms — from open military action to attempts to destabilize the country from within. Accountability for these crimes is inevitable,"" the Prosecutor General's Office said on Telegram.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Kyiv has repeatedly accused Russian intelligence services of orchestrating assassination attempts and sabotage operations inside the country.

A Polish court sentenced a Polish citizen to 3.5 years in prison on Feb. 3 for allegedly offering to assist Russia in a plan to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Ukraine is ready for ""real compromises"" in peace talks but will not accept conditions that undermine its sovereignty, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Kyodo News published on Feb. 20.

His remarks come as negotiations with Moscow remain deadlocked, with Russia maintaining maximalist demands, including Ukraine's withdrawal from Donbas, a position Kyiv has rejected.

""We are ready for real compromises,"" Zelensky said. ""But not compromises at the sacrifice of our independence and sovereignty. We are ready to talk about compromises with the U.S.""

Zelensky described Ukraine's current stance on a ceasefire as a concession in itself, pointing to Kyiv's willingness to negotiate based on existing front-line positions, without withdrawing.

""'We stand where we stand' is already a major compromise,"" he said. ""They have occupied nearly 20% of our territory, and we are prepared to talk about peace now on the basis of this principle.""

He contrasted this with Moscow's position, arguing that Russia has not offered meaningful concessions.

""What are they ready for?"" Zelensky said. ""They told us: 'We are ready not to occupy your other regions.' But that is terrorism… 'I am ready not to kill you, just give us everything.'""

""It is an ultimatum,"" he added, emphasizing that Ukraine is willing to consider compromises — but only those that safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity, armed forces, and citizens.

Territorial issues remain the central obstacle in the negotiations. 

Washington has floated alternative arrangements, including a free economic zone in the war-affected region, though Zelensky has indicated that neither side has shown strong support for the idea.

The latest round of talks on Feb. 18 also failed to produce a breakthrough on territory, underscoring how far apart Kyiv and Moscow remain on the future of occupied regions.

The European Commission would welcome Ukraine resuming operations on the Druzhba oil pipeline, but the final decision rests with Kyiv due to ongoing security risks from Russian attacks, spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said on Feb. 20.

The statement comes as tensions rise over the pipeline's suspension since late January, after Russian strikes damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure. 

The disruption has strained Ukraine's relations with Hungary and Slovakia, which remain dependent on Russian oil delivered through the system.

""We would welcome the reactivation of the pipeline... as far as we know, the Ukrainian government is committed to repairing the pipeline,"" Itkonen said during a briefing. 

""But the decision is for Ukraine only, whether and when to repair it.""

The remarks show the EU's balancing act between supporting Ukraine amid Russia's war and addressing energy concerns among member states still reliant on Russian supplies.

Itkonen said the Commission has held frequent talks this week with Hungarian, Slovak, and Croatian counterparts. The bloc's Ad Hoc Oil Coordination Group will meet on Feb. 25 to assess the situation.

Hungary and Slovakia accused Kyiv of withholding transit for political reasons and escalated the dispute by announcing on Feb. 18 a halt to diesel exports to Ukraine.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, whose government is up for re-election in April, accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of deliberately undermining Hungary's energy security.

""President Volodymyr Zelensky has decided not to restart oil transit for political reasons,"" he said.

Budapest and Bratislava have sought alternative routes, asking Croatia to facilitate deliveries via the Adria pipeline. Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said Zagreb refused to transport Russian oil.

The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest oil networks with a capacity of about two million barrels per day, remains a critical supply route for Hungary and Slovakia — the only EU countries still importing Russian crude through the system.

Ukraine has argued that continued reliance on Russian energy undermines efforts to cut off funding for Moscow's war, while Russian strikes — and Kyiv's own attacks on energy infrastructure inside Russia — have further complicated the pipeline's future.

U.S. President Donald Trump holds a chart detailing tariffs, at the White House in Washington, April 2, 2025.Carlos Barria/Reuters

The U.S. Supreme Court has struck down a key pillar of Donald Trump's protectionist trade agenda, ruling that the President acted illegally in using one of his emergency economic powers to impose sweeping tariffs on trade partners last year. 

The 6-3 decision, released Friday, is a major rebuke of the President on a signature economic policy. However, it's only a partial – and likely temporary – setback for the administration. 

Trade experts expect Mr. Trump to rapidly rebuild his tariff wall using other legal tools. And the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles and lumber, which are hitting Canadian trade the hardest, aren't affected by the decision and will remain in place. 

The Supreme Court decision focuses on duties that were imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. These include “fentanyl tariffs” imposed on Canada, Mexico and China, and the “Liberation Day” or “reciprocal” tariffs placed on the rest of the world. 

IEEPA allows the President to take extraordinary steps to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency. Mr. Trump relied on this extensively over the past year to quickly increase tariffs and pressure other countries to cut deals with Washington to avoid further duties.

By mid-December, the U.S. had collected around US$130-billion in tariff revenue using IEEPA. 

IEEPA, however, does not explicitly mention tariffs. The Supreme Court upheld two lower court decisions that found Mr. Trump was misusing the legislation and acting beyond the powers explicitly granted to him by the U.S. Congress.

“Had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs, it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes,” chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court decision. 

“While taxes may accomplish regulatory ends, it does not follow that the power to regulate includes the power to tax as a means of regulation. Indeed, when Congress addresses both the power to regulate and the power to tax, it does so separately and expressly. That it did not do so here is strong evidence that ‘regulate' in IEEPA does not include taxation,” he wrote.

The decision was a major test of the scope of U.S. presidential power, and the role of Congress. In his attempt to overhaul the global trading system and remake parts of the U.S. government, Mr. Trump has wielded executive actions in an unprecedented – almost imperial – manner. 

The Supreme Court pushed back against this, reminding the Trump administration that the President operates within a carefully constructed balance of powers. 

“Against that backdrop of clear and limited delegations, the Government reads IEEPA to give the President power to unilaterally impose unbounded tariffs and change them at will. That view would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy,” the court said. 

“It is also telling that in IEEPA's half century of existence, no President has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope. That ” ‘lack of historical precedent,' coupled with the breadth of authority” that the President now claims, suggests that the tariffs extend beyond the President's ‘legitimate reach'.”

A key question now is what happens to tariff revenue collected using IEEPA. Hundreds of companies reportedly filed lawsuits in U.S. courts ahead of the Supreme Court ruling to try to protect their right to a refund or position themselves at the front of the line for one.

Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's federal minister responsible for North American trade, welcomed the decision.

“The United States Supreme Court's decision reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified,” Mr. LeBlanc said in a statement. He added that “critical work lies ahead to support Canadian businesses and workers who remain affected by Section 232 tariffs on steel, aluminum and automotive sectors.”

Canada has less at stake in the Supreme Court decision than some other countries.

It was among the first countries to be hit with IEEPA tariffs last year, when Mr. Trump imposed a 25-per-cent tariff on most Canadian goods – which has since risen to 35 per cent – claiming it was needed to force Ottawa to do more to address fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration. 

However, two days later, the President granted a broad exemption to the “fentanyl tariffs” for Canadian products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on free trade. That carve-out has allowed more than 90 per cent of Canadian exports to continue crossing the border tariff-free, even as some sectors are being hammered by the separate industry-specific tariffs.

As of mid-December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had collected around US$2.4-billion in IEEPA tariff revenue on imports from Canada – less than 2 per cent of the total.

“For Canada, this ruling doesn't eliminate the most significant tariffs currently in place, which are on autos, steel, aluminum, lumber and some copper products,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce wrote in a note to clients.

“But it does remove the threat of that 35 per cent tariff being applied if the US opts to withdraw from the USMCA … So while this isn't a cure for tariffs facing Canada in targeted sectors (and actually provides more immediate relief to Canada's competitors in the US that face reciprocal tariffs on all of their exports) it is nevertheless an improvement in Canada's negotiating position in the upcoming USMCA talks.”

The decision may be more important for other U.S. trade partners, including the European Union, Britain and Japan, which agreed to increase market access and make substantial investments in the U.S. under the threat of escalating IEEPA tariffs. However, they may wait to see what the Trump administration does next before considering reneging on the deals they cut with Washington last year. 

“Call it Liberation Day 2.0 – arguably the first one with tangible upside for U.S. consumers and corporate profitability,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economics at Fitch Ratings said in a statement.

“This is a material rollback: more than 60 per cent of the 2025 tariffs effectively vanish. Mechanically, the U.S. effective tariff rate drops from about 13 per cent to around 6 per cent, removing more than US$200 billion in expected annual tariff collections … However, the bigger macro takeaway is not just ‘lower tariffs,' but ‘higher tariff-regime uncertainty.' The odds that tariffs reappear in a revised form remain meaningful. Layer on potential tariff refunds, and you introduce a messy operational and legal overhang that amplifies economic uncertainty.""

Top Trump administration officials have said they have other options to recreate the President's tariff regime if the Supreme Court decision did not go their way. 

Manufacturing meltdown: How Trump's tariffs are squeezing Canadian factories

Twenty-nine ways Trump has changed Canada

Trade experts expect the administration to ramp up the use of sectoral tariffs, which are imposed using Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The U.S. Department of Commerce has already launched a number of additional Section 232 investigations into various industries, including aircraft, critical minerals and pharmaceuticals.

The administration has at least three other laws it could potentially turn to: Section 301 of Trade Act of 1974, which permits country-specific tariffs following an investigation into alleged unfair trading practices; Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows for tariffs up to 15 per cent for 150 days before Congress must vote to extend them; and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which authorizes tariffs of up to 50 per cent in certain circumstances.

Conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh wrote lengthy dissents to the majority opinion. Mr. Thomas argued that, “the power to impose duties on imports is not within the core legislative power” of Congress, which can “therefore delegate the exercise of this power to the President.”

Mr. Kavanaugh argued that the sole question for the court was whether IEEPA confers the power to tariff by granting a president the ability to regulate importation. “Statutory text, history, and precedent demonstrate that the answer is clearly yes: Like quotas and embargoes, tariffs are a traditional and common tool to regulate importation,” Mr. Kavanaugh wrote.

The decision was cheered by business groups on both sides of the border.

“The Supreme Court's decision is welcome news for businesses and consumers,” Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. “We encourage the administration to use this opportunity to reset overall tariff policy in a manner that will lead to greater economic growth, larger wage gains for workers, and lower costs for families.”

Mr. Bradley said the tariffs had led to “significant cost increases and supply-chain disruptions” for small and medium-sized business. He called for “swift” refunds to U.S. importers who had been forced to pay the tariffs.

Candance Laing, president and CEO, Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that this “is a legal ruling, not a reset of U.S. trade policy. This is certainly not the last chapter of this never-ending story.”

She said that Canada should prepare for “new, blunter mechanisms to be used to reassert trade pressure, potentially with broader and more disruptive effects,” and redouble its efforts to diversify trade.

U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a signed resolution during a Board of Peace meeting in Washington on Thursday.Mark Schiefelbein/The Associated Press

You can go halfway around the world to escape Donald Trump and still not succeed. 

The man is a world disrupter. But I can say with confidence that, after spending a few weeks here and in New Zealand and meeting people hailing from all over the place – from Indonesia and Mexico to India and Kenya – that the U.S. President has put Brand America in deep, deep trouble.

Mr. Trump has succeeded in making people around the world not only loathe him but his country as well. Those I talked to want nothing to do with the U.S. and are astonished that a country that not so long ago was seen as that bright, shining city upon a hill that former president Ronald Reagan loved to talk about has allowed itself to fall into such disrepute – and at the hands of a corrupt, mendacious grifter, no less. A country that once sold hope to the world now exports a petty, mean-spirited cruelty instead.

Even many Americans are ashamed of America. In our travels, my wife and I encountered people from the U.S. who, upon learning we were from Canada, fell over themselves to apologize for the actions of their President. They lamented what Mr. Trump has done to the reputation of their country globally, not to mention the lasting damage he's done to it domestically.

Opinion: Can the U.S. finally just shut up about Canada's defence spending?

One Vermont businessman told us over dinner one night that he wasn't sure about what would be left of his country by the next presidential election. While he was hopeful that the Democrats could win back Congress in the midterm elections to slow the horror the President has unleashed, he told us that he fears Mr. Trump might just nationalize the voting system, as he has threatened, and rig the whole thing.

That conversation came a day after Mr. Trump posted a video that portrayed former U.S. president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, as apes in a jungle.

We were also shocked, but heartened, by how many people we encountered who were aware of how Mr. Trump has menaced Canada. Even more so, we couldn't believe how many had high praise for Prime Minister Mark Carney, from tour guides to servers in restaurants. A Melbourne taxi driver who had recently immigrated from Laos told us that he was impressed by Mr. Carney's speech at the World Economic Forum – and he wasn't the only one who cited that pivotal and widely heralded moment in Davos.

We also discovered that wearing the Canadian flag grants you much sympathy. Though this shouldn't be a great surprise: Most people are good, decent folk who recognize evil and malevolence when they see it. 

Even though we were so far removed from the fiery cauldron that is life in North America, next door to the suddenly terrifying, unpredictable monster that is the U.S. under Mr. Trump, it was impossible to avoid hearing about the mind-numbing developments in America.

Opinion: Trump's designation of fentanyl as a ‘weapon of mass destruction' hangs over Canadian banks

Every day it was something new, something as abjectly depressing as the day before. For instance, even a few years ago, it was impossible to imagine a U.S. President officially disassociating his country from the scientific finding that climate change endangers human health – a conclusion the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency used to justify regulations to limit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Now that is – poof – gone. With one signature from DJT, American companies can now pollute like they used to.

It's no wonder the world shakes its head in disbelief. No wonder people from countries around the world are distancing themselves from anything to do with America, including its most high-profile companies. Tesla car sales in Europe, for instance, effectively collapsed last year. Hard not to connect that phenomenon with the company's owner, Elon Musk, who took a chainsaw to the Washington bureaucracy in the service of Mr. Trump and continues to be the President's supporter after a brief falling-out.

Mr. Trump is building a wall around the U.S., and many people are happy to stay out, to do business and form new alliances with others. The world appears to be slowly turning its back on America.

One day in a hotel elevator, I had a conversation with an Australian woman who was in Sydney for a business conference. She mistook my accent for American, and asked me which part of the States I was from.

“Oh, I'm from Canada, not the U.S.,” I replied. 

She apologized. She said it was probably the worst thing she could've said to me – or to anybody, really. And in this worrying new world, she's right.

Where Gen Z  and millennials are spending their Saturdays

It's Saturday. Instead of staying curled up at home, or crowding into a busy brunch spot, you step inside a cozy, intimate space, like a creative studio. There's soft jazz music playing. You help yourself to a salmon canapé and a glass of cucumber-infused water as you meet mostly fellow women in the mid-20s to 40-year-old age range. The host asks you to take your seat in front of the vintage typewriter that calls to you.

You're here to write poetry.

The host is Daniella Zanchi, founder of Poesy, a Canadian company that holds monthly poetry and letter writing workshops. She launched the event series in December, 2024 after spending over a year as a poet-on-demand at public and private events and discovering that many people were curious about writing poetry themselves.

At her workshops, she teaches the craft in an approachable way that makes even first-time writers feel at ease.

“We go through basics of poetry writing, like rhythm or metaphor,” says Ms. Zanchi, “or we'll focus on how to write a poem entirely based off the conversation you're having with somebody.” The latter is Ms. Zanchi's particular talent, and how she garnered attention behind her typewriter at her first few events.

“Everyone gets a handout with three prompts, which are questions focused on the theme of that workshop, such as New Year's intentions,” she says. “We encourage them to write two sentences per prompt, and then we teach them how to trim the excess words and do what we call ‘mining for gold'.”

Each guest is given a notebook and a quill to write and edit the answers to their prompts. After they've found their “gold,” – the best bits amid their free writing – they start typing. The typewriters offer an inviting, old-world element that helps guests imagine they could be the next Sylvia Plath or Anne Carson.

“The typewriter requires you to type slow, because, unlike a laptop, you need to type with one finger at a time and press fairly hard on keys,” says Ms. Zanchi, “so you have more time to think about what you put on the page.”

Being an analog object that requires focus, the typewriter is a big part of the workshop's allure. “Coming into a room and knowing it's going to be a tactile experience is a huge draw,” she says. “It allows people to unplug and actually learn how to use something new, and create something with their hands.”

People leave the workshop with two poems: one they write for themselves, and one written about them by someone else in the room. Before leaving, they're invited to slip their typed poems into envelopes and seal them with molten red wax, another vintage touch to the experience.

Every element of the workshop – from learning the basics of poetry and putting quill to paper, to using a typewriter and packaging one's art in a beautiful way – can be surprisingly gratifying, especially for those who tend to speed through their daily life, racking up screen time.

“When you learn something new, when you use your hands, it does something different to the brain and makes us more human and less robotic,” says Frederick Grouzet, an associate professor at the Department of Psychology at University of Victoria.

After all, the workshop isn't just about writing poetry – it's also about remembering what it feels like to create something without a delete button, giving yourself permission to be imperfect.

The act of writing poetry has mental health benefits, similar to those of journalling, says Dr. Grouzet. It allows people to release thoughts and feelings onto a page and reflect on them in an intentional way. But poetry takes it one step further. “You transform your reflections into something beautiful,” he says, “and that generates positive emotions.”

Beyond the individual benefits, the workshop offers a shared experience, which extends past the moments of conversation that inspire the poems in the moment. “People usually grab food or something with somebody else after the workshop,” says Ms. Zanchi. “We've seen genuine connections come from a curated space that's fostering stories to be shared and people to open up.”

That sense of connection comes from the emotions that brew from creating or enjoying something as a group, says Dr. Grouzet. “It's like everyone looking at a piece of art, or listening to a song all together, and feeling the same thing, at the same time,” he says. Bonds form naturally as people spend time together, learn about each other and share the experience of trying something new.

“It fills this need for connectedness,” he says.

Sounds like the perfect subject for a poem.

The far-right AfD is polling way ahead of rivals in the German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania where elections are planned later this year. Meanwhile, firefighters were called to Berlin's Reichstag. 

These updates have been closed. Thank you for reading. 

Below, you can review the main headlines from Germany on Thursday, February 19:

Women's football in Germany generated more income in 2024/25, with the 12 clubs of the Bundesliga reaching revenue of more than €43 million ($51 million).

The figures came in the German Football Federation's (DFB) report published on Thursday.

The average income per club was thus €3.6 million, but expenditure reached €5.8 million. The clubs' books are balanced by the men's teams. Only SGS Essen is a women-only club.

Women's football has garnered increased interest in recent years, but Bundesliga attendance has dropped to less than 2,700 spectators per match.

Streaming platforms DAZN and MagentaSport have said that the audience for women's football has increased by 7%.

Some 5,700 fighters from the so-called ""Islamic State"" (IS)group were moved from Syria to Iraq last week by US forces.

Among the thousands of fighters, around two dozen were connected to Germany — either being German citizens or foreign nationals who lived in Germany before joining the Islamist group.

The reporting came from the German dpa news agency.

The transfer of IS fighters and their relatives came after Syrian government forces took control of the Kurdish-run camps that had been holding them for years.

The news came at the same time the German military said it was withdrawing more forces from the Kurdish region of Iraq.

A small number of German soldiers will remain on the ground at the multinational camp in Erbil.

Ski Aggu, a Berlin-based Deutschrap artist, has cancelled his planned show in New York, citing ""democratic values.""

The 28-year-old rapper had been planning to perform in April, but his management confirmed the cancellation on Thursday in a statement to Berlin's public broadcaster RBB.

The musician cited the need to defend ""democratic values"" and warned against history repeating itself.

He said the situation in the US in the past months had got to the point that he could no longer just show up and perform ""as if everything was normal.""

President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has expressed his opposition to Germany applying to host the 2036 Summer Olympic Games, according to German magazine Der Spiegel.

Steinmeier reportedly cited the historical significance of the date as it would fall exactly 100 years after the 1936 games that were hosted by Nazi Germany and used as a propaganda tool on the international stage.

The president instead said Germany should be a candidate for the 2040 or 2046 games, a spokesperson told Spiegel.

Thursday marked six years since the racist attack that resulted in the deaths of 10 people in the central German city of Hanau.

On February 19, 2020, a 43-year-old white man opened fire at two locations, killing eight men and one woman on the spot. A 70-year-old died last month from injuries sustained that night. All the victims had migrant backgrounds.

The attacker also shot his own mother before killing himself.

This year's commemoration saw wreaths being laid in Hanau, with events also planned for Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt and Munich.

Hanau Mayor Claus Kaminsky described the 2020 attack as ""the most terrible day this city has suffered in peacetime.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Nigerian President Bola Tinubu spoke on the phone on Wednesday, Tinubu's office said on Thursday.

The two leaders discussed several issues, including a stalled electricity project.

German conglomerate Siemens was part of a 2019 agreement to upgrade Nigeria's electricity transmission lines and distribution substations. It aimed to reach 7,000 MW of reliable power by 2021 and 11,000 MW by 2023. But the project has faced regulatory and logistical setbacks.

Merz told Tinubu that Siemens would complete the project with financing from Deutsche Bank.

The pair also discussed instability in Nigeria's Sahel region.

""The Sahel corridor is bad and needs our support. Intelligence support reconnaissance is needed,"" the Nigerian president said.

Tinubu requested German helicopters to help with reconnaissance and intelligence operations against the insurgency.

Merz also backed plans for a Museum of African Arts, Tinubu's office said.

Germany's Defense Ministry has responding cautiously to reports about a possible additional order of US-made stealth fighter jets.

""There are currently no concrete plans and no political decision for the procurement of further F-35s,” a spokeswoman for the ministry said.

Germany has so far ordered 35 F-35 jets from the United States to replace the Luftwaffe's aging Tornado fleet, which is used to maintain Germany's role in NATO nuclear sharing. Under the deterrence concept, NATO allies would have access to US nuclear weapons in a defense scenario.

The expanded F-35 purchase is seen as one option to ensure short-term readiness with current technology if the future Franco-German air combat system FCAS is scaled back or fails.

France's Europe Minister Benjamin Haddad told DW that Paris had spoken German counterparts about moving forward on the FCAS, and that he believed this would happen.

""I'm confident that we can put the different actors around the table, continue to move forward and implement this project because once again,"" said Haddad.

There are security and industrial policy concerns about increasing Germany's dependence on the United States, including rumors of an F-35 kill switch that would limit what customers could do with the planes.

Firefighters have been investigating after a gas detector in the Reichstag building in Berlin triggered an alarm, prompting a large-scale response from the fire department.

A small amount of a hazardous substance most likely leaked, a fire department spokesperson told Germany's DPA news agency.

The automatic alarm was received by the fire department around 5:15 a.m. Approximately 80 emergency personnel are currently on site assessing the situation.

A spokesperson said that emergency crews had already reached the room from which the alarm originated. A decontamination area has been set up on-site for the safety of the emergency personnel.

A cleaning concentrate has already been identified as the possible cause, according to the spokesperson.

""It's possible that an excessively high concentration of cleaning agent triggered the alarm,"" the spokesperson said. However, this has not yet been definitively determined.

The operation led to traffic restrictions and the rerouting of bus routes that run past the Reichstag building this morning.

The Reichstag, home to Germany's lower house of parliament the Bundestag, was the site of a 1933 fire that the Nazis used in a move to consolidate power.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz is calling for a shift toward greater willingness to work hard, saying Germany needs renewed effort to move the country forward.

Speaking at the Political Ash Wednesday event in Trier, Merz said lifestyles and a four-day week may be appealing, but warned that preserving prosperity requires a strong work ethic.

""Lifestyle and a four-day week. All nice, you can do all that,"" Merz said at the Political Ash Wednesday event in Trier. ""But if we want to maintain our prosperity, then we all have to pitch in together now and make sure that really good work is being done in this country again.""

Germany would not have today's prosperity, Merz said, ""if our parents had gone to work with this mindset that we partly see today.""

""And that is what I want to get away from. I want to motivate us, all of you, all of us together, to undertake a new collective effort here,"" the chancellor said. ""Not with coercion, not with pressure, not with new laws, but simply with cheerfulness at work.""

Merz's Christian Democrats (CDU) are meeting for a party congress on Friday, where the debate over performance and work culture is expected to be central.

A proposal from the CDU's business wing to limit the legal right to part-time work had sparked controversy, originally titled ""No legal right to lifestyle part-time."" The motion has since been revised, now speaking of ""organizing"" part-time entitlements, with the term ""lifestyle part-time"" removed.

A new poll shows the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) leading clearly in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, seven months before an election there.

The Forsa survey for the Ostsee-Zeitung put the AfD at 37%, ahead of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) of state premier Manuela Schwesig on 23% and the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) on 13%. The socialist Left Party, which currently governs in coalition with the SPD, was measured at 11%.

The state election is scheduled for September 20.

The business-focused Free Democrats (FDP) on 2% and the Greens on 4% would miss the 5% threshold and drop out of the state parliament, while the  populist left BSW was at 5%, right on the edge.

Forsa surveyed 1,003 eligible voters in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern between February 9 and February 16.

Compared with an Infratest dimap poll for NDR published in late January, the AfD gained 2 points while the SPD lost 2, with the CDU unchanged at 13%.

Polling institutes note that surveys reflect opinion at the time of questioning and are not forecasts, with the reported margin of error in the Forsa poll at plus or minus 3 percentage points.

While the AfD would emerge as the largest force in the state parliament under the current figures, all major political parties have said they will not work with it.

In the 2021 state election, the SPD won 39.6%, while the AfD took 16.7%, the CDU 13.3%, the Left Party 9.9%, the Greens 6.3%, and the FDP 5.8%.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Trump sweeping tariffs struck down: What happens next?","https://www.dw.com/en/trump-sweeping-tariffs-struck-down-what-happens-next/a-76060070","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 16:01:05 GMT","

In a much-anticipated decision, the US Supreme Court has ruled that most of the president's tariffs are unconstitutional because of how he implemented them. But the administration is prepared to reinstate them.

In a political setback for President Donald Trump, the US Supreme Court has struck down most of his tariffs put in place over the last 13 months, ruling that they are unconstitutional.

Specifically, the court decided in a 6-3 vote that the president exceeded his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 to implement many of his tariffs on US trading partners. 

In anticipation of the ruling, the US administration had made it clear it has been doing its homework for months. It is prepared to quickly implement new tariffs under other laws that allow the president to impose them.

Earlier this year, Jamieson Greer, the United States Trade Representative, said that similar tariffs could be reinstated almost immediately if they were struck down. To him, a decision by the Supreme Court to strike down the tariffs would be just a bump in the road, not a real roadblock.

""The reality is the president is going to have tariffs as part of his trade policy going forward,"" Greer told the New York Times in a January interview.

Legal experts agree that there are a number of additional statutes the president could use to impose tariffs on certain products or trading partners without congressional backing.

Here is a list of the most likely candidates:

Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to implement a tariff up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days at will. Congressional approval is only needed to continue after that period.

Other options require either investigations or hard rationale and are slower to implement.

Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 lets the president implement tariffs on national security grounds. These target specific sectors like steel, aluminum or lumber and need the support of a Commerce Department investigation. The president has successfully used these before.

Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 lets the president implement tariffs on countries that are violating international trade agreements that harm US businesses. There is no limit on the tariff amount or duration, but they must be justified and supported by lengthy investigations.

Besides creating more uncertainty and new tariff workarounds, the Supreme Court ruling could also mean big refunds for the affected US importers.

When the court heard oral arguments at the start of November 2025, they were particularly interested to know if tariffs are really just taxes on Americans by driving up costs for consumers.

For 2025, US Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, collected $287 billion (€243 billion) in customs duties, taxes and fees. This is an increase of 192% compared to the previous year, according to calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

This money includes customs duties, taxes and fees for tariffs already in place when Trump took power, in addition to the major ""reciprocal"" tariffs added since he took office.

Importers who paid these tariffs will be wondering how to get at least some of that money refunded. For those businesses, it will be a welcome reprieve. But with more tariffs likely on the way, it will not add much to their bottom line or planning security.

For individuals, reimbursement will be more complicated since refunds would go to the importers — usually businesses — that paid the duties in the first place, not to consumers.

For the government, it would be a double blow: Having to process all the returns will be a challenge, and the treasury will lose out on billions in revenue.

Since the Trump administration started implementing its tariffs, hundreds of lawsuits have been filed trying to stop them. The case heard by the Supreme Court was brought by a group of businesses, including Learning Resources, Inc.

Over the past 13 months, Trump has imposed tariffs by decree on many countries only to pause them or negotiate lower rates. Among other things, he has pointed to trade imbalances and drug smuggling as reasons to justify his actions.

US-based businesses have complained about the extra costs of tariffs. Other critics have pointed out that many of the them have little to do with trade deficits and more to do with making countries bend to American will.

A snowstorm dumped several inches of snow across parts of Vienna overnight into Friday.

Vienna International Airport paused flights on Friday due to heavy snowfall.

Snow and ice on the roads of Austria's capital city also led to multiple traffic accidents, the public broadcaster Österreichischer Rundfunk reported on Friday.

Heavy snowfall has been reported in several parts of Austria since Thursday. Snow totals of ten (nearly 4 inches) to 30 centimeters (nearly 12 inches) were reported in several parts of the country.

The area around the airport saw an accumulation of about 20 centimeters (nearly 8 inches) of snow, according to Austrian Press Agency (APA).

Vienna's international airport is a major European aviation hub. Many outbound flights were delayed and more than 230 inbound flights were disrupted or rerouted.

Around 19 flights stood canceled as of Friday morning.

Road maintenance services were hard at work to clear the snow, with some 1,000 lorry loads, totaling approximately 15,000 tons of snow, cleared so far.

Officials at the airport called on its passengers to check the status of their flights before they head to the airport.

After the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the King was unsparing towards his younger brother.

“The law must take its course,” the King said in a statement, pledging “our full and wholehearted support” for the investigation.

Compare that to the reaction of Donald Trump. “I think it's a shame. I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the Royal family,” the US president said on Air Force One on Thursday.

Perhaps Mr Trump felt guilty for his role in what has been described as the monarchy's lowest moment, having reluctantly signed the legislation that prompted the release of the “Epstein files”, which contained information leading to Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest.

Maybe he simply felt sorry for the King – “a fantastic person”.

Either way, the stark contrast lays bare how Britain's establishment has been left reeling by the files, while the US has closed ranks.

Democrats and a handful of Republicans in Washington hope Andrew will be the first domino to fall, and are now piling pressure on the US Department of Justice (DoJ) to prosecute Epstein associates.

But as even they admit, American figures have been largely unscathed by the large release of documents on Jan 30.

Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, who spearheaded the publication of the Epstein files, noted Lord Mandelson had been sacked as Britain's ambassador to the US in September and “other examples of accountability around the world”.

“Why isn't more being done here?” he asked.

Asked on Thursday if any Epstein associates in the US will “wind up in handcuffs,” Mr Trump sidestepped the question, reiterating his claim that he personally has been “totally exonerated.”

Andrew was taken into custody on Thursday as police raided his home in Sandringham and the Royal Lodge, which he left on Feb 4 after the King made him surrender the lease.

Lord Mandelson, alongside losing his job in Washington as ambassador, has left the Labour Party and resigned from the House of Lords in disgrace.

Both men appeared to have leaked confidential information to Epstein: Andrew as a UK trade envoy, and Lord Mandelson as business secretary.

Yet those in the US who want investigations and prosecutions have been left disappointed.

Representative Suhas Subramanyam was one of several Democrats who demanded the DoJ emulate Britain's example, noting that not even “actual royalty” had been spared.

“There needs to be more of it. And frankly, it's happening in Europe, but it's not happening enough in the United States,” he said.

Representative Nancy Mace, a Republican who defied Mr Trump to force the release of the Epstein files, was even blunter.

“The UK has officially done more to prosecute Epstein predators than our own government. Shameful,” she said on social media.

In a follow-up post, Ms Mace said: “We called for Prince Andrew's arrest months ago. [It's] finally falling into place. This is the start of a reckoning. Who's next?”

Who's next, indeed?

Andrew's arrest has galvanised critics of the DoJ who believe prosecutors have dragged their feet in bringing charges against Epstein's wealthy and influential associates.

But it's far from clear that it will get them to move any faster. Or indeed, at all.

Last week, Mr Khanna read out the names of the six men he claimed were “likely incriminated” in the Epstein files on the floor of Congress, where he is legally protected from a defamation claim.

On Thursday, he called for the resignation of Howard Lutnick from Mr Trump's cabinet after he apparently lied about his contact with Epstein.

But the president, reluctant to give the media a scalp, has circled the wagons around his commerce secretary.

Last year, Mr Lutnick said he pledged never to be in the same room as the paedophile – a “disgusting person” – after meeting him in 2005. But emails from the files revealed he travelled to Epstein's infamous island, where Epstein abused his underage victims, seven years later.

Mr Lutnick, who has never been accused of wrongdoing, later admitted he met Epstein for lunch along with his wife, children and nannies.

The King has taken a different course from the president. He acted quickly, even ruthlessly, by stripping his younger brother of his titles in October to shield the monarchy.

The man arrested by police officers on Thursday was not “Prince Andrew” – much of the US media got that wrong in their wall-to-wall coverage – but plain old Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor instead.

There's another hurdle to Andrew-style arrests and raids in the US. If prosecutors start bringing charges against Epstein associates now, it will pose awkward questions for the administration.

The DoJ said in a memo from July, which prompted public anger, that the paedophile did not maintain a “client list” and found no evidence for further investigations.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, is frequently scathing about claims that the department has a “hidden tranche of information on men” they were “choosing not to prosecute”.

That assertion will only face more scrutiny in the coming days. The question now is whether Andrew's arrest marks the end of the Epstein files saga, or just the start.

Lori Chavez-DeRemer faces allegations of misconduct at the agency, and her husband faces sexual assault allegations.

Lori Chavez-DeRemer's tenure as head of the US Department of Labor was further embroiled in scandal on Thursday after bombshell New York Times reporting revealed that her husband has been banned from the agency's headquarters over sexual assault allegations leveled by at least two staffers.

The reporting landed on the same day that a group of Senate Democrats launched an investigation into Chavez-DeRemer's policy moves at the Labor Department, accusing her agency of showing “disregard for workers' lives” by “rolling back protections that keep workers safe and hobbling the agency that is tasked with overseeing worker safety.”

The sexual assault allegations against the labor secretary's husband, Shawn DeRemer, were made by two women “as part of an internal investigation by the department's inspector general into alleged misconduct by Ms. Chavez-DeRemer and her senior staff,” the Times reported Thursday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter and a police report.

“The widening misconduct scandal at the Labor Department has forced several aides and members of the security staff in Ms. Chavez-DeRemer's inner circle onto administrative and investigative leave,” the newspaper continued. “The inspector general's office is investigating a formal complaint that Ms. Chavez-DeRemer was having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a subordinate — a member of her security detail — and abusing her office by taking staff to strip clubs, drinking alcohol on the job, and taking personal trips at taxpayer expense. Her lawyer has denied the allegations.”

“This is Trump's America,” retired US diplomat Ken Fairfax wrote in response to the reporting.

Meanwhile, Chavez-DeRemer has been playing a central role in what six Senate Democrats characterized as the Trump administration's “attack on workers from all sides.”

In a Thursday letter to Chavez-DeRemer and David Keeling, the assistant secretary of labor for Occupational Safety and Health, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other Democrats expressed alarm over the Labor Department's “ambitious deregulatory agenda that includes many of the regulations that OSHA has promulgated to keep American workers safe.”

The lawmakers pointed specifically to Labor Department efforts to eliminate more than a third of the Mine Safety and Health Administration's offices, roll back “a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites,” and loosen “respirator requirements for workers exposed to dangerous materials like lead, asbestos, and formaldehyde, as well as chemicals known to be carcinogens.”

“But you are not only rolling back rules that protect workers — OSHA also appears to be taking a lighter hand in enforcing even the rules that still exist,” the senators wrote. “According to OSHA statistics comparing the months of April through September 2025 with the same period in 2024, the agency reduced workplace inspections by 20%. Those statistics also show a 42% decrease in the number of ‘willful violations' found during inspections by OSHA during the months of April-September of 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024.”

Chavez-DeRemer was confirmed as labor secretary last year with bipartisan support and a boost from the Teamsters union given some of her past pro-worker stances, such as support for the PRO Act — which she quickly distanced herself from during the confirmation process.

“Chavez-DeRemer refused to commit to supporting a minimum-wage increase, or paid leave for workers,” The Nation‘s John Nichols wrote following her confirmation hearing last February. “And, of course, she unapologetically declared, ‘The right to work is a fundamental tenet of labor laws, where states have a right to choose if they want to be a right-to-work state, and that should be protected.'”

“She has made it abundantly clear that she is not interested in serving as an ally of America's workers or the unions that represent them,” Nichols added. “In the great struggle between the working class and the billionaire class, Chavez-DeRemer has chosen to side with Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and the oligarchs.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment.

For decades, corporate media and elected officials have shown little interest in reporting by incarcerated individuals on the unchecked inhumane treatment and deplorable conditions inside U.S. jails, detention centers, and prisons.

But as a result of the Trump administration's escalation of anti-immigrant violence and efforts to quell all dissent, professional journalists and writers, who normally are severely restricted from entering into the U.S.'s carceral facilities, are now themselves experiencing the harsh realities that nearly 2.1 million incarcerated people are subjected to daily in this country.

Inadvertently, this inside view has reaffirmed what incarcerated journalists have long reported: rampant deprivation of basic human necessities, denial of due process, medical neglect, and an unrestrained culture of blatant cruelty. It has also prompted renewed scrutiny of U.S. law enforcement, as well as both public and private prison agencies' treatment of those under their control.

British journalist Sami Hamdi was traveling the country on a valid U.S. visa for a public speaking tour when he was abducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials at a California airport. The Trump administration revoked Hamdi's visa in response to a campaign by far right social media influencers who didn't like Hamdi's criticism of Israel's genocide in Gaza. For more than two weeks, Hamdi endured the trauma of being held in multiple ICE jails.

“It felt unreal, almost like being in a movie,” Hamdi told Truthout in a recent interview.

Hamdi described being treated like a subhuman during his detention by ICE officials. In addition to being held in painfully tight shackles for days, with his pleas to loosen them ignored, Hamdi said he and others were denied access to legal representation and medical treatment — people had to feign life-or-death emergencies to have a chance at seeing a medical professional.

Hamdi also told Truthout how he was forced to sleep in filthy, overcrowded cells, and to consume rotten food that made him violently ill. Others told him that experience was common for new detainees whose stomachs had not adjusted to their new diets. Since Hamdi's time in ICE custody, many others, including 5-year old Liam Conejo Ramos and other young children, have reportedly suffered similar reactions to the contaminated food served in ICE facilities. Ramos's case brought special attention to the conditions at the Dilley immigration jail, but those conditions are not unique, within ICE jails or the U.S. carceral system more broadly.

Hamdi's story also resembles the account of Mario Guevara, a journalist originally from El Salvador who had resided in the U.S. legally for over 20 years. Arrested by local law enforcement officials in Georgia while covering a “No Kings” protest, ICE took him into their custody. He spent months in multiple immigration jails before being illegally deported back to the country from which he fled political prosecution decades earlier.

“I don't know why ICE wants to continue treating me like a criminal,” Guevara wrote in a letter to the news outlet The Bitter Southerner during his detention. “It pains me to know that I have been denied every privilege and the right to be free when I have never committed any crime.”

Guevara wrote about how ICE officials unjustly held him in solitary confinement and denied him due process. Upon his release, Guevara stated he had to seek mental health treatment and start taking psychiatric medication to treat bouts of depression and recurring nightmares.

Then there's the appalling abduction of Rümeysa Öztürk, a doctorate student at Tufts University. After co-authoring an op-ed for her campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, that acknowledged the genocide in Gaza, Öztürk was grabbed off the streets by ICE agents. The deportation case against Öztürk was finally thrown out earlier this month, almost a year after her abduction, but the administration still could seek review of that decision.

For the next five months, Öztürk, a Fulbright scholar, was shackled and transferred to ICE jails as far away as Louisiana. While not a career journalist herself, Öztürk also shared alarming accounts of torturous treatment during her detention.

“I could have never imagined such an ordeal when I first came to the United States in 2018 to pursue my graduate studies, learn and grow as a scholar, and contribute to the child development field,” Öztürk wrote in an essay for Vanity Fair titled “God Cannot Hear Us Here: What I Witnessed Inside an ICE Woman's Prison.”

These horrors aren't exclusively reserved for non-citizens like Hamdi, Guevara, and Öztürk, who, it is important to note, had visas or work permits. U.S. citizens have suffered the same fate.

Steve Held, a Chicago-based journalist and co-founder of Unraveled Press, was detained by federal agents outside an ICE facility while reporting on a protest in September. His captors apparently realized what authorities elsewhere did not — when you lock up a journalist, they're likely to report what they see. Their solution, however, was not to change their practices, but to tape up the windows of Held's cell so he couldn't see out.

The accounts of people being detained by ICE show how being held for months or even years before being afforded an opportunity to challenge one's detention before a judge comes with serious personal, financial, and social costs. But their experience is not new. A significant number of U.S. citizens endure this daily all across the country.

Civil liberties organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union have condemned the practice of holding people in prolonged detention before trial. The “guilty until proven innocent” approach violates core principles of the U.S. Constitution.

Recalling his arrest, Hamdi said, “An agent grabbed me from behind, threw me against the car, handcuffed me tightly and tossed me in the vehicle. I repeatedly stated, I had not committed a crime … They would not let me call my attorneys or family. It was a very surreal experience.”

According to a report by the Prison Policy Initiative, in 2023, nearly 70 percent of the national jail population were pretrial detainees. There are now tens of thousands of people being detained by ICE without a deportation order. Like other U.S. jails, ICE jails lack programming or educational opportunities, limit people's access to legal representation, and provide low-quality food and health care, while caging humans in substandard living conditions.

Adding insult to injury, pretrial and pre-deportation hearing detentions induce lost wages, destabilization of family structures, physical and mental health complications, and the countless other adverse effects of being treated like a criminal, like pleading guilty to a crime or agreeing to a deportation despite supposedly having the law on your side. The lack of due process combined with the inhumane treatment chips at their morale. “All of us were losing hope and parts of who we are,” Öztürk wrote.

“The burden of being stuck indoors and cut off from our everyday lives was heavy for everyone,” she added. “It took a toll on growth, career prospects, dreams, and our wellbeing.”

Hamdi described how an elderly man from Uzbekistan who had been broken by 13 months of ICE detention confided in him that he was ready to volunteer for deportation back to his impoverished country, despite knowing he would be able to win his case in court.

“You can have this country,” Hamdi said the Uzbek man confessed.

At the beginning of an ABC News documentary called No Way Out about the failed response to the COVID-19 pandemic by Texas prisons (where I've spent almost three decades), you can hear me say, “We can't breathe!”

Those words were not mere hyperbole. They described the suffocatingly inhumane living conditions and outright cruelty inside Texas prisons.

My outcry was a product of watching healthy people die in record numbers from medical neglect after contracting the COVID-19 virus; of witnessing suicide after suicide because incarcerated individuals were being denied mental health access; of making unanswered pleas for help because we were being denied basic human necessities like toilet paper, soap, and deodorant; of consuming inedible, unhealthy food day after day.

That documentary failed to compel any meaningful change in the Texas prison system. Suicides and homicides have only increased annually. Incarcerated individuals are still dying or suffering lifelong health issues as a result of a lack of access to adequate mental health and medical services. New punitive rules have been implemented that interrupt communication with loved ones and destroy healthy family bonds. The food remains repulsive and the mentalities of the prison guards are as harsh as ever. People are dying to get out, literally.

“A decade ago, two killings, a suspected drug overdose, and a suicide at a single prison in less than two weeks would have been unthinkable,” investigative journalist Keri Blakinger wrote for the Houston Chronicle back in September about events at a prison in Livingston, Texas.

Those same conditions fueling the crisis in Texas exist at prisons and jails nationwide — including ICE facilities.

Öztürk wrote that people arrived “in relatively good health, but their conditions deteriorated day by day due to inadequate access to medical care, nutritious food, sleep, sunlight, and fresh air.”

Federal agents won't even provide treatment for journalists they shoot, like Los Angeles TikTok reporter Carlitos Ricardo Parias. Charges that Parias rammed his vehicle into an immigration officer's car prior to the shooting last June were later thrown out because the government's story was not credible. But his lawyer told a judge he was denied pain medication for his wounds for hours. Adam Rose of the Freedom of the Press Foundation (who is also the press rights chair of the Los Angeles Press Club) says Parias needed morphine but was denied even ibuprofen, and the neglect continued even after a judge ordered treatment.

Hamdi described how ICE officials dehumanized people being detained to the extent that some had to take mental health medication just to survive. “Breathing inside the detention center was hard, both symbolically and physically,” Öztürk expressed in her essay.

The pesky question now is why as a nation the United States allows such models of cruelty to exist?

One theory is the phenomenon called “moral panics.” Moral panics occur when authority figures, including members of law enforcement and politicians, select a handful of true anecdotes concerning a particular kind of behavior by a particular group of people and work with the media to create a society-wide frenzy.

For example, during the Biden administration, far right media personalities and legacy media outlets focused their coverage on isolated incidents of undocumented immigrants committing horrendous crimes, curating a misleading narrative that undocumented immigrants were uniquely responsible for crime in the United States.

In spite of seemingly unlimited data to refute this notion, this false narrative became a cornerstone for Donald Trump's presidential campaign and propelled him back into the Oval Office.

After his election, President Trump and his surrogates continue to peddle the same falsehood with the help of the media. They called undocumented immigrants murderers, rapists, violent gang members, and drug traffickers who had to be removed from the country at all costs.

That big, beautiful lie led to the creation and passage of Trump's first legislative achievement, the Big Beautiful Bill (BBB).

Instead of allocating funds to help people who are struggling to obtain basic necessities like housing, food, and health care, the BBB appropriated a record $170 billion toward criminalizing immigrants. Forty-five billion is reserved exclusively to build more immigration jails. This legislation increased ICE's budget by 265 percent and its bed space from 40,000 to 160,000. According to The Marshall Project, 85 percent of current and future bed spaces will be housed in private prisons, which a 2026 report from the Prison Policy Initiative revealed rake in $2.4 billion in taxpayer money annually.

These moral panics also work to generate consent for something more sinister: criminalization — the process by which populations are deemed unworthy of their rights and worthy of punishment. The state uses criminalization to redirect its responsibility for the social problems it causes — economic crisis, poverty, displacement, war — onto populations which are often the victims of state policies, and to justify the harms of policing and incarceration.

The framing of undocumented immigrants as criminals has permitted ICE agents to unleash unprecedented violent tactics on all immigrants, or mere visitors from abroad — including journalists like Hamdi.

The U.S. public should be reminded that this is the same rhetorical strategy used by the Reagan and Bush administrations' failed “war on drugs” and the “super-predators” sham to demonize young Black males perpetuated by the Clintons.

These administrations contributed to the U.S. becoming the world's leader in incarcerating its own citizens and resulted in the public's general desensitization to how caged humans are treated. Now, more journalists are seeing it for themselves.

The Trump administration's approach toward quelling dissent with brute force is uncharted territory, but the inhumane treatment of those in U.S. custody is routine.

This is why, as an incarcerated journalist who has devoted the past 20 years attempting to educate society on the culture of unchecked cruelty that exists inside these walls of the nation's jails, detention centers, and prisons, I am encouraged by the assistance these worthy causes are receiving from my colleagues like Hamdi, Guevara, Held, and Öztürk, and for the media outlets that are providing space for these stories. As Öztürk put it, all we want is “to be seen as humans again.”

What's happening inside these places should not just alarm society as a whole, but should mobilize us into action, especially those who want to further the cause of liberation. That includes joining and supporting civil liberties organizations, mutual aid groups led by prisoners, campaigns against jail construction and expansion, legal support groups, and journalism outlets like the nonprofit I founded to empower incarcerated journalists and highlight their work, JoinJeremy.

“They know that it is wrong,” Hamdi told Freedom of the Press Foundation during an online event in November. “They know that if the American public finds out the realities of what's happening, ICE will be dismantled in an instant.”

Hamdi may have overestimated us. The conditions at Dilley have been widely reported lately, but so far there has been no dismantling. Instead, the administration plans to expand ICE's capacity to warehouse people. Hopefully the talented writers who now know firsthand of the horrors that expansion will bring can help persuade the public to finally recognize the injustices currently exemplified by ICE jails but equally prevalent across all carceral institutions. 

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

We refuse to let Trump's blatant propaganda machine go unchecked. Untethered to corporate ownership or advertisers, Truthout remains fearless in our reporting and our determination to use journalism as a tool for justice.

 How Beijing Is Encouraging Entrepreneurs Without Giving Up Control

 Lizzi C. Lee and Jing Qian

When China launched a sudden investigation into Ant Group, the financial subsidiary of the tech giant Alibaba, in 2020, it sent a shiver through China's business community. Regulators halted Ant Group's IPO, which was expected to be the world's largest at the time, and later fined Ant and other tech platforms billions of dollars. Alibaba's founder, Jack Ma, who had earned the ire of Chinese leaders after criticizing Beijing's cautious approach to financial regulation, retreated from the public spotlight. For the next few years, most private firms operated in a fog of regulatory uncertainty: permissible boundaries for business activity were shifting, penalties arrived faster than rules could be interpreted, and enforcement agencies did not coordinate. Many entrepreneurs concluded that the business environment had turned against them, and they scaled back investment or relocated their operations abroad.

But one year ago, in February 2025, Chinese leader Xi Jinping signaled that he might be changing course. He invited Ma to a symposium for entrepreneurs, which was the businessman's first public appearance with top leaders since Ant Group came under regulatory fire. The photo op of Xi and Ma together dominated headlines, but it was only the most visible sign of a larger shift: China's political leaders were again acknowledging that they need the private sector. Many of the breakthroughs that have powered China's global dominance in batteries, e-commerce, electric vehicles, and solar panels have come not from state-owned enterprises but from private firms capable of rapid iteration, disciplined commercialization, and global competitiveness. Now, as China attempts to overcome the most critical chokepoints in science and technology—semiconductors, advanced materials, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology—its leaders are increasingly aware that progress depends on entrepreneurial initiative.

Beijing has been laying the groundwork for a new way of managing the private sector. It is not completely loosening political control, nor is it likely to. Instead, the Chinese Communist Party wants to institutionalize a more predictable system of oversight after years of volatile crackdowns. The aim is to encourage ingenuity as long as it serves the country's drive for technological self-reliance and global leadership. The new model offers regulatory stability to firms in exchange for a commitment to playing by the CCP's rules and working toward its policy goals. Beijing has not abandoned the conviction that political power must remain superior to private capital; what has changed is the sophistication of the toolkit used to enforce that primacy, and the more nuanced ways it is trying to achieve it.

China's new approach starts with redrawing the boundaries of what firms can and cannot do. To better define and stabilize the relationship between the state and private firms, authorities have streamlined conflicting mandates from agencies in China's regulatory bureaucracy. Whereas past crackdowns created confusion and generated inconsistent or competing demands on firms, policymakers are establishing a coherent set of rules for how firms in each sector need to secure data, register algorithms, and transfer data across borders. The 2026 automotive data guidelines published in early February, for instance, clearly define what data from cars can be shared internationally, making it easier for electric vehicle companies to expand their markets without running afoul of regulators in different agencies.

Beijing is also codifying legal protections for private entrepreneurs. In 2025, the government enacted the Private Economy Promotion Law, China's first comprehensive statute promising equal legal treatment, property rights protection, and fair market access for private firms. The judiciary launched a campaign emphasizing the need to distinguish economic disputes from criminal cases, which seeks to quell long-standing concerns about arbitrary enforcement actions against private entrepreneurs. And state media outlets have been highlighting rulings in which courts side with companies against government agencies, signaling greater willingness to restrain administrative overreach.

Meanwhile, the party is leaning into the corporatist political structure of the economy to influence companies from the inside. This includes party cells, which are the basic units of CCP organizing and serve as the party's presence within a company. These cells are required in any firm that employs at least three party members and are usually composed of mid- or senior-level managers who are party members. Although these cells were once treated as peripheral, they have taken on a more visible role in ensuring that political and policy directives become part of corporate governance. Party cells can convey Beijing's messages to company leaders and reinforce the expectation that companies should match their goals to party-state priorities.

In some cases, authorities can exercise control over firms even more directly. Entities linked to the state, including government-affiliated investment funds, regulatory bodies, or state-owned enterprises, can take golden shares, or small equity stakes in a company. This stake (usually about one percent) provides little financial value but enough veto power to shape a company's internal decisions. Golden shares allow state agencies to influence companies at critical junctures without micromanaging their daily operations, and their use has become common in data, finance, media, and advanced technology firms. In 2021, for instance, an investor affiliated with the Cyberspace Administration of China acquired a one percent share in ByteDance, the domestic arm of TikTok's parent company. The golden share gave the agency, China's web regulator, a board seat and ownership of the operating licenses for ByteDance's apps in China.

These efforts have reduced some of the regulatory whiplash that marked earlier crackdowns. Companies now better understand the political redlines they cannot cross. But by embedding the party more deeply into corporate governance, Beijing is also formalizing its power to intervene in ways that could undercut its goals. Even if firms' day-to-day operations remain commercially driven, the need to defer to political priorities could reduce their willingness to take risks, make new investments, and craft long-term plans. If political objectives are prioritized over market logic, investor confidence could weaken, and corporate dynamism could wither.

Previously, Beijing was able to manage tech platforms' global engagement only in an ad hoc manner. When the ridesharing platform Didi pursued an IPO in New York in 2021, for example, regulators recommended the company delay the listing but did not explicitly block it—only to launch a sweeping review and crackdown soon after the IPO went ahead. China's new approach to the private sector embraces openness by managing it sector by sector, calibrating how it controls firms' international exposure based on the risks and rewards that each sector presents to the country's national development strategy.

In sectors in which China already holds a competitive edge, the key concern is how to keep it. China dominates the global market in batteries, for instance, and Beijing fears leaking its world-leading technology. Many Chinese firms maintain extensive global supply chains, rely on cross-border data and technology linkages, and work with overseas partners and international investors—which policymakers view as vulnerable channels through which sensitive information can leak. Beijing continues to support private firms by offering subsidies, guaranteeing procurement of their products, and channeling capital through state-backed funds. But policymakers remain cautious about which firms may access financing and sensitive data, how technologies may be transferred or exported, and when some entrepreneurs should be allowed to travel overseas.

In fields such as biotech, in which competitiveness depends on constant integration with the global scientific frontier, the tension between innovation and security is even more pronounced. Biotech entrepreneurs need to attend international conferences and collaborate across borders, and their competitiveness hinges on licensing assets to multinational pharmaceutical companies that can commercialize and distribute their products to overseas markets. But although Beijing seeks to accelerate biotech innovation, it has not relaxed its political and security guardrails. Instead, it is increasing control. Beijing is tightening oversight of foreign partnerships and licensing deals, subjecting cross-border collaborations to national security reviews, and restricting university scientists from traveling abroad without approval. These measures reflect real concerns about technology leaks, but they weigh heavily on a sector in which growth depends on global collaboration.



Beijing's new approach is to push biotech firms to make money in China rather than seek profits abroad. For instance, regulators are trying to create more opportunities for pharmaceutical companies to profit in China's domestic market—which currently offers much lower profit margins because of strict government price controls—by adjusting reimbursement rates for new drugs. And they are trying to get multinational drugmakers to do more R & D within China, such as through joint labs and local partnerships, to keep innovation within the domestic ecosystem rather than flowing outward. Yet biotech is inherently global: limiting cross-border collaboration slows discovery of new drugs and ultimately harms patients everywhere. Whether Beijing can successfully keep Chinese biotech firms competitive while limiting space for overseas collaboration is a test—not only for the biotech sector but also of whether this broader model of managed openness under geopolitical constraints will succeed.

But in some areas critical to the country's goal of becoming less reliant on the United States for technology, Beijing has become noticeably more open to outside financing in the past year. Regulators are willing to let more “tough tech” firms, which are those operating on scientific and technological frontiers, raise capital in public markets, especially the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In semiconductors, for instance, Beijing has moved on from trying to gain an edge with state investments. In 2014 and 2019, it launched the so-called Big Funds 1.0 and 2.0, which mobilized tens of billions of dollars into chip fabrication, equipment, and supply chain upgrading. These state-led efforts struggled, however, because they could not efficiently allocate capital to sectors in which experimentation, competition, and failure are necessary. Beijing is now hoping that making it easier for firms to go public and list on international markets will better support promising “tough tech” companies.

Beijing has also pivoted away from relying on picking winners and toward building a broader ecosystem that helps these companies succeed. Policymakers are focusing on providing shared energy and data infrastructure, targeted tax and subsidy incentives, more STEM education, and national coordination of advanced supply chains and logistics networks. The telecommunications giant Huawei, for instance, has increasingly become the state's leading coordinator for the country's AI needs. It brings together the building blocks of the country's AI ecosystem—designing chips, providing cloud computing services, and tailoring hardware and software to the needs of downstream companies that build AI applications—so that firms across China can operate on a common technological core. Yet security concerns persist. Reports show that authorities are restricting overseas travel for engineers at leading AI companies in China, limiting the possibility of global cooperation and hampering China's ability to influence burgeoning international AI standards.

The evolution of Alibaba illustrates one way the new state-business relationship operates. Beijing did not crush Ant Group, Alibaba's financial arm, in 2020 and simply walk away. Instead, authorities narrowed the scope of acceptable private sector expansion and created space for the firm to use its strengths to support the party-state's goals. Tech behemoths such as Alibaba were not allowed to create financial platforms to challenge state banks, but they could take on “tough tech” challenges to make China a science and technology powerhouse.

In response, Alibaba has quietly reinvented itself. It has shifted from a consumer-facing Internet platform to a foundational AI- and cloud-infrastructure provider. Alibaba developed the Qwen family of open-source large language models, which has grown into the world's largest ecosystem of its kind. Singapore's government, for instance, chose Qwen as the foundation for Sea-Lion, its flagship national AI model. In parallel, Alibaba diversified its chip supply chains and developed high-performance chips, including an accelerator chip that can compete with Nvidia's H20. China wants companies such as Alibaba to develop these domestic chips so the country can pursue its AI ambitions without needing to rely on hardware made by U.S. companies such as Nvidia.



Alibaba is not merely paying lip service to state priorities; it has fundamentally reshaped its business model. As of late 2025, AI-related products within its cloud business have seen triple-digit year-over-year growth for nine consecutive quarters. In 2019, at the height of its expansion into personal financial technology platforms, Ant Group spent less than nine percent of its annual revenue on R & D, most of which focused on credit, wealth management, and insurance products. By 2024, Ant's R & D spending had more than doubled in absolute terms and exceeded ten percent of revenue for three consecutive years. R & D investment is now concentrated in large language models and AI database technologies.

Following years of expansion into an array of sectors as varied as finance and media, Alibaba also concentrated its operations. It streamlined its corporate structure, restructured its various business arms, and focused on AI, cloud computing, and e-commerce. The company merged different holdings, such as the food delivery service Ele.me and travel agency Fliggy, into its core e-commerce business, to further this consolidation. This narrower scope of operations makes the firm easier for the party to regulate and signals to authorities that the company is aligned with Beijing's goals.

So far, China's leaders have embraced the company's revival. Compared with 2020, when China sought to bring big tech to heel, Beijing has built a stronger arsenal of regulatory, legal, and political tools to keep firms working toward its policy priorities. Alibaba's pivot from financial technology into AI and cloud infrastructure is also less risky to Beijing. Whereas finance is volatile and creates systemic risk, AI infrastructure is less likely to threaten economic stability. The party's evolving compact with the private sector is not about obedience but about convergence: ambition is welcome, and the rewards are still massive, but the space to grow is more constrained and defined by political needs.

The question is not whether China wants to revive its private sector, but how Beijing will try to shape its resurgence. Policymakers are sending a message that big tech companies can only expand if they align their missions with the state's policy priorities, and upgraded legal and regulatory frameworks are establishing more clarity for entrepreneurs seeking to understand where the party will let them grow.

The biggest challenge for Beijing is that years of regulatory shocks have disillusioned much of China's entrepreneurial class. Confidence is in short supply, and rebuilding it will take time. Private firms remain outside the party-state apparatus, which means they lack the institutional protection that shields state-owned enterprises from shifting political winds. Domestic investors will not regain their appetite for the type of high-risk, high-cost technological ventures that China is prioritizing until the political boundaries are clear and the business community is confident that it will not face another sudden reversal. Some foreign investment revived in 2025 as China's stock market grew, but many overseas investors remain wary of putting money into Chinese companies because of capital controls, opaque rules on market access, and limited exit mechanisms should something go wrong.



But Xi does have a couple of structural advantages. Beijing's evolving compact with private capital is reinforced by the narrowing options Chinese entrepreneurs face abroad. Geopolitical tensions have sharply curtailed the scope for overseas expansion, and no other market rivals China in scale, supply chain depth, or policy coherence. The 2025 U.S. Biosecure Act, for instance, restricts federally funded institutions in the United States from contracting with Chinese biotech firms that it deems to be “of concern,” raising the costs of cross-border collaboration and complicating Chinese firms' operations in the United States. Amid these mounting constraints, China remains the primary place where things get built—and where breakthroughs can scale.

A new generation of entrepreneurs is also emerging. This younger generation doesn't remember what it was like to be an entrepreneur a decade or two ago, when rules were laxer. Many did not experience the recent corporate crackdowns firsthand as business leaders. Instead, they have come of age treating tighter state involvement as normal, which means they are more willing to embrace the government's encouragement and play by its rules. Invoking a darkly humorous metaphor for ordinary citizens in China up against the powerful state as chives—plants that are repeatedly chopped down but regrow quickly—older Chinese entrepreneurs sometimes refer to the younger generation as “new chives,” implying that these entrepreneurs have not yet felt the knife of the state and are eager to be part of China's tech boom. DeepSeek is representative of this group: the young, engineering-driven startup steers clear of overt politics while operating at the frontier of AI. China's leaders hope this new generation of entrepreneurs is rising not in defiance of the system, but in response to it.

If the hybrid model succeeds, it could become one of Xi's most consequential legacies: a political economy that blends centralized authority with entrepreneurial vitality. Whether such a synthesis is sustainable remains an open question, especially because Beijing is hesitant to encourage openness where firms need to collaborate internationally. But after years of crackdowns and recalibration, Beijing appears to have absorbed a critical lesson about the private sector: it is the country's golden goose. China's leaders now understand that when it comes to entrepreneurs and the country's technological and economic goals, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

            The Trump administration plans to double down on targeted immigration enforcement, taking Tom Homan's playbook in Minneapolis and applying it to multiple cities nationwide, according to current and former Homeland Security officials.
    


            It's a marked departure from the highly visible and aggressive tactics employed by top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino. That approach, documented in Hollywood-style social media videos and touted by senior Trump officials at the time, is being tabled, for now, following the scenes that unfolded in Minneapolis, including the shooting deaths of two American citizens.
    


            “No more Bovino bullsh*t. That show is shut down,” a Homeland Security official told CNN.
    


            The return to ICE's typical immigration enforcement tactics, which include identifying targets ahead of time, instead of broad sweeps in areas trafficked by immigrants, comes amid waning public support for how the administration has been conducting immigration arrests.
    


            The protests and images coming out of Minneapolis late last month prompted concerns from some Trump administration officials over the optics of the immigration crackdown. That included President Donald Trump, who privately expressed frustration that his immigration messaging was getting lost. The debate over federal immigration enforcement has also sparked a partial government shutdown affecting portions of DHS, as Democrats have pushed for ICE reforms in exchange for supporting funding for the department.
    


            “Targeting public safety threats is nothing new. …  Under Secretary Noem's leadership, nearly 70% of ICE arrests are of illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S.,” a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement, citing more than 700,000 deportations under the Trump administration.
    


            While the administration has said it is prioritizing people with serious criminal records, many of those detained over the last year do not fall in that category. DHS also issued a recent memo stating that immigration authorities should detain refugees who have not yet obtained a green card and detain them for additional screening.
    


            Sources told CNN that late last year, agents had been more focused on developing targets rather than only relying on street encounters. But that changed with an unprecedented surge of thousands of federal agents to Minneapolis over a welfare-fraud scandal that ensnared the Somali community.
    


            Two Americans — Renee Good and Alex Pretti — were shot and killed by federal agents. And two other officers are under investigation over their accounts about what unfolded in an operation where one of the officers shot a Venezuelan man in the leg.
    


            Homan announced a federal drawdown in Minneapolis last week, citing agreements with local officials allowing additional cooperation.
    


            Current and former Homeland Security officials stressed that the latest move toward a more targeted enforcement approach doesn't mean that the crackdown is softening, as some cities may still see larger footprints of ICE agents. The turbocharged sweeps are less likely, though officials cautioned that plans are subject to change. The administration has also escalated efforts to expand immigration detention — an indicator of plans to continue ramped up arrests.
    


            “What they were doing was hoping that high visibility enforcement operations would scare enough illegal aliens to increase self-deportation. I think that's part of what they were thinking,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for limited immigration.
    


            “What they didn't take into account is that people, even though they still back deportation of illegal aliens, they want to see less of the militarized type of action,” he added.
    


            After Trump dispatched Homan to Minneapolis, Bovino was sidelined and returned to his post as chief patrol agent of the El Centro sector. He's since confirmed on X that he was recently at Mammoth Mountain, the California ski resort, saying in a reply to a user: “Katie, the powder was excellent, and some shredding did take place!! Mammoth is an excellent mountain and looking forward to going back!!!! In the meantime, on the lookout for illegal aliens!!”
    


            Bovino's bravado and heavy-handed arrest tactics in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and Minneapolis captured the administration's aggressive approach to its mass deportation pledge — and penchant for public sparring with critics over controversial actions.
    


            It also marked a pivot from the way enforcement responsibilities are generally divided between Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with the latter charged with interior immigration arrests.
    


            Bovino's enforcement style had been backed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The pivot to Homan's approach is a rebuke of that style and reveals the ongoing tensions between different factions in the administration over how to tackle the president's immigration agenda, officials said.
    


            Homan has generally taken a more stringent approach to immigration enforcement, wanting to focus on public safety and national security threats, as well as so-called “collaterals,” meaning undocumented immigrants that may be in the vicinity of a targeted operation.
    


            “ICE has been doing interior enforcement before Bovino got involved. They prefer to conduct their ops without the optics,” another Homeland Security official told CNN. “(Border Patrol) never wanted anything to do with these interior ops and will go back to focusing on the border.”
    


            The change also means “there's less characters in this play and less storylines,” a former Trump official told CNN. “That's where they think they've set the course,” the official added, referring to the White House.
    


            White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN in a statement, “The President's entire team is working together to implement his immigration enforcement agenda – which has always focused on prioritizing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens. The successful deportations, dropping crime rates, and historically secure border prove that. As always, anyone in the country illegally is eligible to be deported.”
    


            Homan acknowledged the issues on the ground in Minneapolis, including officer misconduct, almost immediately after arriving and since then.
    


            In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” Homan said he increased the presence of internal affairs officers in Minnesota since arriving in the Twin Cities to address misconduct allegations among immigration enforcement officers.
    


            “In any instance where there have been allegations of misconduct or working outside the policy, it has been referred to internal affairs,” he said.
    


            Within the Trump administration, there has been infighting between factions who back Homan and those who back Noem. Homan and Noem have rarely spoken to each other in recent months, according to US officials.
    


            Homan said Sunday he doesn't agree with Noem “on everything,” but added that the pair regularly have discussions, and he described the administration's efforts as “one team one fight.”
    


            “We have discussions and different opinions. That's what makes it a strong team. We bring different ideas to the table and then agree on a mission,” Homan said.

            Lawmakers who oversee the Department of Homeland Security say the agency has repeatedly stymied their requests for information in recent months, with even some Republicans alleging they've had phone calls go unanswered and data requests left to languish.
    


            As the Department of Homeland Security has found itself embroiled in controversies across the country over high-profile killings by immigration agents and the resulting bitter policy disputes, lawmakers say they've stepped up their efforts to try to get answers for the public. But they've often been met with resistance, they said — thwarting their ability to hold anyone accountable.
    


            “I'm not going to sit here on bended knee hoping to God that somebody returns the call,” GOP Rep. Mark Amodei, the Republican who oversees the DHS budget in the House told CNN, after his request to speak with White House Border Czar Tom Homan went unanswered for days.
    


            One Republican staffer told CNN that the stonewalling extends beyond just thorny policy questions about immigration enforcement. Requests to the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the status of federal disaster funding and questions over potential crimes committed by those detained by federal officers have also been met with silence or evasiveness, the staffer said.
    


            The result, the staffer said, is not only that GOP lawmakers can't properly oversee the agency, they can't help blunt possibly unfair attacks from their Democratic counterparts.
    


            “It's really a shame that DHS has taken such an adversarial posture on sharing data. In some areas, like on immigration and the border they have a great story to tell, and we could be helping them tell that story,” the staffer explained. “In other areas where the story is not so good, like FEMA, we could also help. But they choose to go at it alone, so it's on them to defend, which is hard to do when no one believes a word they say or a number they put out. There is no trust and there is no way to verify.”
    


            Democrats, meanwhile, say they have received virtually no response from their inquiries to DHS. At least 15 letters sent by members of the party to the department have either been ghosted, received a cursory acknowledgement or were given a non-answer, a Homeland Security Committee Democratic aide told CNN. Another Democratic staffer told CNN that when they've asked for specific FEMA updates, whether it's on mitigation projects, staffing plans or briefings on various press releases, they've gotten no response.
    


            A DHS spokesperson told CNN the department works through “official channels” and would “not be litigating our relationship” with Capitol Hill through the press. But they also dismissed claims they've not engaged with members of Congress.
    


            “Any suggestion that DHS has ‘refused' to engage with lawmakers is simply false,” the spokesperson said in part, adding that “this administration has been the most transparent administration in history and has spent the last year clearing out congressional correspondence that went unanswered under the last administration.”
    


            Some Republicans told CNN they've been able to leverage their personal relationships with Trump administration officials to get their questions answered and others said they had no issues getting quick responses from DHS – “I communicate with them all the time,” GOP Rep. Andy Ogles said. But two top Republican congressman specifically tasked with overseeing DHS are among those who say they've run into issues.
    


            Amodei, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, sought to speak directly with Homan about the operation in Minneapolis shortly after federal officers' fatal encounter with Alex Pretti there, as well as to receive a broader status update on the administration's deportation efforts.
    


            Amodei's office put in the request in January and was redirected to White House Office of Legislative Affairs Director James Braid to coordinate the conversation. The request went unanswered for 10 days, prompting the Nevada Republican to eventually withdraw the request, Amodei said.
    


            The administration was focused on executing the mission in Minneapolis at the time of Amodei's request, an official said when asked by CNN about the request, adding that it could now be arranged.
    


            “At the time, we were prioritizing the actual execution of the mission in Minneapolis,” the administration official said. “Now going forward, we're happy to offer Chairman Amodei a briefing as well as other congressional committees.”
    


            But Amodei, who projected confidence he'll get the information another way, suggested it was a question of respect. “I wish they were more professional with how they dealt with the people who handled their budget,” he told CNN from his Capitol Hill office.
    


            After withdrawing his initial request, Amodei has recently spoken with Braid about arranging a call with Homan, the congressman's office told CNN.
    


            Another Republican chairman — Rep. Andrew Garbarino of the House Homeland Security Committee — tried for weeks to schedule DHS Secretary Kristi Noem for testimony for the annual worldwide threats hearing before his panel, and eventually resorted to asking the White House in December to lean on her to agree on a date, according to a US official familiar with the discussions.
    


            Noem finally agreed to a hearing, where she was excoriated by Democrats for her handling of immigration, FEMA and other issues. The administration official declined to comment on any coordination with Garbarino, saying they don't discuss private conversations with members.
    


            Garbarino said at the eventual December hearing that he made “numerous accommodations” for Noem's appearance.
    


            “This is why this hearing is so important. Congress must hear from the Executive. Oversight is not unfair. And asking questions is not unwarranted. We must ensure the people's representatives are informed,” the New York Republican said at the time.
    


            CNN has reached out to Garbarino's office for comment.
    


            According to a data analysis compiled by ProQuest Congressional Data and shared with CNN, there has been a 28.7% decline in appearances of DHS officials before congressional committees in 2025, compared to the first year of previous administrations.
    


            Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said he's never seen it this bad.
    


            “I've never met Secretary Noem other than the two times she came before the committee last year. I've met every secretary since the department was created in my office or in a number of occasions,” Thompson said.
    


            The Mississippi Democrat said that for a year, he had not had any direct interaction with an ICE official until he met the director the day before his scheduled hearing before the committee earlier this month. Witnesses before a hearing are required to submit their written testimony to Congress the day before a hearing, but Thompson said the ICE director came to his meeting with his prepared testimony in hand and said he was still working on it.
    


            “If the legislative is to function, then the executive branch has to be forthcoming with the information. If they're not forthcoming with the information, then it's almost impossible for the legislative branch to basically provide any road maps for future success because we don't have access to the data,” Thompson said.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico's attorney general has reopened an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein 's former Zorro Ranch, as allegations swirl about what role the secluded spot played in sexual abuse or sex trafficking of underage girls and young women.

Attorney General Raúl Torrez's office said Thursday that the decision was made after reviewing information recently released by the U.S. Justice Department.

Although New Mexico's initial case was closed in 2019 at the request of federal prosecutors in New York, state prosecutors say now that “revelations outlined in the previously sealed FBI files warrant further examination.” 

The New Mexico Department of Justice said special agents and prosecutors at the agency will be seeking immediate access to the complete, unredacted federal case file and intend to work with other law enforcement partners as well as a new truth commission established by state lawmakers to look into activities at the ranch.

“As with any potential criminal matter, we will follow the facts wherever they lead, carefully evaluate jurisdictional considerations, and take appropriate investigative action, including the collection and preservation of any relevant evidence that remains available,” the New Mexico Department of Justice said in a statement.

The investigation was one of several major developments in the continuing fallout from the release of the federal government's so-called Epstein files. Earlier Thursday, British police arrested the former Prince Andrew on suspicion of misconduct in public office related to his links to the late sex offender.




In Washington, D.C., members of Congress are still working to lift the veil with more testimony from powerful people.

On Thursday, video was released of a six-hour deposition of billionaire retail mogul Les Wexner. In it, Wexner remains defiant that he didn't know of or participate in Epstein's crimes, and he doubles down on the fact that the two “weren't friends.”

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is scheduled to appear before the same House Oversight Committee next week, with former President Bill Clinton following the next day.

In New Mexico, the state's truth commission had its first meeting Tuesday. Aside from looking into the abuse and trafficking allegations, New Mexico lawmakers want to know why Epstein was not registered as a sex offender in the state after pleading guilty in 2008 in Florida to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl and whether there was corruption among public officials.

Epstein never faced charges in New Mexico, but state prosecutors confirmed in 2019 that they had interviewed possible victims who visited the ranch south of Santa Fe. They never elaborated on how many accusers were interviewed or what they say took place at the ranch.

Also Thursday, lawyers for Epstein accusers said they've reached a proposed settlement in a class action lawsuit against his estate — the latest effort to compensate his victims. Pending a judge's approval, Epstein's estate would pay between $25 million and $35 million, depending on how many victims qualify for the settlement.

The estate previously paid 136 claimants a total of $121 million via its Epstein Victims Compensation Program and paid more than $48 million to settle claims from 59 other victims, court records show.

Epstein purchased the sprawling Zorro Ranch in New Mexico in 1993 from former Democratic Gov. Bruce King and built a hilltop mansion. Nearby was a private airstrip with a hangar and helipad. The property also included a ranch office, a firehouse and a seven-bay heated garage.

The property was sold by Epstein's estate in 2023 — with proceeds going toward creditors — to the family of Don Huffines, a Republican running for state comptroller in Texas. In a social media post on X, Huffines said the property has been renamed San Rafael Ranch after a saint associated with healing and that his family plans to operate a Christian retreat there.

A spokesperson for Huffines has said that the owners have never been approached by local, state or federal law enforcement requesting access to the ranch and if they do, full cooperation will be granted.

There are thousands of references to the ranch in the documents released by federal authorities.

Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, was among the guests to have visited the ranch. Following one of the early investigations into the disgraced financier, Richardson donated $50,000 in 2006 gubernatorial campaign contributions from Epstein to charity.

Emails and schedules recently released by federal authorities also show a long list of entrepreneurs, actors and scientists were invited to the ranch over the years, including Woody Allen, Robert Redford, Reid Hoffman, Joi Ito and Peter Thiel.

New Mexico Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard canceled grazing leases held by the ranch in 2019 after her office was denied access to inspect the nearly 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) of leased state land.

Garcia Richard in a letter sent last week called on federal authorities and state prosecutors to ensure a thorough criminal investigation into allegations related to the ranch. She called the allegations “deeply disturbing.”

In 2019 after Epstein's death, a woman identified as Jane Doe said in court that he had molested her at Zorro Ranch in 2004, when she was 15. The woman recalled feeling small and powerless, describing how he laid her on the floor so she was confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians.

“People deserve to know the truth about what happened on Epstein's ranch and are looking to leaders for answers,” Garcia Richard said in a statement.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Actor Shia LaBeouf has been charged with battery and is accused of repeatedly using homophobic slurs while hitting multiple people at a New Orleans bar during Mardi Gras, according to a police report.

The New Orleans police report obtained by The Associated Press via a public records request states that LaBeouf, 39, “became irate and aggressive throughout the night” and struck multiple people with a closed fist at the Royal Street Inn & R Bar, near the historic French Quarter. 

Jeffrey Damnit, a well-known local entertainer who police identified as Jeffrey Klein in the incident report, said he was one of the people attacked by LaBeouf.

“He hit me, he connected a few times with punches, he pushed me a few times,” Damnit said.

LaBeouf “just got nuts” trying to start fights and telling the entertainer and others that he would beat them up, Damnit said. He added that LaBeouf had pushed him from behind at the bar earlier in the night, shouting homophobic slurs and threatening his life.

Damnit was wearing eye makeup and lipstick and said he believes his appearance motivated LaBeouf's attack. 

“That's just somehow something that set him off, angered him and gave him a direction for his anger,” Damnit said. “This guy wants me to be dead because I wear makeup. It's a screwed up thing.”

A video shows a shirtless LaBeouf shoving one person to the ground and hitting another person in the face, “causing his nose to possibly dislocate,” according to the police report.




Damnit and others subdued LaBeouf and tried to get him to leave the area, but he would not leave and became more aggressive, according to Damnit and the police report.

Police arrived at the bar around 12:45 a.m. on the morning of the city's famous Fat Tuesday revelry.

Another video recorded by Damnit and shared with the AP shows LaBeouf looking at the camera and appearing to mouth a homophobic slur while police detained him. He continued to repeat the slur throughout the arrest, the police report stated.

“These f–––––s put me in jail,” LaBeouf said, and then told police he's Catholic, according to the report. 

“I didn't shove nobody, I never touched nobody,” LaBeouf tells New Orleans police officers in the video recorded by Damnit.

Representatives for LaBeouf did not immediately respond to request for comment. In the early morning hours of Feb. 18, LaBeouf wrote “Free me” on his X account. 

A New Orleans magistrate judge ordered LaBeouf to be released from custody on Tuesday without a bond requirement, according to Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gary Scheets. LaBeouf has been charged with two counts of simple battery.

Videos later show LaBeouf dancing throughout the French Quarter and appear to show him waving his jail release papers.

Damnit, a member of the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, says he is worried that he will face ramifications in his professional career for pressing charges against LaBeouf. 

This isn't the first time LaBeouf has faced legal troubles. He was sent to court-ordered rehabilitation after being arrested in New York in 2017 for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct, which was captured on livestream video. 

While on location in Georgia filming “The Peanut Butter Falcon,” later that year, he was arrested for public drunkenness and accused of disorderly conduct and obstruction and sentenced to probation. 

In 2020, he was charged with misdemeanor battery and petty theft in Los Angeles.

That year, the English singer and actor FKA Twigs, whose legal name is Tahliah Barnett, also filed a lawsuit alleging LaBeouf was physically and emotionally abusive to her during their relationship, which they settled in July.

Barnett said LaBeouf put her in a constant state of fear and humiliation, once slammed her into a car, tried to strangle her and knowingly gave her a sexually transmitted disease.

LaBeouf apologized in a statement after the lawsuit was filed. He also denied the accusations in the lawsuit in a 2021 filing, saying any injuries done or damages incurred by Barnett were not his doing.

The actor first gained acclaim as a child for his role on the Disney Channel series “Even Stevens,” and continued working steadily into adulthood. He is perhaps best known for his roles in 2007's “Transformers” and in 2008's “Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.”

LaBeouf shares a daughter, born in 2022, with actor Mia Goth.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House announced a reciprocal trade agreement with Indonesia on Thursday while President Prabowo Subianto was in Washington to attend the first meeting of President Donald Trump's Board of Peace.

Under the agreement, Southeast Asia's largest economy will eliminate tariffs for 99% of American goods while the U.S. will maintain tariffs on most Indonesian goods at 19%, the White House said. That is the same rate the U.S. has set for Cambodia and Malaysia. Indonesia also agreed to address non-tariff barriers to U.S. goods and to remove restrictions on exports to the U.S. for critical minerals and other industrial commodities, the White House said.

Indonesian and U.S. companies also reached 11 deals this week worth $38.4 billion, including purchases of U.S. soybeans, corn, cotton and wheat, cooperation in critical minerals and oil field recovery, and joint ventures in computer chips.

“We have negotiated very intensively over the last few months, and I think we have reached solid understandings on many issues,” Prabowo told business executives Wednesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

A White House statement called it a “great deal” and said it “will help both countries to strengthen economic security, promote economic growth, and thereby continuously lead to global prosperity.”

The agreement was later signed by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and his Indonesian counterpart, Airlangga Hartarto.

Hartarto told a news conference from Washington that both governments cast the agreement as marking the start of a “new golden age” in bilateral economic ties and Indonesia will introduce measures designed to keep trade flows secure and prevent misuse of sensitive goods. 




The agreement was announced the same day that Prabowo, leader of the world's most populous Muslim country, reiterated his pledge at the Board of Peace meeting to send 8,000 troops or “more if necessary” for an international stabilization force in Gaza.

Indonesia was among the first to make a firm commitment to a critical element of Trump's postwar Gaza reconstruction plan. 

“President Prabowo of Indonesia, thank you very much,” Trump said at the Board of Peace meeting. “It's a big country you have, and you do a great job.”

Prabowo praised Trump in return. “We are very optimistic with the leadership of President Trump, this vision of real peace will be achieved,” Prabowo said. “There will be problems, but we will prevail.”

Cambodia and Vietnam are the two other Southeast Asian countries that joined the board, which was originally envisioned as overseeing the Gaza ceasefire but has taken shape with wider ambitions to broker other global conflicts.

Their leaders also came to Washington for the inaugural meeting. Cambodia has already inked a trade deal with the U.S., while Vietnam has reached a framework agreement.

Indonesian companies agreed this week to buy 1 million tons of soybeans, 1.6 million tons of corn and 93,000 tons of cotton from the U.S. They also pledged to buy up to 5 million tons of U.S. wheat by 2030.

The countries agreed to cooperate on critical minerals, though details were not immediately available. 

Washington is seeking Indonesia's agreement to lift restrictions on critical mineral exports, which the Trump administration argues could safeguard U.S. manufacturers from supply‑chain disruptions. The administration has sought to defend against China's stranglehold on the key elements needed for everything from fighter jets to smartphones.

At the Chamber of Commerce event, Prabowo said Indonesia can serve as a “bridge” and “honest broker” between great powers, apparently referring to the U.S.-China competition.

At the Board of Peace meeting, Trump called Vietnam “incredible as a country and as a force” and told leader To Lam that it was “a really great honor to have you.”

Lam's visit to the U.S. is his first since he was reelected as the head of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party last month. Typically, China is an initial stop in a nod to the countries' ideological ties and Beijing's status as Vietnam's largest trading partner. Lam did visit China in August 2024 before traveling to the U.S. during his first term.

Analysts say Lam's visit to the U.S. before traveling to Beijing this time around is a notable shift in sequencing. Hanoi describes its foreign policy as independent and balanced among major powers. 

Trade negotiations between Vietnam and the United States are ongoing following the Trump administration levying 20% tariffs on Vietnamese exports. The latest, sixth round of talks concluded in early February.

Speaking at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace, President Donald Trump warned anew that “bad things will happen” if Iran refuses to make a deal on its nuclear program. Trump said the world will find out “over the next, probably, ten days.”

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

President Donald Trump was in Georgia Thursday for a trip designed to help boost Republicans' political standing heading into the midterms.

In the battleground state, the president spoke on economic issues. The White House has long said Trump would focus more on the economy, and he frequently complains that he doesn't get enough credit for it. But recent months have been dominated by other issues, including deadly clashes during deportation efforts in Minneapolis.

Trump began the day by announcing at his inaugural Board of Peace meeting that nine members have agreed to pledge a combined $7 billion for a Gaza relief package and five countries agreed to deploy troops for an international stabilization force in the war-battered Palestinian territory.

But $7 billion is only a fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild Gaza, where a shaky ceasefire deal looms over Trump's ambitions for his board to rival the United Nations in solving world conflicts.

What to know:








One senior regional government official said he has stressed to Iranian officials in private conversations that Trump has proven that his rhetoric should be taken at face value and that he's serious about his threat to carry out a strike if Iran doesn't offer adequate concessions.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate diplomatic conversations, said he's advised his Iranian interlocutors to look to how Trump has dealt with Venezuela, the Russia-Ukraine war, relations with Europe and pressing allies and foes for tariffs and draw lessons on how it should move forward.

The official said he's made the case to the Trump administration that it could draw concessions from Iran in the near-term if it focuses on nuclear issues and leaves the push on Tehran to scale back its ballistic missile program and support for proxy group for later.

The official also said Trump ordering a limited strike aimed at pressuring Iran could backfire and lead to Khamenei withdrawing Iran from the talks.

The president kicked off his remarks at a Georgia steel company by complaining about the fact that many of his tariffs have been challenged and are waiting a ruling from the Supreme Court that could come as soon as Friday .

“I have to wait for this decision!” Trump said. “I've been waiting forever!”

Reaching a yell at several points, Trump said of his imposition of tariffs, “I have the right to do it as president.”

“What a country,” he said. “So sad.”

With the Supreme Court's tariff's decision still pending, Trump during a tour of Coosa Steel expressed exasperation that his administration is even in court over the issue.

“Every country in the world was ripping us off,” Trump said, addressing reporters as he toured the plant with owner Andrew Saville. “And to think that we have to be before the Supreme Court on a thing like this.”

The high court's decision over the legality of Trump's tariffs is still pending, three months after the case was argued.

Several justices expressed skepticism about the tariffs' legality at arguments in November. Standing with Trump, Saville told the president he'd “leveled the playing field” for businesses like his, which Saville said was struggling previously.

Stopping at The Varsity hamburger restaurant in Rome, Georgia, Trump said Democrats were “fighting like hell” against his administration's seizure of voting records and ballots in Georgia's Fulton County.

“All those crooked ballots were taken,” he said, of the FBI search last month.Trump has long seen Georgia as central to his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen by Democrats and President Joe Biden, a fabrication that he reiterated this week during a White House reception on Black History Month.

Audits, state officials, courts and Trump's own former attorney general have all rejected the idea of widespread problems that could have altered the election.

Ahead of taping a podcast interview, a steel company tour and remarks on the economy, Trump called the Fulton County situation “a disgrace” and said his administration was “cleaning it up.”

Police in the town of Aberdeen believe someone Wednesday afternoon threw from a moving vehicle a flash-bang — which creates a very loud noise — that landed 150 yards from a tent where the site operates in a park.

No one was injured and no property damage occurred. Police Capt. Shannon Blackburn said investigators believe the cylinder was detonated because of the voting site, which is being used for next month's primary elections. Flash-bangs can be used to attempt to disperse crowds.

Blackburn said witnesses reported hearing what they thought was a blown electrical transformer, and saw no vehicle or potential suspect. The investigation is continuing.

Aberdeen is a town of 9,000 about 70 miles southwest of Raleigh.

Early voting for the March 3 primary runs Feb. 12-28. Races includes nominations for a U.S. Senate seat, and for various congressional, legislative and judicial positions.

The president was asked about his threat that “really bad things” will happen to Iran if it does not strike a deal with the U.S. over its nuclear program. 

When asked by a reporter what the goal of a strike would be, Trump said, “I'm not going to talk to you about that. We're either going to get a deal or it's going to be unfortunate for them.”

He said Iran has 10 to 15 days to reach a deal.

“I would think that would be enough time,” he said.

Javier Milei, Argentina's right-wing president and one of Trump's closest allies in the region, announced he would be willing to deploy members of the country's international humanitarian assistance corps, Cascos Blancos, to support reconstruction efforts in Gaza.

“Our track record in peacekeeping operations is a proven asset that we put at the service of the stabilization force,” Milei said during his speech. Since their creation in 1994, the Cascos Blancos have operated in more than 80 countries.

Milei said Argentina believes “in a diplomacy that assumes risks to achieve peace” and praised Trump's determination to pursue a solution in Gaza.

“Argentina participates in this Council with the conviction that peace requires political will and an institutional framework capable of sustaining real solutions over time. Trump has led by example by mediating the peace agreement in Gaza,” Milei added.

President Donald Trump on Thursday refused to say whether he's seen evidence that aliens had visited earth.

The president was asked directly about “non-human visitors” while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One.

Trump said that former President Barack Obama shared classified information by recently suggesting that aliens are real.

“I don't know if they're real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information,” Trump said of Obama. “He's not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information.”

Trump continued: “I don't have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.”

President Donald Trump said the arrest of former Prince Andrew on suspicion of misconduct related to his ties to Jeffrey Epstein “is a shame,” telling reporters he is an “expert” on the matter and claiming to be “totally exonerated” in the scandal.

The president said to reporters as he prepared to head to Georgia for an event that the arrest of the former prince is “very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family.”

Trump praised his brother, King Charles, and said he “would be coming to our country very soon.”

Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address next week, just months after resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican.

The Democratic rebuttal will immediately follow Trump's address to Congress next Tuesday, offering the party's most high-profile opportunity to deliver a countermessage.

Spanberger, who served three terms in Congress, became Virginia's first female governor earlier this year. She won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families.

The second lady thanked people for “the outpouring of love and excitement” that followed the January announcement by her and her husband, Vice President JD Vance, that she is pregnant with their fourth child.

“Your support means more to us than we can say,” she said Wednesday in a social media post.

But she asked supporters to refrain from sending gifts and to consider helping others instead.

“We would be honored if you would consider making a donation to your local diaper bank to help families in need,” she said.

The newest member of the Vance family, the couple's third son, is due in July. They also have a young daughter.

The Trump administration last week made a $160 million partial payment of its past dues to the United Nations regular budget, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told the Associated Press.

The payment comes as Trump adjourned his first meeting Thursday of the Board of Peace, a new initiative many see as his attempt to replace the U.N. Security Council's role in preventing and ending conflict around the world.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had warned earlier this month that the world body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues, a message clearly directed at the United States.

The U.S. owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.'s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year, according to a U.N. official. The U.S. also owes $1.8 billion for the separate budget for the U.N.'s far-flung peacekeeping operations, and that also will rise.

It wasn't only heads of state who offered major contributions to Trump's Board of Peace.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino outlined a new plan by the world's governing body of football — “soccer” for those who live in the U.S. — to bring new sports opportunities to war-torn Gaza.

“We don't have to rebuild houses or schools or hospitals or roads,” Infantino said. “We also have to rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust. And this is what football, my sport, is about.”

Specifically, FIFA pledged to spend $50 million for a national football stadium in Gaza to hold between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators in addition to a FIFA academy at a cost of $15 million. The organization also vowed to build 50 “FIFA arena mini pitches” and five full-sized pitches at a total cost of $7.5 million.

Workers are restoring an exhibit depicting the history of the nine people once enslaved in Philadelphia amid a legal fight between the city and the Trump Administration.

Mayor Cherelle Parker visited the site Thursday morning and saw the work being done, spokesperson Joe Grace said.

A federal judge had set a Friday deadline for the Interior Department to restore the exhibit on the people enslaved by George Washington at the former President's House on Independence Mall.

Senior U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe issued the deadline Wednesday even as the Justice Department appeals her order to reinstate the exhibit.

In the last of several statements made about the United Nations, Trump ended his inaugural meeting Thursday by hinting that the U.S. -- the world body's largest donor -- will be making more changes to the institution, including to the appearance of its headquarters in New York.

Many world leaders and diplomats have been worried that Trump's new initiative was an attempt to eclipse the U.N. Security Council. But Trump attempted to assuage those concerns, saying that the U.S. will “work again with the United Nations and, bring it back to health.”

He added that his administration plans to “fix up even the building.”

“I like to see beautiful buildings. I like to see buildings fixed up physically, not look like they are in disrepair,” Trump said. “We don't like that. So we're going to do a job with the United Nations.”

Billionaire investor Marc Rowan, a member of the Board of Peace's executive committee, said reconstruction would begin in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.

He said 100,000 homes for 500,000 people, about a quarter of Gaza's population, were initially planned, along with $5 billion of infrastructure. He said “over time,” 400,000 new homes for Gaza's entire population were planned, with $30 billion in infrastructure projects.

He gave no timeline for when construction would begin.

“This is not a problem of money or collateral,” he said. “This is a problem of peace.”

In an hourslong meeting, leaders from various countries, including Peru, Bahrain and Pakistan, spent most of their speaking time praising Trump and what they called his “unprecedented” ability to end conflicts around the world.

Pakistan called him the “savior of South Asia,” while others said that years of U.S. foreign policy efforts by his predecessor failed to do what Trump has done in the last year. 

The glowing remarks that went around from each corner of the globe resembled the same format and tone of Trump's Cabinet meetings, which involve less policy substance and more adulation for the Republican president.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his pledge that Gaza will not be rebuilt until Hamas disarms.

“We agreed with our friends in the United States: There will be no reconstruction of the Gaza Strip before the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip,” he said in a speech to graduating officers at an army base in southern Israel.

“Soon, Hamas will face a dilemma: disarm the easy way — or disarm the hard way. But it will be disarmed, and Gaza will no longer threaten Israel.”

Iran held annual military drills with Russia on Thursday as a second American aircraft carrier drew closer to the Middle East, with both the United States and Iran signaling they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran's nuclear program fizzle out.

Trump said he hopes to reach a deal with Iran, but the talks have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups. Indirect talks held in recent weeks made little visible progress, and one or both sides could be buying time for final war preparations.

Iran's theocracy is more vulnerable than ever, following 12 days of Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites and military last year, as well as mass protests in January that were violently suppressed. But it is still capable of striking Israel and U.S. bases, and has warned that any attack would trigger a regional war.

Despite repeatedly underscoring the importance of preventing and ending conflict, Trump made several pointed remarks during his Board of Peace meeting directed at Iran as the U.S. has amassed a significant military in the region.

The Republican president stood in front of many of the same regional allies who have pressured the U.S. in the last few weeks to not take military action against Iran and once again warned its longtime adversary to come to the table with an acceptable deal or face the consequences.

“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise bad things happen,” Trump said.

The inaugural meeting of Trump's Board of Peace comes perhaps ironically at a time of high tension between the United States and Iran and one of the largest U.S. military buildups in the Middle East in decades, with one aircraft carrier group in the region already and another on the way.

The military moves have coincided with the series of threats Trump has made to Iran if it does not accede to his demands to denuclearize, give up ballistic missiles and halt funding extremist proxy groups.

Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, the leader of the newly-created International Stabilization Force, announced that Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have all pledged troops to the effort. In addition, Egypt and Jordan, which border the Gaza strip, have agreed to train the police and security forces.

“With these first steps, we help bring the security that Gaza needs for a future of prosperity and enduring peace,” Jeffers said.

— This item has been corrected to show that Jeffers is a major general, not a general, and is not retired.

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved Trump's proposal, despite raising concerns at the panel's January meeting. Some commissioners had questioned the lead architect about its “immense” design and scale, roughly twice the size of the White House itself.

Trump's demolition of the East Wing prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment typical for even relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued in federal court to halt construction. And the project is scheduled for additional discussion at a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission, now led by one of Trump's top aides.

— CORRECTS: A previous APNewsAlert erroneously reported that the vote was unanimous; one commissioner abstained.

The vice president nodded to domestic politics heading into the midterm elections in his brief statement to the board. 

“The reason that we're here today is yes to save lives and yes to promote peace, but this creates incredible prosperity for the American people,” Vance said.

He said the countries represented on the board represent “trillions of dollars of investment” in the U.S., and support millions of American jobs by buying goods made in America.

The direct line between the Board of Peace and the U.S. economy is not completely clear. Trump's trade war has strained economic relations with several major U.S. allies.

The Republican president repeated his concerns and criticism of the United Nations during his Board of Peace meeting, saying the UN should have been more involved in conflict-solving than it has been.

But, Trump also said that the U.S. is going “to be working with the United Nations very close.”

“Someday I won't be here. The United Nations will be, I think, is going to be much stronger,” he said. “The Board of Peace is gonna almost be looking over the United Nations, and making sure it runs properly.”

Trump also announced the U.S. is pledging $10 billion for the Board of Peace, but didn't specify what the money will be used for.

“The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room,” Trump said.

CORRECTS: A previous APNewsAlert erroneously reported that the vote was unanimous; one commissioner abstained.

Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait are the countries that are making pledges, Trump said.

“But every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region),” said Trump in thanking the donors.

The amount, while significant, represents a fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory decimated after two years of war.

Shouting out all of the various conflicts he says he solved, Trump mentioned that Iran is “a hotspot right now.” He said his envoys have had “very interesting” meetings with Iranian officials. 

His positive comments come as the two adversaries have leaned into gunboat diplomacy in recent weeks, with nuclear talks between the nations hanging in the balance, Tehran holding drills with Russia and the Americans bringing another aircraft carrier closer to the Mideast.

“It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran, and we have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise bad things happen,” Trump said.

Trump is fueling the rivalry between the two members of his administration considered the frontrunners to replace him as the GOP's next presidential nominee: Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance.

Trump described Vance as “a fantastic man” and a “fantastic talent” before running through the highlights of the vice president's education and marriage and noting that Vance “gets a little bit tough on occasion.”

The president then pivoted to Rubio, calling his leadership style “the opposite extreme. ... Marco does it with a velvet glove, but it's a kill.”

Trump then praised Rubio's performance at the Munich Security Conference this week, joking that if he did his job any better he'd be fired for outshining him.

Much can change in the two years before voters pick the GOP's 2028 presidential nominee. The Constitution bars Trump from seeking a third term.

A week after Trump blasted him as a RINO, short for Republican In Name Only, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt struck a conciliatory tone toward the White House.

“Politics is tough,” Stitt said Thursday at an event sponsored by Politico at the outset of the National Governors Association's annual meeting. “Politics has a way of just beating you down over time so I can't imagine being president of the United States. He's got a tough job to do.”

Stitt is the president of the NGA this year. The group, made up of governors from both parties, is typically one of the few bipartisan organizations to convene in Washington each year.

But this year's meeting has been defined by tensions as Trump has refused to invite two Democratic governors to a business meeting at the White House. Trump said Stitt mischaracterized his position.

Trump says Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the driving force behind renaming the U.S. Institute of Peace the “Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace,” in a move still being contested in courts.

“Marco named it after me,” Trump said Thursday at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace at the former USIP building. Trump said it was a surprise. Rubio is not known to have played a significant role in the renaming, although the State Department is the current custodian.

The USIP was created as an independent entity by Congress in 1984, a status Trump sought to revoke last year when the building was seized from its leadership and nearly all of its employees fired. The changes remain subject to litigation.

In one of many tangents, Trump used his speech at the Board of Peace meeting to reinforce his support for various foreign leaders who are facing or were recently facing a contested election in their country. Many of the endorsements are part of Trump's pattern of embracing autocratic leaders who are part of a global pushback against democratic traditions.

“I'm not supposed to be endorsing people, but I endorse, when I like people. You know, I've had a very good record of endorsing candidates within the United States, but now I endorse foreign leaders, including Viktor Orbán, who's here,” Trump said, mentioning also Milei and the prime minister of Japan.

While Trump convenes his Board of Peace, the nation's governors also are gathering in Washington. Their annual gathering has traditionally been a show of bipartisanship. Trump disrupted norms by not inviting all governors to meetings at the White House. 

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, joined Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, both Republicans, in opening this year's National Governors Association on a panel where they emphasized bipartisanship, regardless of Trump's actions. 

The break with tradition reflects Trump's broader approach in his second term. He has taken a confrontational stance toward some state leaders, withholding federal funds from states that draw his ire and deploying federal troops to cities over the objections of local officials.

Despite the presence Thursday of dozens of world leaders, Trump noted that many countries — including the U.K., France and Canada — have chosen to not yet accept the invitation to the Board of Peace.

“Almost everybody's accepted, and the ones that haven't, will be. And some are playing a little cute — it doesn't work. You can't play cute with me,” Trump said. “But, this is the most prestigious board ever put together.”

In his opening remarks, Trump welcomes the dozens of world leaders in attendance and says many of them have become “incredible friends of mine.”

“Board of Peace is one of the most important and consequential things, I think, that I'll be involved in,” the second-term president said.

Trump and other world leaders have arrived at the first meeting of the Board of Peace.

Flanked by Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump stood in front of leaders from Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Qatar, among others, to take a group photo before discussing the various parts of the president's peace plan for Gaza.

A number of world leaders, including Argentina's Javier Milei, Hungary's Viktor Orbán and others carried red hats with the emblem “USA” and an American flag on the side, and put them on the tables next to their country signs.

The new research tied to one of America's leading banks provides more evidence that Trump‘s push to charge higher taxes on imports is causing economic disruption.

The additional taxes have meant that companies that employ a combined 48 million people in the U.S. — the kinds of businesses Trump had promised to revive — have had to absorb the new expense by passing it along to customers in the form of higher prices, employing fewer workers or accepting lower profits.

“That's a big change in their cost of doing business,” said Chi Mac, business research director of the JPMorganChase Institute, which published the analysis on Thursday.

The research adds to a growing body of economic analyses that counter the administration's claims that foreigners pay the tariffs.

Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin told reporters earlier this week that “at the international level it should above all be the U.N. that manages these crisis situations.” 

The Trump administration on Wednesday pushed back: “This president has a very bold and ambitious plan and vision to rebuild and reconstruct Gaza, which is well underway because of the Board of Peace,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “This is a legitimate organization where there are tens of member countries from around the world.”

And Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said the board is “not talking, it is doing.”

“We are hearing the chattering class criticizing the structure of the board, that it's unconventional, that it's unprecedented,” Waltz said. “Again, the old ways were not working.”

Trump said this week he hopes the board would push the U.N. to “get on the ball.”

“The United Nations has great potential,” he said. “They haven't lived up to the potential.”

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts is one of two federal panels reviewing the president's plans to build a ballroom twice the size of the White House itself on the site of the former East Wing.

The commission, now led by Trump's appointees, is scheduled to further discuss the project at its monthly meeting on Thursday, held over Zoom.

At last month's meeting, some of those commissioners questioned the architect about the “immense” design and scale of the project even as they broadly endorsed the president's vision for the massive expansion.

The U.S. trade deficit slipped modestly in 2025 as Trump upended global commerce by slapping double digit tariffs on imports from most countries.

The gap the between the goods and services the U.S. sells other countries and what it buys from them narrowed to just over $901 billion from $904 billion in 2024, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 

Exports rose 6% last year, and imports rose nearly 5%. The trade gap surged from January-March as U.S. companies tried to import foreign goods ahead of Trump's taxes, then narrowed most of the rest of the year.

Trump's tariffs are a tax paid by U.S. importers and often passed along to their customers as higher prices. But they haven't had as much impact on inflation as economists originally expected. Trump argues that the tariffs will protect U.S. industries, bringing manufacturing back to America and raising money for the U.S. Treasury.

Members of the United Nations Security Council are calling for Gaza ceasefire deal to become permanent, and blasting Israeli efforts to expand control in the West Bank as a threat to prospects of a two-state solution. They met Wednesday on the eve of Trump's first Board of Peace gathering to discuss the future of the Palestinian territories.

The high-level U.N. session in New York was originally scheduled for Thursday but was moved up after Trump announced the board's meeting for the same day, complicating travel plans for diplomats. It is a sign of the potential for overlapping and conflicting agendas between the United Nations' most powerful body and Trump's broader ambitions to broker global conflicts, which have raised concerns in some countries that it may attempt to rival the U.N. Security Council.

Chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream provides details on the Supreme Court's ruling striking down all IEEPA tariffs. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley weighs in.

The Supreme Court on Friday blocked President Donald Trump's use of an emergency law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on most U.S. trading partners, delivering a blow to the president in a case centered on one of his signature economic policies — one he characterized as ""life or death"" for the U.S. economy.

In a 6-3 decision, the justices invalidated Trump's tariffs. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.

""The Framers gave that power to ‘Congress alone' — notwithstanding the obvious foreign affairs implications of tariffs,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. ""And whatever may be said of other powers that implicate foreign affairs, we would not expect Congress to relinquish its tariff power through vague language, or without careful limits.""

Roberts noted that Trump used ""two words"" that were ""separated by 16 others"" in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), ""regulate"" and ""importation,"" to justify that he had the ""independent power to impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time.""

""Those words cannot bear such weight,"" Roberts wrote.

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in November in the case, which centered on Trump's use of the IEEPA to enact his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on most countries, including a 10% global tariff and a set of higher, so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs on certain nations.

In April, Trump declared the U.S. trade deficit a ""national emergency,"" and lawyers for the administration have cited that declaration as the legal basis for invoking IEEPA, which allows the president to respond to ""unusual and extraordinary threats"" when a national emergency has been declared.

The high court agreed to take up the case last fall after lower courts, including the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, blocked Trump's attempt to use IEEPA to enact import duties.

Lower courts pressed the Justice Department to explain why Trump invoked IEEPA when other, more narrowly tailored statutes enacted by Congress more specifically address tariffs — including laws that cap tariffs at certain levels or set timeframes subject to congressional review.

The law authorizes the president to ""regulate … importation"" during a declared national emergency, but it does not mention the word ""tariffs"" — an omission that was at the heart of the hours-long arguments before the high court in November. The absence of the word was a key factor in the majority's decision.

During oral arguments, justices pressed Solicitor General John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the government, on whether IEEPA applies to tariffs or taxation powers and what guardrails — if any — would limit the executive branch should the high court rule in Trump's favor.

Sauer told the justices that IEEPA allows a president to ""regulate"" ""importation"" of goods, which he said was the practical equivalent of a tariff.

But justices, including Trump's conservative appointees, appeared skeptical, pressing Sauer on whether there has ""ever been another instance in which a statute has used that language to confer the power"" Trump seeks.

Other conservative justices questioned whether an ""economic equivalent"" to tariffs — such as sanctions, embargoes, licenses and quotas — could be used by the president under the law.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh raised in a fiery dissent what he said would be ""serious practical consequences"" of the high court's decision in terms of refunding illegitimately imposed tariffs. The majority did not address refunds, an issue now likely to be raised in lower courts.

""The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process is likely to be a ‘mess.'""

Lawyers for the Trump administration have argued in lower courts that the IEEPA allows a president to act in response to ""unusual and extraordinary threats"" and in cases where a national emergency has been declared.

Trump has claimed that deep and ""sustained"" trade deficits amount to a national emergency that is sufficient to trigger his executive powers under the emergency law.

The DOJ urged the Supreme Court to allow the tariffs to remain in place, warning that denying Trump the tariff authority under IEEPA ""would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses.""

Plaintiffs countered that in the 50 years since its passage, the law has never been used by a president to impose tariffs. They also argued that, by the administration's own admission, the trade deficit cited by Trump has persisted for nearly 50 years — a fact they said undermines his claim that there is an ""unusual and extraordinary"" trade emergency.

They argued that authorizing Trump's use of IEEPA to continue his universal tariffs would drastically expand executive power at the expense of the other branches of government.

Judges on a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of International Trade voted unanimously last year to block Trump's tariffs from taking effect, ruling that as commander in chief, Trump does not have ""unbounded authority"" to impose tariffs under the emergency law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit also rejected the administration's use of IEEPA.

Rebeccah Heinrichs analyzes U.S.-Iran nuclear talks and rising military tensions. She discusses Russia-Ukraine peace efforts led by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and the potential for a ceasefire.

For weeks, the U.S. military has quietly amassed what President Donald Trump has described as an ""armada"" in Iran's backyard. Mapped out across the Persian Gulf and beyond, the deployment tells its own story — one of calculated pressure backed by credible capability.

The latest signal of escalation is the movement of the world's largest aircraft carrier, the U.S. Navy's USS Gerald R. Ford, and its strike group from the Caribbean toward the Middle East.

The buildup coincides with indirect negotiations between Washington and Tehran over Iran's disputed nuclear program. Trump has warned that the regime must fully dismantle its nuclear infrastructure — or face consequences.

At the heart of America's force projection is another carrier strike group: USS Abraham Lincoln — a mobile fortress at sea, guarded by destroyers and equipped to unleash precision strikes at a moment's notice. On deck, F-35 fighters and F/A-18 attack aircraft sit within range of dozens of key Iranian military and nuclear targets.

Meanwhile, in the Eastern Mediterranean, destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Roosevelt provide additional strike capability and missile defense coverage — and could potentially assist Israel in defending against any Iranian counterattack.

WORLD'S LARGEST AIRCRAFT CARRIER HEADS TO MIDDLE EAST AS IRAN NUCLEAR TENSIONS SPIKE DRAMATICALLY

Farther south, in the Red Sea, USS Delbert B. Black adds another layer of firepower along one of the world's most important shipping lanes. The Red Sea links the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean through the Suez Canal, a corridor that carries a significant share of global trade and energy supplies. 

A U.S. destroyer there not only protects commercial traffic but also gives Washington the flexibility to respond quickly to threats moving between the Middle East and Europe.

Even closer to Iran's coastline, in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, USS McFaul and USS Mitscher are operating in one of the most strategically sensitive waterways on the planet. Roughly a fifth of the world's oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz each day. Their presence signals that the U.S. can both defend that vital choke point and, if necessary, strike Iranian targets from close range.

Beyond naval forces, U.S. air power is spread across multiple Middle Eastern bases, giving commanders the ability to strike, defend and sustain operations quickly.

Several types of combat aircraft are operating from regional bases, including F-15s, F-16s and the radar-evading F-35. The A-10 specializes in close-air support missions against armored threats.

Those fighters are backed by a network of support aircraft. KC-135 and KC-46 tankers refuel jets midair, allowing them to fly farther and stay aloft longer. EA-18G electronic warfare aircraft can jam enemy radar and communications. E-3 Sentry aircraft serve as airborne command centers, tracking threats across wide areas. P-8 Poseidon planes patrol and monitor maritime activity.

Additionally, heavy transports — including C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster aircraft — move troops and equipment, while MQ-9 Reaper drones provide surveillance and can carry precision weapons. The assets give U.S. commanders flexibility to operate across air, sea and land.

Taken together, the air and naval deployments create overlapping strike capability, missile defense coverage and control over major maritime routes. For Iran, it means U.S. forces are not concentrated in a single vulnerable location — they are distributed, layered and positioned to operate from multiple directions at once.

Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan reports on the deadly Northern California avalanche that killed eight skiers as the search continues for one missing person on ‘Special Report.'

At least six victims have been identified in the tragic avalanche incident on Tuesday that killed up to nine people in Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, California.

Six of the victims were among a group of outdoor-loving mothers who regularly traveled together. A joint statement from the affected families identified the women as Kate Vitt, Carrie Atkin, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, and sisters Caroline Sekar and Liz Clabaugh.

""We are devastated beyond words,"" the families said in the statement. ""Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women."" 

All the women were described as ""mothers, wives, and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.""

Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said during a news conference Wednesday that authorities had told the families the mission had shifted from rescue to recovery.

""They were on their way back to camp when the avalanche actually hit,"" Moon said, adding that it took search and rescue crews hours to find the first few survivors.

The group of women, most of whom resided near California, were reportedly seasoned backcountry skiers. They were reportedly well-trained, fully prepared, and equipped with avalanche safety gear.

""They were passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains,"" the families' statement said. ""They lived in the Bay Area, Idaho, and the Truckee–Tahoe region.""

They expressed being ""heartbroken"" and said they are doing their best to support one another and their families in the way they believe the mothers would have wanted.

McAlister Clabaugh, the brother of Sekar and Clabaugh, told The New York Times that Sekar, 45, was a mother of two who lived in San Francisco. 

Liz Clabaugh, 52, served as a graduate nurse residency program coordinator at St. Luke's Health System in Boise, Idaho, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Vitt, a San Francisco resident, held positions at SiriusXM and Pandora, according to her LinkedIn profile, and was a mother to two children.

Several members of the group were also connected to Sugar Bowl Academy, an elite boarding and day school for competitive skiers and snowboarders that has counted multiple Olympians among its alumni.

""This tragedy has affected each and every one of us. The depth of support for the families whose lives have been changed forever reminds us of how special this community is,"" Executive Director Stephen McMahon said.

The Feb. 17 avalanche near Castle Peak in the Sierra Nevada mountains became the deadliest in California's history.

Authorities reported that the tragedy involved a group of 15 backcountry skiers, including 11 clients and four guides, on a multiday guided expedition organized by Blackbird Mountain Guides.

Eight people were confirmed dead, with one additional person presumed dead.

""We are profoundly grateful for the extensive rescue efforts by Nevada County Search and Rescue, Tahoe Nordic Search and Rescue and all of the authorities involved, and for the outpouring of support from the Tahoe community and beyond,"" the families said in the statement.

""We are heartbroken and are doing our best to care for one another and our families in the way we know these women would have wanted,"" they added. 

To continue recovery efforts for the final missing individual, authorities announced Thursday that all National Forest lands and trails around Castle Peak will be closed for roughly one month, from Feb. 20 through March 15.

Authorities emphasized that emergency personnel may need to use snow machines, aircraft and even explosives during the operations.

""Due to the current instability of the snowpack and need to prioritize first responder access to the area, members of the public are prohibited from entering the closure area during search and rescue operations,"" the U.S. Forest Service-Tahoe National Forest said.

""It is our top priority to ensure the safety of first responders during this recovery mission and aid in the return of each victim to their families,"" Tahoe National Forest Supervisor Chris Feutrier added in a statement. ""Our deepest condolences to the families that have lost their loved ones from this tragic incident. Our sincere appreciation to all first responders, law enforcement and partners that are supporting this recovery.""

The avalanche marks the deadliest in the U.S. since 1981, when 11 climbers were killed on Mount Rainier in Washington state. It is also the second deadly slide near Castle Peak this year after a person on a snowmobile was buried in January.

Retail mogul Les Wexner's lawyer scolded him over the lengthy answers given during a House oversight committee hearing on Wednesday. 

The video of Wexner's nearly five-hour deposition, where he was questioned about his association with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was released Thursday, and Wexner's lawyer could be heard telling him to tighten up his answers. 

“I'll f***ing kill you if you answer another question in more than five words,” Michael Levy whispered into Wexner's ear. 

The remark came after Wexner was asked how Epstein could have other clients when managing Wexner's extensive wealth portfolio, to which he began explaining the breakdown of his employees who manage his personal finances.

Before telling Wexner to answer briefly, Levy had to continue reminding Wexner to answer the question and not tell stories. 

Questions about President Donald Trump's relationship with Epstein also came up during the deposition. 

“I would go to some of the Victoria's Secret fashion shows because it was very important to the brand,” Wexner said. “At some of the fashion shows, Jeffrey was there, and [at] some, Trump was there. Trump would always introduce himself to me. I always thought it was kind of odd … because [Trump] had nothing to do with fashion.” 

Wexner did not place Epstein and Trump together at the same fashion show, “I have no specific recollection.” He also said he didn't think of the two as friends and said Epstein “held him out as a friend.” 

Wexner was subpoenaed to testify before the committee after his name appeared over 200 times in the Epstein files. Wexner answered questions from his home in New Albany, Ohio. 

Throughout the deposition, Wexner maintained that he was unaware of Epstein's involvement with underage girls and said their association ended when Epstein was being investigated in 2006. 

Wexner, the founder of LBrands, which owns clothing lines such as Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch, called Epstein a “conman” and said he was not aware of Epstein's crimes.

LES WEXNER TESTIFIES HE WAS ‘CONNED' IN EPSTEIN RELATIONSHIP BUT DID ‘NOTHING WRONG'

The 88-year-old billionaire explained that Epstein started managing his personal finances in the 1980s. He said Epstein called the services “favors” in a con to gain Wexner's trust. 

Once the Epstein files were released and Wexner had time to review the finances managed by the late financier, Wexner said Epstein had stolen millions of dollars from his family.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court handed President Donald Trump a major loss on Friday, striking down his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs as unlawfully implemented.

The high court ruled 6-3 that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. The ruling marks a significant setback for the president's signature economic agenda item and is a rare rebuke for Trump from the justices after a series of wins at the high court over the last year.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, finding that the law Trump cited to impose his “Liberation Day” tariffs on most countries and on Canada, Mexico, and China over the fentanyl crisis does not confer the sweeping power he claims it does.

“Based on two words separated by 16 others in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA—'regulate' and ‘importation'—the President asserts the independent power to impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time,” Roberts wrote. “Those words cannot bear such weight.”

“When Congress grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints,” Roberts wrote for the majority opinion. “It did neither here.”

Roberts's majority ruling was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Kagan, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Jackson each wrote their own opinions concurring with the judgment.

The three justices who dissented from the ruling were Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh, all conservatives. Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Alito and Thomas, while Thomas filed a separate dissenting opinion as well.

“Properly read, IEEPA does not draw such an odd distinction between quotas and embargoes on the one hand and tariffs on the other,” Kavanaugh wrote for the dissent. “Rather, it empowers the President to regulate imports during national emergencies with the tools Presidents have traditionally and commonly used, including quotas, embargoes, and tariffs.”

“The Court today nonetheless concludes otherwise and holds that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs to deal with the declared drug trafficking and trade deficit emergencies,” he added.

During oral arguments in November 2025, the justices appeared highly skeptical of the Trump administration's arguments that the IEEPA authorized the president to implement the sweeping tariffs.

Trump used the IEEPA to implement his sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” for most countries, with a 10% baseline rate and higher rates for select countries, along with his tariffs aimed at Canada, Mexico, and China over their role in the fentanyl crisis. Other tariffs imposed by the president on aluminum, steel, and cars, among other products, are not affected by the ruling, because they were implemented using a different law.

The two consolidated cases before the high court, Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, were appealed after a trio of losses for the Trump administration in two federal district courts and one federal appeals court.

In its arguments to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department defended the president's signature economic policy as a matter of Trump exerting his foreign policy, arguing in a brief that striking down the tariffs as unlawful would “effectively disarm the President in the highly competitive arena of international trade.”

The companies suing over the tariffs argued they were unlawfully implemented, and that the IEEPA does not grant the president the power to tariff, noting that the term “tariff” is not present in the text of the statute.

During oral arguments, Roberts grappled with how the imposition of the sweeping tariffs under the IEEPA balanced the president's broad authority dealing with foreign powers and Congress's inherent taxing power.

Sotomayor plainly said she did not “understand this argument” from the DOJ that the tariffs did not impose a tax, a power given to Congress under the Constitution, during the November arguments, while Gorsuch expressed concern over future uses of such a sweeping tariff power.

SUPREME COURT JUSTICES PIT PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC POWERS AGAINST FOREIGN POLICY POWERS IN TARIFFS ARGUMENT

After oral arguments, the Trump administration projected confidence over the outcome of the case but also stated it could recreate most of the sweeping tariffs using other laws if the high court struck down the ones levied using the IEEPA.

The ruling marks the first in a set of cases the Supreme Court will decide this term slated to deal with the president's powers and policies. The high court will also issue a ruling in the coming months with implications for the president's firing power within the executive branch and Trump's executive order regarding birthright citizenship.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Women don't want to just be ‘girlbosses' or ‘tradwives'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/premium/4462412/girlboss-tradwife-motherhood-families-children/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 10:15:38 GMT","



In recent years, the notion that motherhood is binary has gained significant traction. As a quick glance at social media will confirm, there are seemingly two competing forces at play: that of the “girlboss” and the “tradwife.” For those who fully subscribe to one, they find passionate allies to commiserate with. The sisterhood is strong among those who prize careers and corporate lives or those who prefer what is presented as domestic bliss. But lost alongside these rigid categories are the many women who fit neither mold. There are millions of mothers in America who choose to do both, or must do both, out of necessity. And for some reason, modern society can quickly view these “partial” commitments by another word: inadequacy.

The aforementioned scourge of social media has done much to introduce strict adherence to certain lifestyles as some sort of ultimate virtue. If you're a girlboss whose goal is making money and advancing in your career, well, you're really doing something with your life. If you're a stay-at-home mother focused on making sourdough bread from scratch and raising children, well, you're really doing something with your life. If you're doing something other than that, including a combination of both, you're not fully committed. And that in itself is unacceptable. Or so says the pressure-filled digital landscape.

But what if the “girlboss” and “tradwife” crowds are the minorities? What if those of us who blend the two are the real, silent majority? From all indications, this appears to be true. 

In February 1963, Betty Friedan's book, The Feminine Mystique, was published. Friedan's book greatly affected the American populace and helped to usher in the second wave of feminism. Friedan introduced “the problem that has no name.” This so-called problem? That of the housewife. Namely, her existence.

Friedan wrote, “Can the problem that has no name be somehow related to the domestic routine of the housewife? Is she trapped simply by the enormous demands of her role as modern housewife: wife, mistress, mother, nurse, consumer, cook, chauffeur; expert on interior decoration, child care, appliance repair, furniture refinishing, nutrition, and education? … We can no longer ignore that voice within women that says: ‘I want something more than my husband and my children and my home.'”

There is nothing wrong with a wife and mother doing and achieving things outside the home. But Friedan, and countless others who sang her praises, acted as if being a housewife is not enough, not fulfilling, and painfully stifles women as a matter of course. This mindset, this about-face, did not bring about a positive change. The feminism of the 1960s and 1970s did much to permanently alter not just American life, but how we measure women and their worth. Unlike what we've been told repeatedly, these alterations were not improvements.

Fast-forward to the 2020s and the computerization of everything. Neither women nor men could have anticipated just how much the online world would impact our offline one. Among many other things, the internet is used to spread ideals, foster a sense of community, as well as mock and shame. The social and emotional contagion that is naturally part of the online world does much to influence women. There is a lot of content about being a girlboss in a male-dominated world. There seems to be just as much content about being a tradwife in a world that urges you to be a girlboss. The display of a false binary reinforces the idea that not fully giving yourself to one means you are falling short as a mother and woman. These two categories are culturally recognizable archetypes. But it begs the question, are they more internet subcultures than statistically dominant identities? Just how many mothers are able to exist as either a top-tier career woman or the ultimate of all supermoms? Believing we, as mothers, must pursue or excel at one of them is daunting, to say the least. 

While there is plenty of internalized pressure on women, external pressure to perform exists, too. And sometimes, it is the outside pressure and comparisons that form the bulk of often unspoken inner dilemmas. In October 2023, the Journal of Medical Internet Research published a study titled “Understanding the Tensions of ‘Good Motherhood' Through Women's Digital Technology Use.” The technologies in question, both social media and parenting apps, can and do greatly impede some women as they attempt to meet societal standards.

Among the principal findings: “The discourse of good motherhood permeated participants' responses as they described their experiences when encountering ‘perfect' images of motherhood posted on social media. Although such instances were acknowledged by the participants in this study as performative, the bombardment of these idealized images appeared to impact their self-perception and led to moments of self-critique accompanied by espoused feelings of guilt or anxiety.”

Motherhood is enough on its own without seeing the so-called perfection others choose to present to the world. This digital onslaught does a lot to discourage mothers.

Emily C. Klear, Director of Adult Psychotherapy Services at The Family Institute of Northwestern University said of these burdens, “It puts us in a position of competition, as women. Or that there is … some sort of ‘right way' or ‘wrong way' to be a mother.”

In this world of online oversaturation, it's easy to feel as though you don't measure up. And that is especially true of women when they first become mothers. The universe of motherhood is completely unknown at the time one starts out on that journey. Seeking help and advice is only natural. But it seems that increasingly, looking for guidance can be a negative experience. Instead of support, one can quickly find ways you are mothering wrong. This colors the early days of motherhood and beyond.

The pressure only deepens when a mother has to decide if she'll work while raising her children. It's not an easy choice, whether she works because she wants to, needs to, or both. Either way, it becomes a defining moment in her life. Women in general are free to choose their paths, but biology ensures trade-offs that men will never face. That's not a negative. It's just a basic biological reality that must be accepted.

If you pay attention to the narratives from both camps, you'll see unspoken calls to fit into a certain framework. The overarching reason for contention between the two versions of motherhood almost solely relates to employment. But the real-world data about both what women want and where they actually end up defy each side's loud demands. Once again, these lifestyles include both those created by planned desire and those driven by financial or familial necessity.

An Employment Characteristics of Families Summary released by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics in April 2025 shows a country with diverse family makeups. The data show that families are certainly not one-size-fits-all: “In 2024, 32.7 million families, or nearly two-fifths of all families, included children under age 18. At least one parent was employed in 91.4 percent of families with children, down from 91.9 percent in 2023. Among married-couple families with children, 97.5 percent had at least one employed parent in 2024, and in 66.5 percent of these families both parents were employed. Among families maintained by fathers, 84.8 percent of fathers were employed, down from 86.5 percent in 2023. This was a greater share than the 75.4 percent of mothers who were employed in families maintained by mothers, little changed from the prior year.” These figures reveal the black-and-white, but they don't show what mothers want when it comes to employment. 

A report by the Institute for Family Studies released in November 2025 reached this conclusion: “Despite recent fluctuations in women's employment, the long-term trajectory shows that more married mothers of young children are working full time than ever before, even though full-time work is not the preferred option for most.” The breakdown is as follows: “Only 39% of married mothers with children under five say their ideal is full-time work. 40% prefer part-time work. 20% would prefer not to work for pay at all.”

The big flashing desire this data points to? A word called flexibility. There is nothing that says a majority of mothers want full-time work. At the same time, it's clear what might be considered the “tradwife crowd” is not a majority, either. It's almost as if mothers have a complicated relationship with employment and what it looks like for them personally. And there is nothing in these figures to suggest mothers who do work want to abandon their biological duties as bearers and carers of children. Painting mothers with a broad brushstroke is never a good idea. It is a much more complex situation than culture warriors on either side of the political aisle will admit.

The IFS report also found that mothers who work outside the home prioritize certain policies that would help them the most. The top three are paid family and parental leave, flexible work arrangements, and a strengthened child tax credit. While the report shows government-subsidized child care is on the list, it “does not rank among mothers' top priorities—especially compared to policies that give families more time and financial stability.” Again, flexibility is key. The freedom to tailor work-life balance to each individual family naturally induces stability. Every couple with children is looking for ways to not only provide for them and their offspring, but to make it work as seamlessly as possible.

One trend likely to stick around is the so-called “side-hustle wife.” This is a mother whose main priority is raising her children. But because of financial needs and/or personal ambition, work is also part of her life. That work can involve a part-time position outside the home or a work-from-home situation. Either way, it's a blending of traditional motherhood with children as the top focus alongside work to supplement the family income. This can come from a desire to make the family's lifestyle more achievable or take some pressure off the husband/father as the breadwinner. These women don't fit perfectly into either the girlboss or tradwife categories. They occupy both at different times during the day and week.

In 2025, the American Family Survey's annual polling data on affordability revealed that 71% of respondents said raising children is unaffordable, compared to 14% who said it is affordable. The breakdown along party lines is wide but perhaps not as enormous as expected: “In 2025, about 82% of Democrats viewed raising children as unaffordable, compared to 64% of independents and Republicans — an 18 percentage-point gap.” Democrats see it as a bigger issue. But others, including Republicans, are concerned as well. And this is one area where Republicans can make up some major ground. 

Far too often, the Republican Party is presented as anti-woman. This is, of course, not true, but is used as a powerful narrative by the legacy media and online provocateurs. One reason for this campaign is the traditional pro-life stance held by Republicans. Another is the promotion of marriage and the nuclear family. Women and men are naturally encouraged to have and raise children. Parental age is sharply on the rise, and fertility rates are on a downward trend. These are problems not just in the present but long-term sense. Republicans are right to address both. But as they do, it's important to recognize a few key things: Many families struggle to make ends meet, some mothers work out of need or want, and working mothers are not failures. The Republican Party as a whole, and right-leaning voters individually, would do well not to castigate women for straddling both the mother and boss/employee lanes. Doing so dismisses real-world stresses and ignores our shared economic reality.

The majority of women still lean Democratic, even if the margin is somewhat slim. And according to the Pew Research Center, “at all age levels, parents are more Republican-oriented than non-parents.” If Republicans want to maintain the support of parents and draw more women in general to their side, they should take a softer approach. This doesn't require abandoning honesty or forsaking responsibility, but it does require a greater understanding of the real-world situations mothers and families are in. 

We live in a society that is desperate to throw people into categories. This is partly due to our preoccupation with politics. It also has much to do with our consumption of the online world and, however wrongly, what people think of us. The truth is, most mothers do not live in strict ideological categories either promoted by secular society or used as a response to those societal demands. Mothers live in kitchens and sometimes carpools, offices, nurseries, homeschool classrooms and public school drop-off lanes. Mothers, no matter their path, are often surrounded by half-finished to-do lists. Mothers make trade-offs daily. This is not because they are confused about their values, but it's because life demands compromise. Too often, women are told we can “have it all.” This suggests we can achieve a perfect record in both motherhood and career at the same time. This is not possible. In reality, “having it all” looks like juggling a host of commitments and shifting priorities around the moment, and the most important people in our lives.

SURROGACY IS BOOMING, BUT ETHICAL QUESTIONS REMAIN 

The call from outside observers for total, unbending commitment to career or to domesticity misunderstands the nature of motherhood altogether. For most of us, we are simply trying our best. This may not satisfy onlookers, but the only real test lies with the husbands who love and support us and the children who depend on us. What they think, and how their needs are met, is what matters. 

The competing camps of motherhood may look at the majority in the middle and say we are not achieving. But most women are not failing to live up to an ideal. They are already living the real thing.

President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would direct all relevant agencies to release government files related to aliens and any information “connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.” 

Trump cited a heightened interest in extraterrestrials as the reason for his new order in a Truth Social post. 

“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,” Trump said. 

The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office at the War Department is the defense office in charge of detecting and analyzing UAPs and determining possible risk. NASA also has a department dedicated to researching UAPs. 

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) backed Trump's move and called it a “bipartisan thing.”

“I grew up watching The X-Files. If he's going to release all of The X-Files, I think that could be a bipartisan thing,” Fetterman told Jesse Watters on Fox News, saying he believes alien life exists given the trillions of planets in the universe.

During a recent interview, former President Barack Obama said aliens are real but that they aren't being held at Area 51 as online discourse has suggested for years and has been depicted in films and TV shows. Obama later clarified that during his tenure, he saw no evidence of aliens. 

Trump called Obama's comments “a big mistake” and said the former president was disclosing classified information. 

While Trump now said he will make information on E.T.s public, he joked about the possibility early in the day, saying he would need to do so to get Obama “out of trouble.” He also joked that while he doesn't know whether aliens exist, he knows “illegal aliens” are real.

TRUMP JOKES OBAMA MADE ‘BIG MISTAKE' INSISTING ALIENS ARE REAL: ‘CLASSIFIED INFORMATION'

Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, previously said that the president already has a speech prepared to announce information about life beyond Earth. She said the president was “coy” when she asked about the topic.

A reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt about the supposed speech, but Leavitt said she is not aware of such a thing but that she would “check in” with the president's speech writers.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) criticized President Donald Trump on Thursday night for announcing he would be releasing government files related to aliens. He categorized the decision as an attempt to divert attention from the Epstein files.

Massie's criticism and Trump's announcement about releasing government files about aliens came on the same day Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, was arrested in the United Kingdom due to suspected misconduct while in public office in connection with the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. 

Massie, along with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), has been one of Congress's most fervent supporters in demanding transparency regarding the Epstein files. Khanna introduced the Epstein Files Transparency Act on July 15, 2025, and Massie cosponsored it on the same day. In the days, weeks, and months following the bill's introduction, 23 other Democrats joined on to co-sponsor the bill.

South Dakota Republicans worry that she might return.

Updated at 1:00 p.m. ET on February 20, 2026.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has faced intense scrutiny from Republicans and calls for her firing from Democrats since the January 24 shooting of Alex Pretti by Customs and Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. Now Noem's tenuous standing with the Trump White House is creating concern in her home state of South Dakota that she might leave the Cabinet to challenge Senator Mike Rounds in the state's June Republican primary.

Political allies of Rounds have begun preparing for this scenario, even though they remain skeptical that Noem will actually make the move, three people familiar with the discussions told me. To get into the race, Noem would have to register for the primary and collect the 2,171 supportive signatures statewide by the end of next month. A Noem adviser told me today that she has no plans to leave. But Noem could have an incentive to seek elective office if Democrats remain on track to win back control of the House and launch investigations into her tenure at the Department of Homeland Security. A Senate seat would give her both a professional staff and a fundraising platform to help defend herself.

“It's something people are talking about across the state,” one Republican involved in South Dakota's politics told me; this person, like others I spoke with, requested anonymity to discuss the rumors. “And based on everything I've been hearing, Mike Rounds would handily win that race.”

In recent weeks, Noem has ceded some of her public-leadership role overseeing immigration-enforcement operations, and President Trump has relied more on the White House “border czar” Tom Homan to lead those efforts. White House officials have grown frustrated with her performance as Republican midterm strategists raise alarms about the political damage her deportation strategy is doing to the party's chances. One person familiar with the discussions told me that Noem's position in the Cabinet is no longer secure, even though the president has not yet moved against her and has repeatedly praised her in public comments.

Read: Battles are raging inside the Department of Homeland Security

The situation has been complicated by the refusal of congressional Democrats to vote for a new budget for Noem's department, which has caused a partial government shutdown that is expected to last at least into next week. Republicans say that Democratic calls for Noem's removal make Trump pushing her out in the immediate future less likely. In his second term, Trump has been deeply reluctant to allow political pressure to force him into firing Cabinet members.

Several weeks ago, before the Pretti shooting, Republicans in South Dakota learned that pollsters were asking voters whom they would prefer in a matchup between Rounds and Noem, two people familiar with the calls told me, adding that they don't know who is paying for the polling and have not seen the results.

The possibility of Noem running against Rounds has also prompted discussion among advisers to the president about possibly waiting to make a change to DHS leadership until after next month's filing deadline, according to one person familiar with the discussions. Others have been supportive of a move. “Mike Rounds is so unpopular amongst Republican primary voters, he'd lose to a dead dog,” a national Republican strategist told me. The senator's allies pushed back against that characterization. Rounds, 71, has successfully run statewide as a Republican four times since 2014, winning two primaries and two general elections.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told me in a text message that it would not be appropriate for a government spokesperson to comment on a story about Noem's political future. Another adviser to Noem told me that her team had not polled the race.

Rounds's Senate office did not respond to a request for comment. The White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told me in a statement, “President Trump has assembled the most talented and America First cabinet and staff in history,” before listing off some of the administration's accomplishments.

Rounds and Noem, both former governors of South Dakota, have never been particularly close and have occasionally clashed in public. After Noem published a book that describes her decision to kill her family dog after she determined that it was dangerous and untrainable, Rounds was notably outspoken in his criticism. “I don't see how it helps,” he said of her description of the incident. “These dogs become a member of a family, you know. People identify with that.”

Trump and Rounds have also clashed, particularly over Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election, which Rounds described as “fair”; Trump incorrectly maintains that he won the election. But Trump endorsed Rounds over the summer—“HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” the president posted on social media. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the senior senator from South Dakota, is a close ally of Rounds and would likely back him over Noem.

Another possible route for Noem is to run again for the U.S. House seat that she held from 2011 to 2019. That seat will be vacated next year by Representative Dusty Johnson, who has announced that he is running for governor. Noem has also expressed interest in the past about being selected as a running mate on a Republican ticket or mounting her own presidential campaign.

An earlier version of this article misidentified the four statewide elections that Rounds has won since 2014. They were all connected to his Senate campaigns, not his runs for governor.

The editor of the recently scrapped Book World believes in serving subscribers, not data.

What does it mean to subscribe to something? Whether we mean a belief or a magazine, the definition is complicated. I began subscribing to The New Yorker when I was a sophomore in college; more than 30 years later, I have yet to stop and I feel strongly that I never will. Yet during some of those years—okay, many of them—the weekly issues have piled up in my home and gone mostly unread between biannual days of bingeing and purging. If these reading habits could somehow be converted into digital clicks, the resulting “traffic report” might look like I don't want the product at all.

Earlier this month, I was one of a great number of people laid off from The Washington Post. Before the past year and a half of staggering self-inflicted wounds—culminating in the firing of hundreds of journalists, including war reporters, arts critics, and the entire Sports and Books sections—the paper had survived and briefly thrived by emphasizing digital subscriptions. This strategy has become essential in the dwindling newspaper industry, given steep declines in revenue from print advertising. I started at the paper in late summer 2022 as the editor of Book World, a section that the Post was re-expanding, restoring a stand-alone print review that had been shut down in 2009. I'd spent 11 wonderful years on the Books desk at The New York Times, and I knew that moving to any other paper at this point in history was a risky proposition, but the chance to bolster general-interest literary coverage in this country was too tempting to pass up.

Within a year or two, my leap of faith seemed to be vindicated: All signs pointed to us gaining (and keeping) readers at Book World. We were publishing more and attracting a bigger audience. We heard regularly from readers, many of whom still sat with the physical Sunday paper; some let us know they were especially loyal to our staff critics and often started scans of the Post by flipping to their work. I feel very passionate about the importance of arts coverage and criticism, but my thoughts about building and maintaining an audience apply just as well to international news, local journalism, and reporting on climate change, other areas that are vital to the mix of any serious newspaper even if the number of clicks on them can be modest.

I've sometimes gotten the sense, emanating from the precincts of mass media where grand strategy is handled, that publications believe that their potential audience is the total number of people with an internet connection. This is false not just as reality but even as metaphor. No audience is infinite, or even close (especially a paying audience), and you must choose whom you court to be part of it—and how you court them.

Many discussions of strategy now involve the idea of “meeting readers where they are.” On one level, this is a realistic acknowledgment that, put simply, it's not 1972. Editors and writers frequently complain that their work isn't getting placed on the homepage or near the top of an app, and it's true that even marginally more time in a prominent spot helps boost readership. Other levers are also available. Papers can and very obviously do influence reader behavior, but it's fashionable among journalism execs to stress reader influence instead. “Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success,” the Post's owner, Jeff Bezos, recently said, perfectly encapsulating this view: “The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.” This philosophy doesn't merely counsel paying attention to what readers respond to—something any sane 21st-century journalist does; it essentially makes the data your editorial staff.

Read: The murder of The Washington Post

I don't believe in this inevitability. As a reader of many distinctive publications, I want to be led by them. What makes them special is where they choose to take me, and how much I trust them to do that. In a subscription business, you are not just trying to reach new people, crucial as that is; you are also trying to retain those you already have. Sizable, steadfast subscriber bases are hard-won, and keeping them involves the fulfillment of an unspoken contract as well as the actual one that paying readers sign. I expect publications I support to attempt growth without radically changing the focus or quality of the work or pivoting to some get-traffic-quick scheme every time readership dips over a holiday weekend.

Even more important than retaining loyalists, as the Post's recent history proves, is not deliberately antagonizing them or your own talent. Working at the Post after Bezos nixed its endorsement of Kamala Harris in 2024 was an almost painfully perfect microcosm of living in America during that time—for managerial as much as political reasons. While the Trump administration placed arrogant agitators in positions of leadership over seasoned professionals, three or four people at the top of the Post made decisions that many of their employees and customers viewed as misguided, actively destructive, or both. Even allowing for the industry headwinds facing the paper and the necessity of painful change, I found it difficult to see what was happening as stewardship, exactly. Over the past year, I've far too often had reason to think of the popular meme from The Simpsons in which Principal Skinner wonders if he's out of touch and concludes: “No, it's the children who are wrong.” The top brass of the third-biggest newspaper in the country seem to have decided, “No, it's our readers and journalists who are wrong.”

In the days since the latest and largest disaster at the Post, I have sometimes asked myself (even more loudly than I normally do) if I defend arts criticism simply because it has so enriched and defined my personal and professional life. Maybe I'm in a bubble, conditions have irrevocably changed, and criticism, in the eyes of a mass audience, is dead. Maybe most readers really do feel it's been satisfactorily replaced by the Tomatometer and Amazon customer reviews and friends on Goodreads. Really, maybe they do.

I don't think readers are wrong, or that certain trends aren't real; I think that important guardians of the media often misunderstand them. I'm not someone who stands athwart the internet yelling “Stop!” That would mean getting run over, and I'm not interested in martyring myself or the culture of criticism for the sake of a fully analog past that is not returning. I live online as much as anyone else. Yet I do believe that the subscription model is not just the answer to a revenue problem, but an asset to the work itself—an opportunity to know more about your readers, their commitments, and their curiosities, and to reward them rather than condescend to them or, worse, punish them.

The Iranian regime fears its domestic opposition enough to seek to silence it.

Killing thousands of protesters last month was apparently not enough for the Islamic Republic, which followed up by arresting prominent internal critics, too. The Iranian regime wouldn't have gone after these figures if it didn't fear them—perhaps even as much as it fears the royalist movement that has surged around former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. Its sensitivity about both groups is a reminder that uniting them remains the Iranian opposition's best move, if only activists would take it.

On January 31, the domestic oppositionists Abdollah Momeni, Mehdi Mahmoudian, and Vida Rabbani were swept up and sent to prisons in northern Iran, far from their Tehran residences. They were released on bail on February 17. Mahmoudian's case attracted international attention because he is the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of Jafar Panahi's 2025 film, It Was Just an Accident. All three figures were once associated with the regime's internal movement for incremental reform; all three long ago abandoned that stance to advocate the wholesale transformation of the system instead.

Last month, the three arrested activists had joined two like-minded figures—former Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh and the Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi, both in prison—in calling for a democratic transition and free elections for a constituent assembly. In an interview with BBC Persian, Mahmoudian called on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to resign. Hassan Asadi Zeydabadi, a lawyer who represents Rabbani and Momeni, told me that his clients were most likely arrested because they advocated for Khamenei's dismissal and because “the regime wants to prevent the formation of a national opposition inside the country.”

Arash Azizi: The Islamic Republic will not last

Iran's regime still does have a reformist faction that functions as its loyal opposition. The reformists participate in the political system as elected representatives; they gently push some of the autocracy's boundaries but largely defer to the authority of the supreme leader. Iran's president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is a reformist. He owes his presidency to the active support of the Iranian Reformist Front. On February 8 or 9, that organization's leader, Azar Mansouri, was arrested alongside several of her colleagues, including Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, and detained until their release on bail on February 13 and 14. During the Women, Life, Freedom protests of 2022, regime leaders held meetings with Mansouri, ostensibly to address the people's demands. This time, it accused her of “undermining national unity” and “coordinating with enemy propaganda.”

The Islamic Republic has the jitters. Anahita Hosseini-Lewis, an expert on Iran at Birkbeck, University of London, told me that the system is suffering from an “acute existential anxiety.” In part, that's because the imperative to replace the Islamic Republic has become something close to a consensus across the Iranian opposition, and the regime's operatives know it. Last month, a number of regime critics inside the country, including Mansouri and other reformists, embraced an initiative called the National Assembly for the Salvation of Iran, which planned to set forth a charter of demands for fundamental change. The initiative had hardly gotten off the ground but was likely the catalyst for the arrests, a source close to the reformists told me, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

As Hosseini-Lewis pointed out, the Islamic Republic has a “long-standing strategy of preventing domestically rooted alternatives from taking shape.” Its effort to stanch domestic movements and silence their leaders has been successful enough that many Iranians now look abroad, to Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah of Iran, who hasn't been to Iran since 1978. But some inside Iran worry both that the royalist movement has become brittle and non-inclusive, and that the former crown prince lacks experience inside the country.

Mohammad Karim Asayesh, an urban activist in Tehran, told me that he knows Momeni, Mahmoudian, and Rabbani, and prefers them to exiled leaders such as Pahlavi, whom he considers inept and undemocratic.

“Unlike Pahlavi, these three have a history of activism inside the country and they've paid a price for it,” he said. “They've harbored an ethical and responsible politics, have remained patriotic. And the fact that they are living in Iran means that they are more attuned to the realities of the Iranian people compared to Pahlavi, who hasn't lived in Iran since he was 18.”

The three arrested figures are also all in their 40s, which makes them significantly younger than most Iranian political eminences and more connected to the country's youth.

The filmmaker Jafar Panahi told me that he got to know Mahmoudian when they were in Tehran's Evin Prison together, and that he particularly admired the sense of responsibility Mahmoudian showed toward others in captivity. The screenwriter has already spent nine years of his life behind bars and is “a rare ethical witness,” Panahi said.

But Hosseini-Lewis cautioned me that the three former reformists don't “currently function as a viable anti-regime leadership, either individually or collectively.” An activist in Tehran, who asked that I withhold her name for safety reasons, told me of Momeni, Rabbani, and Mahmoudian, “Their courage is admirable, and they've taken the right positions. But the regime has created mistrust toward everybody, and their reformist pasts limit their prospects.”

Iran's opposition spans a wide gamut—reformist, republican, and monarchist; domestic and international. Forging a broad coalition across these tendencies seems like an obvious necessity but has so far proved elusive. Amir Hossein Ganjbakhsh, a political activist based in the United States, advocates for bringing Pahlavi's supporters together with those of Mirhossein Mousavi, the former prime minister who became the symbolic leader of the Green Movement and has languished under house arrest since 2011. Mousavi started out an ardent Islamist, became a reformist, and has called for a democratic transition since 2023.

Nancy A. Youssef and Vivian Salama: Why the U.S. hasn't yet struck Iran

“These two men matter symbolically, as two ends of a spectrum, the two sides of the 1979 revolution,” Ganjbakhsh told me. “But the coalition can also include everybody in between. Without losing our historical identities, we can join up together.” Even Mansouri and her colleagues in the Iranian Reformist Front could be part of this, Ganjbakhsh suggested, given that they have shown sympathy for the protesters and have paid for it with the charges against them.

The arrests of domestic political figures coincided with sensitive diplomatic talks between Iran and the United States. Hard-liners may have worried that a deal would change the balance of factional forces inside the regime, and so sought to shore up their internal position by arresting their rivals. Mahmoud Sadeghi, a reformist former member of Parliament, went so far as to call the arrests a “pseudo-coup” in a post on X.

Surely Iran's domestic and exiled opposition would rather participate in shaping the country's fate than have it decided between the regime, with its many factions, and Iran's foreign adversaries. But if the opposition is to play any role, it will have to get its act together and unite.

For several hours last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi sat before the House Judiciary Committee with one apparent mission: Don't back down.

The oversight hearing focused on the recent actions of the Justice Department, which has been consumed with the release of the Epstein files, as well as ongoing investigations into the fatal shootings of two American citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis. At some points, the back-and-forth between Bondi and Congress devolved into a screaming match. Faced with questions about her department's haphazard redaction of the files, she often went on the attack, calling Representative Jamie Raskin a “loser lawyer” and asking Representative Jerry Nadler whether he'd “apologized to President Trump” for participating in his impeachment hearings.

Bondi seemed more passionate about these deflections than she did about defending the department's work, which has been hampered in recent months by understaffing and low morale. DOJ reportedly lost nearly 10,000 employees from November 2024 to November 2025. U.S. Attorney's Offices (which are part of the department) shed 14 percent of their workforce, a one-year reduction that officials say is unlike anything they've seen in years. Some were fired, some took a buyout package, and others simply walked away. Last month, Bondi suggested in court filings that the department was struggling to keep up with its workload, having released only a fraction of the millions of Jeffrey Epstein–related files under review. Some attorneys were reportedly spending all or most of their days on the files. (Bondi said on Saturday that “all” of the files have been released, as mandated by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have criticized the files' heavy redactions.)

Add to that a backlog of federal immigration cases and the ongoing legal fallout from the administration's mass-deportation push, and the result is an organization that is thoroughly overwhelmed. The U.S. attorney for Minnesota, who has been responsible for defending recent federal immigration-enforcement efforts, described the new influx of casework as an “enormous burden.” One ICE attorney who volunteered to work on Minnesota's backlog was reportedly removed from her DOJ post after telling a judge that her job “sucks” because of the increased caseload and the administration's failure to comply with immigration court orders. “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, your honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep. I work days and night,” she said.

Nationally, DOJ is making some progress—the Executive Office for Immigration Review announced in September that it had whittled its pending-case backlog down from more than 4.18 million to under 3.75 million—but the lack of staffing will only make it harder to tackle the remaining caseload. (A DOJ spokesperson told me in a statement that “after four years of bureaucratic weaponization under the Biden Administration, President Trump and Attorney General Bondi have created the most efficient Department of Justice in American history.”)

The mission and purpose of the department has also been overhauled—many of its core functions have been politicized since Trump's return to office. The president has directed the department to pursue his personal enemies and has replaced career DOJ employees with inexperienced MAGA loyalists, sometimes to the detriment of his own agenda. Take the recent prosecution of two longtime Trump rivals, New York State Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey. In September, after an acting U.S. attorney reportedly decided that the case against Comey was too weak to pursue, the president pressured him to resign and replaced him with one of his former lawyers, Lindsey Halligan, who had never prosecuted a case before. Halligan appeared to make several fundamental errors in presenting Comey's case, and her cases against James and Comey have since been thrown out. She resigned in January, a few months after a judge ruled that she had been illegally appointed.

The New York Times reported that Bondi's former chief of staff put out an open call on social media for lawyers who “support President Trump and anti-crime agenda” to privately message him about jobs within the department. These were, until recently, some of the most prestigious positions in the American legal system—the “crème de la crème,” my colleague Quinta Jurecic, who covers politics and law, told me. Now the halls are empty enough that a department affiliate is seeking out applicants online.

At least the remaining employees know who's in charge. This afternoon, a banner was hung on the DOJ building's facade—on it, right above the slogan “Make America Safe Again,” was a picture of the president.

The Longevity Scam

By Jordan D. Metzl

The quest to live forever has fascinated humans for millennia. The Epic of Gilgamesh, composed about 4,000 years ago, follows a king who searches the world for a plant that can restore youth, only to lose the plant to a thieving snake. The (likely apocryphal) story of Juan Ponce de León, who is said to have embarked on a search for the Fountain of Youth in the early 16th century, refuses to die—unlike its protagonist, who was killed along his journey.

Today's longevity-medicine movement is driven by the same aggressive desire for eternal youth as the mythic stories of old. But whereas in earlier times ideas about wellness could travel only as fast as the people who held them, today just about anyone with an internet connection can use social media and AI-generated graphics to sell medical advice in seconds. Despite a decided shortage of placebo-controlled trials in humans to support that advice, the business of longevity is booming, thanks in large part to sleek direct-to-consumer marketing delivered by health influencers with far more confidence than evidence. By 2030, $8 trillion might be spent annually on longevity-related products.

Gisèle Pelicot's memoir is an astonishingly honest look at her life with a man who did the unthinkable.

One afternoon in 2024, when her session in court had ended unusually early, Gisèle Pelicot went to the Leclerc supermarket in Carpentras, a picturesque town in Provence. She asked to meet the security guard who, four years earlier, had confronted her husband, Dominique, after observing Dominique trying to use his phone to film up the skirts of unsuspecting female shoppers.

The guard had been irate at the time. He had been thinking, he later told the Daily Mail, about his mother and sister, who shopped at that supermarket and might have been vulnerable to this creep with a cameraphone. Police officers who arrested Dominique Pelicot went to his home, seized his personal devices, and found more than 20,000 images and videos of Dominique—and of other men he had invited into his home—raping his drugged wife.

Gisèle Pelicot wanted to thank the guard, who she believes saved her life. Prior to her husband's arrest, her physical health had been deteriorating due to almost a decade of being drugged and violently assaulted. Had no one intervened, she thinks, he eventually would have killed her.

Pelicot recounts this story in her new book, A Hymn to Life. It's an extraordinary account of her marriage to Dominique, their life together, the revelation of his crimes, and the public trial of him and 50 other defendants, men from a wide range of ages and backgrounds whom Dominique had met online in a chat room called À Son Insu (“Without Her Knowledge”) and invited to his home to assault Gisèle. (All 51 defendants were found guilty of varying charges, many for aggravated rape; Dominique, who is 73 years old, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.)

In her account, Pelicot also mentions other security guards who, around 2010, had also caught Dominique taking upskirting photos. Back then, she writes, “the police clearly didn't think filming under women's skirts was terribly serious, because he got away with a fine of 100 euros, and I never heard a thing about it.” At the time, upskirting was still something paparazzi photographers did to female stars—many of them teenagers—with apparent impunity; the words nonconsensual pornography weren't applied to this kind of behavior until much later, and the act itself wasn't officially criminalized in France until 2018. But if the police had taken Dominique's earlier offenses seriously, would they have been able to prevent what he became?

I've been stuck on this question because the central mystery of the Pelicot case seems to have been what kind of man could do such a monstrous thing to his wife. What kind of man reverberates as a bass line through the news coverage of the trial, the interviews with Dominique's family members, the books, even my own writing. It's a strange inquiry, because we know very well what men can do to women when they feel untouchable. In 2024, some 83,000 women and girls were killed intentionally, 60 percent of them by their intimate partner or a family member—137 a day. (That's compared with just 11 percent of male homicides in which the victim was killed by an intimate partner or family member.)

Since Dominique Pelicot was arrested, news stories have emerged of an Italian Facebook group where users posted intimate photos of women to its tens of thousands of mostly male members; a Telegram channel reportedly devoted to swapping tips on how to sedate women before assaulting them had more than 70,000 members. The latest tranche of the Epstein files has revealed messages between world leaders or billionaires and a convicted child sex offender in which the dehumanizing catchall word pussy abounds in subject lines and sentence fragments, as a party password and a buddy-buddy bonding prompt.

Read: Not all men, but any man

We know that there are also many good men, honorable men. The outraged security guard, for one. The lawyers who flanked Gisèle Pelicot in court, protected her from cameras, took her to lunch every day so that she wouldn't be intimidated by seeing some of the men who were on trial for assaulting her drinking beer and laughing together in a nearby café. But for half a century, Pelicot thought she was married to one of these good men. Her husband claimed during his trial that he himself was one for four decades, until his urges became too strong to resist.

People who commit appalling sexual crimes are generally “more like us than not like us,” the clinical psychologist Veronique Valliere argues in her 2022 book, Unmasking the Sexual Offender. Down in the undercurrents of the internet, Dominique Pelicot found not just fantasy but community. And it's been hard lately not to notice the trend toward more flagrant male transgression out in the open—more performative vice signaling among some of the most powerful people in the world. So the question after reading A Hymn to Life becomes slightly different from What kind of man would do such a thing to his wife? Gisèle Pelicot famously said that she wanted a public trial because “shame has to change sides.” But what do we do when many men can't—won't—feel it? What if there are simply more rewards these days for monsters?

A Hymn to Life is an astonishing book—unflinchingly honest, open to self-interrogation, evocative, determined. Co-written with the journalist Judith Perrignon, it begins on November 2, 2020, when Gisèle Pelicot accompanies her husband to the police station for an interview over “something foolish” he'd been caught doing at the supermarket, only for her to be confronted with the truly unimaginable. The deputy sergeant asks her about her husband's character. “He's kind, attentive. He's a lovely guy,” she replies. “That's why we're still together.”

The deputy sergeant asks if she and her husband are swingers. Pelicot is disgusted by the question. He tells her that her husband has been arrested for aggravated rape and administering toxic substances. He shows her photographs of a woman wearing a suspender belt being penetrated by an unfamiliar man. “That's you in the photograph.” “No,” she counters. “That's not me.” There are more photographs, more men, dozens of them, he says (the police eventually determined 72 in total). Pelicot asks for water. “My mouth is paralysed,” she recalls. “A psychologist comes into the office. A young woman. I don't need her. I am far away, even though we are in the same room. I am secure in my happiness, our happiness.”

She's submerged instantly in deep, deep shock. She automatically goes home to wash and dry clothes for her husband, now in police custody, as though she's “a dog waiting by the garden gate for its master.” Pelicot writes that she had met Dominique when they were teenagers; they were both from very unhappy backgrounds. Gisèle had lost her mother to a brain tumor when she was 9 (the symptoms of which would haunt Gisèle later in life when she started having unexplained blackouts), and her stepmother was unloving and cold. Dominique's father, Denis, tormented his wife and was suspected of abusing their daughter—a girl with learning disabilities whom they'd adopted when she was 5. (Denis moved her into his bedroom, according to Gisèle's memoir, as soon as he was widowed.) During his trial, Dominique testified that on a family camping trip, he once discovered his mother in her tent, her hands bound, “being forced to fellate her husband.” Gisèle writes that the bond she had with her husband was based on mutual suffering and mutual rescue: “We were lovers and we were twins. We would always be together; our suffering behind us, we would escape from our damaged families. I would be his cure and he would be mine.”

One of the cruelest ironies of love is how vulnerable it makes you to danger. In her book, Valliere—who as a therapist has frequently worked with sexual abusers—states plainly that “a relationship is the best avenue to sexual offending. It is the path to love, trust, hope, and denial.” Confronted with the images shown to her by the police, Gisèle Pelicot simply cannot process the gap between her idea of her husband and the reality of what he has done to her: the deceit, the manipulation, the degradation; intentionally exposing her to sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV; letting her agonize over inexplicable gynecological symptoms and the terrifying idea that she might be losing her mind.

The reaction of her three children, especially her daughter, Caroline, is totally different. Hearing the news of her father's arrest, Caroline screams out loud—“a shriek of anguish. The howl of a wounded animal.” The next day, she begins destroying her father's possessions, smashing plates and tearing up a nude painting hanging in the hallway that turns out to have the word coercion written in pencil on the back. Pelicot is troubled by her children's immediate disavowal of their father, of their entire childhood. “All their memories had certainly turned out to be unbearable lies,” she writes. “But mine hadn't.”

Pelicot's honesty is breathtaking, and it helps make A Hymn to Life all the more revelatory as a sociological document. Despite her confident assertion early on that her husband was a terrific guy, un super mec, her narrative reveals more complexity than her own interpretation of Dominique seemed to allow. From the beginning, by her account, the couple's sex life bears the dynamic of Dominique pushing Gisèle further than she wants to go. He demands fellatio, then anal sex, which she refuses. In her book, she casually reveals that she didn't have her first orgasm until she had an affair in her mid-30s, because sex had always been about gratifying her husband. Dominique begins consuming pornography, asking her to replicate certain things he enjoys and taunting her as a prude when she declines. He calls her a “bitch” during sex. He has a tendency to become “aggressive” when contradicted. He's constantly on his computer. One day, his son's partner walks in on Dominique masturbating behind his desk, which Dominique seems unembarrassed about, so much so that you can't help but wonder whether he'd planned it. (In fact, at some point, he set up secret cameras to film each of his two daughters-in-law in the shower; he then posted the images online.) His email handle is “Fétiche45.”

He repeatedly loses his job and runs up huge debts that Gisèle, the main breadwinner, has to pay down. Once, in 2013, she finds bleach on her clothes but has no memory of how it might have gotten there; she jokingly asks Dominique if he has been drugging her, to which he responds with incredulous outrage. The portrait that emerges is that of a domineering liar and narcissist who seems to get off on punishing his wife and making her uncomfortable. That none of this has ever been clear to Gisèle is perplexing even to her. “Beyond the pain of the revelations and the shame of my body being turned into a sack,” she writes, “there was also the shame of having understood nothing—of feeling like an idiot in the eyes of others, and in my own.”

Since the trial, multiple people involved have published books elucidating their own sides of the events. (Dominique Pelicot is apparently writing one from prison.) Caroline, whom Dominique took sexualized photos of while she was sleeping but has always denied abusing, has written I'll Never Call Him Dad Again, in which she recounts her family's history as a “chronicle of horror and survival.” Tormented by her instinct that she was also drugged and assaulted by her father, Caroline can only lash out: at Dominique, who has “soiled” their family; at the “gutter press” that plagues them; and at her mother, whose calm resilience she's baffled by, and who refuses to concede that Caroline might also be a victim. “Maybe her doubt is an unconscious attempt to shield herself, but it hurts me all the same,” Caroline writes. Her raw anger feels totally alien from her mother's remarkable strength, and yet both are understandable. “If I allow the full extent of my pain to be seen, all my pain, I will drown in it,” Gisèle writes. “I have no choice but to be invincible.”

In another book about the Pelicot trial, Living With Men, the philosopher Manon Garcia notes that both Gisèle and Caroline were reproached during the trial for not responding correctly to what had happened to them: Caroline was gently asked to behave “more properly” by the judge, who seemed “taken aback by the fury of her pain,” while Gisèle was apparently criticized by one of the defendants' lawyers for being so calm. “One thing is clear,” Garcia writes. “Whatever you do, you will always be someone's bad victim.”

But she, too, is torn between expressing a kind of primal rage of her own and deploying a more detached analysis of the “cultural scaffolding of rape,” the social systems that enabled Dominique to easily find scores of men within a 40-mile radius who would rape his wife. The defendants have nothing in common except a culture where, as Garcia puts it, “the only relationship that might count is with other men.”

That many of the defendants came to court expressing not shame but intense anger at Gisèle Pelicot—they were “simmering with rage,” Gisèle writes—suggests that they simply did not think they had done anything wrong. And the reality we are left to confront, Garcia argues, is that they're not aberrations for feeling this way. They really might be just your average guys next door.

Not all is quite so dismaying. Garcia believes that Gisèle Pelicot would not have been confident enough to ask for a public trial if #MeToo had never happened. Dominique Pelicot was exposed as a direct result of changes to French law that activists had been campaigning for. And in some ways, the generational divide between Gisèle's long-standing marital devotion (“The principal axis of our lives was the man we had married or were hoping to meet,” she writes in A Hymn to Life) and Manon Garcia's skepticism (“Can we live with men? And if so, at what cost?”) reveals a growing unwillingness among women to accept an inferior or unsafe status as the price of being loved.

But many are also noticing who's devastated by the news these days and who isn't. “I just think it's funny how men don't seem to be adequately upset or outraged by the Epstein files,” the artist Chloe Wise posted recently, noting that all the women she knows “can't sleep” or are “spiraling,” “disturbed,” and “forever scarred,” while “every man is like: ‘Oh yeah, it seems bad, I haven't really looked into it.'”

Read: The unspeakable, enabled

And you'd be forgiven, observing recent news cycles, for coming to the conclusion that, for too many people, a culture that tacitly condones and even enables exploitation is not that big a deal. Consider Meta's new smart glasses, which make filming someone without their consent far too easy, or the flood of sexualized images of women and children that Grok has generated. Or the ways in which both adult-content sites such as OnlyFans and chatbot platforms habituate users (primarily men) to intimate relationships that are entirely sycophantic and affirming. One of the defining characteristics of generative AI, Paul Ford emphasized in Wired last year, is that it is “totally shameless.” In that sense, he wrote, it's an apt reflection of the minds that created it, who are themselves just as shameless: “They insist we remake civilization around them and promise it will work out. But how are they going to teach a computer to behave if they can't?”

The shame must change sides, Gisèle Pelicot still insists. Her story, she argues, “stirs up our violence, our barely concealed sordidness, our dormant traumas, our silences, our equivocations. It is the grubby reflection of the domination and predatory activity that still structure our world.” Her takeaway is that love can be an antidote to such misery, and her faith in it is extraordinary. Possibly even superhuman.

Our health secretary is a jeans guy, and he knows it.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

A post on X claimed to be a simple message from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Stay active; eat well. But the 90-second video it shared, called “Secretary Kennedy and Kid Rock's Rock Out Work Out,” seems designed to be bewildering. Here was Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eating steak and doing preacher curls in his belted blue jeans and a pair of hiking shoes; and here he was again, stripping off his T-shirt to ride an exercise bike inside a sauna; and here he was a little later, strutting over to a cold-plunge tub (still in his blue jeans but with the belt removed); and here he went into the tub, sliding underwater in his dungarees.



Why was the HHS secretary bathing in a pair of pants? The video never provides an answer for this question, even as Kennedy plays pickleball, then mugs for the camera, then soaks in a Jacuzzi with a glass of milk, all while still in jeans. It's just bizarre—a PSA that presumably has been dialed in by his staff to maximize its WTF effect. (The video has been viewed more than 13 million times and produced some 11,000 replies; HHS did not respond to a request for comment about the video or the jeans.) However his peculiar gymwear habit started, its present state is very clear: The secretary's jeans are self-aware.



Kennedy's proclivity for working out in belted denim long predates the knowing wink with which it's now displayed. Take the summer's “DOD-HHS Fitness Challenge,” for which Kennedy donned his favorite workout gear and did a bunch of pull-ups with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Or the viral clip of him from 2023, wearing jeans and boots and nothing else, squeezing out a final set on Venice Beach. I don't believe that these show a man who lifts in jeans to maximize his clicks. I believe that they show instead a man who fits a waning archetype in fitness culture, a species that has for decades been endemic to the gym: Kennedy is a jeans guy.



I've worked out, off and on, for more than 30 years—and for all of that time, the jeans guys have remained a steady presence on the rubber floors. They are sometimes taciturn, sometimes chatty. They often pair their jeans with boots, as Kennedy will do, and with a T-shirt or a tank top or a hoodie. But lest you think he simply has no truck with any gym-specific gear, the jeans guy is sometimes spotted wearing padded lifting gloves, or a leather lifting belt across his Levi's. At times, his social role will overlap with that of other weight-room regulars, not least of which is the gym grandpa, who hangs around and shoots the breeze and doles out tips on how to lift. However he appears, and however much he gabs, the jeans guy's social status is the same: He's an outsider. Rarely does one find a jeans guy paired up with a workout partner. “It's usually like, ‘The jeans guy rides alone,'” Tolga Ozyurtcu, a historian of physical culture at the University of Texas at Austin, told me when I called him up to talk about this phenomenon.



Not everyone enjoys the company of the jeans guy. Some see him as a threat. Planet Fitness once made a point of banning denim in the gym, along with grunting, dropping dumbbells, and judging others. (Those who broke these rules could be punished with a “lunk alarm” and summarily kicked out.) But this discrimination feels as ill-considered as it is unfair: In my experience, jeans guys are harmless at the very worst, and at best, they add some needed color to a dreary landscape. In this way, the jeans guys are akin to other gentle curiosities, such as the shorts guys who alight on college campuses in wintertime, and the black chipmunks that scamper by from time to time in city parks.



What motivates the jeans guy? No one knows. He is, if nothing else, as inscrutable as a four-leaf clover. Ask him why he isn't wearing shorts, and he will likely tell you that he chooses denim for efficiency. When Fox News's Jesse Watters asked Kennedy in August to explain his favored workout gear, all Watters got was this: “Well, I just started doing that a long time ago because I would go hiking in the morning and then I'd go straight to the gym, and I found it was convenient, and now I'm used to it.” In the hope of getting more, I reached out to Ryan Calder, the fitness coach who spotted Kennedy on the incline bench in that viral video from 2023. Did Calder—who at the time was dressed, quite reasonably, in shorts—happen to ask Kennedy about his denim pants and boots? He did. “I asked him right then, you know, like, ‘So, you're banging it out in jeans?,'” he told me. “And he's like, ‘Yeah, man, this is my efficient way. I only have 30 minutes. I don't spend time changing clothes.”



A jeans guy's self-report must be taken with a grain of salt—maybe even he cannot really fathom why he lives the way he does. Kennedy's is no exception to this rule. In public appearances, he is almost always in a suit and skinny tie, so adding a daily interlude in workout denim would hardly seem to be a way of saving time. His habit may be instead a product of the workout culture he imbibed during his youth. “The jeans guy, it's a thing. It's a very definitive thing,” Conor Heffernan, a fitness historian at Ulster University, told me. “It's a trope we've had since the '80s.” The power lifters of the time, some of whom were connected to the biker subculture, adopted a “rugged, spit-and-sawdust aesthetic” in the gym, he said. This included denim. During the same period, glitzy photoshoots for bodybuilders also featured jeans, to match the styles of the time. Heffernan brought up a famous photo of Lee Haney, the eight-time Mr. Olympia, flexing shirtless in a pair of jeans above a steamy manhole cover in New York City. Perhaps the older jeans guys of today—Kennedy himself is 72—are nothing less than living fossils.



Their aesthetic may have faded out, but a younger set of jeans guys—ironic jeans guys—has since emerged in the fitness culture. Take the influencer-marathoner Truett Hanes: His brand is built on running very fast and very far … in jeans. He claims that this started as a goof, but it has turned into a business. He now represents a denim company, as well as a chafing cream. The idea of working out in jeans, partly silly and partly serious, is everywhere once you start to look for it. One gymwear brand, Raskol, launched a line of lifter jeggings in 2023 in shades such as “blue steele” and “pale thunder,” with a tongue-in-cheek campaign that had bodybuilders boasting of their pride at using PEDs—that is, “performance-enhancing denims.”



This self-mocking move may be just the prelude to a fuller jeans-guy renaissance, Heffernan suggested. After all, Raskol's jeggings did sell out, he said. And this wouldn't be the first time that a traditional signifier of masculinity crept back into mainstream culture by way of performative half jokes. The fashion for bushy beards, and beards' association with authentic manliness, has followed this same trajectory from irony to earnestness during its various resurgences since the early 19th century. Now the same could be happening to denim workout pants: Today's goof evolves into tomorrow's masculine ideal. “I think irony moves into fashion very quickly in fitness,” Heffernan said.



For Kennedy, this process may appear to be going in reverse: His latest workout video shows that he's in on the joke, that in 2026 he's capable of pumping irony as well as iron, and that he can engage in what Heffernan described as “a very deliberate deployment of jeans.” But it also shows that there is a recipe, if not a cultural machinery, for rehabilitating out-of-date ideas. Not all of Kennedy's eccentricities are as quaint as how he dresses in the gym, and there are many ways of going backwards in pursuit of health while pretending that you've found a way into the future. MAHA is nostalgia, sometimes with a smirk. The jeans guy dunks himself in water. The jeans guy is reborn.

Cows are draining the Colorado River.

More than one in 10 Americans rely on the Colorado River to take showers and drink clean water. But with no end in sight to the decades-long drought in the western US and rapidly decreasing river levels, this essential resource is fueling bitter disputes over who, exactly, should be cutting back on water.

This fight has been coming to a head especially among the seven states that make up the Colorado River Compact — California, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wyoming — as well as a sliver of Mexico and over 20 tribal nations that rely on the 1.9 trillion gallons of water pulled from the Colorado River for use each year.

Record low snowfall in the West this winter has further strained the situation, and this week, tensions are running especially high.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

The Colorado River Compact states failed to reach a Valentine's Day deadline for a deal on how water would be apportioned for the next two decades, with the current rules set to expire this fall. If the states don't agree to more ambitious cuts soon, the federal government could step in and unilaterally decide for them.

But it's unclear exactly what that future would look like. Last year, the US Department of the Interior published a proposal with five potential options for the river's future. Most involve a mix of voluntary and mandated water usage cuts, while another — fairly dire — option is “no action” at all.

The ongoing and escalating water crunch has inspired localities throughout the West to creatively conserve water through water recycling programs, ripping out grass lawns, and hiking rates when households use water in excess. But ultimately, if the Colorado River has any chance at sustaining tens of millions of Americans for decades to come, the western United States will need to do something that, on the surface, doesn't seem to have much to do with water conservation at all: raise a lot fewer cows.

When we think about water use, we probably think of ourselves first — the water we drink, the toilets we flush, or the lawns we tend. Next, we might think of commercial uses, like water to irrigate golf courses and run car washes; or on an even larger scale, water used for fracking or operating power plants. But the biggest user of water, by far — especially among the Colorado River states — is agriculture.

Farming accounts for about 75 percent of annual Colorado River water usage, according to a 2024 paper published in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

But not all agricultural sectors are equally thirsty. While a small share of the Colorado River water is used on farms to grow fruits and vegetables, like lettuce, oranges, and grapes, almost half of it — by far the lion's share — is used to grow just alfalfa and other types of hay, virtually all of which is used to feed beef and dairy cattle.

Portions of the other crops grown with Colorado River water, like corn, wheat, cotton, sorghum, and oats, are likely fed to livestock, too.

All told, animal feed accounts for at least 47 percent of all water pulled from the Colorado River — yet the imprudence of devoting so much water to one industry receives little to no attention in public discussion over the West's water crisis.

What's more, the millions of cows in the American West are themselves fueling climate change in a non-insignificant way with their methane-rich burps, which in turn accelerates the water shortages for the river.

And these crops provide little economic activity to the region. For example, almost 70 percent of all of Utah's water is used to grow alfalfa, though it represents just 0.2 percent of the state's GDP.

As I wrote a few years ago: “The West's already limited water is primarily used to grow a low-value crop, alfalfa, while cities are left to spend heavily on water-saving infrastructure to keep the H2O running and ensure reserves.”

Yet few politicians — or us, the consumers of burgers, cheese, and steaks — are willing to question the status quo of ceding so much of this shared and increasingly sparse natural resource to the cattle industry.

If policymakers and agricultural researchers were to start our food system from scratch, they probably wouldn't put a bunch of cows in the desert.

Despite the problems the West's large cow population has created, policymakers also can't just pull them off the land or rip alfalfa plants from the soil. Or turn off the spigots for, either. That's because in the American West, water rights are set by what's called the “prior appropriation” doctrine — whoever uses the water first lays claim to those rights and holds them indefinitely so long as they use the water.

California farmers were among the first to claim these rights in the mid- and late-1800s in the wake of the 1862 Homestead Act, which gave Western settlers free land to cultivate. Today, senior water rights holders are given priority, by law, over more junior water rights holders. (In the eastern US, where water is more plentiful, water rights are more egalitarian.)

“It is a stupid system, but the problem is that people are really heavily invested in that system,” John Matthews, executive director of the nonprofit Alliance for Global Water Adaptation, told me a few years back. There are some potential solutions, such as paying farmers to fallow their fields and allowing more farmers to sell or lease their water rights to municipalities.

While farms across the Colorado River Compact have innovated to cut water use and waste, they're still the biggest H2O guzzler by far. One California irrigation district dominated by alfalfa crops for cattle alone uses more water than all of Colorado uses for everything.

In current negotiations, the Lower Basin states — California, Arizona, and Nevada — have all committed to significant cuts. But the Upper Basin states — Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming — have refused to commit to such reductions, arguing that California and Arizona have long overconsumed water. The stalemate shows no signs of resolving soon.

Such battles over water in the West have been playing out for more than a century, and it's all but certain they'll continue, especially in the increasingly parched decades ahead. That is, unless policymakers — along with food companies and we consumers — address the cow in the room and challenge our meat- and dairy-centric status quo.

In the meantime, people living in the West will continue to be told to remove their grass lawns and take shorter showers while largely symbolic scapegoats like golf courses and data centers will take the fall for the real source of the West's water crisis: ranchers, dairy producers, and their millions and millions of cows.

From Venezuelan oil to the Board of Peace, Trump is constantly looking for new sources of cash he can control.

After President Donald Trump launched a military operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, he announced that America planned to take control of its oil revenue. More specifically, one American.

“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” he proclaimed in a statement.

This wasn't the first time he'd used that kind of language. Earlier, he announced “deals” with allies Japan and South Korea, in which the countries received tariff relief in exchange for pledging massive investments in the United States that Trump himself would allegedly oversee. 

And in Davos, Switzerland, Trump unveiled a new international initiative called the “Board of Peace.” It's being pitched by the White House as a global problem solver, starting with Gaza.

According to an alleged draft charter, countries would serve limited terms unless they pay $1 billion to fund the board. And, not coincidentally, the chairman (Trump) would have substantial control over its operations. Many American allies quickly balked at the arrangement, with France's foreign minister citing the “very extensive powers” granted to the board's chairman.

These recent episodes are all part of a broader story of Trump's second term: his endless quest to secure a slush fund that he can use to personally control large sums of money.

To say that Trump is in an endless quest for a slush fund is not to suggest that there's to be a literal White House bank account with his name on it (he'd love that, though).

Rather, it's a description of a disturbing approach to governing: a relentless push to create discretionary pools of money and leverage points of control that can be used to reward, punish, and command, all while trying to dodge legal and constitutional constraints.

When convenient, he's gone through Congress, whose decision to grant him a massive $170 billion immigration enforcement fund in a party-line vote outside the normal appropriations process is now central to policy arguments about Immigration and Customs Enforcement after Minneapolis. Of that, ICE is slated to receive $75 billion — tripling its annual budget.

But he's also looked for ways to find control over investments through the levers of foreign policy — tariffs, trade deals, foreign mergers, military seizures, diplomatic programs — that were never intended to be used this way.

If you're thinking, “Okay, but governments negotiate deals all the time,” that's true to a point. What's striking is that the tariffs Trump unilaterally imposed are being used as leverage to shake down allied countries to feed his insatiable appetite for grandiose headlines about alleged incoming investments.

Instead of enforceable trade agreements, these deals are more like political commitments. Locking in binding obligations and durable tariff changes typically requires congressional action. The enforcement mechanism for these deals is basically his never-ending threat of higher tariffs. For example, the administration reached a trade deal with Europe in July, but the truce didn't last. After Trump escalated pressure over his demand for Greenland, he revived tariff threats against several European countries.

The concessions Trump announces in these deals are also sometimes less than they seem when the countries fill in the details. Trump claimed: “I got [a] signing bonus from Japan of $550 billion. That's our money. It's our money to invest, as we like.” But Japanese investments are being structured as equity, loans, and guarantees routed through Japanese public finance institutions and an investment committee, not a $550 billion pot of cash that Trump can simply steer at will.

These “deals” are built to generate headlines, not binding obligations that would survive courts, Congress, and the next administration. And if the administration tries to treat these foreign pledges as money it can direct, it would be attempting an end around Congress's power of the purse and laws meant to prevent exactly that. (More on that later.)

None of this came out of nowhere. The slush-fund instinct was hiding in plain sight months before the administration started dangling tariff relief in exchange for headline-grabbing “investment packages.”

The seed was planted weeks into Trump's second term, when he ordered his administration to plan for a United States sovereign wealth fund (SWF), a government-owned investment fund.

The idea was that the federal government should be in the business of assembling a portfolio of “strategic” assets and directing capital flows, with the president at the center of the decision making. It's a bad idea — and one more commonly associated with socialist thinkers, who see it as a way to disperse economic gains in the private sector broadly to the public. To Trump, though, the irresistible appeal was that it would put him in the position of dealmaker, developer, and CEO.

The White House eventually realized that a formal SWF would require legislation, which would entail governance rules, statutory limits, and congressional oversight. It would thus be slower, more constrained, and harder for Trump to control. Tellingly, plans for the formal SWF were subsequently shelved.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the pivot away from a formal SWF when, in reference to the aforementioned shakedowns of allied countries, he stated in August, “Other countries, in essence, are providing us with a sovereign wealth fund.” The revealing phrase is “in essence,” because there's no actual fund; there's just the executive branch attempting to leverage tariffs and dealmaking to finance projects “owned and controlled by the United States” that would be selected by Trump.

What emerged was the beginning of an improvisational workaround, a series of ad hoc arrangements meant to mimic a fund but without the guardrails.

In June, the White House pressured Japan's Nippon Steel into giving the president a “golden share” — a non-monetary stake that comes with substantial control over its business decisions — as part of its purchase of U.S. Steel in order to secure a deal approving the sale.

Following Trump's public humiliation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in August, the government acquired a 10 percent equity stake in the storied, but troubled, semiconductor company. The acquisition was funded by previously awarded — but not yet fully paid — grants to Intel under the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act, plus additional money tied to a program to produce chips for the Pentagon. The arrangement wasn't presented as a temporary emergency tool, as had been the case with past government equity acquisitions; instead, it was portrayed as an indefinite strategic ownership position.

Other equity deals have drawn on different justifications and funding streams. The Pentagon's recent equity stake in defense contractor L3Harris is a perfect illustration of how the administration makes it up as it goes, deal by deal. On January 13, the Department of Defense announced a $1 billion investment structured to give the government an equity stake in a rocket motor company that L3Harris will spin off later in 2026. The Pentagon framed it as the first “direct to supplier” deal of its kind, tied to multi-year procurement and speeding the production of rocket motors needed for missiles. But the equity stake was unnecessary, as the Pentagon could have achieved its goals with the procurement tools it already has.

That matters, because it creates an obvious conflict of interest. The government becomes the customer, regulator, and partial owner of a firm that will compete for government business. The incentive problem should be obvious: When Washington owns part of a company, it has a stake in the company's success, and a political stake in ensuring it doesn't fail. That's one reason federal equity stakes were historically associated with emergencies rather than peacetime political dealmaking.

As it stands, the administration has acquired equity stakes in 12 private companies, including several mineral producers and an energy company. The administration has made clear its intention to consider acquiring equity stakes in additional companies and industries.

Then, there's the administration's “pay-to-play” chip export scheme that takes the slush fund mentality and dispenses with the pretense that the primary motivation is the US's industrial capacity. In December, the administration said it would allow Nvidia and AMD to export particular chips to China — overruling critics who worried the move would cut into America's lead on a key technology with security implications — in exchange for a 25 percent cut of the sales. Observers noted that the Constitution bars taxes on exports.

Cue the improvisation. Trump ultimately imposed a narrowly targeted 25 percent tariff on certain advanced chips, including the ones Nvidia and AMD could sell to China, using a national security order tied to a Section 232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. As global technology expert Paul Triolo explained, “There is no precedent for this type of approach to tariffs and semiconductor policy. This is a policy designed specifically for Nvidia and AMD to be able to ship advanced GPUs to China and for the US government to attach a ‘chip tax' to this process in a way that does not violate existing laws.”

It's a clear example of the administration's governing style: constantly rejiggering the legal structure of a scheme to preserve the underlying goal — money and control — while avoiding the most obvious legal obstacles. With the direct cut of export sales initially touted by Trump looking constitutionally dicey, the White House shifted to an import tariff ploy that could be framed as the president merely exercising trade powers delegated to him by Congress.

The deeper problem is what this kind of improvisation invites. Even when Congress doesn't get a vote on an export decision, the system ordinarily runs through agencies, written standards, and a paper trail. Those guardrails exist to make conflicts of interest easier to spot and harder to exploit. That concern reared its head in late January, when the Wall Street Journal reported that a United Arab Emirates-backed entity linked to an Emirati royal purchased 49% of the Trump family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, for $500 million, with roughly half paid up front. The report connects the investment timeline to subsequent US-UAE negotiations and, ultimately, to an agreement allowing the export of tightly controlled advanced AI chips.

If accurate, a foreign interest looking to obtain advanced American chips placed a large bet on a fledgling business tied directly to the incoming president, his family, and close associates. Even if no quid pro quo can be proven, the mere appearance of a “pay for play” scheme involving a national security matter is disturbing. And it lands amid broader concerns that the Trump family and associates have been monetizing proximity to presidential power.

The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, stating that “no money shall be drawn from the Treasury” unless the legislative branch formally allows it. It's the central guardrail against Trump's mentality that money can be raised and deployed based on presidential discretion rather than congressional authorization.

Federal budget law reinforces this principle.

The Antideficiency Act bars agencies from obligating or spending federal funds in advance of, or beyond, a congressional appropriation. And the Miscellaneous Receipts statute generally requires that money received by the government be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts unless specifically authorized for deposit elsewhere. Again, these rules exist to prevent agencies — and presidents — from creating their own pots of money outside of Congress's control.

The revenue from Trump's tariffs goes to the Treasury, for example, and turning it into spending requires congressional action. That hasn't stopped the president from wildly claiming he can use tariff revenues to pay for everything from a “Dream Military,” to replacing the federal income tax, to $2,000 stimulus checks. But he's made no progress on actually advancing these priorities using the money in question.

These constraints don't automatically resolve every questionable action. Over time, Congress has delegated substantial power to the executive branch. Whether the executive branch has misused that delegated power is a question for the courts. In the meantime, Congress can — and should — conduct oversight of the administration's maneuvering.

For equity acquisitions, the administration is relying on existing Pentagon industrial base authorities and repurposed funds to acquire stakes in companies. Unresolved issues include whether those statutes and appropriations clearly authorize equity ownership and, if the government later receives dividends or sells the stake, whether congressional budget rules, such as the MRA, require the funds to be returned to the Treasury rather than reused by the agencies.

The legal and constitutional restraints explain why Trump's slush-fund hunt keeps producing more questions than answers. The schemes are hard to square with the fundamental separation of powers, so creative legal justifications and improvisation are required.

The Venezuelan oil proceeds saga shows how Trump's abrupt public decrees can turn into complicated schemes after they force his apparatchiks to act. Trump initially said he would control the money, declaring that “I don't have to consult with anybody” to take control of the oil.

After Trump's initial claim, the White House issued an executive order invoking emergency powers to keep courts from steering Venezuelan oil revenue to the country's creditors. It creates “Foreign Government Deposit Funds,” meaning proceeds held in designated Treasury accounts. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control then issued a general license permitting certain Venezuelan oil transactions but requiring payments that would otherwise go to sanctioned Venezuelan entities to be routed first into Treasury accounts.

The order says the money remains Venezuela's sovereign property, yet the Treasury may release it only at the Secretary of State's direction. The administration says, “It's not our money,” but it nevertheless controls the spigot.

Confusion deepened when reports said $500 million from the first sales sat in a US-controlled account in Qatar before being returned to Venezuela. Reuters quoted an administration official saying the Qatar fund is temporary and future proceeds are expected to go into a US-based account.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Senate that the US controls only the disbursement of funds, that Venezuela will submit monthly budget requests for administration approval, and that audits will ensure the funds benefit Venezuelans. But a Treasury-held, State-directed custodial fund that effectively governs a foreign government's money is unusual, and the administration hasn't clearly identified the statute authorizing this structure or explained how it can realistically audit and enforce spending inside Venezuela.

The ongoing murkiness blurs who controls what, where, and under what legal authority.

The administration's Board of Peace initiative holds similar concerns. According to the draft charter, a country's membership would be limited to a three-year term unless it contributes $1 billion “in cash funds” to extend it. Even if the White House claims this isn't a “fee,” the obvious questions remain. Where would the money go? Who would control it? What is the legal authority for the president to solicit contributions from foreign governments? What about Congress?

On Thursday, Trump announced that the US will contribute $10 billion to his board. That, once again, immediately raised the question of how the president can do it if Congress hasn't appropriated the money. As CNN reporter Aaron Blake noted, “critics have likened [the Board] to a giant slush fund Trump will control.” Another day, more questions.

A reason why these “deals” keep generating questions is that the administration is dancing around the federal government's core design. Congress is supposed to control the purse, and presidents aren't supposed to create their own financing mechanisms.

Even if you assume the administration is acting in good faith — an unwarranted assumption — its approach erodes the idea that federal power should be exercised through general rules rather than personalized deals. Trade policy shouldn't be a means for the president to shake down allies. Export controls are supposed to be about security, not revenue generation. Subsidy programs are supposed to be debated and authorized by Congress, not converted into partial government ownership of private companies. And emergency powers are supposed to be extraordinary, not an excuse to act on autocratic instincts.

The question, “Is this legal?” therefore can't be answered with a simple yes or no. As the Supreme Court's looming ruling on Trump's “emergency” tariffs portends, some actions may survive judicial review; others may not.

But the long-term risk is not just that Trump might be doing something illegal. The long-term risk is that his presidency is normalizing treating the receipt and disbursement of money as instruments of personal power. Were this happening under a Democratic administration, congressional Republicans would be outraged. Instead, they've collectively buried their heads in the sand. If and when a future Democratic administration takes advantage of the precedents being set by Trump, they'll have only their own willful cowardice to blame.

﻿Is it time for the left to rethink its approach to guns?

The Gray Area is now publishing twice a week on audio and video. Subscribe to Vox's YouTube channel or listen wherever you get your podcasts. 

Tyler Austin Harper didn't set out to become a culture warrior.

He trained as a scholar. His PhD was in comparative literature. He has written widely about the history of human extinction, the crisis in higher education, and, apparently, high-maintenance carbon-steel knives. For a while, he taught environmental studies at Bates College, working at the intersection of literature, science, and climate.

Now a staff writer at The Atlantic, Harper has offered some of the more unpredictable — and provocative — arguments on recent politics and culture. Although he sits on the left, he hasn't been shy about critiquing his own side — and even embracing views typically associated with the right.

Exhibit A: his recent piece on why Minneapolis should be a “Second Amendment wake-up call,” an argument for why liberals should take gun rights seriously if they truly believe their own warnings about creeping authoritarianism.

I invited Harper on The Gray Area to talk about the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and why he thinks many on the left are thinking about guns in the wrong way. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, which drops every Monday, so listen to and follow us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

You wrote a piece about Alex Pretti, an American citizen, who was shot and killed in the back on the street by an ICE agent. I'm not going to try to summarize your piece. But you came at it from a pretty unique angle. What was the argument you made? And why did you feel like you needed to say it?

I'd been telling friends and colleagues for a week or two before the shooting that I was worried this exact thing was going to happen. It seemed inevitable that we were going to see a killing stemming from someone legally exercising the right to carry.

I live in Maine. ICE had come to Maine. Not in the numbers we saw in Minneapolis, but they were ramping up. And what I was watching unfold in Minneapolis did not inspire confidence.

They were stopping people on the street solely based on how they looked. Detaining Native Americans because they didn't have passports on them. Pushing people to the ground. Grabbing people. The pattern looked chaotic and amateurish. This did not look like a disciplined, well-trained law enforcement operation.

And I didn't trust at all that they were even familiar with the gun laws in the states they were operating in — whether Minnesota or Maine — both of which have relatively permissive Second Amendment protections.

When I said that to friends, some of them thought I was just being paranoid, like I was the resident gun guy overreacting. But then that's essentially what happened.

So why did you feel personally compelled to speak up?

Because I conceal carry. And I don't usually talk about that publicly. The whole point of concealed carry is that it's concealed. You don't make it part of your persona. You don't perform it.

I come from a family of gun owners. I've owned guns since I was 12. I shoot regularly. But carrying daily is something I started doing more recently. In this case, though, it felt important to say something as someone who actually does carry.

Pretti was legally carrying. He was disarmed, thrown to the ground, pepper-sprayed for trying to help a woman to her feet, and then shot in the back 10 times.

And one thing that gets lost in a lot of the debate is what happens after the first shots.

People fixate on the beginning. Did someone yell “gun”? Did an agent panic? Even if you grant panic for the first shots, that doesn't explain what happens next.

If you watch the video, after he's shot multiple times, the agents move backward. They create distance. He's down. He's not advancing. And then one or two of them continue firing into his motionless body. That's not split-second panic. Ten rounds over five seconds sounds quick if you don't shoot. But if you do shoot, you know five seconds is a long time.

How long have you been carrying?

About 18 months. I've been a “gun guy” for much longer than that. I grew up around guns. I've always owned guns for home protection. But Maine is a safe state. I didn't feel compelled to carry every day until I started receiving more threats.

Your piece framed this as a wake-up call for the Second Amendment. What did you mean by that?

That the Second Amendment is not just for one demographic or one political party.

Democrats, both strategically and culturally, have not taken it seriously enough. I have a lot of problems with the NRA, but I do agree with their core claim that the Second Amendment is fundamentally about preventing government tyranny.

It's not primarily about hunting. It's not primarily about home defense. It's about ensuring that citizens retain some capacity to resist state overreach.

So when liberals insist we are sliding toward authoritarianism, or that democracy is blinking red, and then simultaneously advocate disarming civilians in the states they control, I find that inconsistent. And what's revealing is the administration's response. Suddenly they're talking like caricature gun-control liberals. Referring to a standard Sig 320 as a “military-style pistol.” Acting as if carrying extra magazines is evidence of terrorist intent.

Many people carry a spare magazine because magazines are one of the most common failure points. That's just prudence. That's not extremism.

So this is a wake-up call in two directions. Liberals should reconsider their reflexive hostility to civilian gun ownership. And conservatives should notice that the current administration's supposed pro-gun stance evaporates the moment guns are in the “wrong” hands.

The hypocrisy has been staggering. The same ecosystem that celebrated armed militia guys occupying a state capitol suddenly acts horrified at an armed protester. 

I'd draw a distinction.

The influencer class and the administration are absolutely hypocritical. But many conservative gun owners have been principled about this. I've seen plenty say that I disagree with Pretti politically, but he had the right to carry.

There's also a longstanding anti-federal strain in gun culture. People who grew up hearing about Ruby Ridge, Waco, federal overreach. That predates Trump. So for many in the gun community, this isn't just partisan hypocrisy. It's confirmation of an old suspicion.

Why did guns become so right-coded in the first place? There's nothing inherent in the Second Amendment that makes it conservative.

It's demographic drift.

The Democratic Party is now more urban, more professional-class, more highly educated. Gun ownership skews more rural and more working-class.

That shift in party base affects cultural attitudes. It's less that the Second Amendment became conservative in essence and more that gun ownership increasingly aligned with communities that felt culturally alienated from the Democratic Party.

So gun politics became a proxy for broader cultural divides.

Do you think this could shift anything on the left?

At the grassroots level, maybe.

I've had friends who never thought about guns ask me to take them shooting, ask what they should buy. People are scared. When you see armed federal agents acting lawlessly, abstract arguments become concrete.

That changes the conversation.

Do you buy the idea that we're sliding toward authoritarianism?

Yes, with nuance.

There's a difference between Trump as a person and Trumpism as a movement. There's a difference between Trump voters and ideological true believers.

Is Trump himself a fascist? I don't think so. I think he's a grifter. His core motivations are money, ego, and power as spectacle. That doesn't make him benign, but it makes him opportunistic rather than doctrinal.

But elements of MAGA are authoritarian. That's undeniable. You see it in rhetoric, in the symbolism, in the flirtation with repression. The danger is that serious ideologues can use Trump as a vehicle because he doesn't care as long as it serves him.

That's what makes him so vexing. If he's a fascist, it's almost by accident. He's not sitting there reading Carl Schmitt. But the Stephen Millers of the world are deadly serious.

Exactly. And that's the tension.

So if you had to make the pro-Second Amendment case to a skeptical lefty who hates guns and gun culture, what's your pitch?

First, we're not starting from a blank slate. American gun culture is deeply entrenched. You're not going to unwind centuries of it with a federal ban. That's a fantasy.

Second, if you genuinely believe there is a meaningful risk of authoritarian drift — even 10 or 15 percent — that's not trivial. That's a real probability.

So under those conditions, would you rather be armed or unarmed? If the answer is armed, then at minimum you should respect the legitimacy of civilian gun ownership. I'm not saying everyone needs to buy a gun. But there's a contradiction between insisting we're on the brink of authoritarianism and insisting civilians must be disarmed.

And what would you say to the gun-curious liberal?

Go to a range. Take a lesson. Most gun shops are not the caricature you imagine. Gun culture skews conservative, yes. But it's more diverse than you think. You'll see all kinds of people there.

Even if you leave thinking, I hate this and I never want to do it again, at least your position will be informed by experience rather than abstraction. And that alone improves the quality of the debate.

How democracies fall — and how they can come back.

American democracy is not in a good place. Institutional breakdown and mistrust define our political moment. Polarization has broken our politics, and President Donald Trump has elevated fealty to him — as opposed to the Constitution — as the core principle of governance.

And the American story is part of a global story. If the post-World War II decades tell the tale of liberal democracy triumphant, the 21st century paints a darker picture. Values and ideals once considered foundational and immutable have come under threat from anti-democratic forces across the globe. The rise of autocracy and the retreat of liberal democracy may well be the dominant narrative when historians look back on the first quarter of the century.

So, where does the story go from here? That's a question we wanted to take on in this ambitious series of narrative features, video explainers, and podcast episodes that we'll publish over the next two weeks.

Senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp traveled to Brazil to find out how that country succeeded in holding off its own autocratic threat, and what the United States can learn from it; you'll learn about what he found in a feature piece, as well as audio and video dispatches, this week. Our video team provides other perspectives: first, a piece that tells the story of how Finland turned back its homegrown fascist threat in the 1930s; second, an explainer on an idea whose time has come: expanding the House of Representatives.

Coming next week: Our Today, Explained podcast team traveled to Poland to report on its own experience with democratic backsliding; this two-part episode will shine further light on the fragility — and resilience — of 21st-century democracy.

Meanwhile, Beauchamp offers a zoom-out view of the lessons from other democratic near-misses. He also has a Q&A with Matthew Yglesias, revisiting a piece the Vox co-founder wrote on this site 11 years ago — “American democracy is doomed” — and assessing the state of our democracy now. Finally, Lee Drutman, a leading scholar on democracy, offers a historical look at America's attempts at reform. His is an empowering argument: Reform has been a constant in the American story, and this moment should be no different.

As Drutman writes in his piece, “Trump is not forever.” There will be an American future on the other side of this benighted present. What that future looks like is entirely up to us.

This package takes as its starting point that global democracy is in a bad way — but that the diagnosis, while serious, isn't terminal. America can learn from the example of other democracies that have also faltered, but ultimately succeeded. It can learn from its own past, which tells us that democratic reform not only is possible but inevitable. And it can learn from ideas given new life by our predicament, as we search for a path out of this anti-democratic cul-de-sac.

The Court just did Trump a huge favor. Will he take it?

The Supreme Court just upended President Donald Trump's trade war.

In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled on Friday that the bulk of Trump's tariffs were unconstitutionally enacted.

Trump had rested his trade agenda on a peculiar interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a statute that empowers the president to “regulate” transactions in response to “unusual and extraordinary” threats amid national emergencies.

In the administration's view, that law had authorized them to impose tariffs on more or less any nation, since America's trade deficit constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States.

But the idea that a trade deficit represented such a calamity was disputed by most economists and legal scholars. And it was never clear that the IEEPA authorized broad tariffs in any case: “Regulating” a transaction is not necessarily the same thing as imposing a tax on imports. Further, many constitutional scholars argued that Congress could not constitutionally give presidents completely open-ended authority to impose new tariffs, given that the legislative branch is supposed to hold the power of the purse.

On Friday, the Supreme Court endorsed this view. “The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion. “In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”

The Court's decision could have profound economic consequences for ordinary Americans — at least, if the president does not find new legal rationales for reconstructing his tariff regime.

Since taking office, Trump has massively increased taxes on imports. In January 2025, the average US tariff was 2.5 percent. A year later, it is at about 17 percent — the highest since 1932 — according to the Budget Lab at Yale.

This has taken a toll on the US economy. By taxing various foreign-made industrial inputs — from steel to semiconductors to lumber — Trump has made it more expensive for American companies to produce things. And by taxing imported goods, he's driven up retail prices. As a result, he has made America's industries less productive and its households less wealthy than they otherwise would have been.

According to a recent analysis from the Budget Lab, Trump's tariffs had been poised to slow economic growth by 0.4 percentage points in 2026. If maintained indefinitely, his trade regime would have left the American economy persistently 0.3 percent smaller, effectively shedding $100 billion off our national wealth, year after year.

The tariffs were also likely to raise America's price level by about 1.3 percent in the short run. This would have effectively cost the average household about $1,750 in annual income, due to higher expenses. Making matters worse, by depressing consumption and investment, the tariffs were set to marginally increase unemployment. In the Budget Lab's model, joblessness rises by 0.6 percentage points by the end of 2026, relative to its level in a world without the tariffs.

The Supreme Court's decision has — for the moment — made much of this harm disappear.

According to the Budget Lab's report released Friday, the Court's ruling brought America's average tariff rate down to 9.1 percent. If Trump enacted no further trade restrictions, that would translate into:

The only major benefit of the tariffs has been their impact on federal deficits. Trump's trade agenda is now poised to raise only $1.2 trillion in revenue over the coming decade; had his IEEPA tariffs remained in place, that figure would have been more than twice as large.

Nonetheless, taken together, the overturning of the tariffs would provide a significant economic stimulus — increasing the average household's real annual income by nearly $1,000, accelerating growth, and reducing unemployment.

And all that is before accounting for the impact of tariff reimbursement payments: When the government levies an illegal tax, it isn't allowed to retain that revenue. Rather, every importer that paid a tariff this year is now entitled to a refund — one paid back at a 6 percent annual interest rate, compounded daily. To make full restitution, the government will need to send out more than $100 billion to US businesses.

The stimulative impact of those reimbursements will likely be modest. The government won't immediately mail out $100 billion in checks. Rather, every affected importer will need to individually apply for relief, a process that could take years. Nevertheless, reimbursements will boost business revenue — and thus potentially, investment — at the margin.

Trump enacted most of his tariffs using the IEEPA for a reason: Since that statute is meant to facilitate swift presidential action during an emergency, it doesn't require the administration to complete any onerous bureaucratic process before imposing import taxes. By contrast, the White House cannot invoke many other tariff powers without conducting investigations and/or hearings.

Nevertheless, those other powers are considerable. The Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the president to enact duties of unlimited scale on foreign countries that engage in unfair trade practices. Trump is already using this law to place tariffs on Chinese goods.

Separately, that law authorizes the president to impose across-the-board tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days, in response to a large trade deficit.

The Trade Expansion Act of 1962, meanwhile, allows the administration to impose tariffs when imports threaten America's national security. Trump has already interpreted this authority expansively: In the administration's account, cheap foreign-made cabinets are a threat to the US homeland.

Taken together, these laws — along with a handful of others — could allow Trump to reimpose virtually all of his tariffs. In January, Trump's top trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, said that the administration would replace any invalidated emergency tariffs using alternative legal authorities.

But the process of rebuilding Trump's trade regime could be lengthy and cumbersome.

To enact tariffs in response to unfair trade practices, the US trade representative must conduct an investigation demonstrating such cheating, a process that can take months. Likewise, to impose duties in the name of national security, the Department of Commerce must document the supposed threats in question.

This said, the administration can immediately enact temporary, 15 percent tariffs on any country it wishes. That would buy it 150 days to conduct sham investigations authorizing permanent tariffs through other authorities.

Thus, tariffs will decline slightly in the short term. But in the longer run, they could eventually creep back up to something approaching their current level.

All this said, the Trump administration has strong political incentives to pare back its trade war. Americans' top concern is the cost of living. And they overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump's handling of both trade and inflation.

Trump may have dismissed such polling as “fake news.” But he appeared to have been rattled by the GOP's dismal showing in the 2025 elections. The morning after Democrats stomped to victory in Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, and other states, Trump declared on Truth Social, “Costs are coming way down. Affordability is our goal.”

In this context, the White House might see an adverse Supreme Court ruling as an opportunity to reset its trade policy — without needing to explicitly admit error. By claiming that his hands have been tied by a corrupt judiciary, Trump could seek to replace some, but not all, of his tariffs without losing face.

If Trump wants to make America poorer in service of his economically illiterate trade ideas, however, he can probably still find a way.

Rather, it will just force Trump to pursue such self-sabotage in a more laborious and bureaucratic manner.

An esteemed American economist isn't feeling good about where things are headed.

Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and Columbia economist, said he believes the US economy would continue to weaken when speaking to CNBC about his macro outlook on Thursday. That's largely due to a handful of issues he sees hanging over the US, he said, pointing to tariffs, a decline in jobs, and interest rates in particular.

""Not great right now, and the prospects are that we're just going to get worse,"" Stiglitz said of his economic outlook.

His downbeat sentiment regardi g the US economy doesn't square with recent growth figures. GDP grew at a robust 4.4% in the third quarter, and is expected to have expanded by 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to the latest estimates from the Atlanta Fed.

But there are a few under-the-surface details that suggest the economy isn't on a good path, Stiglitz suggested. Here's what explains his pessimistic view about where the US is headed:

President Donald Trump's tariffs are hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court, but should they stick around, the import taxes are expected by many economists to raise prices for consumers.

Moreover, the inflationary impact of tariffs is regressive, meaning they're expected to impact lower-income consumers the most, Stiglitz said.

An analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale University found that, over the short run, tariffs are expected to hit the bottom 10% of US households the hardest, reducing disposable income by an estimated 3.5 percentage points.

""If you look at who is paying these tariffs, it is the lower-end people in terms of percentage of their incomes,"" Stiglitz said. ""It's regressive and it's distortive.""

President Trump has said that tariffs would help jump-start a revival in America's manufacturing sector, but a recovery isn't yet visible in broad-strokes employment data, Stiglitz said.

Manufacturing, one of the US's largest industries, is estimated to make up around 10% of GDP.

Employment in the manufacturing sector has declined for more than two years straight, according to data from the Labor Department.

""The decline in blue-collar jobs is even larger,"" Stiglitz said. ""The point is there's a mismatch between what they say — they've done these policies, these are the results.""

Stiglitz also pointed to the push from the Trump administration to lower interest rates.

In particular, he pointed to recent comments from Kevin Warsh, Trump's Fed Chair nominee, who said that AI could unlock a productivity boom in the US. In that scenario, the economy could grow without stoking inflation, meaning the US could have room to lower interest rates more than markets expect.

Stiglitz said he was ""most disturbed"" by Warsh's comments.

Among investors, the fear is that the central bank could lower rates prematurely, which could lead to hotter inflation down the line.

Additionally, if the Fed were to be seen as caving to political pressure to cut rates, that could undermine the Fed's credibility, which could also unanchor inflation expectations.

""I don't think there's any significant body of thought that thinks that AI productivity increases are going to percolate into the macro economy fast enough to justify any significant or with any impact on rate increases. And the fact that he said that, to me, was very worrisome,"" Stiglitz said.

President Donald Trump says he is directing federal agencies to declassify UFO files. For traders betting on aliens, that could mean a very earthly payday.

""Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday night.

Earlier on Thursday, Trump took aim at former President Barack Obama, accusing him of improperly discussing classified material when speaking about extraterrestrial life on a recent podcast.

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Obama ""gave classified information"" and wasn't ""supposed to be doing that,"" adding that he could get him ""out of trouble"" by declassifying the relevant files.

Obama said in a tongue-in-cheek exchange with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen last week that aliens are ""real"" and that they're not ""being kept"" at Area 51. He later clarified in an Instagram post that there was no evidence during his presidency that aliens ""have made contact with us.""

Aliens have always had a niche following. In prediction markets, aliens are tradable assets.

On the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, guessing about aliens has become a high-volume betting category. Traders have poured millions of dollars into whether the US will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life.

One of the platform's largest markets asks whether the US will confirm that aliens exist before 2027. The market has drawn more than $4 million in trading volume as of Thursday.

Betting activity has also centered on whether a Trump administration would declassify UFO files before 2027, with odds climbing above 80% in December.

Polymarket users also placed bets on other extraterrestrial theories, including whether mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey were aliens.

If the files are released and contain anything definitive, longtime alien bettors may finally cash in.

In November 2024, unidentified drones were seen flying at night over New Jersey and other East Coast states.

The mysterious sightings unsettled residents and drew questions from local officials, fueling a wave of speculation about what — or who — was in the sky. Alien theories quickly gained traction.

At that time, Trump said the government ""knows what is happening"" but wasn't sharing it.

""For some reason, they don't want to comment. I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows, and our president knows, and for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense,"" he said at Mar-a-Lago.

""Something strange is going on,"" he added.

A Facebook group titled ""New Jersey Mystery Drones — let's solve it"" has grown to more than 81,000 members as of writing. Users in the group continue to float the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement, alongside speculation about commercial or military craft.

Meta is dialing back the metaverse to mean something far less futuristic: an app on your phone.

The company, which spent billions of dollars to build Horizon Worlds — an immersive, virtual hangout zone on its Quest virtual reality headsets — is ""shifting focus"" for Horizon Worlds ""to be almost exclusively mobile,"" according to a blog post published on Thursday.

Horizon Worlds is part of Meta's Reality Labs division for VR products and smart glasses, a unit that has burned nearly $80 billion since 2020.

""Last year, we began to experiment with Worlds as a mobile platform, and we saw positive momentum,"" wrote Samantha Ryan, Meta's vice president of content at Reality Labs. ""Now, to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we're going all-in on mobile.""

The move signals how dramatically Meta has redrawn its VR ambitions.

Last month, Meta laid off roughly 10% of Reality Labs employees, closed three VR gaming studios it owned, and stopped releasing new content for Supernatural, a popular VR fitness app it acquired in 2023.

Meta said it is still committed to virtual reality hardware and supporting third-party developers who create games for it. 

""We're in it for the long haul,"" Ryan wrote, and pointed to the company's ""robust roadmap of future VR headsets tailored to different audience segments.""

Meta invested nearly $150 million in VR developer platforms in 2025, Ryan wrote, and she said that popular games like ""The Thrill of the Fight 2,"" ""Hard Bullet,"" and ""UG"" had earned ""millions"" in revenue.

Still, she wrote that 86% of the time people spend in Meta's headsets is in third-party apps, not its own. The pivot to mobile effectively pits Horizon Worlds against entrenched competitors like Roblox and Fortnite that cater to casual mobile gamers rather than VR enthusiasts with headsets.

On Meta's latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg pitched Horizon as the natural home for ""immersive 3D"" content: AI-generated scenes, objects, and mini experiences. Now, rather than putting on a headset, people could just spin up that content with a prompt and then share it straight into Instagram, Facebook, or Threads, he said.

At xAI's Palo Alto headquarters, engineers cheered.

It was February 2, and they'd just received a memo from Elon Musk, informing them the AI startup would be acquired by his rocket company, SpaceX. In a Slack channel for the team that trains the company's chatbot Grok, memes flowed, and a few changed their profile pictures to depict themselves as astronauts.

The excitement was quickly overshadowed by the pressure building inside the startup racing to catch up with rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic, while preparing for an expected IPO.

Over the past six months, Musk has become deeply involved in day-to-day operations. He's run a massive group chat that's active at all hours, directed product changes, reassigned engineers, cut staff on key teams, and launched intensive ""war rooms"" to accelerate development. Several current and former employees said that the level of involvement has altered how the company functions. Leadership roles have narrowed, projects have shifted quickly, and teams have been pushed into what one described as a constant ""fire drill.""

Musk said that the changes are necessary as the company scales and the team's lean structure will be the secret to its success. Discussing xAI's restructure following the SpaceX acquisition, he posted on X:

""As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism.""

Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter.

Musk's memo about the SpaceX acquisition talked of building a ""sentient sun"" and data centers in space. Separately, the company reassured staff that little would change in their day-to-day work as the company geared up for an initial public offering that could value it at $1.5 trillion.

Within a week, however, the tone in the office had shifted. Two of the company's cofounders, Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu, announced they'd resigned as Musk restructured the company and narrowed their responsibilities. The leadership departures increase risk at ""a sensitive stage"" ahead of the company's IPO, said Dimitri Zabelin, a senior AI analyst at PitchBook.

One employee described co-founder Ba's departure as ""incredibly disheartening,"" saying Ba, who studied under ""Godfather of AI"" Geoffrey Hinton, was one of the most respected researchers at the company.

In the following days, nearly a dozen employees took to Musk's social media site to say they had also left the company. Some had departed weeks earlier. A few left of their own volition. Others were affected by a restructuring following the SpaceX merger, in which Musk cut some members of the teams working on Grok Imagine, the chatbot's image and video generation feature, and the Macrohard team, which was developed last fall to help automate white-collar work, four people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.

Employees say the structural changes — coupled with an increasingly intense work culture since Musk wound down his involvement in President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and began focusing more on the AI startup — have significantly increased the pace and pressure inside the company.

Musk is a common sight at the office. Though he's heavily involved in the day-to-day, Musk does not use the company's Slack workspace, several people said. Instead, he communicates frequently through X, including in a direct message group of more than 300 engineers. Often, researchers will drop ongoing work to address the concerns that Musk flags.

In that chat, according to people familiar with it, Musk shares screenshots of his conversations with other tech executives and points out criticisms of Grok's performance he wants addressed. Late last year, Musk told staff that in conversations with his friends, he had been embarrassed by Grok Imagine's performance. As a result, some workers on the project were called to task, two people said.

Internally, Musk has expressed frustration with the pace of Grok's development. XAI released Grok 4.2 this week. Separately, releases of at least two other products were pushed back by several weeks, according to people familiar with the timelines.

In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game ""Baldur's Gate,"" according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.

Across his companies, Musk has long been known for his intensity. He's said he slept on Tesla's factory floor during the ""production hell"" for the Tesla Model 3 in 2017. The company is now the world's most valuable automaker. Now, xAI is getting the same treatment. Several workers told Business Insider that 12- and sometimes 16-hour workdays are common. Two said managers told them they are expected to respond to Slack messages within 30 minutes, regardless of the time of day.

""Because the company is so small, everything is a fire drill,"" one former worker said.

At any given time, multiple ""war rooms"" operate out of conference rooms at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, employees said. When researchers are ""war-rooming,"" teams temporarily relocate to a shared space to work side by side on specific problems — sometimes for months. At the end of 2025, at least five war rooms were running simultaneously, according to three people. One, they said, was dedicated to teaching Grok how to play one of Musk's favorite video games, ""League of Legends.""

Last year, Musk made it clear within the company that xAI would prioritize improving Ani, a hyper-sexualized, anime-inspired AI companion, people with knowledge of the issue said. He characterized Ani, a virtual companion who is capable of sexual role-play, as a way to set xAI apart from other AI companies.

Some employees told Business Insider they were unsettled by the company's focus on the product. Today, the character is displayed prominently at the company's headquarters. At a company holiday party, paid actors dressed as Ani and another character hosted a robot fight club-style event, according to videos shared on social media.

Several employees said they had joined the company hoping to work on systems that would push the boundaries of science and were discouraged to find significant resources devoted to Ani.

Grok's behavior on social media has also been a source of tension inside the company. Musk has characterized xAI and its chatbot as the ""anti-woke"" counterpart to ChatGPT. Public backlash against the chatbot, including for Grok's series of antisemitic rants and instances in which it digitally undressed people on social media without their consent, has put strain on employees, who have expressed concern about how their place of employment is viewed in the AI space.

Until last year, the company did not have a team of researchers specifically geared toward working on safety concerns associated with its large language model. It hired its first dedicated safety researcher in February of last year, around the same time that the Human Data team — which trains the chatbot — began reporting issues with reviewing large amounts of X user-generated requests for child sexual abuse material. One person with knowledge of the team said it was known within the company that a large portion of Grok usage was adult role-play, and the use case was discussed in several meetings with researchers.

The safety team grew to roughly half a dozen employees before three people left in December, shortly before users on X began reporting instances of the chatbot creating non-consensual sexual images of people, including some minors.

According to people familiar with the team, xAI's safety teams lacked the authority to formally block product launches and were focused primarily on adjusting model outputs after training rather than conducting broad pre-launch risk reviews.

Musk said on X last week that ""everyone's job is safety"" at xAI.

""It is not some fake department with no power to assuage the concerns of outsiders,"" he said.

XAI still has a handful of workers in safety roles and was hiring for additional safety staff in January, according to posts viewed by Business Insider.

Some former workers say the backlash and pace of work prompted their exit. Last summer, xAI shortened its vesting period from the industry standard of one year to six months, making it easier for workers to leave without forfeiting large portions of their equity.

Employee retention challenges are not unique to xAI; OpenAI and Anthropic have faced waves of departures in recent months. Across the industry, AI companies are competing fiercely for a limited pool of top researchers, some of whom have begun voicing concern about the narrowing space for exploratory work as companies increasingly orient themselves toward product over research in the competition to build ever larger models — a dynamic that poses a particular problem for xAI, which is younger and smaller than its main competitors.

Still, some analysts say the race is far from settled. Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, compared the current AI landscape to the early days of the internet.

""I don't think Grok is that far behind, and it's still early in this race,"" Rocco told Business Insider.

Musk has publicly signaled confidence. He told staff last week during the all-hands, referencing xAI's moment of transition: ""There's some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.""

Blue Owl Capital, a leading investor in the data center boom, was unable to arrange financing for a $4 billion data center it is co-developing in Pennsylvania after pitching lenders to help bankroll the project in recent months.

The facility, 80 miles west of Philadelphia in the city of Lancaster, will be occupied by CoreWeave, a provider of artificial intelligence cloud computing services that has become a closely watched name in the AI race for its rapid expansion — and the billions of dollars of high-interest-rate debt it has taken on to fuel that growth.

An executive who arranges debt for major data center deals told Business Insider that the lack of interest in the Lancaster project was due to growing caution among lenders and investors about taking on sizable exposures to AI players with less-than-sterling credit.

CoreWeave has a below-investment-grade rating of B+, according to S&P Global Ratings.

""We saw it. We passed,"" a senior executive at a large specialty lender told Business Insider.

A spokesman for Blue Owl said that the company had ""considered"" third-party financing for the Lancaster project ""as we would with any transaction as we explore alternatives before choosing the most attractive path forward.""

The spokesman added that the project, which he said is already under construction, ""is fully funded, on time, and on budget.""

It is unclear whether Blue Owl has been funding construction entirely from its own capital. If Blue Owl is unable to raise debt for the Lancaster development, it could be on the hook for a potentially huge outlay of cash to pay for the data center's construction.

The situation shows the complications and risks involved in financing the massive buildout of infrastructure for AI computing.

Brennan Hawken, an equity analyst at BMO Capital Markets who covers Blue Owl, said that difficulties to raise debt for the Lancaster project would raise concern.

""I'm not familiar with this deal, but if there is a struggle to find the debt financing, that's a bit of a red flag that I would want to drill into,"" Hawken said.

Business Insider previously reported that major banks had recent difficulty selling off pieces of $38 billion of debt to finance the construction of two data center campuses that will be anchored by Oracle. Banks often sell pieces of such large commitments to other lenders to spread risk and also reap a quick profit.

The slowdown in interest in participating in that financing was due to worries about Oracle's enormous AI spending and whether the tech company's credit rating could be impacted by those outlays. Oracle has since sought to calm the lending market, announcing that it would raise up to $50 billion of cash from stock and bond offerings in order to ""maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet.""

Last summer, CoreWeave announced it would lease 100 megawatts of initial capacity at the Lancaster data center and potentially expand its commitment to 300 megawatts. The company said it would pour up to $6 billion into the project to equip it with chips and other cloud infrastructure.

A month later, in August, Chirisa Technology Parks announced it would partner with Blue Owl and Machine Investment Group to develop the project. The partnership said it would provide $4 billion of funding, an amount separate from CoreWeave's investment, to support the construction of the project's data center facilities.

In the fall, Blue Owl began shopping the development to potential lenders, a person familiar with that effort said.

Blue Owl has been one of the most creative financial architects of the data center building boom. Last year, it structured a deal to partner with Meta in the ownership of a large data center campus that Meta will build and operate in Louisiana. Blue Owl utilized Meta's strong credit to raise $27.3 billion of investment-grade corporate bonds against its share of the project's equity, proceeds that will be used to help pay for construction, according to S&P.

Blue Owl could arrange a similar type of vehicle that could attempt to tap the credit of an investment-grade customer of CoreWeave's who might use the Lancaster facility or Nvidia, the chipmaker that has purchased large stakes in CoreWeave. It could also potentially raise cash for construction debt by tapping large institutional investor clients to pool together a loan, Hawken said.Blue Owl is facing questions after reports emerged that it had permanently halted withdrawals on one of its retail private credit funds.

Much of the development of hyperscale data center campuses has sought to utilize the strong credit ratings and deep pockets of big-tech partners.

Fluidstack, a peer of CoreWeave's, announced a deal last year to lease a 168-megawatt data center in Colorado City, Texas, which will be built by the crypto mining firm Cipher. Google, Fluidstack's tenant for the project, said it would guarantee about half of the $3 billion due under the 10-year lease. Fluidstack signed another similar-sized lease in December with the data center builder TeraWulf that will also provide ""investment-grade credit support.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The world's top TikToker did a $975 million deal. Now the stock behind it is crashing.","https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktoker-khaby-lame-975-million-deal-riding-on-falling-stock-2026-2","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 10:02:00 GMT","

TikTok superstar Khaby Lame's $975 million deal is getting squeezed.

Hong Kong-based Rich Sparkle Holdings last month unveiled plans to merge with Lame's social media and e-commerce business.

The deal made Lame's payout dependent on Rich Sparkle's share price, which has plunged to $11.19 as of market close on Thursday from a high of over $180 last month.

Lame, a Senegalese-Italian creator, built a following with dialogue-free videos mocking overly complicated life hacks, like using a gadget to open a soda can instead of just popping the tab. He is now the world's top TikTok influencer with over 160 million followers.

As part of the deal, Rich Sparkle — formerly a financial printing company — planned to create an AI avatar of Lame to do brand deals and sell products on social media while earning a commission. Rich Sparkle projected Lame's avatar could drive as much as $4 billion in annual product sales.

In return for its IP, Lame's company would get 75 million new shares in Rich Sparkle, valued at $13 each. (That $13 is a guide. Someone actually has to buy the shares for Lame and his team to cash out. So, if the share price of Rich Sparkle tumbles, the value of Lame's stake will fall as well. The same is true if it goes up.)

Rich Sparkle's drop-off isn't affecting Lame's current wealth, as there have been no formal filings indicating that the deal has closed or been approved by the Nasdaq. Lame and representatives for Rich Sparkle did not respond to requests for comment.

Paul Nary, a management professor at Wharton, said it's hard to know what will happen next.

Public details about the business are scarce, and the company's value — based on a projection of how much Lame's fame could be worth — is hard to assess. If Lame's team and Rich Sparkle shared more financial information, it could boost confidence in the company, Nary said.

""Normally, you'd have more specifics on the asset being acquired,"" he added. ""The entire value of the company depends on that person and his related ventures.""

The Lame example highlights the friction many solo creators face in trying to translate their social media fame into big, sustainable businesses.

Using a digital clone of Lame to sell stuff may seem like a wildly futuristic idea. However, digital avatars are becoming increasingly common in the influencer e-commerce playbook, particularly in China.

Chinese platforms like Baidu, JD.com, and Alibaba's Taobao have become hubs for digital avatars to sell on livestreams. AI clones of celebrities or influencers can pull in millions of dollars in a single livestream. The avatar for one Chinese influencer, Luo Yonghao, drove over $7 million in sales during a more than 6-hour selling session last year, CNBC reported.

While humans can appear more authentic to viewers, AI avatars can sell 24 hours a day without breaks and answer viewers' questions in real time.

""After an hour, you start to lose your concentration, you start to lose your voice,"" said Alexandre Ouairy, Director of PLTFRM, a marketing, advertising, and e-commerce agency in China. ""A machine will continue speaking nonstop.""

Lame doesn't narrate his videos, which could make it even easier for his digital avatar to succeed.

""He's got a great following, but it doesn't translate to a parasocial relationship like Mark Rober or Jimmy Donaldson does,"" said Jim Louderback, a creator economy advisor, name-checking the popular science influencer and creator behind MrBeast. ""Because the character he built on TikTok is separate from himself, if he decides to pull back, his character lives on in the digital twinning.""

Rich Sparkle's plan, in partnership with a Chinese marketing agency known as Three Sheep Group, is to use Lame's likeness to craft brand deals and sell products on apps like TikTok Shop, primarily in the US, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

As avatars become ""the latest style of livestreaming in China,"" a lot of Chinese companies believe they can ""copy the same format and do it in other countries,"" said Ophenia Liang, cofounder of the agency, Digital Crew, which helps Western brands break into the Chinese market.

No matter how skilled Lame's partners are at cloning his likeness, it still may be very hard to translate his fame into $4 billion in annual live-commerce sales, the figure that Rich Sparkle said it could hit in its acquisition announcement, the marketers said.

Whatnot, a buzzy platform focused on livestream commerce in the US and a few other markets, said it drove a total of $8 billion in 2025 product sales, as measured by gross merchandise value (GMV). Rich Sparkle's estimate suggests that Lame himself could drive sales equal to half that entire platform.

Sales on other top US social commerce platforms like TikTok Shop are growing quickly, but are still a far cry from those in the Chinese market. During the busiest four-day stretch of the holiday shopping season last year, TikTok Shop said its total US sales were around $500 million.

""Using his digital clone, there would be good revenue,"" Liang said of Lame, but he's unlikely to drive $4 billion in sales.

While the influencer economy is a buzzy category among investors, it has yet to produce an enduring IPO success story, aside from social media giants like Meta and Reddit.

That isn't stopping some creators from dreaming of going public. MrBeast's team has hinted at plans to IPO, for example. The top YouTuber's company was valued at around $5 billion in its latest funding round.

Lame is looking to enter the public markets through a reverse merger. That's when a private company goes public by merging with an existing public company, often called a shell. In this case, the shell is Rich Sparkle, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, with its main financial printing business based in Hong Kong. It reported $6.2 million in revenue in its 2025 fiscal year.

A reverse merger can be a way to access public markets with less time, cost, and scrutiny than a traditional IPO.

""I always think of reverse mergers as a poor man's IPO, because I don't have to spend all this money to get listed, and it's much cheaper than going through the IPO process,"" said Tim Loughran, a professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. ""For investors, they should be wary.""

Other creator economy firms have opted for reverse mergers to list on public markets, including the video app Triller and the Los Angeles influencer collective Clubhouse Media Group. Clubhouse shrunk down to a penny stock and is now traded over the counter. Triller was delisted by the Nasdaq in December after failing to file its SEC paperwork on time. Its market cap has fallen over 90% from its first day of trading.

One risk of running an influencer-fronted public company is reliance on a single personality to drive revenue.

Gaming and esports company FaZe Clan, which went public in 2022 via a special-purpose acquisition company valued at $725 million, relied on one creator for about 20% of its revenue. It sold itself in 2023 for a fraction of its SPAC price, and its influencer business later unraveled in late 2025 after many of its top talent left abruptly amid a contract dispute.

""It would be very difficult to have an IPO for a company that's based entirely on an influencer and personality,"" Wharton's Nary said. ""This is precisely a case of an asset that would be very hard to value and take through a standard IPO process. Having a key man risk, it's tough.""

Social media's most influential tech reviewer said Tesla keeps leaving him on read.

Marques Brownlee — better known as MKBHD to his 20.8 million YouTube subscribers — said he had to take a trip to a nearby car dealership to source his own Tesla Model Y Performance for a January review.

""Tesla stopped talking to me,"" Brownlee said in a recent TikTok, filmed as he picked up the SUV from New Jersey EV dealer George Saliba. ""It's not cause I gave them a negative review.""

Tesla stopped talking to @Marques Brownlee, so he's borrowing one of ours to review #cardealership #carreview #tesla

Automakers typically offer loan cars to influencers and journalists for weeklong test drives, and Tesla has supplied Brownlee with its vehicles in the past.

In 2022, he called the Model S Plaid the ""best overall car of the last decade,"" after a review.

The TikTok clip is the latest sign that the relationship has cooled.

In 2023, Brownlee spoke out after the Cybertruck's delivery event. The pickup, which Musk initially said would have a 500-mile range and a starting price under $40,000, launched with just over 300 miles of range and a $70,000 sticker.

Brownlee said Tesla's reveal was ""straight up not delivering"" on its promises.

He still took delivery of the new car, but sold the Cybertruck after eight months and replaced it with the Rivian R1T, a rival electric pickup.

And in September 20205, Brownlee publicly canceled his $50,000 deposit for two long-awaited Tesla Roadsters.

""Tesla has been sitting with my 50 grand for eight years and hasn't done anything with it, obviously,"" he said on his ""Waveform Podcast.""

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Despite the apparent chill in the relationship, Brownlee's latest Tesla review was largely rosy.

After spending time with the refreshed Model Y Performance — a dual-motor SUV with about 460 horsepower and a starting price of about $59,130 — Brownlee said Tesla still leads in several key areas.

""The thing about testing one and actually driving a Tesla for a while, you start to remember all of the ways that Tesla is still ahead of the competition,"" he said in the video.

He praised the center display as the automotive ""gold standard,"" highlighted improvements to the ride and rear design, and said Tesla's regenerative braking remains best in class.

His review wasn't completely glowing.

Brownlee said he wants more physical controls and argued that the trim doesn't meaningfully sharpen the steering or overall driving feel in sport mode.

He also said Tesla's lead isn't as commanding as it once was, pointing to rising competition from Lucid, Rivian, and General Motors.

It's not the first time Brownlee has turned to Saliba's lot when a carmaker didn't provide a vehicle.

In 2024, he picked up a Fisker Ocean from the same dealership and called it the ""worst car I've ever reviewed,"" setting up a PR firestorm for Fisker.

The automaker pushed back on the review, saying he had driven the car just before an expansive software update.

Fisker filed for bankruptcy three months later.

The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority.

The 6-3 decision centered on the tariffs Trump justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.

Those IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. They include Trump's so-called ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.

In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Trump administration's use of the law to impose taxes on imports, which is normally the purview of Congress, went too far. Trump would need a distinct law from Congress ""to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,"" he wrote.

""What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms,"" he wrote. ""When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.""

The majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the ""major questions doctrine"" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance.

The Supreme Court's decision comes as the United States trade deficit ticked down over the last year, largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. It shrank to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest figure since 2009, before ticking back up in the last two months of the year, Commerce Department data published Thursday showed.

Two groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. The Supreme Court combined the cases and put them on the fast track, holding oral arguments at the beginning of its November term.

IEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to ""regulate"" importation in times of emergency. The Trump administration claimed that it included the ability to impose tariffs — a position no other president has taken.

Lawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress  would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president.

During oral arguments, most justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, said taxes were ""part of the spark of the American Revolution"" and should get careful treatment.

""The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different,"" Gorsuch said. ""And it's been different since the founding.""

Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs.

""Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,"" he wrote. ""The plaintiffs and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or even total embargoes on all imports from a given country. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty.""

The Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion.

But his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.

Big Tech and watch fans could own the crossover piece of their dreams.

Two custom timepieces made by Swiss watch brand Tudor for employee watch collector clubs at Apple and Google are up on the market.

Silicon Valley is a place where flashy watches can be spotted on the wrists of leaders like Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison. The love of watches has bred collectors' groups within some of the biggest companies.

A watch made for an employee group at Apple is up for bidding on watch auction house Loupe This, through February 25. The current bid as of Thursday afternoon stood at $13,500.

The style is part of Tudor's Black Bay collection. Similar pre-owned models typically resell for around $3,000.

The limited Apple collectors group edition features a skull-and-crossbones pirate flag motif with deep ties to Apple's history.

It's a callback to the Steve Jobs era. The late CEO once said in a meeting, ""It's better to be a pirate than join the Navy,"" and the members of the Macintosh team often referred to themselves as pirates, as a former employee described in a blog post. In a nod to those roots, the company flew a pirate flag over Apple's headquarters for its 40th anniversary.

About 82 of these ""pirate"" watches were produced around 2021, according to the Loupe This listing.

A Tudor watch created in collaboration with Google's watch collector group, Watches@, is also for sale on the vintage watch marketplace Wind Vintage.

It's from Tudor's Pelagos collection and features a Google-centric twist that tech fans may recognize: the Google Chrome Dino at the 6 o'clock position on the dial. The design is inspired by the Chrome Dino that pops up when your computer isn't connected to the internet. It's also the character in a game you can play on Google Chrome.

The watch, created in 2024, is listed for $14,900. A similar model sold at an auction on Loupe This last week for $10,451.

Other Pelagos models are reselling for around $4,000 on pre-owned watch marketplaces.

Apple, Google, and Tudor did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Loupe This cofounder Eric Ku said these sorts of collaborations come together through groups reaching out to companies like Tudor for customized watches with their logo and other changes, like an engraving.

They tend to sell for more than base models because of their limited quantities, Ku said, and they attract ""real fans"" of the brands they represent.

The US manufacturing industry is at a crossroads: try catching the leaders where they are or beat them to where the industry is headed.

Edward Mehr sits firmly in the second camp. The thesis of his robotics-enabled manufacturing startup, Machina Labs, is that America's reindustrialization needs to be distributed and flexible. Trying to build the centralized, traditional factories China has perfected is a lost cause.

""It's going to be a miracle to catch up if you want to replicate what they have,"" Mehr told me.

""It's just not the right chess move. We need to try to see if we can leapfrog and then do the next generation.""

We're still in the early stages of robotics in factories. Mehr said the industry is still five years away from a major, ChatGPT-like breakthrough. But there's no shortage of companies giving it a go, including giants such as Tesla and Amazon.

The opportunity is huge, with the manufacturing industry accounting for trillions of dollars. It's also a brutal business to break into. If a robot doesn't immediately help you cut costs or improve efficiencies, there's not much point pursuing it any further. (Example: Amazon's recent ""Blue Jay"" warehouse robot.)

Machina Labs, which specializes in producing complex metal structures for the defense, aerospace, and automotive industries, sees its value-add on two fronts. Its robots can switch between different manufacturing operations, saving the time it would take to retool a factory to produce a new product. It's also portable, meaning there's no need to custom-design factories for specific productions.

The space is crowded, and Mehr acknowledged that competitors are also pursuing portability or flexibility, but typically not both.

""We're almost rethinking a lot of the manufacturing processes from scratch,"" he said. ""If you go to our factory, things are being built in a way that you cannot see in any other place.""

Like many robotics players, Machina Labs now needs to prove its thesis at scale.

The company raised a $124 million Series C round earlier this month from investors including Lockheed Martin Ventures and Toyota's venture arm. It'll use that cash to build a new 200,000-square-foot factory.

The factory will feature 50 robots and initially serve Lockheed Martin. The goal is to produce a few thousand structures every year. That's a significant step up from its current factory, which runs 10 robots and has an annual production of a few hundred.

But what about the humans? Tensions are already high around AI's impact on white-collar jobs. Are blue-collar workers headed to a similar fate?

Machina Labs' new factory will include about 150 human workers, which Mehr said is roughly equivalent to the number of humans who'd work at a robot-free factory. The work is different, but no one seems to be complaining.

Mehr said a recent internal survey found that employees' interest level in the job was exceptionally high. (So much for AI fatigue!)

""You're working with robots. You're working with software. Compared to previously, you had these instructions. You'd follow it daily, over and over again,"" he said. ""Now, you almost feel like you're playing a game.""

The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a huge chunk of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, delivering a major rebuke of the president's key economic policy.

The law that undergirds those import duties ""does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,"" the majority ruled 6-3 in the long-awaited decision.

The ruling is a massive loss for Trump, who has made tariffs — and his asserted power to impose them on any country at any time, without congressional input — a central feature of his second presidential term.

Trump's legal stance ""would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy,"" the majority concluded. And they highlighted that Trump imposed the tariffs without Congress, which has the power to tax under the Constitution.

Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the opinion of the court. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.

The decision noted that before Trump, no president had ever used the statute in question ""to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.""

To justify the ""extraordinary"" tariff powers, Trump must ""point to clear congressional authorization,"" the court wrote. ""He cannot.""

The ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded. That sum could total $175 billion, according to a new estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model.

Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent that the refund process ""is likely to be a 'mess,'"" after predicting that the short-term impact of the court's tariff ruling ""could be substantial.""

Since retaking the White House, Trump has rapidly reshaped America's long-standing trade relationships by imposing a staggering array of import duties that have touched nearly every country on earth.

Many of those tariffs were invoked using a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. They include Trump's near-global ""reciprocal"" tariffs, and separate duties related to the alleged trafficking of deadly drugs into the U.S.

The IEEPA does not explicitly mention tariffs, as the Supreme Court noted Friday. Instead, it allows the president to ""regulate … importation"" of foreign property transactions after declaring a national emergency in order to deal with certain ""unusual and extraordinary"" threats.

The Trump administration has argued that language empowers the president to impose tariffs on foreign goods.

Critics charged that the law does not permit the president to unilaterally impose levies of any size on any country at any time. A federal trade court and a federal appeals court both found Trump's IEEPA tariffs illegal before the Supreme Court took up the case.

The majority of U.S. tariff revenue generated last year came from the IEEPA duties.

Reaction to the ruling quickly poured in, with the loudest voices cheering the demise of the chaotic policy that has been blamed for raising prices and straining long-standing global alliances.

""This ruling is a victory for every American family paying higher prices because of Trump's tariff taxes,"" Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the House Budget Committee's top-ranking Democrat, said in a statement. ""The Supreme Court rejected Trump's attempt to impose what amounted to a national sales tax on hardworking Americans.""

House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Richard Neal, D-Mass., in a statement called the decision ""a victory for the American people, the rule of law, and our standing in the global economy.""

Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a U.S. sneaker industry group, said Friday's ruling ""marks an important step toward creating a more predictable and competitive environment for American businesses and consumers.""

""This ruling provides relief at a time when cost pressures have been significant,"" Matt Priest, president and CEO of the footwear group, said in a statement.

The Distilled Spirits Council, an advocacy group for U.S. liquor makers, responded to the ruling by urging the Trump administration to ""secure a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs"" with top trade partners.

Doing so ""would provide much needed certainty for American spirits exporters while helping ease financial pressures on bars, restaurants and retailers at a time when affordability remains a major concern for consumers,"" said the council's president and CEO, Chris Swonger, in a statement.

Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for trade with the U.S., said in a post on X that the decision ""reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.""

Trump last April unveiled his sweeping reciprocal tariff plans at a much-ballyhooed White House event marking what he had dubbed America's ""liberation day.""

That announcement stoked a sudden market panic, and the tariffs were quickly put on pause. They have since been repeatedly tweaked, delayed and reimposed, adding confusion and further complexity to the administration's tangled web of trade policies.

Other IEEPA-based tariffs include a set aimed at Mexico, Canada and China related to allegations that those countries have allowed the deadly drug fentanyl to flow into the U.S.

Trump, a fierce critic of America's recent history of making free trade deals, has repeatedly praised tariffs as both a bountiful source of federal revenue and a key tool in negotiations with foreign partners and adversaries alike.

He has claimed foreign countries bear the cost of his tariffs, and he has downplayed concerns that the taxes lead to higher prices for Americans. His administration, however, has admitted that the duties are paid by U.S. importers.

Trump has claimed the tariff revenue has been so large that the duties may be able to replace the income tax. He has also floated the idea of sending Americans $2,000 tariff dividend checks.

""We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs,"" he wrote in a recent Truth Social post.

Other estimates are significantly lower: The Bipartisan Policy Center, for instance, tallied U.S. gross tariff revenue in 2025 at about $289 billion. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it had collected roughly $200 billion between Jan. 20 and Dec. 15.

For the IEEPA-specific tariffs, the administration said it has collected about $129 billion in revenue as of Dec. 10.

Ahead of the ruling, Trump and his administration talked up the consequences of the high court striking down the tariffs.

""If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED!"" Trump wrote on Jan. 12.

U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have stated they believed the Supreme Court would not undo the president's ""signature"" economic policy.

The U.S. government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers after the Supreme Court ruled Friday in a 6-3 decision that tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal, a new estimate says.

The potential refunds to a broad range of companies would be for tariffs already collected by the government since Trump slapped on the duties without authorization from Congress.

The $175 billion refund estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model was produced at the request of the Reuters news wire service. The model is a nonpartisan fiscal research group at the University of Pennsylvania.

Multiple importers already have pending lawsuits seeking refunds of their tariffs, citing lower-court rulings that found Trump's tariffs are not legal. 

The Supreme Court ruling on Friday did not say that the federal government could keep the money it has already collected from those tariffs but didn't explicitly address refunds.

The president had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs. He was the first president to ever use IEEPA for that purpose.

Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three conservative members of the high court to dissent from Friday's ruling, warned about the potential logistical difficulty of having to refund tariffs already collected.

""In the meantime, however, the interim effects of the Court's decision could be substantial,"" Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent.

""The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others,"" he wrote.

""As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process is likely to be a 'mess,'"" Kavanaugh wrote.

""In addition, according to the Government, the IEEPA tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars — including with foreign nations from China to the United Kingdom to Japan, and more,"" he wrote.

""The Court's decision could generate uncertainty regarding those trade arrangements."" 

Brian LeBlanc, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group, in a LinkedIn post Friday said ""we estimate"" that the IEEPA-related tariffs that have been ruled illegal constitute ""roughly 60% of the tariffs issued to date.""That's a big deal. Until President Trump replaces those tariffs with alternative authorities, the tariff rate just dropped from around 9.5% to around 5%,"" LeBlanc wrote. ""Refunds are going to be tricky, and we expect the Trump administration to replace most (but not all) of this lost tariff revenue.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection in December said the amount of tariffs collected that would be at risk of having to be refunded was $133.5 billion. 

That tally would have risen since then because of the ongoing collection of duties.

President Donald Trump said Friday that he is considering limited military strikes to pressure Iran over its nuclear program. 

""I guess I can say I am considering that,"" Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors. 

Trump said Thursday that he would make a decision in the next 10 to 15 days on whether to attack the Islamic Republic. He has left open the possibility that a deal could still be reached with Tehran over its nuclear program. 

Trump has previously said an attack on Iran would be ""far worse"" than the limited strikes launched by the U.S. in June against its nuclear facilities.

Oil prices were stable Friday after rallying more than 5% this week as traders price in some risk of imminent U.S. military action. U.S. crude oil fell 28 cents to $66.15 per barrel by 10:39 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent was down 23 cents at $71.43 per barrel.

A massive U.S. military buildup is underway in the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is in the region. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is en route. 

The oil market's biggest fear is that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran could lead to a prolonged disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. 

The strait is a vital chokepoint for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that amount accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.

About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.

Congressional Democrats rejoiced on Friday and Republicans remained divided in the wake of a momentous Supreme Court decision striking down a large portion of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.

""Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement following the decision. ""We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.""

The ruling is a major hit to Trump, who used a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to slap a barrage of tariffs on American trading partners. Tariffs and the economy more broadly will be a key messaging issue for Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections. Primaries start next month leading up to the November general election.

The Supreme Court decision sets up additional potential showdowns in Congress over how to handle Trump's trade war after the U.S. House voted last week to overturn tariffs on Canada.

For Republicans, Trump's tariffs, which have proven largely unpopular in a pivotal election year, are a more complicated issue.

""SCOTUS's outrageous ruling handcuffs our fight against unfair trade that has devastated American workers for decades. These tariffs protected jobs, revived manufacturing, and forced cheaters like China to pay up,"" Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, posted to X. 

""This betrayal must be reversed and Republicans must get to work immediately on a reconciliation bill to codify the tariffs that had made our country the hottest country on earth!"" Moreno continued.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has voted with Democrats in opposition to Trump's tariffs, celebrated the decision. He and other opponents of the trade policy have argued that it is Congress, not the president, that has the constitutional authority to enact taxes and tariffs.

""In defense of our Republic, the Supreme Court struck down using emergency powers to enact taxes,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., posted on X. ""This ruling will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism.""

The court ruled a little over a week after a small group of House Republicans joined most of their Democratic colleagues to overturn Trump's 35% tariff of Canada, though the resolution was largely symbolic since it would requires approval from the Senate and the White House to take effect.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., one of the six Republicans who voted to overturn the tariffs, called the decision ""a common-sense and straightforward ruling by the Supreme Court. 

""The Constitution's checks and balances still work. Article One gives tariff authority to Congress,"" Bacon wrote on X. ""In the future, Congress should defend its own authorities and not rely on the Supreme Court.""

Some Democrats suggested Trump would look for other mechanism to impose tariffs, while some Republicans said that he should do so.""Good news today. The Supreme Court has struck down many of Trump's tariffs. Sadly, this President is absolutely dedicated to making you pay these taxes. He's going to try other ways to keep them in place,"" Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said in a post to X. ""I will continue voting to block Trump's reckless tariffs in the Senate.""

In the House, Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., touted his legislation, dubbed the RELIEF Act, that would trigger tariff refunds to small businesses.

""These taxes stole money from working families and small businesses who were forced to pay them from the very beginning. Now, it's time to start repairing the economic damage these Trump taxes have caused,"" Horsford posted to X.

The legislation is symbolic because its success would require significant Republican buy-in in the GOP-controlled House and Senate. And many allies of Trump suggested the SCOTUS decision would not be the end of the president's tariff agenda.

In this article

It's been nearly one month since tax season opened, and many filers expect bigger refunds due to changes enacted via President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill."" 

But it's still too early to tell how much bigger refunds could be amid limited IRS filing data.

""In some cases, estimates are that over 20% will be returned to the Taxpayer,"" he wrote.

In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump said tax refunds are ""substantially greater than ever before."" 

It's unclear which estimates Trump was referencing. The White House did not respond to CNBC's request for clarification. 

Typically, filers see a refund when they overpay taxes throughout the year via paycheck withholdings or estimated payments. Filers generally have a balance due when they don't pay enough.

Early on Feb. 13, Treasury Secretary and acting IRS Commissioner Scott Bessent told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" the average tax refund was 22% higher so far this season. It wasn't clear how many days of returns Bessent's figure included or what comparison period he used.

IRS filing season statistics released later on Feb. 13 showed the average refund was $2,290 as of Feb. 6, up about 11% from one year prior. The Treasury has not responded to CNBC's requests for comment about the discrepancy. 

However, ""we're still very early in tax filing season,"" Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank, told CNBC.

The filing season opened Jan. 26, and the first batch of IRS data included returns through Feb. 6. Typically, the average refund size ""pops"" in late February once payments include the earned income tax credit or additional child tax credit, Lautz said.   

Currently, ""it's way too early to tell if any data points are durable trends,"" he said. 

As the IRS shares more filing data, the average refund compared with 2025 could increase, according to a Feb. 18 note from Bank of America Securities.

The company expects Trump's tax law changes could create ""about $1,000 of stimulus per household, on average,"" during the 2026 tax filing season. About half of that change could come from the higher cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, and the ""no tax on overtime"" deduction, analysts wrote.  

This refund estimate aligns with October research from investment bank Piper Sandler, which projected that Trump's ""retroactive tax cuts could average about $1,000 per return, though it will be substantially more for some filers.""

In 2025, the average tax refund through Oct. 17 was $3,052, according to IRS data. 

However, individual refunds could vary significantly this season, depending on 2025 withholdings and which of Trump's new provisions impact that taxpayer's situation.

Forty minutes before the federal government revealed that economic growth slowed sharply in the last quarter, President Donald Trump dropped a hint that the incoming data would be weaker.

""The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post at 7:50 a.m. ET.

At 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025. That's a decline of 3 percentage points from the previous three-month period. 

Trump's Friday morning post referred to last year's record-length government shutdown, which began Oct. 1 — the start of the fourth quarter — and lasted 43 days.

The federal funding lapse was expected to take a toll on GDP. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that, depending on its length, the shutdown would shrink annualized real GDP growth in Q4 by up to 2 percentage points.

But economists from Dow Jones were still estimating a 2.5% gain for the period.

Trump has previously revealed economic data before its official release, raising questions about possible policy violations and concerns that traders may be getting a heads-up from the president, who can be briefed on the data before it comes out. 

The Office of Management and Budget not only prohibits executive branch officials from commenting early on such releases, but forbids public statements about them until 30 minutes after they have come out.

A White House official defended Trump's post, telling CNBC on condition of anonymity that the president has consistently pointed out how the shutdown has been a drag on the economy, including by sharing GDP percentage figures ""consistent with his 2% Truth this morning.""

In a Truth Social post in January, Trump indirectly revealed forthcoming nonfarm payrolls data.

The White House at the time admitted that there was an ""inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data"" while attacking the media for ""grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy.""

During his first presidential term, Trump signaled optimism about a blowout jobs report shortly before its release.

Trump's post Friday morning also reiterated his long-running criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates as sharply or quickly as the president wants.

""Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!"" Trump wrote.

He has previously branded Powell with the derisive nickname ""Too Late""; it was unclear if the president meant to misspell the nickname in Friday's post.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's social media post.

Oil prices edged lower on Friday, after President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited military strike to pressure Iran over its nuclear program.

""I guess I can say I am considering that,"" Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors.

International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery fell 43 cents to $71.23 per barrel by 11:10 a.m. ET, erasing earlier gains, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery lost 41 cents to $66.02. 

Both contracts notched their highest settle in six months in the previous session as energy market participants continue to monitor supply risks in the oil-rich Middle East.

The U.S. and Iran have held talks in Switzerland this week to try to resolve a standoff over Tehran's nuclear program. Initial reports of progress, however, gave way to accusations from Washington that Iran had failed to address core U.S. demands. 

Speaking at the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday, the U.S. president said ""bad things will happen"" if Tehran doesn't agree to a deal over its nuclear program. 

Trump added that the world will likely find out over the next 10 days whether the U.S. will reach a deal with Iran or take military action. He later told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wanted an agreement within ""10 to 15 days."" 

His comments come after a significant buildup of U.S. military forces in the Middle East and amid reports the White House is considering fresh military action against Tehran as soon as this weekend. 

Trump said Iran's nuclear potential had been ""totally decimated"" by U.S. strikes on its facilities in June last year, before adding ""we may have to take it a step further or we may not,"" without providing further details.

Iran reportedly said in a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday that Tehran will respond ""decisively"" if subjected to military aggression.

The Islamic Republic has conducted military drills in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz in recent days, as well as joint naval drills with Russia in the Gulf of Oman, also known as the Sea of Oman.

""Everything is in place, or will be by Saturday night, for strikes to commence and so the window opens then,"" Daniel Shapiro, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, told CNBC's ""Access Middle East"" on Friday. 

""Doesn't mean that's going to happen immediately. The president did indicate that he is waiting to hear from Iran whether they are prepared to make concessions on their nuclear program that he's insisting on,"" Shapiro said. 

""I think it's unlikely. We have never seen Iran open to those types of concessions, so I think it is unlikely they will agree to those, which means that in the days coming, the president will have to make that decision on military strikes,"" he added. 

The Trump administration has said it still hopes to reach a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear program, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying on Wednesday that it would be ""very wise"" for Iran to make a deal. 

Martijn Rats, chief commodity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that, while the oil market is ""very well supplied"" on a global basis, there are three factors propping up prices. 

""Worries about Iran, clearly. Also, an unusually large amount of buying by China, simply for stockpiling purposes. It makes you wonder what they are going to do with all these inventories and then also we have very high freight rates,"" Rats told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Friday.

""The factor of those three that is most prominent, of course, is the issue in Iran,"" Rats said. 

Strategists at Barclays said Friday that while equity markets have largely shrugged off the geopolitical noise so far, tensions have been rising since Vice President JD Vance accused Iran of failing to discuss so-called ""red lines,"" alongside reports of increased U.S. military capability in the region. 

""We believe that any strike would likely have to be time limited and with defined targets (nuclear, ballistic missiles), as they were last summer,"" the strategists said in a research note. 

""With midterm elections later this year and the administration prioritizing affordability for US consumers, we suspect their willingness to tolerate a prolonged period of significantly higher oil prices, and potentially casualties too, will be limited,"" they continued. ""So if conflict is imminent it is likely to be short lived, in our view.""

Bath & Body Works Champagne Toast bodywash, with no minimum shipping threshold, is now just a click away for Amazon Prime members.

The mall-favorite brand is making some of its best-selling fragrances, bodywashes, hand soaps and candles available for Amazon's U.S. shoppers. The selection is also eligible for Prime shipping. 

Amazon is the No. 1 online destination for U.S. beauty shoppers, accounting for 47% of the online beauty and personal care market in the U.S. in 2024, according to Euromonitor. Sephora is second with 9% share. Euromonitor estimates 39% of all beauty and personal care sales take place online. 

""Launching our first authorized brand storefront on Amazon allows us to put ourselves directly in the path of the consumer,"" Bath & Body Works CEO Daniel Heaf told CNBC. ""It's about meeting them where they already shop.""

The Amazon launch marks the latest effort by Columbus, Ohio-based Bath & Body Works to expand its access points for customers. Last year, it began selling its products in college campus stores — with a footprint of now more than 1,000 locations — in the company's first points of sale outside its roughly 2,600 owned and franchised stores and its own website.

Heaf joined Bath & Body Works in May after his role as Nike's chief transformation and strategy officer was eliminated by CEO Elliott Hill. 

Heaf recently laid out his ""plan to return [Bath & Body Works] to profitable, sustainable growth."" He calls it a ""consumer-first formula"" with four pillars: creating disruptive and innovative products; reigniting the brand; winning in the marketplace; and operating with speed and efficiency.

The Amazon partnership, Heaf said, ""is the first of many milestones that we'll be delivering this fiscal year against that strategy.""

Before the official storefront launch, Bath & Body Works products were sold on Amazon through third-party resellers. 

Now, Heaf says, the company is attempting to reclaim the brand story on Amazon — and those marketplace sales.

While Amazon has many first-party relationships with brands from Nike to Calvin Klein that use wholesale partnerships as part of their business models, there are few examples of retailers selling on the site that design, manufacture and sell their products entirely on their own. 

For those so-called vertically integrated brands, like Bath & Body Works, Amazon is increasingly filling the role of skilled logistics partner rather than retailer. 

Gap, J.Crew and Everlane are similarly vertically integrated and have small selections of branded products for sale on Amazon. 

Gap began selling what it calls ""core basics for the whole family"" in 2022 through a wholesale relationship, where Amazon owns and sells the products, which are Prime eligible. Gap has said its goal is to reach new or lapsed customers as well as provide existing shoppers the convenience for ""core essentials."" 

Under Bath & Body Works' new agreement with Amazon, the brand will retain ownership of the inventory and control pricing, but will use Amazon's fulfillment partners network for Prime eligibility. 

Everlane declined to comment on its Amazon partnership. J.Crew did not respond to request for comment.

Jewelry company Kendra Scott has an authorized storefront on Amazon after initially opposing the partnership — even though it had wholesale relationships with other retailers, including Macy's and Nordstrom. But over time, the brand began to view Amazon as another opportunity to reach shoppers rather than a competitive threat, according to a person familiar with the company's decision-making, who spoke about internal matters on the condition of anonymity.

On its own website, Bath & Body Works is making it easier for shoppers to place their orders. The company lowered its free shipping threshold to $50 from $100 last month. 

Still, Heaf admits, ""We know that we will never compete with Amazon in terms of their Prime Network. No one is going to be offering next-day shipping. That's just not what we're in the business of. And so I think that by going on Amazon, we are also making our own site more competitive but recognizing that our job is not to build a fulfillment network that can operate at the speed of Amazon.""

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


U.S. markets had a shaky Thursday, pressured by Washington's escalating tensions with Iran and renewed worries over private credit. 

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he will decide within 10 days whether to strike Iran. Concerns over oil supply in the event of military action in Iran pushed oil prices up almost 2% in U.S. trading, and rose further during Asia hours.

Meanwhile, Blue Owl Capital tightened investor liquidity after selling $1.4 billion in loan assets, raising alarms about the stability in the private credit market. Its stock fell nearly 6%, while shares of other asset managers, such as Blackstone and Apollo Global Management, retreated as well. 

""This is a canary in the coal mine,"" Dan Rasmussen, founder and adviser at Verdad Capital told CNBC. 

The combined set of worries led markets lower. The S&P 500 lost 0.28%, putting it near the flat line for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.54% and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.31% down.

In Europe, Airbus stock fell 6% Thursday after the aircraft maker said its deliveries this year would be fewer than analyst expectations. CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC that the supplier-driven engine shortages are ""unsatisfactory.""

But there's some positive sentiment at India's AI Impact Summit. CNBC talked to Microsoft President Brad Smith, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Qualcomm head Cristiano Amon about their views on the artificial intelligence industry, semiconductor manufacturing, competition with China, among other topics.

Memory chip shortage is still the limiting factor for agentic AI, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, told CNBC. 

Nonetheless, Nvidia appears to be going full steam ahead on AI companies. The chipmaker is planning to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, CNBC has confirmed. That would put the startup at a $730 billion pre-money valuation.

— CNBC's Ashley Capoot, Spencer Kimball and Hugh Leask contributed to this report.

Blue Owl sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held in three of its private debt funds, the private market and alternative assets manager said Wednesday, curbing liquidity payments to investors. The concern is that years of ultra-low interest rates and thin yield spreads encouraged lenders to make riskier moves.

Japan's headline inflation rate fell to 1.5% in January, its lowest level since March 2022. The reading ended a run of 45 straight months in which inflation had remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 2%.

Shares of Japanese drugmaker Sumitomo Pharma fell over 12% Friday on what appeared to be profit-taking, a day after the government endorsed the company's iPS cell-based therapy for Parkinson's and heart disease.

Major U.S. indexes fell Thursday as investors shifted away from financials and software stocks. Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Friday. South Korea's Kospi, however, rose more than 2% to touch a record high for the second straight day.

[PRO] Analysts still like Airbus stock despite the aircraft manufacturer providing a conservative delivery guidance for 2026 — here's why.

India is throwing its weight behind AI — but is there substance behind the headlines?

Three years ago, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told an audience in India, ""it's totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation models but you should try anyway."" Altman walked back his comments the next day. 

A couple of years later, China's DeepSeek emerged as a contender to OpenAI's ChatGPT and chatbots from other U.S. tech giants. Indian citizens resurfaced Altman's comment, declaring that China had already proven him wrong.

But can India compete with the U.S.?

In this article

A federal grand jury indicted three Silicon Valley engineers on charges of stealing trade secrets from Google and other technology companies and transferring sensitive data to Iran, prosecutors said Thursday.

Samaneh Ghandali, 41, her sister Soroor Ghandali, 32, and Mohammadjavad Khosravi, 40 — all residents of San Jose — were arrested Thursday and appeared in a federal district court the same day.

The indictment identified the defendants as Iranian nationals. Soroor was in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant student visa. Samaneh later became a U.S. citizen, and Khosravi, her husband, became a U.S. legal permanent resident. Prosecutors said that Khosravi previously served in the Iranian army.

The trio faces charges of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of California.

Prosecutors alleged the three defendants exploited their positions at leading technology firms that develop mobile computer processors to obtain hundreds of confidential files, including materials related to processor security and cryptography. 

Samaneh and Soroor worked at Google before joining a third company identified only as Company 3. Khosravi worked at a separate firm referred to as Company 2, which develops system-on-chip (SoC) platforms such as the Snapdragon series for smartphones and other mobile devices.

SoC is a semiconductor that integrates numerous components, such as graphics processing units and memory, into a power-efficient package. Common SoCs include Qualcomm's Snapdragon, found in most high-end Android phones, and Apple's A-series for iPhones.

In a statement to CNBC, Google said it had detected the alleged theft through routine security monitoring before referring the case to law enforcement. 

""We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident,"" spokesman José Castañeda said. 

The tech giant also pointed to measures to protect its trade secrets, including restricting employees' access to sensitive information, two-factor authentication for work-related Google accounts and logging file transfers to third-party platforms such as Telegram. 

Authorities alleged the defendants routed stolen files through a third-party communications platform to channels bearing each of their first names, before copying the material to personal devices, each other's work devices, and to Iran. 

""The method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities,"" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani. 

The defendants sought to cover their tracks after Google's internal security systems flagged Samaneh's activity and revoked her access to company resources in August 2023. 

According to the indictment, she signed an affidavit falsely claiming she had not shared Google's confidential information outside the company. During that period, a personal laptop linked to Samaneh and Khosravi was used to search for methods to delete communications and to research how long mobile carriers retain message records, prosecutors said.

The couple also allegedly photographed hundreds of computer screens containing confidential information from Google and Company 2, in what appeared to be an attempt at circumventing digital monitoring tools. 

On the night before the pair traveled to Iran in December 2023, Samaneh allegedly took about 24 photos of Khosravi's work computer screen containing Company 2's trade secrets, including its Snapdragon SoCs. 

Prosecutors allege that while in Iran, a device linked to Samaneh accessed those photographs, while Khosravi accessed additional Company 2's proprietary information, such as Snapdragon SoC hardware architecture.

Prosecutors said in the indictment that Snapdragon SoC trade secrets had independent economic value because they were not generally known and could not be readily obtained from Company 2's competitors, who could benefit from their disclosure or use. 

If convicted, each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison for each trade secret charge and up to 20 years for obstruction of justice, along with fines of up to $250,000 per count.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would direct the Department of Defense and other agencies to make public government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life.

Trump said the files that will be identified and released will also concern unidentified aerial phenomena and unidentified flying objects, as well as ""any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.""

In a Truth Social post, the U.S. president said his move was based on the ""tremendous interest"" in the subject, without providing additional details. This comes after he accused former U.S. President Barack Obama of leaking ""classified information"" on aliens. ""I don't know if they're real or not, but I can tell you he gave classified information,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. 

Obama said on Saturday in a podcast that aliens were real, ""but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51."" 

""There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States,"" Obama added.Area 51 refers to a classified U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada, and has been the center of conspiracy theories saying the U.S. government has been conducting research and using the facility for storing extraterrestrial materials and technology. 

Obama had previously said that the first question he wanted answered when he became president was ""Where are the aliens?""

After the podcast on Sunday, the former U.S. president clarified his stance on a post on Instagram, saying that the universe was so vast that the odds are good that there's life out there. 

However, he said that he also saw ""no evidence"" during his presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with Earth."" 

In late 2024, the Pentagon said it had seen 757 new reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs between May 2023 and June 2024, NBC News reported.

Of these, 21 ""merit further analysis"" due to ""anomalous characteristics and/or behaviors,"" the report said, adding that there was no evidence, so far, to substantiate life from another planet being involved in these sightings.

The private credit boom is facing a new test after Blue Owl Capital permanently restricted withdrawals from one of its retail-focused debt funds.

Shares in Blue Owl Capital fell nearly 6% on Thursday after the private market and alternative assets manager sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held in three of its private debt funds.

The biggest portion of the sale came from a semi-liquid private credit fund marketed to U.S. retail investors called the Blue Owl Capital Corporation II, which will stop offering quarterly redemption options to investors, reigniting debate over whether stress was beginning to resurface in one of Wall Street's fastest-growing corners.

""This is a canary in the coal mine,"" Dan Rasmussen, founder and adviser at Verdad Capital told CNBC. ""The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst.""

The broader concern is that years of ultra-low interest rates and thin yield spreads encouraged lenders to make riskier moves, financing smaller, more leveraged companies at yields that appeared attractive compared with public markets, market watchers said.

""Years of ultra-low rates and ultra-low spreads and very few bankruptcies led investors to go further and further out the risk spectrum in credit,"" Rasmussen said. ""This is a classic case of 'fool's yield,' high yield that doesn't translate into high returns because the borrowers were too risky.""

Private credit, which are generally direct loans made by non-bank lenders to companies, have ballooned into a roughly $3 trillion market globally.

Publicly traded business development companies, or BDCs, which are investment vehicles that lend to small and mid-sized private companies and are a major part of the private credit market, are increasingly funded by retail investors rather than institutions, according to Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. 

The Fuqua research, which was published last September, showed that institutional ownership of BDC shares has steadily declined over time, falling to about 25% on average by 2023.

""This trend indicates that retail investors are playing an increasingly large role in supplying equity capital to publicly traded BDC,"" the researchers pointed out.

In 2025, the eight largest members of the S&P BDC Index offered dividend yields which can go up to 16%, with Blue Owl's at over 11%. For comparison, the S&P Global's U.S. high yield corporate bond index 1-year, 3-year and 5-year returns stand at around 7.7%, 9% and 4%, respectively.

""The majority of loans in private credit funds that individual investors tend to own, they're high yield loans. They are, by their nature, somewhat risky,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

""Over the course of the cycle, you can anticipate some material defaults across these funds,"" he added.

Private credit concerns recently resurfaced after investors grew uneasy that AI tools could disrupt traditional enterprise software models, a major borrower group of the industry, adding to existing concerns in over rising leverage, murky valuations and the possibility that isolated borrower stress could reveal deeper systemic weaknesses. 

The First Brands Group collapse last September brought to fore risks in private credit after the heavily leveraged auto-parts maker ran into distress, highlighting how aggressive debt structures had built up quietly during years of easy financing. 

The episode heightened fears that similar risks could be lurking across the market, prompting JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to warn that private credit risks were ""hiding in plain sight,"" warning that ""cockroaches"" will likely emerge once economic conditions deteriorate.

The fundamental problem private market deals have is multi-year commitments that don't line up with quarterly redemptions, said Michael Shum, CEO of Cascade Debt, which builds infrastructure software for private credit and asset-based lenders.

""When times are good, cashflows cover normal redemption requests. When times are bad, requests surge and it becomes a race to the bottom,"" he said.

Blue Owl did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday struck down President Trump's tariff regime in a 6-3 decision.

""No President has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope,"" the court ruling said.

""That 'lack of historical precedent,' coupled with the 'breadth of authority' that the President now claims, suggests that the tariffs extend beyond the President's 'legitimate reach.'""

Bitcoin knee-jerked about 2% higher on the news, rising past the $68,000 level. As has been typical in crypto lately, though, the gain was reversed within minutes, returning to just below $67,000 at the current time.

Crypto's fleeting gains stood in contrast to what's appearing more sustainable in stocks, with the Nasdaq rising 0.6% to a session high.

Earlier Friday, a batch of U.S. economic data showed signs of stagflationary impulses. The U.S. economy grew only a modest 1.4% in the final three months of 2025, the Commerce Department reported. Alongside core personal consumer expenditure prices rose 3% year-over-year, faster than the hoped for 2.9% and up from 2.8% previously.

On a yearly basis, the economy grew 2.2%, which is the slowest growth since Covid year 2020.

""Today's economic data delivered a messy message of both hotter than expected inflation, and slower than anticipated growth,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said. ""The confusing message from today's data confirms the current Fed bias to take their time with monetary policy.""

The US under President Donald Trump's orders could soon strike Iran and that's not great news for cryptocurrencies.

Indeed, analysts told DL News that another Middle Eastern conflict could prompt investors to further derisk, potentially bringing more pain to crypto investors. 

“We're already starting to see the uncertainty there weigh on crypto and equity markets,” Carlos Guzman of GSR Research said. 

The warning comes as Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have lost about half their total value since October, with many analysts saying things could get worse from here.

Bitcoin has long-been touted a hedge against global uncertainty, be that macroeconomic or geopolitical. 

But history has proven that the top cryptocurrency has failed to live up to that title.

“A true bottom requires ownership to change hands, and right now it's kind of like all the same people — it's like, who's the next buyer?” 

Just last year, when tensions flared between neighbours Israel and Iran — with later involvement from the US — investors shorted Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin's price fell sharply following Israel's June 2025 “Operation Midnight Hammer” strike and dipped again later that month when the US joined in. 

Crypto prices then recovered after Trump signalled a pause in attacks. 

This time, though, things are different. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum have slumped severely following a brutal October $19 billion liquidation event that has continued to unwind. 

Bitcoin was trading above $100,000 per coin during last year's strikes and now trades around $67,000.

“In the current context of a bear market, geopolitical headwinds would exacerbate selling pressure on digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, causing prices to decline further,” Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant's head of research, told DL News. 

Regardless of a war, experts added, the bottom is not in, and a large war in the Middle East could do more harm than good. 

“I don't think the bottom's in at all,” Greg Magadini, Amberdata's director of derivatives, said of Bitcoin's price. 

“A true bottom requires ownership to change hands, and right now it's kind of like all the same people — it's like, who's the next buyer?” 

He added that a US strike on Iran would be a de-risking event that immediately sends Bitcoin nosediving, while gold and treasuries would benefit. 

How low could Bitcoin go? Sebastian Serrano, the CEO of crypto exchange Ripio, forecasted Bitcoin dropping as low as $53,000 if bearish momentum following a strike were to continue. 

“That said, if Bitcoin holds its ground and fails to move lower despite the macro headwinds, that would actually be a notably strong bullish signal — demonstrating real resilience in the face of risk-off sentiment,” he said.

Ethereum's recent market performance suggests that blockchain-specific developments aren't the only factor influencing its value. Macroeconomic forces also play a significant role in shaping investors' attitudes toward the market. The Ethereum price, like other assets, responds strongly to changes in interest rates, inflation, and global liquidity.

As digital assets have matured, more analysts have noticed that price changes are less connected to news about specific cryptocurrencies and more connected to the economy as a whole. This shift highlights how Ethereum has evolved from a niche technology to an indicator that may help influence financial conditions. 

When central banks tighten monetary policy, such as raising interest rates or reducing liquidity, assets that people view as risky usually see their value change first. Cryptocurrency often remains in this category because of its unpredictable price swings. Higher rates make safer investments, like bonds or savings, more enticing, reducing the incentive for investors to seek high-risk, potentially high-reward assets like Ethereum. 

On the other hand, when monetary policy is loose, people often rush into the markets. At these times, investors may be willing to allocate additional capital to riskier assets, sometimes seeing crypto as a top choice. This, in turn, drives up the price of ETH and other cryptocurrencies like it.

One study found that changes in monetary policy were linked to changes in cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, between 2019 and 2025. These findings support the idea that ETH price fluctuations aren't totally random, but rather a response to specific triggers that tend to alter investors' confidence in the market. 

Periods of high inflation weaken the value of fiat currencies. This is one of the key reasons why demand for crypto assets rises. During these times, some investors see Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value. They think these assets can keep buying power better than cash, that loses value.

When people lose faith in traditional fiat currencies, like when inflation is high or the economy is unstable, they usually turn to crypto. This situation often creates another boost for ETH's growth, pushing its price higher than what developments in the crypto sector alone could accomplish.

Ethereum seems to behave more like a “macro asset,” meaning its price often moves in sync with other financial markets. When trends seem to tolerate higher risk, capital flows into riskier assets like crypto. In contrast, during low-risk periods, liquidity can be reduced as people sell their tokens. 

An analysis found that Ethereum volatility appears to strongly react to announcements of new U.S. monetary policies. Its sensitivity means that a new macroeconomic shift can lead to dramatic price swings. 

As institutions increasingly treat Ethereum as a valuable part of a diversified investment portfolio, its price has more and more reflected trends in other financial markets. Therefore, economic cycles, signs of inflation, or changes to the central bank that traditionally would affect only equities or bonds now have a tie to ETH as well. 

This change in Ethereum's status has mixed effects: while ETH is considered valuable even to traditional investors, it's no longer an asset that is completely independent from the traditional trading market. For instance, if equities decline because of rising interest rates, ETH may fall too, even if nothing has changed within the Ethereum network. 

Portfolio managers can include Ethereum to diversify portfolios. While it seems like Ethereum is more tied to traditional markets than ever, some analysts argue that having a decentralized currency means it's inherently safer than funds that are directly tied to the market.

Retail investors, analysts, and portfolio managers can use interest rates, inflation data, and global liquidity trends to forecast potential ETH price movements. Traders might look at new policies coming from the central bank to anticipate a sharp price swing in the crypto market. 

Researchers' analyses show how Ethereum's correlation with traditional financial assets has evolved over time. Economic events of the past can be studied to assess a token's long-term stability.

Cryptocurrencies were once seen as totally detached from traditional finance. Many viewed them as digital assets primarily driven by network growth and technical upgrades. However, with increased institutional involvement, it seems like macroeconomic trends and policies are also shaping crypto. Ethereum is now a very important part of the economy, even though its price goes up and down a lot. 

So, even if the technology behind Ethereum stays the same, changes in interest rates, less liquidity, inflation, or changes in how people feel about the market can all make ETH less valuable and less in demand. But if fiat currencies are weaker and monetary policies are more relaxed, people may want ETH more, which could make its price go up. 

For those holding onto Ethereum, paying attention to macroeconomic signals is crucial. Its price is shaped not only by technical deployments but also by global financial conditions. By tracking these metrics, you can better anticipate when macroeconomic shifts might favor or suppress Ethereum.

Altcoin breadth on Binance has deteriorated sharply, with a large majority of tokens now trading below a widely watched long-term trend level, an exhaustion signal that CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost frames as a liquidity problem as much as a price problem.

In a post on X, Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) shared a CryptoQuant chart tracking the share of Binance-listed altcoins trading below their 50-week moving average alongside Bitcoin's price. His headline claim: “LIQUIDITY CRUNCH PUSHES 83% OF ALTCOINS INTO BEAR TREND,” arguing that most investors exposed to non-Bitcoin, non-stablecoin assets are “now in significant difficulty,” particularly those still holding positions.

Altcoin Breadth Breaks Down On Binance

Darkfost's chart, titled “Altcoins performance (Binance)”, shows the percentage of altcoins below the 50-week moving average rising back into historically stressed territory. In his latest read, 83% of Binance altcoins are below that threshold, a sign that weakness is not isolated to a handful of names but spread across the tape.

He also pointed to an even more extreme episode earlier this month. “Since the end of the bear market in 2023, a new record was set on February 7, with more than 92% of altcoins on Binance trading below this key technical support,” he wrote, describing it as a post-2023-cycle high in downside participation.

That stands in stark contrast to the conditions seen during earlier upside phases. Darkfost noted that in March 2024 only 6% of Binance altcoins traded below the 50-week line, and in December 2024 the figure was 7%. Outside of those multi-month windows, he added, at least half of altcoins remained under the threshold, behavior he characterized as meaningfully different from the prior cycle's breadth dynamics.

Darkfost framed the altcoin drawdown as inseparable from Bitcoin's trend and the macro backdrop, suggesting that the market's risk budget has tightened while altcoin supply has expanded.

“The market continues to be driven by BTC's movements, which has been in a downtrend since October 2025 following an ATH at $126,000. At present, BTC's momentum remains highly uncertain, with price still hovering at roughly 46% of its all time high. Rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between the US and Iran, alongside increasingly hawkish projections and tone from the Fed expressed in the latest FOMC minutes, are making the current environment especially challenging for highly volatile assets such as altcoins,” he wrote.

The chart itself marks BTC near the mid-$60,000 range, underscoring his broader point: in a regime where Bitcoin direction is unclear and macro inputs are hostile to duration and volatility, breadth in higher-beta tokens can deteriorate quickly and then stay impaired.

Why The 50-Week Line Matters

Darkfost emphasized the 50-week moving average as a long-horizon filter used by market participants to separate corrective phases from structurally constructive ones. When a majority of tokens sit below it, rallies tend to be narrower, selection pressure rises, and “alt season” narratives become harder to sustain without a decisive shift in liquidity conditions.

He attributed the current setup to “the increase in altcoin supply across the broader crypto market combined with still constrained liquidity conditions,” a combination that can mechanically dilute marginal flows. In that environment, he argued, outperforming becomes less about broad beta exposure and more about understanding how market structure has changed.

At press time, the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin stood at $943.46 billion.

Dubai, UAE, Feb.  20, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 

Pepeto Presale Hits $7.27M While Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered Call for $200,000 Bitcoin 

Goldman Sachs' digital assets team isn't being subtle anymore. Their latest projection puts Bitcoin at $200,000 before this year ends. ETF inflows, big money piling in, and a clearer regulatory picture are all fueling the call (Forbes, January 2026). Standard Chartered backed it up with a $150,000 floor target. Two of the biggest names in finance are saying the same thing. And anyone who's been through a crypto cycle knows what comes next.

Bitcoin runs first. Then altcoins go parabolic. It happened in 2017 when BTC jumped from $1,000 to $20,000 and altcoins did 10x to 100x after that. It happened in 2021 when Bitcoin topped $69,000 and SHIB turned $1,000 wallets into retirement money. Right now BTC is sitting around $67,000. That's a 47% pullback from October's $126,080 high. CoinShares and Nexo say this dip is building the floor for the next move (CNBC, January 2026). Most people are staring at Bitcoin charts. Smart money? It's already loading the altcoins that'll do the biggest multiples once capital rotates.

That's where Pepeto comes in. The presale has raised $7.27M at $0.000000184 per token with three product demos already live. Unlike the coins that made headlines in past cycles, Pepeto isn't built on hype alone. It's built on infrastructure the meme economy has never had.
		



Pepeto Announces Three Working Product Demos as Crypto News Highlights Altcoin Season Forming 

Every previous altcoin season rewarded projects that solved real problems. Most presales in 2026 still ship roadmaps and Telegram stickers. Pepeto took a different approach.

PepetoSwap handles cross chain meme coin trades. Pepeto Bridge routes tokens between fragmented ecosystems. Pepeto Exchange is being built as the central hub for the meme economy. All three exist as working demos right now. After buying $PEPETO, investors get immediate access to test every product before full launch.

""Pepeto was built as infrastructure for a meme economy worth billions but fragmented across dozens of chains,"" said a Pepeto team representative. ""We showed investors working products instead of asking them to trust a whitepaper.""

SolidProof and Coinsult completed dual audits. Zero tax. Created by a cofounder of Pepe. Binance listing confirmed. That combination of live demos, verified security, and exchange access is why the cap is already 70% filled.

Pepeto's 250x Math Makes the Case Before Altcoins Start Moving 

Here's what separates Pepeto from large caps. Bitcoin going from $67,000 to $200,000 is roughly 3x. Strong return. But it won't change your life the way earlier cycles changed lives for people who found the right altcoin at the right time.

Dogecoin reached $90 billion with no swap, no bridge, no exchange, and no audits. Just a logo and a community. Pepeto has three working demos, dual audits, zero tax, and a confirmed Binance listing at a price still starting with six zeros. If Pepeto reaches even a fraction of DOGE's peak, early participants are looking at 250x or more. That turns $1,000 into $250,000.

Staking at 214% APY adds another layer. A $50,000 position generates $107,000 in yearly yield. But don't confuse the yield with the main opportunity. Staking is the holding bonus. The real play is what happens to a six zero token with live products when capital rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins (CoinGecko, December 2025).
		



Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, and Nexo all project Bitcoin heading higher. History says the altcoin explosion follows. This time, it won't be random meme coins catching the wave. It'll be projects with real products, real audits, and confirmed exchange access. Pepeto checks every box at $0.000000184. The investors who found DOGE and SHIB before listings didn't wait. They saw the setup and moved.

The crypto market may feel like a rollercoaster without seatbelts, but even a thrill ride has moments to catch your breath. Bitcoin's recent price swings and Ethereum's bearish technical signals show traders are navigating volatility with caution. Meanwhile, other projects are experimenting with new staking models, tokenomics, and presale mechanisms, signaling a shift toward more structured opportunities rather than just speculative hops. The market is balancing risk and reward, as investors increasingly seek ecosystems offering measurable returns and sustainable growth alongside meme-driven hype.

APEMARS enters this arena as a presale designed for disciplined positioning. Stage 8 pricing at $0.00006651 provides early believers a chance to join before the listing price of $0.0055. With defined stages, heavy community engagement, and Mars-inspired tokenomics, APEMARS encourages commitment over short-term flipping, perfectly timed to ride the momentum of altcoin season.

APEMARS is the structured rocket fuel of altcoin season. Built on Ethereum, the project features a 23-stage presale mirroring a symbolic Mars journey. Stage 8 is currently active, offering an ROI of over 8,169% from the stage price to the intended listing. Early access rewards positioning, with lower prices for early participants, encourages long-term engagement. The presale has raised over $225k, with more than 11.6B tokens sold and 1080+ token holders.

Staking is the core of the APEMARS ecosystem. Offering a 63% APY inspired by Mars' –63°C average, the two-month post-launch lock protects early mission phases and discourages flip culture. Rewards are distributed automatically, allowing holders to earn yield passively while contributing to network stability. APEMARS integrates referral rewards and community missions, creating a high-energy engagement model where committed participants can amplify their positions in a transparent, narrative-driven environment.

Investing $5,000 in Stage 8 of APEMARS ($0.00006651) could hypothetically reach $412,500 if the token hits the listing price of $0.0055. Early-stage pricing and structured progression reward disciplined entry, offering one of the highest ROI scenarios among altcoin presales currently available. This scenario emphasizes strategic accumulation rather than chasing post-launch hype.

Joining APEMARS is straightforward: connect an Ethereum-compatible wallet to the official presale dashboard. Select the desired amount of $APRZ tokens, confirm the transaction, and ensure you retain your wallet's private keys. Stage-based pricing updates automatically, so earlier participation secures lower prices. Engage with the community via leaderboard challenges, referral rewards, and mission-based tasks to maximize benefits. Staking options activate post-launch with a two-month lock, reinforcing long-term holding and commitment-based rewards.

Bitcoin price today decreased by 1.19% to $66,765.15, reflecting short-lived bullish rallies amid a stronger U.S. dollar and hawkish Fed signals. Analysts note that tactical downside moves occur when positioning becomes overly defensive, yet durable advances remain contingent on weaker dollar trends, disinflation, and consistent spot demand.

Recent trading underscores tight liquidity, with rallies quickly absorbed by steady selling pressure. Intraday examples showed Bitcoin spiking to $68,500 before retreating below $66,000 alongside Fed minutes, illustrating fragility in sentiment. Volatility remains muted compared to equities, while long-term holder stress and stablecoin outflows reinforce the cautious environment. Bitcoin news today emphasizes that upside is possible but uneven without broader macro support.

Ethereum price today decreased by 1.56% to $1,966.05. Elliott Wave analysis identifies multiple bullish scenarios, with preferred models projecting moves above $6,000 if critical support levels hold. Technical targets suggest expansion toward $6,673 or $8,000 as multi-year consolidation completes its cycle.

The key levels at $1,384, $883, and $356 act as stop-loss thresholds, contingent on holding above them. Analysts emphasize uncertainty in timing, but the overall trend signals higher prices if price structure remains intact. Ethereum price prediction models highlight upside potential aligned with altcoin season momentum, encouraging strategic positioning ahead of expected structural breakouts.



Altcoin season strengthens as Bitcoin and Ethereum navigate measured recoveries. Bitcoin price today shows tactical rallies amid macro uncertainty, while Ethereum price prediction models point to higher targets if key supports remain intact. Both assets highlight cautious optimism in volatile markets, providing a reference framework for strategic positioning.

APEMARS Stage 8 remains a standout early-stage presale opportunity. With over $225k raised, 11.6B tokens sold, and current ROI surpassing 8,169% to the listing price of $0.0055, the project rewards commitment over flipping. Its 63% APY staking model, structured stage pricing, and Mars-inspired narrative create rocket fuel for early believers. Find all the latest information on the best crypto to buy now for BTC, ETH, and other top projects, with APEMARS joining the list of high-potential opportunities in altcoin season.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Crypto Whales Build A ‘Fortress Floor' As Retail Panic Sells The Altcoin Sector","https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-whale-build-fortress-floor-retail-panic-sell/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 06:00:39 GMT","

The crypto market continues to face notable selling pressure, with several leading altcoins struggling to regain upward momentum after months of volatility. Sentiment remains fragile as investors weigh macro uncertainty, liquidity conditions, and the lack of sustained bullish catalysts. While periodic rebounds have emerged, most altcoins remain well below previous cycle highs, reinforcing a cautious environment across the broader market.

A recent CryptoQuant report provides additional perspective on this dynamic. According to the analysis, retail investors appear to be under persistent pressure to sell altcoins, particularly as price weakness and negative sentiment dominate headlines. At the same time, the data suggests a more complex underlying picture. Despite ongoing pressure, certain segments of the market are forming notable buying walls, indicating that demand has not disappeared entirely.

Trading volume across altcoins has risen significantly since Ethereum established its recent bottom, reaching levels that are difficult to compare directly with the previous cycle. This increase in activity, even while prices remain depressed, may reflect repositioning rather than pure capitulation. Importantly, most altcoins have yet to stage meaningful recoveries, suggesting that current participation could represent accumulation, speculative positioning, or a mix of both as the market searches for direction.

The CryptoQuant analysis indicates that much of the current altcoin selling pressure is being driven by retail participants reacting defensively to volatility and prolonged drawdowns. Fear-driven liquidations often emerge during uncertain phases, particularly when liquidity tightens, and price recovery lacks momentum. This behavior tends to amplify short-term weakness, especially across mid- and lower-cap crypto assets.

However, the same data suggests that a portion of this selling volume is being systematically absorbed by larger or more patient market participants. This absorption dynamic typically reflects positioning rather than speculation, as buyers accumulate exposure while sentiment remains fragile. Historically, such phases have preceded structural market transitions, although timing remains uncertain and outcomes are not guaranteed.

Some analysts argue that the current cycle may be characterized by unusually strong preparatory accumulation compared with previous market phases. Elevated spot volumes alongside persistent volatility suggest capital rotation rather than outright market exit in certain segments.

That said, projections about a future altcoin bull phase being significantly stronger than the previous cycle remain speculative. Market structure, macro liquidity conditions, regulatory developments, and Bitcoin dominance will all influence whether such expectations materialize. The data primarily supports a market undergoing redistribution rather than a confirmed bullish reversal.

The total crypto market capitalization excluding the top ten assets continues to show persistent weakness, reinforcing the view that the broader altcoin sector remains under structural pressure. The chart reflects a clear failure to sustain momentum following the mid-2025 rally, with capitalization steadily declining since the last major peak. Recent price action shows the market hovering near roughly $170B, significantly below previous highs and still trending downward.

Technically, the structure appears fragile. Price has moved below the shorter-term moving averages and is testing longer-term support zones. The inability to reclaim these averages suggests declining momentum rather than a consolidation phase. Volume spikes accompanying downward moves also indicate that selling activity remains dominant, not merely passive drift.

Historically, similar configurations have occurred during late corrective phases when capital rotates back toward Bitcoin and larger-cap assets. This typically reflects risk reduction rather than outright market exit, but it nonetheless suppresses altcoin performance for extended periods.

Importantly, the absence of strong recovery attempts suggests liquidity constraints remain a key factor. Unless broader market sentiment improves or Bitcoin stabilizes convincingly, the altcoin segment may continue to face headwinds. At present, the data support ongoing redistribution rather than a confirmed cyclical bottom for the broader altcoin market.

BNP Paribas Asset Management has issued a tokenised share class of French‑domiciled money market fund, recorded on public blockchain infrastructure.

The initiative relies on a permissioned access model on Ethereum, restricting holding and transfers to authorised participants within a regulated framework.

Conducted as an intra‑group experiment, the project leverages the joint expertise of BNP Paribas Asset Management, CIB AssetFoundryTM and BNP Paribas' Securities Services business to test new end‑to‑end fund processes. 

BNP Paribas Asset Management has issued a tokenised share class of an existing French-domiciled money market fund, marking a new step in its exploration of fund tokenisation using public blockchain infrastructure.

The project involved the issuance of a tokenised share class of the BNP Paribas Asset Management money market fund on the public Ethereum network via BNP Paribas' AssetFoundryTM platform. The tokenised shares are issued under a permissioned access model, whereby holdings and transfers are restricted to eligible and authorised participants, in line with applicable regulatory requirements.

This initiative follows BNP Paribas Asset Management's earlier tokenised money market fund issuance in Luxembourg on a private blockchain. This second tokenised money market fund project was implemented using a different technological and operational setup through a public blockchain. Together, these initiatives reflect BNP Paribas' approach to exploring multiple tokenisation and distribution models to better serve the fund managers and their investors.

Leveraging BNP Paribas' cutting edge capabilities across the Group's integrated model

Within this project, BNP Paribas Asset Management acted as the fund issuer. BNP Paribas Securities Services business acted as transfer agent and fund dealing services provider, while BNP Paribas CIB's AssetFoundryTM platform provided the tokenisation and connectivity layer to the public blockchain network. 

Moreover, BNP Paribas' Securities Services business operated the wallet setup and held the private key within the scope of this controlled intra‑group pilot. 

The initiative was conducted as a one‑off, limited intra‑group experiment, enabling BNP Paribas to test new end‑to‑end processes, from issuance and transfer agency to tokenisation and public‑blockchain connectivity, within a controlled and regulated framework.

Public blockchain with permissioned access

The tokenised fund shares were issued on the public Ethereum network with permissioned tokens ensuring that only eligible participants can hold and transfer the tokens, while benefiting from the strength and broad adoption of public blockchain infrastructure.

This approach allows BNP Paribas and BNP Paribas Asset Management to assess, how public blockchains can be integrated into regulated fund structures, while maintaining the highest standards of governance, investor protection, and operational robustness.

Tokenisation is an innovative technology that is being explored across the financial industry for its potential to enhance how investment funds are issued and distributed over time. For money market funds in particular, which play a central role in liquidity management for corporate and institutional investors, tokenisation could be used as an alternative to traditional batch‑based fund processing, including more regular and flexible processing of fund related operations, while preserving the regulated nature of these funds.

“BNP Paribas Asset Management is committed to driving innovation that will ultimately benefits our clients. This second issuance of tokenised money market funds, this time using public blockchain infrastructure, supports our ongoing efforts to explore how tokenisation can contribute to greater operational efficiency and security within a regulated framework.” Edouard Legrand, Chief Digital and Data Officer at BNP Paribas Asset Management

“BNP Paribas' AssetFoundryTM platform delivers key digital-assets capabilities, from tokenisation to network connectivity and wallet-related functionalities within a controlled setup. This initiative allows us to better understand the operational and governance implications of tokenisation for money market funds.” Julien Clausse, Head of AssetFoundryTM (Digital Assets & Tokenisation) at BNP Paribas CIB

“BNP Paribas' Securities Services business transforms innovation into tangible value for our clients. By acting as transfer agent and leveraging the Group's tokenisation infrastructure, we deliver a streamlined and secure operational setup that supports fund processes enabled by public blockchain infrastructure, within a regulated and permissioned context.” Paul Daly, Head of Distribution Product Solutions at BNP Paribas' Securities Services business

Leader in banking and financial services in Europe, BNP Paribas operates in 64 countries and has nearly 178,000 employees, including more than 144,000 in Europe. The Group has key positions in its three main fields of activity: Commercial, Personal Banking & Services for the Group's commercial & personal banking and several specialised businesses including BNP Paribas Personal Finance and Arval; Investment & Protection Services for savings, investment and protection solutions; and Corporate & Institutional Banking, focused on corporate and institutional clients. Based on its strong diversified and integrated model, the Group helps all its clients (individuals, community associations, entrepreneurs, SMEs, corporates and institutional clients) to realise their projects through solutions spanning financing, investment, savings and protection insurance. In Europe, BNP Paribas has four domestic markets: Belgium, France, Italy and Luxembourg. The Group is rolling out its integrated commercial & personal banking model across several Mediterranean countries, Türkiye, and Eastern Europe. As a key player in international banking, the Group has leading platforms and business lines in Europe, a strong presence in the Americas as well as a solid and fast-growing business in Asia-Pacific. BNP Paribas has implemented a Corporate Social Responsibility approach in all its activities, enabling it to contribute to the construction of a sustainable future, while ensuring the Group's performance and stability.

As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, blockchain is emerging as a foundational technology to enhance cybersecurity by providing tamper-proof records, decentralized authentication, and secure data sharing. This makes things such as the Solana price of great importance, as they now fundamentally affect the viability and security capabilities of such systems. The latest Solana price updates are available on Binance, providing traders and investors with real time data.

In the age of modern technology, everything has become that much more convenient. Processes that used to require substantial labor, effort, and time now occur in a matter of seconds with the push of a button. And yet, for all the good this has done, it has also sewn the seeds of disaster within modern digital systems. For as much as consumers have become reliant on fast-paced, reliable technology to serve their every whim, this same technology has left people unexpectedly vulnerable.

If you wanted to keep information safe in decades past, it meant keeping a literal, physical document protected from potential harm. It was as simple as keeping the document close by, storing it in a safe location, and not letting other people who might wish to use its information maliciously see it. Today, however, nothing is quite that simple. Thanks to digital tools, much of your personal information is not stored securely with you, but rather in multiple databases spread across the internet. To this end, cybersecurity is extremely important to take seriously to keep all your valuable information protected, and blockchain technology is offering some bold new solutions.

Attacks like ransomware, phishing, and data breaches are escalating in frequency and complexity. Traditional centralized security systems are vulnerable to single points of failure. As technology has continued to advance rapidly over the last several years, many institutions (especially those more rooted in classical practices) have failed to keep pace with this digital learning curve. Because of this, those wishing to breach the sensitive information these businesses hold often operate with far more advanced technology and do so with ease.

To adequately protect people's valuable information, these companies need to not only update their security systems now, but also adopt a methodology that enables them to continually update and evolve their systems into the future. The hackers who are looking to profit from others' misery are not going to stop using newly developed technology to gain an edge, which is why businesses have a responsibility to adopt security advancements that can outpace them; advancements like blockchain.

Current systems store user data on centralized servers, making them tempting targets for breaches. For example, if a hacker breaches a single server, they can obtain the private information of thousands of different users at once. Therefore, they present high-risk but high-reward opportunities for malicious parties, and as technology continues to advance rapidly, security measures have required even greater improvements.

Recent incidents have demonstrated the scale of this vulnerability. Organizations across healthcare, finance, and retail sectors have experienced compromises that exposed millions of user records. Any organization that handles sensitive data must be able to prevent attacks and react fast because these systems are centralized, making it easy for attackers to obtain data once they gain access.

Blockchain provides a permanent, verifiable record of transactions, aiding in detecting tampering or unauthorized access. Logs stored on the blockchain are transparent and resistant to alteration. All of this makes the technology more dependable over the long term and capable of verification.

Blockchain also enables secure, user-controlled identities through decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Users authenticate without sharing sensitive personal data, reducing the risk of breaches.

IoT networks are especially vulnerable due to device sprawl and weak endpoints. Fortunately, blockchain can authenticate devices and ensure the integrity of data transmitted across networks.

Companies and agencies are now testing blockchain to safeguard internal communication, supply chains, and critical infrastructure. As blockchain security solutions grow, performance and cost-efficiency become important. Networks like Solana are often evaluated for these traits. These factors can influence the Solana price based on its utility and interest from institutions.

Blockchain is not a full cybersecurity solution. It complements existing protocols but does not replace them. Integration with AI, zero-knowledge proofs, and regulatory clarity will define its future in cybersecurity. Moving forward, the future looks promising for blockchain, though, and its potential further applications.

In 2020, when cryptocurrency first became enormously popular among segments of online investors, many general consumers were quick to dismiss the use of such digital currency. However, in the years since, coins such as Solana have proven their value and capability to go the distance. To this end, it's no surprise that similar technology, in the form of blockchain, is now being used to strengthen cybersecurity protocols, allowing even the most traditional institutions to evolve their security measures and better protect consumers' personal data.

London, United Kingdom, 20th February 2026, ZEX PR WIRE, CT3 has announced the launch of the CT3 On-Chain Commerce Ecosystem – a Web3 layer for businesses that enables companies to distribute digital products through NFT access keys backed by decentralized storage.



With this release, CT3 introduces a full-cycle flow for digital commerce: sellers upload a digital product to CT3, receive an NFT “key,” and list it on supported marketplaces. When the NFT is purchased, ownership transfers to the buyer's wallet, and the buyer can instantly access and download the file via CT3. The first marketplace integration has already been successfully launched with OpenSea.

Why it matters

Digital sales are still burdened by payment gateways, chargebacks, manual fulfillment, and fragmented tools. CT3 replaces this complexity with a wallet-first model: purchase → ownership → instant delivery, available globally and 24/7, without the need for traditional storefront infrastructure.

Advantages vs Existing Solutions









About CT3

CT3 is a company that has been operating since 2022 and is developing a decentralized cloud storage solution: you upload a file, it is stored across a distributed network, and access is granted through an NFT key. This approach virtually eliminates the risk of shutdowns, data leaks, and makes cyberattacks significantly harder: data is split into fragments and stored on different nodes, access is controlled cryptographically, and the system does not rely on a single provider- so there is no single point of failure.

At the core of CT3's philosophy are three principles: security, anonymity, and freedom of speech. The company believes that everyone has the right to protect their data, maintain privacy, and express their thoughts freely without fear of censorship or information leaks.

Invitation for sellers to collaborate

CT3 invites sellers of digital products to collaborate – including licenses, subscriptions, tickets, certificates, promo codes, private releases, as well as databases and datasets. Anyone looking for wallet-native distribution with automated delivery and a verifiable usage status can contact CT3 to join the first wave of merchants.

Real-time market monitoring

SINGAPORE, Feb 20, 2026, 14:38 SGT

On Friday, Ether changed hands at $1,955.79, slipping 0.73% in the previous 24 hours. About $18.0 billion worth of Ether was traded, according to data from CoinMarketCap. (CoinMarketCap)

Ethereum's narrative is once again in flux. This round, some investors are pointing to “utility” NFTs—think ticketing or licensing projects—as the main driver, instead of yet another hype cycle. Meyka, in a Feb. 19 note to UK clients, pegged ether at $1,963.24, down 1.39% for the day, highlighting that the relative strength index (RSI) was sitting close to 30, a mark plenty of traders see as oversold territory. The note also pointed to a wave of enterprise-grade NFT platforms now touting features like custody, fiat rails, KYC requirements and even dispute resolution. Meanwhile, project teams keep diversifying: Ethereum, layer-2 rollups, and competitors like Solana are all in play as efforts to shave down costs and hunt liquidity ramp up. (Meyka)

The back-and-forth spilled into Polymarket, with users putting down $1.17 million on a bet about ether's price at noon ET on Feb. 19. The contract referenced Binance's one-minute ETH/USDT close, according to the platform's own rules. In the end, the market paid out “yes” for ether above $1,500 and $1,900, but not for levels above $2,000. (Polymarket)

Prediction markets are now facing criticism of their own. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin—who was among the early backers of Polymarket—flagged concerns on X, cautioning that the space could slide into “corposlop” fixated on “low-value gambling.” He specifically pointed to short-term bets on crypto prices, according to Business Insider. (Business Insider)

Macro risks are still front and center for major tokens. “No major catalyst looks set to push [cryptocurrencies] higher,” said Gerry O'Shea, head of market insights at Hashdex, in comments to Barron's, highlighting lingering uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy and the broader economy. Bitcoin hovered around $67,088 as late U.S. trading wound down Thursday; ether edged up about 0.3%, per Dow Jones Market Data referenced by Barron's. (Barron's)

Utility isn't just about NFTs, and plenty of it flies under the radar. Meyka, in a Feb. 11 note, highlighted things like enterprise pilots for luxury authentication, tokenized loyalty programs—think loyalty points as tokens—and Scope 3 emissions reporting, which tracks indirect emissions across a company's value chain. According to the note, these applications generate steady, smaller on-chain transactions, which help drive both base fees and validator income—the payouts for network operators. (Meyka)

Ethereum keeps it simple: each transaction comes with a gas fee, usually settled in ether. Should transactions with steeper fees pick up and remain, validators pocket more, potentially lifting demand for the token that covers those costs.

The key question: which network gets the action. Layer-2s bundle up transactions, return them to Ethereum, which keeps user fees down. Solana, with its lower costs, is pushing to capture the rapid-fire, smaller trades—exactly the kind of volume that first gave NFTs their buzz.

The center of gravity doesn't always stay put. Should “utility” end up as just another marketing tagline and liquidity start drying up, bids might vanish, price floors could plunge, and wash trading—fake deals that puff up volume—can scramble key trading signals.

On-chain analytics platform Parsec has shut down after five years of operation, founder Will Sheehan confirmed in a public statement, citing shifting market conditions and changes in on-chain activity.

Describing the closure as “the end of the road for parsec,” Sheehan said the company struggled to stay aligned with how the market evolved. “The market zigged while we zagged a few too many times,” he wrote.

Parsec began in early 2020 as a side project focused on charting Uniswap v1 activity. During DeFi Summer and the broader 2021 market expansion, it developed into a full DeFi analytics terminal. The platform provided customizable dashboards and on-chain data tools used by traders and firms tracking decentralized finance markets.

Sheehan said Parsec's most significant traction came during the 2022 deleveraging cycle. He referenced major events including the collapses of Wonderland, Olympus, Terra, and the 3AC/stETH depeg, noting that firms and traders relied on Parsec to navigate the volatility and liquidation events that followed.

According to Sheehan, decentralized finance activity changed materially after the collapse of FTX. He stated that DeFi spot lending leverage “never really came back in the same way,” adding that on-chain behavior evolved into patterns the team did not fully understand.

While the platform experienced temporary spikes in usage—including dashboards tied to Friendtech and a Polymarket election tracker that drew several hundred thousand visits in a single night—those moments did not translate into sustained product momentum. Sheehan described the increasing ephemerality of crypto trends as a structural challenge.

Reflecting on the company's lifespan, he acknowledged making “about a thousand mistakes” but expressed pride in the team he built. He also reiterated his belief that DeFi can reinvent traditional finance and open opaque legacy systems, a vision he said he continues to hold.

Parsec will not continue operations, but Sheehan said he plans to remain active in the industry through writing and other contributions.

Parsec's focus on DeFi and NFT data tracking came at a time when market activity has evolved from its earlier patterns, with slower growth in these segments and less leverage in key DeFi protocols than in prior cycles. NFT sales volumes fell during 2025 compared with 2024, reflecting cooler market interest in that sector.

Parsec also experimented with artificial-intelligence-powered tools such as Parsec Agent, which used language models to analyze market activity and social sentiment. Despite these efforts, the project has decided to end services and return funds to paying users.

The closure of Parsec arrives amid broader consolidation in the crypto analytics space as some firms struggle to maintain relevance and sustainable business models in a shifting market environment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO wins battle in fight to fine tech retailer £500k","https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/ico_wins_battle_in_protracted_fight/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 10:25:00 GMT","

The UK's data protection watchdog has scored a small win in a lengthy legal battle against a British retail group that lost millions of data records during a 2017 breach.

You can read Lord Justice Warby's decision, handed down yesterday, here [PDF].

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) originally fined DSG Retail £500,000 ($673,000) in 2020, the maximum financial penalty allowed under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA 1998) – the relevant legislation at the pre-GDPR time.

Its monetary penalty notice (MPN) was upheld by the Court of Appeal's first-tier tribunal but later reversed by the upper tribunal [PDF], which sided with DSG Retail and, if that decision was final, would have effectively nullified the ICO's fine.

Important to the case is the nature of the data that was stolen. Hackers installed malware on 5,390 tills across consumer electronics stores Currys PC World and Dixons Travel, both of which DSG owns.

The malware went unnoticed for nine months, hoovering up 5.6 million payment card details and the personal information belonging to around 14 million people, the ICO confirmed when issuing its MPN.

Then-commissioner Steve Eckersley said at the time that the ICO's findings were ""concerning"" and related to ""basic, commonplace security measures,"" that ultimately showed ""a complete disregard"" for customers' data.

The point of contention, central to the protracted legal case, is whether the card details the attackers scooped up could be used to identify cardholders. The trove of personal data accessed separately from the payment details is not something being debated in this case.

Crucially, the card details involved were the long 16-digit card number and expiry dates, but not the names on the cards.

DSG argues that this specific aspect of the case does not amount to a personal data breach since the hackers could not identify people from the payment card details alone. DSG acknowledges that it, as an organization, could make the link between the card data and real individuals, but says the attackers could not.

The upper tribunal ruled against the ICO, arguing that the case should be viewed from the perspective of the attackers. If they couldn't use the card data to identify people, then that data should not be considered personal data within the context of a DPA 1998 offense. 

Lord Justice Warby concluded on Thursday that this argument was incorrect, siding with the ICO, sending the case back to the first-tier tribunal which ruled correctly in the first instance.

His judgment challenged the upper tribunal's interpretation of the law, saying that personal data must be viewed from the perspective of the controller; if it can lead to the identification of an individual, in this case, at DSG Retail, then it is personal data.

The relevant statute requires data controllers to safeguard this data, regardless of whether a third party could use it to identify individuals.

Lord Justice Warby added that the upper tribunal's thinking could lead to confusing consequences if that was indeed the correct interpretation of the DPA 1998.

The same approach would effectively free data controllers of the burden of protecting data in the event of a ransomware attack, for example, provided the attacker could not use it to identify people.

""It is implicit in the reasoning of the UT, and in DSG's submissions, that such interventions are essentially harmless from the perspective of data subjects, so long as the malicious actor is not able to identify the people to whom the data relate, so that a duty to guard against them would be pointlessly burdensome,"" Lord Justice Warby ruled. ""I do not accept that.""

He went on to discuss the possibility of jigsaw identification, whereby attackers could use the vast amounts of personal data that are accessible online, through various sources, as a means to identify the cardholders.

""Technology has vastly increased in sophistication. The ability to locate, assemble, and combine disparate items to elicit information about individuals is greatly enhanced. It will often prove impossible to rule out the risk that unauthorized access to part of a data set, which does not itself identify any individual, could lead to processing by some unknown third party with (legitimate) access to the means of identification.""

Now that the Court of Appeal has ruled that DSG had a legal duty to safeguard the payment card data as personal data, the first-tier tribunal will review the case within the context of this judgment.

DSG could appeal the tribunal's decision, sending it back again to the upper tribunal. If disputes remain, it could become a matter for the UK Supreme Court.

Binnie Goh, general counsel at the ICO, said: ""Today's judgment is a significant victory, bringing much-needed clarity for people affected by cyber attacks as well as industry. 

""We welcome the CoA's confirmation that organisations must protect all personal data they process, regardless of how it might be used or exploited by hackers. This recognises that even if hackers can't identify people individually from stolen datasets, cyberattacks can and do still cause real harm.  

""With the rising threat of cybercrime, this decision strengthens our ability to take robust action in the future and sends a clear message to all organisations: you have a protective duty to safeguard the personal data you hold."" 

Curry's PLC, the current trading name of DSG Retail, did not respond to our requests for comment. ®

Joachim Nagel, president of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, has called on Europe to take “decisive measures” to boost its economic self-reliance in the light of increasingly strained relations with the United States. To support this effort, he backed the European Union's proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, and euro-denominated stablecoins.

Speaking at the New Year's Reception of the American Chambers of Commerce Germany, held in Frankfurt on Monday, Nagel said EU officials were “working hard” toward the introduction of a retail CBDC, while also suggesting Euro-denominated stablecoins could contribute to “making Europe more independent in terms of payment systems and solutions.”

After covering a range of topics related to EU-U.S. relations, including the importance of trade, the mutual stock of direct investment, and the increasingly “shaky” transatlantic partnership, Nagel veered on to what he perceived as priorities for the EU and its central banks going forward.

“The European Union's recent political agenda places significantly more emphasis on Europe's strategic priorities,” said the Deutsche Bundesbank president. “We in Europe have to take decisive measures to boost our economic dynamics.”

Nagel narrowed this broad goal down to three specific measures. First, simplifying regulations in the EU to enhance the competitiveness of the European economy, including digital solutions that work across the Eurozone. Second, more investment in energy and digital infrastructure, especially renewables and artificial intelligence, and third, the EU should “channel efforts into supporting the international role of the euro.”

On this latter matter, Nagel emphasized that the Eurosystem was working hard to introduce the digital euro as a retail CBDC for payments.

“This will be the first pan-European retail digital payment solution, based solely on European infrastructures,” he said.

In addition, he said that more “exploratory work” has been underway on the possible introduction of a wholesale CBDC as well, which would allow financial institutions to make programmable payments in central bank money.

These efforts were framed by the ongoing tension with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, who has described the EU as a “foe” on trade and imposed tariffs on the bloc. This international falling out has resulted in a push from the EU for greater independence and economic resilience.

With this in mind, Nagel also made a pitch for boosting euro-denominated stablecoins, painting it as a practical move, “as they can be used for cross-border payments by individuals and firms at low cost.”










On top of escalating diplomatic tensions, it seems likely that this euro drive is also motivated by the overwhelming global dominance of U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins—in keeping with the long term dominance of the U.S. dollar generally—and a booming stablecoin sector that reached a total market capitalization of over $300 billion in December 2025, and saw a Citi (NASDAQ: C) report from October predict it will achieve a $1.9 trillion valuation by the end of the decade.

Whatever the reasons, the influential German central bank appears to be increasingly throwing its substantial weight behind both a euro CBDC and euro stablecoins, suggesting momentum may be picking up steam toward these assets finally being realized.

Digital euro progress

The EU and European Central Bank (ECB) have been working on the digital euro since 2021, with the ECB being the driving force behind the project.

The process has been slow, largely due to legislative feet-dragging from the EU parliament. However, last September, ECB executive board member Piero Cipollone hailed a “major breakthrough,” after EU finance ministers agreed on a framework for customer holding limits, a key feature for controlling usage and safeguarding bank deposits.

“The discussion at the level of member-states is going very well,” he said. “The middle of 2029 could be a fair assessment.”

This was followed, in October, by the ECB announcing seven companies with whom it signed framework agreements for various digital euro components and services. Specifically, for alias lookup, risk and fraud management, app and software development kit, offline solution, and secure exchange of payment information.

Most recently, earlier this February, the ECB issued a call for experts to participate in two workshops focused on the role of technical service providers in supporting market readiness for the digital euro.

This represented further progress, but the ECB was still keen to reiterate that “the final decision on whether to issue a digital euro will be taken only once the relevant EU legislation has been adopted.”

The federal government is expanding tax reporting requirements and guidance for cryptocurrency brokers and exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, amid an explosion of digital currency trading and asset diversification.

That means more filing scrutiny and transparency requirements for some Illinois taxpayers. 

Illinois is one of the nation's largest holders of digital currencies, ranking No. 8 among states with the largest average value of crypto owned per holder, according to Coinbase.

The state follows federal tax codes concerning digital assets — imposing taxes on profits that must be reported on an Illinois tax return. 

Residents should also be aware of several other important factors before reporting their crypto assets and any gains or losses this tax season, according to experts.

“Since 2014, the IRS has come out and explicitly said that all virtual currency, including crypto, is property, and it's taxed essentially under the same general principles as other property, like stocks or real estate,” said Adam Ansari, a tax and estate planning attorney at Clark Hill's Downtown office. “So when you sell crypto, you are likely selling capital gain property.”

Digital assets can include:

Taxpayers must report transactions that result in income, gains or losses during the tax year, according to Nicholas Slettengren, founder of Count On Sheep, a San Diego-based crypto tax advisory firm.

“This includes sales, trades, conversions between cryptocurrencies, payments for goods or services made with crypto and any crypto received from mining, staking, airdrops, or interest-bearing accounts,” he said in an email.

Crypto mining is a process that validates crypto transactions and/or mints new digital coins.

Staking is a way for asset holders to earn rewards by using their crypto assets to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions. In return, users receive more of the crypto that was staked, similar to the benefits of interest-bearing bank accounts. 

Airdrop is when a new crypto project launches and sends out free tokens to a select group, often as part of a broader marketing effort for the new currency. Receiving these coins count as a taxable event when the recipient is able to use or access the currency, according to TurboTax.

Using crypto to buy goods and services also creates a taxable event, just like selling it for cash, according to Mark Gallegos, tax partner at Porte Brown's Elgin office.

“So everyday transactions, like buying a cup of coffee with crypto, can technically create a tax reporting obligation,” he said.

How long a filer held their crypto before selling or exchanging it can determine its tax rate, similar to how investments are taxed by the IRS.

If you owned the currency for one year or less before spending or selling it, any profits are typically considered short-term capital gains, taxed at your ordinary income rate that could be between 10% and 37%. If you held it for more than one year, profits are typically long-term capital gains that are subject to tax rates at either 0%, 15% or 20%, according to TurboTax.

Capital transactions, including crypto, should be reported on Form 8949, where taxpayers must report personal sales, trades and crypto positions, including acquisition and sales dates, proceeds, cost basis and the resulting gain or loss. The tally is documented on Schedule D, which summarizes your overall capital gains or losses for the year.

For other income, such as interest earned or staking earnings, these are reported by taxpayers on Schedule B or Schedule 1, said Curt Mastio, managing partner at Chicago-based Founder's CPA.

If you received crypto as income, it's taxed by the IRS as ordinary income based on the fair market value at the time you were paid. And you must report the funds on your return, even if you didn't receive a Form 1099-NEC or W-2.

“When you dispose of or sell digital assets, you generally subtract your basis [or fair market value at purchase] from the fair market value at disposition to compute gain or loss,” Mastio said.

If a filer isn't keeping track of each transaction's capital gains or losses, it can become difficult to untangle when tax season arrives. 

Plus, the IRS may still have ways of tracking your crypto activity, according to TurboTax. Some exchanges that provide filers Form 1099-B will report client trades to the IRS. The federal agency also uses blockchain analytics tools to identify the crypto activity of digital wallets, especially to help spot suspected tax evasion or money laundering.

For the 2026 tax year, crypto brokers and exchanges are required to issue clients a Form 1099-DA, or the Digital Asset Proceeds From Broker Transactions form.

“It will catch a lot of people by surprise ... when it goes into effect,” Slettengren said. “In essence, the IRS knows your crypto holdings and it is time to start paying your taxes now if you have not reported in the past.”

For taxes due in April, service providers like Coinbase or Robinhood were only required to report sales during the calendar year on Form 1099-DA but that stipulation changed on Jan. 1, according to Brian Kearns, founder of Haddam Road Advisors in Evanston.

“Starting in 2026, custodians will also need to provide basis information for gains and losses for crypto assets,” he said. “If your crypto is not held by a custodian, you alone are responsible for reporting gains and losses and for calculating the requisite tax.”

Value and utility are two very different things in the investment world.

For more than a century, no asset class has been able to hold a candle to the stock market in terms of annualized return. Despite its volatility, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC +0.42%) has significantly outperformed commodities, real estate, and bonds over the very long term.

But over the last decade, cryptocurrencies have absolutely crushed the S&P 500 in the return column, with Bitcoin (BTC +1.86%), the world's largest digital currency, leading the way. Over the last 15 years, Bitcoin has catapulted from around $1 per token to approximately $68,500, as of this writing in the late evening of Feb. 15.

There's arguably no asset or investment on the planet that incites more polarizing discussions from professional and everyday investors than Bitcoin. But there's a problem with these debates: they often conflate value and utility. As you're about to see, value and utility are two very different things in the investment world -- especially in the cryptocurrency arena.

In its simplest form, value is determined by the amount investors are willing to pay for an asset. If someone is willing to purchase Bitcoin for $68,500, this very clearly demonstrates the token has value (at least at that specific moment in time).

Whereas value in the stock market is determined by a combination of operating fundamentals and investor perceptions, value for digital currencies is almost solely reliant on perceptions. Without income statements and balance sheets to pore over, emotions tend to rule the roost with Bitcoin and the laundry list of important altcoins.

Bitcoin's stratospheric rise can effectively be boiled down to a handful of investor perceptions.

Firstly, it's one of a relatively small number of digital currencies with a fixed or limited supply. When all Bitcoin are eventually mined, there will be just 21 million tokens in circulation. Just as product scarcity allows businesses to increase their prices when demand is high, the value of Bitcoin has risen due to the perception that it's scarce.

This scarcity also plays a key role in the belief that Bitcoin is an inflationary hedge. With few exceptions, U.S. M2 money supply continues to expand. As the value of fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, is eaten away by inflation over time, a fixed-supply token like Bitcoin is seen as a smart hedge against inflation.

Furthermore, there's the expectation that Bitcoin's blockchain network will become an increasingly utilized peer-to-peer payment platform that operates without the need for centralized financial institutions. For example, the average number of Bitcoin transactions per day has climbed from 200,000 to 300,000 in 2022 to between 400,000 and 600,000 over the last six months. 

Based on these perceptions, Bitcoin has value.

However, Bitcoin having value in no way proves that it offers real-world utility.

On Wall Street, there are plenty of examples of companies with sizable market caps that technically offer no utility. Purely clinical-stage drug developers can potentially sport billion-dollar market caps based on the perception of what one or more of their experimental therapies can do for patients. But until these companies have an approved therapy, they lack utility. If clinical-stage drug developers fail to produce an approved drug, their shares (and market cap) ultimately pay the price.

The perception of value has never been in question with Bitcoin. It has an ardent online following, with some Wall Street analysts and pundits (e.g., Cathie Wood and Tom Lee) also coming to its defense. But Bitcoin fails the utility test.

Although Bitcoin is perceived as scarce, its supply is limited only by lines of computer code that can be changed with developer consensus. Although consensus is highly unlikely, it isn't 0%. In comparison, precious metals like gold and silver are truly finite resources that can't be produced out of thin air. Though we're still in the process of recovering these metals from deep in the Earth, we can't create additional gold or silver beyond what's already present on the planet.

Bitcoin's payment network also lacks a competitive edge. While it's still riding its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin's blockchain network costs in the neighborhood of $0.30 per transaction and, depending on the size of the payment, can take anywhere from 10 minutes to one hour to validate and settle. Comparatively, payment-facilitating coins like XRP and Stellar sport transaction costs that are a tiny fraction of a penny, and they typically settle on their respective blockchain networks in five seconds or less. The point being that several other blockchain projects can run circles around Bitcoin's network where it counts.

We've also witnessed Bitcoin fail the real-world utility test in El Salvador. The Salvadoran government legalized Bitcoin as a form of tender in September 2021, aiming to have its citizens use the token for everyday transactions. Ultimately, data from 2024 showed that roughly eight out of 10 El Salvadorians didn't use Bitcoin. While El Salvador's government continues to hold the world's largest digital currency as a reserve asset, Bitcoin has failed as a medium of exchange.

Given what history tells us, Bitcoin's very limited utility should eventually weigh on its value -- though there's no blueprint or precise timeline for when this might happen.

Does Bitcoin have value? Yes, thanks to investors' perception. But does the world need Bitcoin? Based on the data we have, no, it doesn't.

Introducing the digital euro could cost European banks between €4 billion and €6 billion over four years, European Central Bank Governing Council member Piero Cipollone said on Thursday. The estimate is based on indications received from banks and covers implementation expenses linked to integrating the new digital currency into existing systems.

“Estimates we've come up with based on indications we received from banks point to implementation costs of between 4 and 6 billion euros over four years: that is about 3% of what they spend every year on IT-system maintenance,” Cipollone said while speaking to an Italian parliamentary committee on banks.

The ECB itself expects to spend around €1.3 billion to set up the digital euro infrastructure. Once operational, annual running costs are projected at about €300 million.

The ECB is working with private contractors to develop the infrastructure for a digital-only version of the euro. Under the proposed framework, euro area residents would hold digital euro accounts with the central bank, accessed through applications provided by commercial banks.

Banks would distribute the smartphone applications required to use digital euros for payments. They would also interface with merchants and consumers, effectively acting as the operational layer between users and the ECB's core system.

European Union citizens outside the euro zone would also be able to use digital euros if their national central bank reaches an agreement with the ECB, Cipollone said.

Cipollone said banks would be able to recover their implementation costs through fees charged to merchants for digital euro services. At the same time, the ECB would not charge banks for using its settlement network, removing a cost component typically associated with private payment schemes.

Banks would therefore not need to deduct from merchant fees the amounts normally paid to private payments networks for processing services, he added. Merchants, in turn, are expected to benefit from capped fees on digital euro transactions.

Those caps would be set below current charges imposed by international card networks such as Mastercard and Visa, potentially lowering acceptance costs for retailers.

The ECB is awaiting European Union legislation that would authorize issuance of the digital euro. Policymakers view the project as a way to keep central bank money relevant in an increasingly digital economy and to address fragmentation across Europe's payments systems.

Officials have also argued that a digital euro would reduce dependence on non-EU payment providers, reinforcing monetary sovereignty and economic security within the bloc.

The central bank is selecting lenders to participate in a pilot phase ahead of a planned launch in 2029. If approved by lawmakers, the digital euro would add a publicly issued digital payment option alongside cash and existing electronic banking channels.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday struck down President Trump's tariff regime in a 6-3 decision.

""No President has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope,"" the court ruling said.

""That 'lack of historical precedent,' coupled with the 'breadth of authority' that the President now claims, suggests that the tariffs extend beyond the President's 'legitimate reach.'""

Bitcoin knee-jerked about 2% higher on the news, rising past the $68,000 level. As has been typical in crypto lately, though, the gain was reversed within minutes, returning to just below $67,000 at the current time.

Crypto's fleeting gains stood in contrast to what's appearing more sustainable in stocks, with the Nasdaq rising 0.6% to a session high.

Earlier Friday, a batch of U.S. economic data showed signs of stagflationary impulses. The U.S. economy grew only a modest 1.4% in the final three months of 2025, the Commerce Department reported. Alongside core personal consumer expenditure prices rose 3% year-over-year, faster than the hoped for 2.9% and up from 2.8% previously.

On a yearly basis, the economy grew 2.2%, which is the slowest growth since Covid year 2020.

""Today's economic data delivered a messy message of both hotter than expected inflation, and slower than anticipated growth,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said. ""The confusing message from today's data confirms the current Fed bias to take their time with monetary policy.""

Could aliens in another galaxy see dinosaurs on Earth?

How big would a telescope need to be to see Earth's dinosaurs from 66 million light-years away? Think big—and then think bigger

In last week's The Universe column, I fielded a reader's question about galaxy collisions in an expanding universe. The answer deals with vast distances, inscrutable forces and the ultimate fate of the cosmos.

Not all queries are quite so serious. For example, reader David Erickson had this on his mind: “If there were aliens 66 million light-years from Earth, how big a telescope would they need to see dinosaurs?”

Ha! I love this question. I've thought of it myself but never worked out the math—except to think, “Probably pretty big,” which turns out to dramatically underestimate the actual answer. But what's really lovely is that grappling with this admittedly bizarre thought experiment has some real-life implications for the future of the science.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

First off, why does it matter that the aliens are 66 million light-years away? It's because light travels a distance of one light-year per year through space, and the Chicxulub asteroid impact that wiped out the nonavian dinosaurs occurred about 66 million years ago. The light from that event would just now be reaching a galaxy 66 million light-years away, more or less. At that distance, observers there could still see (the very last of the) dinosaurs, assuming they felt like building a really big telescope.

Now the question needs to be split into two parts: How big is a dinosaur from that distance, and how big must a telescope be to see something that size?

Because the sky looks like a gigantic sphere surrounding us, astronomers use angles to measure apparent size. The basic unit for that is a degree; for example, the angle from the horizon to the point directly above an observer, called the zenith, is 90 degrees. The moon has an apparent size of about 0.5 degree across.

How big an object appears depends on its physical size and its distance from whatever is viewing it. There's a lovely little formula called the small-angle approximation that relates the two. There are a lot of different ways to represent this equation, depending on the units you use. For degrees, you take the object's physical size, multiply it by 57.3 and divide by the distance. So an object that is one meter wide, such as a small wide-screen TV, would have an apparent size of one degree at a distance of 57.3 meters.

For our dinosaur, let's pick everyone's favorite terrifying carnivore, a Tyrannosaurus rex. T. rexes varied in size, but let's say the one the aliens wish to observe is 10 meters long.

The distance is 66 million light-years, which is a bit of a hike. We need that in meters, so after converting (“Let's see, multiply by 10 trillion, carry the 2,” and so on), we get a distance of a staggering 6.6 × 1023 meters.

Plugging that into our formula, we find that a T. rex seen from that distant galaxy would have an apparent size of about 10-21 degree. That's one sextillionth of a degree, or a zeptodegree, if you like fun math prefixes. That's incomprehensibly tiny. But to be fair, it's pretty far away.

Great, that's one of two key questions answered! Now, how big of a telescope do you need to see something so Lilliputian?

You might think what we need is magnification to spot our beast from so far away, but that's not exactly the case. In a nutshell, something small and very far away will look like a dimensionless dot. If you magnify that dot in an image, you're just magnifying pixels. To see it as more than a dot, you need to resolve it. So what we really need to see a T. rex and not a dot is high resolution.

Resolution is an inherent property of all telescopes and depends mostly on the size of the telescope's mirror. There's another formula for that, called Dawes's limit. It too can be expressed in many different ways, but if you use degrees and meters, it becomes: resolution in degrees = 3.2 x 10-5 / D, where D is the diameter of the telescope mirror in meters. We know the size of our object in degrees, so we want to solve for D. When we do so, we find the diameter of our telescope needs to be 3.2 x 1016 meters (32 quadrillion meters).

That's about 3.4 light-years, which would make for, um, a mighty big telescope. That's a mirror that would span three-quarters the distance to Alpha Centauri!

Needless to say, we don't have the tech quite yet to build such a thing. Even if we had the know-how to build this mirror, getting the necessary construction material would be a tall order: given the density of typical telescope mirror glass and assuming a mirror thickness of just one millimeter, our T. rex–resolving mirror would have a mass of about 1030 (one nonillion) metric tons. This turns out to be more than 100 million times the mass of Earth. You'd probably need to raid, destroy and remix a good portion of a big galaxy's rocky planets to build a mirror like that.

If our peeping aliens are especially clever, they might get around this by building an astronomical interferometer instead. This is an array of smaller telescopes spread out over some area; by using sophisticated mathematical techniques, their observations can be combined to mimic the resolution of a single telescope with a size equal to the separation between the two smaller telescopes that are the farthest apart from each other. But even with the material savings from this godlike feat of engineering, we'd still be talking about a billion trillion metric tons of mirror—a decent fraction of the mass of Earth. I'd love to see the alien contractor's face when they get that assignment. (Assuming they have a face, that is.)

Just for fun, let's say our curious alien friends did somehow build a suitable telescope. Other issues would still arise, such as how to point it in the right direction. Just moving it would be a monumental task. Worse, they'd need to keep it locked on our long-dead dinosaur for some time to get a decent exposure. The need to track a target is no small problem because everything is in motion: Earth is spinning and revolving around the sun; the sun is moving through the galaxy; the galaxy is moving through the universe; and the aliens' galaxy is flying around, too. That apparent motion is incredibly small over such vast distances, but remember just how absurdly small the T. rex appears! From 66 million light-years away, a T. rex is pretty faint; at that distance, even the sun would be too faint to see using something like the Hubble Space Telescope. Myriad celestial motions would smear the image out unless somehow corrected for—and I'll admit I have no idea how to manage that. Whether as a monolithic mirror or a fancy interferometric array, the telescope would be so big that relativistic effects would come into play.

All this is somewhat whimsical and fun to fiddle with, but it has real-world astronomical ramifications. One goal of astronomy is to build a telescope powerful enough to actually see details such as surface features and cloud patterns on distant exoplanets, those far-off worlds that orbit other stars. Such a telescope would have to be huge, even if it were an interferometer, but it's technically possible—visually resolving such details on an Earth-sized planet 10 light-years away, for instance, would require a telescope array that stretched a few hundred kilometers across. We aren't ready to build that now, but in a few decades, perhaps.

How amazing would it be to see continents on a planet in another star system? We just need the will to do it; we already have the brainpower. We're not dinosaurs, after all.

Dated to the ninth century C.E., a time when the Vikings ruled the area, the grave held the remains of at least 10 different young men.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

 A team of University of Cambridge students made a giant discovery during a training dig just three miles outside of the city, both figuratively and literally. The dig seemed unpromising at first, but that changed with the discovery of a ninth-century C.E. group burial.

Based on the number of skulls found among the remains, the archaeology team concluded that burial pit in Wandlebury contained the bodies of at least 10 individuals. The most remarkable individual discovered in the pit was a man whose height, at 6 feet 5 inches, was so far above average for his time that he would have been considered a giant. Adding to the intrigue, the giant had a hole surgically bored into his skull. 

“Before we uncovered the first remains, our best find was a 1960s Smarties lid,” said archaeology undergraduate student Olivia Courtney in a statement. “I had never encountered human remains on a dig, and I was struck by how close yet distant these people felt. We were separated by only a few years in age, but over a thousand years in time.” 

The spot on the outskirts of Cambridge was once a frontier war zone during the conflict between the Saxon-run kingdom of Mercia, which controlled the area in the late eighth century under King Offa, and the neighboring kingdom of East Anglia. Around 874, the Viking Great Army sacked the town, and Cambridgeshire was subsequently incorporated into a Viking-ruled kingdom of East Anglia.

The burial pit was probably a result of that conflict, given that all the remains in it were those of young men. The mass grave was a mix of complete and dismembered remains, ranging from skulls without clear accompanying bodies, a stack of legs, and four complete skeletons. Some of the remains were even found in positions suggesting that they had been tied together. Experts believe the young men were tossed into the pit without ceremony, likely after a battle or a mass execution. 

The “giant” was between the age of 17 and 24, face down in the pit. With the average male standing only 5-foot, 6-inches tall in that day, the man would have been considered wildly abnormal. A one-inch-diameter hole in his skull points to a trepanation procedure, which was believed at the time to relieve migraines and seizures.

“The individual may have had a tumor that affected their pituitary gland and caused an excess of growth hormones,” Trish Biers, curator of the Duckworth Collections at the university, said in a statement. “We can see this in the unique characteristics in the long shafts of their limb bones and elsewhere on the skeleton. Such a condition in the brain would have led to increased pressure in the skull, causing headaches that the trepanning may have been an attempt to alleviate. Not uncommon with head trauma today.”

Some of the men had traces of combat injuries, including one who had chop marks on his jaw, indicating that he was beheaded. The way that parts were tossed haphazardly into the pit, including ribs, a pelvis, and legs stacked together on top of corpses, suggested that the burial followed some sort of mass execution.

“Those buried could have been recipients of corporal punishment, and that may be connected to Wandlebury as a sacred or well-known meeting place,” said the university's Oscar Aldred. “It may be that some of the disarticulated body parts had previously been displayed as trophies and were then gathered up and interred with the executed or otherwise slaughtered individuals.”

However, apart from signs of beheading, there isn't much evidence that the body parts were chopped up. Aldred therefore concluded that they may have been “literally falling apart” from decomposition when they went into the pit. “Cambridgeshire was a frontier zone between Mercia and East Anglia, and the continual wars between Saxons and Vikings as they clashed over territory across many decades,” Aldred said. “We suspect the pit may relate to these conflicts.” 

Radiocarbon dating links the bones to the ninth century, but no additional artifacts were found in the pit to help narrow down the date range. Historic England plans to commission a new geophysical survey of the area to learn more about the burial. A Cambridge team will go to work on bone analysis, including ancient DNA and isotopic work, to investigate health, kinship, and ancestral links. The team may also attempt “refitting” to see if they can piece the remains back together to get a more accurate count of buried individuals. 

“I would never have expected to find something like this on a student training dig,” said Grace Grandfield, a Cambridge undergraduate, of the literally giant discovery. “It was a shocking contrast to the peaceful site of Wandlebury.”

Scientists thought they found them all.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Just when experts thought they knew every moai on Rapa Nui, otherwise known as Easter Island, a dried-up lakebed kept them on their toes. These statues—largely made of a stone formed from volcanic ash and dust called tuff—pepper the island, with more than 1,000 already found and logged. 

Finding a new one came as a surprise. And a bit of a mystery.

“We think we know all the moai, but then a new one turns up, a new discovery, and in this case, in the lake, at the statue quarry,” Terry Hunt, professor of archeology at the University of Arizona, told Good Morning America. “There have been no moai found in the dry bed or in what was previously a lake, so this is a first.”

And it may not be the last. 

As the area undergoes drying, the lakebed in question has given up its moai. And this opportunity may occur again. “Under the dry conditions that we have now, we may find more,” Hunt said. “They've been hidden by the tall reeds that grow in the lakebed and prospecting with something that can detect what's under the ground surface may tell us that there are in fact more moai in the lakebed sediments. When there's one moai in the lake, there's probably more.”

The newly discovered moai is also one of the smallest found, leading experts to believe that hidden within these reeds is the potential for a bounty of new moai. 

Created by the Rapu Nui people, moai have a mythical legend attached to them and have gained worldwide renown for their appearances. Some believe these moai were given special powers to walk across land and end up in their resting place. Whether or not the legend has legs, there are many theories regarding how these statues moved from building sites to various locations. 

While the largest of the statues weighs 86 tons and rises 32 feet tall, most of the moai average about half that size. About 95 percent are carved from the volcanic tuff, but a few are made from basalt. Each one is unique, created by carvers to represent the characteristics of the person it resembled, often a chieftain or key leader. 

The finishing touch on moai was the inclusion of special stones for the eyes, not carved or placed  until the statue found its home. 

Even though experts thought they knew the locations of all of these moai homes, finding this new, small one in the lakebed proves some had remained a complete mystery.

“It's here in the lake and nobody knows this exists,” Salvador Atan Hito, vice president of Ma'u Henua, the group that oversees the island's national park, told Good Morning America, “even the ancestors, our grandparents don't know [about] that one.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Doctors implant dopamine-producing stem cells in Parkinson's patients","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260219040820.htm","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 09:05:47 GMT","

Parkinson's disease is a long term neurological condition that gradually worsens over time. More than one million people in the United States are living with the disorder, and about 90,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Current medications and therapies can ease symptoms, but no treatment has been proven to stop or slow the disease itself.

The condition is closely linked to a drop in dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical messenger that plays a critical role in controlling movement, as well as supporting memory, mood, and other essential functions. As dopamine producing brain cells progressively die off, the brain loses its ability to properly regulate movement. This breakdown leads to the hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's, including tremors, muscle stiffness, and slowed motion.

Researchers at Keck Medicine of USC are now testing a new approach that aims to address this dopamine loss directly. In an early phase clinical trial, doctors are implanting specially engineered stem cells into the brain. These cells are designed to replace damaged neurons and generate dopamine.

""If the brain can once again produce normal levels of dopamine, Parkinson's disease may be slowed down and motor function restored,"" said Brian Lee, MD, PhD, a neurosurgeon with Keck Medicine and principal investigator of the study.

Reprogrammed Stem Cells Designed to Produce Dopamine

The treatment uses a newer type of lab created stem cell known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Unlike embryonic stem cells, iPSCs are made by taking adult cells, such as those from skin or blood, and reprogramming them back into a versatile state. In this form, they can develop into many different kinds of cells in the body.

""We believe that these iPSCs can reliably mature into dopamine-producing brain cells, and offer the best chance of jump-starting the brain's dopamine production,"" said Xenos Mason, MD, a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders with Keck Medicine and co-principal investigator of the study.

Brain Implant Procedure and Long Term Monitoring

To deliver the cells, Lee creates a small opening in the skull to reach the brain. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for guidance, he carefully places the stem cells into the basal ganglia, the region responsible for coordinating movement.

After the operation, participants are closely observed for 12-15 months to track changes in symptoms and watch for potential side effects, including dyskinesia -- excess movements -- or infection. Researchers plan to continue following patients and monitoring their condition for up to five years.

""Our ultimate goal is to pioneer a technique that can repair patients' motor function and offer them a better quality of life,"" said Lee.

Keck Medicine is one of three sites in the United States taking part in the study. The multisite clinical trial includes 12 people with moderate to moderate-severe Parkinson's disease.

The stem cell therapy, known as RNDP-001, is produced by Kenai Therapeutics, a biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for neurological disorders. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has granted the clinical trial, Phase 1 REPLACE™, fast-track designation, which is intended to speed up the development and review process.

Disclosure: Mason has received an honorarium payment from Kenai Therapeutics in the past.

The story of how life began on Earth grows even more intriguing when viruses enter the picture. These microscopic particles are thought to have existed since the earliest cells emerged. Unlike living cells, viruses consist only of genetic material and cannot produce proteins on their own. Because proteins are essential for cellular activity and survival, viruses depend entirely on host cells to function.

For decades, scientists have tried to understand where viruses came from, how they evolved, and how they fit into the tree of life. Professor Masaharu Takemura of the Graduate School of Science at Tokyo University of Science (TUS), Japan, has been a leading figure in this effort. In 2001, he and Dr. Philip Bell of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University, Sydney, independently proposed the cell nuclear virus origin theory, also known as viral eukaryogenesis (term coined by Dr. Bell).

This hypothesis suggests that the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (cells whose nucleus is bound by a membrane) may have originated from a large DNA virus such as poxvirus that infected an archaeal ancestor (single-celled microorganisms). Rather than destroying its host, the virus may have established a stable presence in the cytoplasm. Over time, it likely absorbed important genes from the host cell and gradually transformed into what we now recognize as the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. If correct, this theory means viruses may have played a central role in the rise of complex life.

Giant DNA Viruses and Virus Factories

Support for this idea grew in 2003 with the discovery of giant DNA viruses. When these viruses infect cells, they create structures known as virus factories inside their hosts. In some cases, these factories are surrounded by membranes and serve as sites for DNA replication, resembling a primitive version of a cell nucleus. This similarity has strengthened the proposed evolutionary link between viruses and complex cells.

In recent years, researchers have identified additional giant DNA viruses. Among them are members of the Mamonoviridae family, which infect acanthamoeba (a type of amoeba, which is a single-celled microorganism), and clandestinovirus, a closely related virus that infects vermamoeba (another type of amoeba from a different family).

Discovery of Ushikuvirus

In a new study published in the Journal of Virology, Prof. Takemura and collaborators at the National Institute of Natural Sciences (NINS), Japan, describe another giant DNA virus that infects amoeba. The virus, named ushikuvirus after Lake Ushiku in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, where it was isolated, adds further evidence supporting the nuclear virus origin hypothesis.

The research team included Mr. Jiwan Bae and Mrs. Narumi Hantori, Master's degree students at the Graduate School of Science, TUS, along with Dr. Raymond Burton-Smith and Professor Kazuyoshi Murata from NINS.

""Giant viruses can be said to be a treasure trove whose world has yet to be fully understood. One of the future possibilities of this research is to provide humanity with a new view that connects the world of living organisms with the world of viruses,"" says Prof. Takemura.

Unique Structure and Infection Strategy

Giant viruses are widespread in nature, but isolating them is difficult. They are also remarkably diverse, making each new discovery significant. Ushikuvirus infects vermamoeba, similar to clandestinovirus, and shares structural similarities with the Mamonoviridae family, particularly Medusavirus. Medusavirus is known for its icosahedral shape and numerous short spikes covering its capsid surface.

However, ushikuvirus also displays important differences. It triggers a distinct cytopathic effect that causes infected vermamoeba cells to grow unusually large. Its capsid surface contains multiple spike structures topped with unique caps, some with filament-like extensions not seen in medusaviruses.

Another key difference lies in how the virus replicates. Medusaviruses and clandestinovirus reproduce within an intact host nucleus. In contrast, ushikuvirus breaks down the nuclear membrane during replication to produce new viral particles. This behavior suggests a possible evolutionary connection between Mamonoviridae family viruses that use the intact nucleus as a viral factory and giant viruses such as pandoravirus that disrupt the nuclear membrane. Scientists believe these differences may reflect adaptations to different hosts over time.

Clues to Eukaryotic Evolution

By examining these structural and functional variations, researchers are gaining insight into how giant viruses diversified and how their interactions with host cells may have influenced the evolution of complex eukaryotic life.

""The discovery of a new Mamonoviridae-related virus, 'ushikuvirus,' which has a different host, is expected to increase knowledge and stimulate discussion regarding the evolution and phylogeny of the Mamonoviridae family. As a result, it is believed that we will be able to get closer to the mysteries of the evolution of eukaryotic organisms and the mysteries of giant viruses,"" says Prof. Takemura.

Potential Healthcare Implications

The discovery of amoeba-infecting giant viruses may also have practical value. Certain Acanthamoeba species can cause serious illnesses, including amoebic encephalitis. A deeper understanding of how giant viruses infect and destroy amoebae could eventually help researchers develop new approaches to preventing or treating these infections.

Dr. Masaharu Takemura is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Science Education, Graduate School of Science at the Tokyo University of Science, Japan. His research focuses on giant virus biology, viral eukaryogenesis, and virus education. He has published more than 120 scientific papers and has received over 2,500 citations. His long-term goal is to clarify how giant viruses and eukaryotes evolved and to create educational materials that improve virus literacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just mapped mysterious earthquakes deep inside Earth","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260219040818.htm","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 13:07:46 GMT","

Researchers at Stanford University have produced the first worldwide map of an unusual type of earthquake that occurs deep in Earth's mantle rather than in the crust. The mantle lies between the planet's thin outer crust and its molten core. By charting these rare events, scientists hope to better understand how mantle earthquakes work and what they can reveal about how all earthquakes begin.

The findings, published Feb. 5 in Science, show that continental mantle earthquakes happen across the globe but tend to cluster in specific regions. Significant groupings appear beneath the Himalayas in southern Asia and near the Bering Strait between Asia and North America, south of the Arctic Circle. Studying these deep tremors could provide new clues about the crust mantle boundary and the behavior of the upper mantle, which generates volcanic magma and helps drive tectonic plate motion.

""Until this study, we haven't had a clear global perspective on how many continental mantle earthquakes are really happening and where,"" said lead study author Shiqi (Axel) Wang, a former PhD student in the lab of geophysics professor Simon Klemperer at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. ""With this new dataset, we can start to probe at the various ways these rare mantle earthquakes initiate.""

Although these quakes occur too far below the surface to cause significant shaking or damage, they offer valuable insight into how earthquakes form. Understanding their origins may improve knowledge of more common, shallow earthquakes that pose real hazards.

""Although we know the broad strokes that earthquakes generally happen where stress releases at fault lines, why a given earthquake happens where it does and the main mechanisms behind it are not well grasped,"" added Klemperer, senior study author. ""Mantle earthquakes offer a novel way to explore earthquake origins and the internal structure of Earth beyond ordinary crustal earthquakes.""

What Lies Above and Below the Moho

Earth's crust is relatively cool and brittle. In contrast, the mantle is a thick layer of warm, dense rock that behaves more like a slow moving solid and extends about 1,800 miles deep, making up most of the planet's interior. The dividing line between the crust and the mantle is called the Mohorovičić discontinuity, or ""the Moho.""

For years, scientists questioned whether the mantle, which is hotter and more ductile than the crust, could generate significant earthquakes at all. Most continental earthquakes begin about 6 to 18 miles below the surface, well above the Moho and within the crust. Subduction zones are an exception. In those regions, heavy oceanic plates slide beneath lighter continental plates, sometimes producing earthquakes hundreds of miles deep. However, seismic instruments have occasionally detected earthquake origins beneath continents and away from subduction zones, in some cases as much as 50 miles below the Moho.

Over the past decade, growing evidence has convinced many researchers that rare earthquakes do originate in the mantle, though they may occur about 100 times less frequently than crustal earthquakes. Even so, confirming them has been difficult because of limited data.

A Breakthrough in Seismic Wave Detection

To reliably tell mantle earthquakes apart from crustal ones, Wang and Klemperer developed a technique that compares two kinds of seismic waves. These waves travel through Earth after an earthquake, spreading vibrations through the planet much like the ringing of a bell.

One type, called Sn or ""lid"" waves, moves along the top of the mantle in a region known as the lid. The other, called Lg waves, consists of high frequency vibrations that move efficiently through the crust. By measuring the ratio between these two wave types, researchers can determine whether an earthquake started in the crust or in the mantle.

""Our approach is a complete game-changer because now you can actually identify a mantle earthquake purely based on the waveforms of earthquakes,"" said Wang.

Hundreds of Rare Deep Earthquakes Identified

The team analyzed data from seismic monitoring stations around the world and factored in information such as crustal thickness. From an initial pool of more than 46,000 earthquakes, they identified 459 continental mantle earthquakes that have occurred since 1990.

The researchers caution that this figure likely underestimates the true number. Expanding seismic networks, especially in remote regions like the Tibetan Plateau north of the Himalayas, would probably reveal more mantle quakes. Klemperer has spent much of his career studying earthquakes in this remote area. His earlier work on unusual deep quakes there helped inspire Wang to pursue the topic.

With a growing catalog of confirmed mantle earthquakes and a dependable way to detect them, the team plans to investigate what triggers these rare events. Some may occur as aftershocks caused by seismic waves traveling outward from crustal earthquakes. Others could be linked to heat driven convection within the mantle as it recycles subducted slabs of Earth's crust.

Looking ahead, the researchers expect that continued study will shed new light on the planet's inner workings.

""Continental mantle earthquakes might be part of an inherently interconnected earthquake cycle, both from the crust and also the upper mantle,"" said Wang. ""We want to understand how these layers of our world function as a whole system.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find cancer-linked chemicals in popular hair extensions","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260219232620.htm","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 04:33:16 GMT","

A sweeping new investigation by the Silent Spring Institute has found dozens of potentially harmful chemicals in widely sold hair extensions, including those made from human hair. The findings represent the most detailed chemical review so far of this largely unregulated beauty product category. Researchers say the results add strong evidence that hair extensions may pose health risks, particularly for black women, who use these products at much higher rates.

The study was published in the American Chemical Society journal Environment & Health and comes at a time of growing concern about the long term health effects of hair extensions. More than 70 percent of black women report wearing hair extensions at least once in the past year, compared with fewer than 10 percent of women from other racial and ethnic groups. Extensions are often worn for cultural expression, personal style, and convenience.

""While prior reports have found some chemicals of concern in hair extensions, there's still much we don't know about their overall chemical makeup. We wanted to get a better picture of the extent of the problem,"" says lead author Dr. Elissia Franklin, a research scientist at Silent Spring Institute. ""This is an industry that has long overlooked the health of black women, who should not have to choose between cultural expression, convenience, and their health.""

Chemical Treatments and Limited Ingredient Disclosure

Hair extensions are produced from synthetic fibers or bio-based materials, including human hair. Manufacturers frequently treat these fibers with chemicals to make them flame resistant, waterproof, or antimicrobial.

""Yet, companies rarely disclose the chemicals used to achieve these properties, leaving consumers in the dark about the health risks from prolonged wear,"" says Franklin. Because the fibers rest directly against the scalp and neck, wearers may experience extended skin contact. When extensions are heated during styling, they can also release chemicals into the air that users may inhale.

How 43 Hair Extension Products Were Tested

To better understand what these products contain, Franklin purchased 43 popular hair extension brands from online retailers and local beauty supply stores. The team grouped the products by fiber type, synthetic (mostly plastic polymers) or bio-based (including human, banana or silk), and documented the claims listed on their packaging. Among the synthetic products, 19 claimed to be flame retardant, three were labeled water resistant, nine advertised heat resistance, and three promoted ""green"" claims such as ""no PVC"" or ""non-toxic.""

Researchers then applied a method known as non-targeted analysis to search for a broad array of chemicals, including substances not typically screened in consumer goods. Using two-dimensional gas chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry, they detected more than 900 chemical signatures, representing both known and previously unidentified compounds. Machine-learning tools compared those signatures with an extensive chemical database, allowing the team to identify 169 chemicals spanning nine major structural classes.

Cancer Linked and Hormone Disrupting Substances Found

The testing uncovered numerous substances associated with cancer, hormone disruption, developmental harm, and immune system effects. These included flame retardants, phthalates, pesticides, styrene, tetrachloroethane, and organotins.

Key findings include:

""We were especially surprised to find organotins,"" says Franklin. ""These are commonly used as heat stabilizers in PVC and have been linked with skin irritation, which is a common complaint among hair extension users."" Organotins have also been linked with cancer and hormone disruption.

Growing Calls for Stronger Regulation

The global hair extension market is projected to surpass $14 billion by 2028, with the United States leading in global imports. Given the size of the market and the chemicals detected, Franklin argues that more oversight is needed. ""These findings make clear that stronger oversight is urgently needed to protect consumers and push companies to invest in making safer products,"" she says.

Many of the detected substances are included under Proposition 65, suggesting that hair extensions may warrant clearer warnings and closer regulatory scrutiny.

Efforts to change policy are gaining traction. In New York, lawmakers have introduced legislation that would require manufacturers of synthetic braids and hair extensions to disclose all ingredients. In New Jersey, a bill moving through the legislature would prohibit certain harmful chemicals in synthetic hair products.

At the national level, the Safer Beauty Bill Package, introduced in Congress last year, contains provisions that would direct the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the safety of synthetic braids and hair extensions.

Funding for this project was provided by a Beauty Justice Grant from the Environmental Defense Fund and charitable donations to Silent Spring Institute, including the Institute's Safer Chemicals Program.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Air pollution linked to higher Alzheimer's risk in 28 million older Americans","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260220010836.htm","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 06:48:46 GMT","

Older adults who live with higher levels of air pollution are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, according to new research led by Yanling Deng of Emory University, U.S.A. The study was published February 17th in the open access journal PLOS Medicine.

Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia and affects roughly 57 million people worldwide. Scientists have long recognized air pollution as a risk factor for Alzheimer's, as well as for chronic conditions such as hypertension, stroke, and depression. Because these conditions are also tied to dementia, researchers have questioned whether polluted air raises Alzheimer's risk indirectly by contributing to those illnesses, or whether it harms the brain more directly. Another possibility was that existing health problems could make the brain more sensitive to pollution.

Large Medicare Study of 27.8 Million Older Adults

To explore these questions, the Emory team analyzed data from more than 27.8 million U.S. Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older between 2000 and 2018. They compared levels of air pollution exposure with new cases of Alzheimer's disease, while carefully considering the presence of other chronic health conditions.

The analysis revealed that people exposed to higher levels of air pollution had a greater likelihood of developing Alzheimer's. The relationship was somewhat stronger among individuals who had previously suffered a stroke. In contrast, hypertension and depression did not meaningfully increase the pollution related risk.

Direct Brain Effects of Fine Particulate Pollution

Taken together, the results indicate that air pollution may raise Alzheimer's risk mainly through direct effects on the brain rather than by triggering other chronic diseases. At the same time, a history of stroke appears to increase vulnerability, suggesting that certain individuals face compounded risks.

The findings also point to cleaner air as a potential strategy for lowering dementia rates and protecting cognitive health in aging populations.

The authors add, ""In this large national study of older adults, we found that long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution was associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease, largely through direct effects on the brain rather than through common chronic conditions such as hypertension, stroke, or depression.""

""Our findings suggest that individuals with a history of stroke may be particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of air pollution on brain health, highlighting an important intersection between environmental and vascular risk factors.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists reveal how exercise protects the brain from Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260219040752.htm","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 15:20:22 GMT","

Researchers at UC San Francisco have identified a biological process that may explain why exercise sharpens thinking and memory. Their findings suggest that physical activity strengthens the brain's built in defense system, helping protect it from age related damage.

As people grow older, the blood-brain barrier becomes more fragile. This tightly packed network of blood vessels normally shields the brain from harmful substances circulating in the bloodstream. Over time, however, it can become leaky, allowing damaging compounds to enter brain tissue. The result is inflammation, which is linked to cognitive decline and is commonly seen in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

Several years ago, the research team discovered that exercising mice produced higher levels of an enzyme called GPLD1 in their livers. GPLD1 appeared to rejuvenate the brain, but there was a mystery. The enzyme itself cannot cross into the brain, leaving scientists unsure how it delivered its cognitive benefits.

The new research provides an answer.

How GPLD1 Reduces Brain Inflammation

The scientists found that GPLD1 influences another protein known as TNAP. As mice age, TNAP builds up in the cells that form the blood-brain barrier. This buildup weakens the barrier and increases leakiness. When mice exercise, their livers release GPLD1 into the bloodstream. The enzyme travels to the blood vessels surrounding the brain and removes TNAP from the surface of those cells, helping restore the barrier's integrity.

""This discovery shows just how relevant the body is for understanding how the brain declines with age,"" said Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute.

Villeda is the senior author of the paper, which was published in the journal Cell on Feb. 18.

Pinpointing TNAP's Role in Cognitive Decline

To determine how GPLD1 exerts its effects, the team focused on what the enzyme does best. GPLD1 cuts specific proteins from the surface of cells. Researchers searched for tissues containing proteins that could serve as targets and suspected that some of these proteins might accumulate with age.

Cells in the blood-brain barrier stood out because they carried several possible GPLD1 targets. When the scientists tested these proteins in the lab, only one was trimmed by GPLD1: TNAP.

Further experiments confirmed TNAP's importance. Young mice genetically modified to produce excess TNAP in the blood-brain barrier showed memory and cognitive problems similar to those seen in older animals.

When researchers reduced TNAP levels in 2-year-old mice -- which are the equivalent of 70 human years -- the blood-brain barrier became less permeable, inflammation decreased, and the animals performed better on memory tests.

""We were able to tap into this mechanism late in life, for the mice, and it still worked,"" said Gregor Bieri, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in Villeda's lab and co-first author of the study.

Implications for Alzheimer's and Brain Aging

The findings suggest that developing medications capable of trimming proteins such as TNAP could offer a new strategy to restore the blood brain barrier, even after it has been weakened by aging.

""We're uncovering biology that Alzheimer's research has largely overlooked,"" Villeda said. ""It may open new therapeutic possibilities beyond the traditional strategies that focus almost exclusively on the brain.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists uncover oxygen-loving ancestor of all complex life","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260220010825.htm","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 06:21:49 GMT","

Scientists widely agree that complex life emerged after two very different microbes formed a close partnership. That merger eventually gave rise to plants, animals, and fungi, collectively known as eukaryotes. Yet one key question has lingered for years. How did these two organisms meet if one required oxygen to survive while the other was believed to thrive only in oxygen-free environments?

Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin now report evidence that may resolve that puzzle. Writing in the journal Nature, the team focused on a group of microbes called Asgard archaea, which are considered close relatives of the ancestors of complex life. Although most known Asgards live in deep-sea or other oxygen-poor environments, the new study shows that some members of this group can tolerate or even use oxygen. The discovery strengthens the long-standing theory that complex life evolved as predicted, likely in an environment where oxygen was present.

""Most Asgards alive today have been found in environments without oxygen,"" explained Brett Baker an associate professor of marine science and integrative biology at UT. ""But it turns out that the ones most closely related to eukaryotes live in places with oxygen, such as shallow coastal sediments and floating in the water column, and they have a lot of metabolic pathways that use oxygen. That suggests that our eukaryotic ancestor likely had these processes, too.""

The Great Oxidation Event and Early Eukaryotes

Baker's team studies the genomes of Asgard archaea to identify new branches of the group and better understand how these microbes generate energy. Their latest findings align with what geologists and paleontologists have reconstructed about Earth's early atmosphere.

More than 1.7 billion years ago, oxygen levels in the atmosphere were extremely low. Then oxygen concentrations rose sharply during what scientists call the Great Oxidation Event, eventually approaching levels similar to those today. Within a few hundred thousand years of this dramatic increase, the earliest known microfossils of eukaryotes appear in the fossil record. This close timing suggests that oxygen may have played a crucial role in the emergence of complex life.

""The fact that some of the Asgards, which are our ancestors, were able to use oxygen fits in with this very well,"" Baker said. ""Oxygen appeared in the environment, and Asgards adapted to that. They found an energetic advantage to using oxygen, and then they evolved into eukaryotes.""

Symbiosis and the Birth of Mitochondria

The prevailing model holds that eukaryotes arose when an Asgard archaeon formed a symbiotic relationship with an alphaproteobacterium. Over time, the two organisms became integrated into a single cell. The alphaproteobacterium eventually evolved into the mitochondria, the structure inside eukaryotic cells that produces energy.

In this study, researchers significantly expanded the known genetic diversity of Asgard archaea. They identified specific groups, including Heimdallarchaeia, that are especially closely related to eukaryotes but are relatively uncommon today.

""These Asgard archaea are often missed by low-coverage sequencing,"" said co-author Kathryn Appler, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France. ""The massive sequencing effort and layering of sequence and structural methods enabled us to see patterns that were not visible prior to this genomic expansion.""

Massive Genome Sequencing Effort

The work began with Appler's Ph.D. research at The University of Texas Marine Science Institute in 2019, when she extracted DNA from marine sediments. The UT team and collaborators ultimately assembled more than 13,000 new microbial genomes. The project combined samples from multiple marine expeditions and required analyzing roughly 15 terabytes of environmental DNA.

From this extensive dataset, the researchers recovered hundreds of new Asgard genomes, nearly doubling the known genomic diversity of the group. By comparing genetic similarities and differences, they built an expanded Asgard archaea tree of life. The newly identified genomes also revealed previously unknown protein groups, doubling the number of recognized enzymatic classes within these microbes.

AI Analysis of Oxygen Metabolism Proteins

The team then examined Heimdallarchaeia more closely, comparing their proteins to those found in eukaryotes that are involved in energy production and oxygen metabolism. To do this, they used an artificial intelligence system called AlphaFold2 to predict the three-dimensional shapes of the proteins. Because a protein's structure determines how it functions, this analysis provided important clues.

The results showed that several Heimdallarchaeia proteins closely resemble those used by eukaryotic cells for oxygen-based, energy-efficient metabolism. This structural similarity offers additional support for the idea that the ancestors of complex life were already adapted to using oxygen.

Other contributors to the study included former UT researchers Xianzhe Gong (currently at Shandong University in China), Pedro Leão (now at Radboud University in the Netherlands), Marguerite Langwig (now at the University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Valerie De Anda (currently at the University of Vienna). James Lingford and Chris Greening at Monash University in Australia, along with Kassiani Panagiotou and Thijs Ettema at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, also participated in the research.

Funding was provided in part by the Gordon and Betty Moore and Simons Foundations, the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.

There is a need to quantify the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening using primary colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) compared with usual care with no screening. Guidelines recommend screening in individuals aged 50–75 years using colonoscopy or FIT, and many screening programs use one-sample biennial FIT. Here we compare incidence of diagnosed CRCs and gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events between screening and usual care during the diagnostic phase of the SCREESCO trial. A randomized block method (no masking) assigned 278,280 individuals aged 60 years to once-only colonoscopy, 2 rounds of two-stool FIT with a low cutoff (10 μg g−1 feces) or usual care (control group) in a ratio of 1:6 for colonoscopy versus control and 1:2 for FIT versus control. In the analysis, 31,113 individuals were in the primary colonoscopy arm and 60,267 were in the FIT arm, and there were 186,671 primary colonoscopy controls, of whom 120,521 were also controls for comparison with the FIT arm. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the incidence rate of CRC was 107.9 in the colonoscopy arm and 99.9 in controls per 100,000 person-years (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91–1.28) and 96.0 in the FIT arm and 103.9 in controls (IRR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.81–1.05). Rates of stage I–II CRC were higher in the colonoscopy arm (IRR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09–1.74) and in the FIT arm (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.99–1.43) versus controls. Rates of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events were slightly higher in the intervention arms during the first year and were subsequently more similar to controls. Our findings of an increase in CRC detection implies a benefit of screening while the increase in adverse events suggests some initial harm. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02078804.

To inform health policy in early detection and removal of CRC and precancerous lesions, there is a need to quantify the benefits and harms from CRC screening. The American College of Gastroenterology and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommend CRC screening in individuals aged 50–75 years by colonoscopy or FIT, where colonoscopy is performed only in those with increased risk indicated by a higher fecal hemoglobin level1,2. Several countries have implemented FIT-based organized screening often with a similar age range and biennial testing but with cutoffs for a positive test ranging between 8.5 μg hemoglobin per g feces and 120 μg hemoglobin per g feces3,4. In Sweden, screening by use of a one-sample biennial FIT has been ongoing in the Stockholm-Gotland region since 2015 in individuals aged 60–69 years and since 2020 in individuals aged 60–74 years, with a cutoff of 40 μg hemoglobin per g feces for women and 80 μg hemoglobin per g feces for men5,6. A national biennial FIT-based screening program with the same cutoffs and age range began its rollout in 2021 with full implementation planned for 2026.

There are several trials of colonoscopy screening, but few have examined FIT compared to usual care7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. The Spanish randomized controlled trial (RCT) COLONPREV recently found similar CRC incidence in the FIT arm and the primary colonoscopy arm at 10 years but did not include any control arm15. Colonoscopy may cause serious adverse events, although the reported rates have been low8,16. There is also limited evidence from RCTs on the impact of screening using primary colonoscopy and FIT on CRC incidence and adverse events compared to usual care.

The RCT SCREESCO trial (Screening of Swedish Colons; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02078804) in Sweden includes a primary colonoscopy screening arm, two rounds of a two-stool FIT screening arm with an unusually low cutoff (10 μg g−1 feces) and a control arm with individuals not invited to screening but following usual care17. By adding extensive information from Swedish healthcare registers, we now report a comparison of the diagnostic yield, in terms of total CRCs diagnosed, and of adverse events occurring in all participants in the trial—screening versus control arm—during the diagnostic phase (from 2014 to 2020, when all interventions occurred) on an intention-to-screen basis. The aim of the present study was to assess if the randomization has resulted in the three arms being similar in terms of baseline demographic variables and medical history and to assess if the screening approaches resulted in a higher rate of diagnosis of CRC during the diagnostic phase, especially stage I–II CRC, compared to usual care. It also aims to assess potential harms of screening approaches in terms of an increased rate of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events in general and short-term all-cause mortality during the diagnostic phase. The present analysis extends previous trial information, which was limited to screen-detected CRCs and adverse events in screening colonoscopies17.

Between 11 February 2014 and 1 March 2016, 201,000 individuals turning 60 or aged 60 were randomized to one of three arms: primary colonoscopy, two rounds of two-stool FIT (FIT×2) or controls. All these controls were controls to both intervention arms. Because of low participation in the primary colonoscopy arm, an additional 77,280 individuals were randomized to primary colonoscopy or control between 30 May 2017 and 25 May 2018. A total of 278,280 individuals were randomized. Due to administrative lag in registration, 159 individuals who died and 70 individuals with prevalent CRC before the date of randomization were identified only after randomization and were excluded. Another two control individuals were excluded because they were not identifiable in any register (Fig. 1). There were 278,051 unique individuals included in the final analyses, 31,113 in the primary colonoscopy arm, 60,267 in the FIT×2 arm and 186,671 primary colonoscopy controls (randomized 2014–2018), of whom 120,521 were also controls for comparison with the FIT×2 arm (that is, FIT×2 controls, randomized in 2014–2016).

Number of randomized, excluded and included individuals.

Baseline demographic variables (for example, educational level and country of birth) and history of comorbidities (Table 1) were balanced between the primary colonoscopy arm and colonoscopy controls (n = 186,671) and between the FIT×2 arm and FIT×2 controls. Most individuals (92%) did not have any prior gastrointestinal or cardiovascular event.

The maximum and median follow-up were 6.9 years and 4.8 years, respectively, and 1,385 (0.5%) individuals migrated out of Sweden during the follow-up. The median time from randomization to screening colonoscopy in the 10,679 (35% of the 30,400 invited) participants in the primary colonoscopy arm was 349 days (interquartile range (IQR): 253–446 days), and the median time from randomization to first FIT in the 33,383 (55% of the 60,137 invited) participants in the FIT×2 arm was 338 days (IQR: 229–395 days) (Extended Data Fig. 1). Men (35%) participated slightly more often than women (33%) in the primary colonoscopy arm, whereas more women (59%) participated in the FIT×2 arm than men (52%) (Supplementary Table 1). Individuals who did not participate in colonoscopy in the primary colonoscopy arm or in fecal testing in the FIT×2 arm (that is, non-participants) had lower educational level, originated more often from another country and exhibited slightly more comorbidity.

The incidence rate of diagnosed CRCs during the diagnostic phase was 107.9 per 100,000 person-years (160 individuals/148,337 person-years) in the primary colonoscopy arm and 99.9 (889 individuals/889,774 person-years) in the control arm (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91–1.28) and 96.0 (330 individuals/343,703 person-years) in the FIT×2 arm and 103.9 (715 individuals/687,048 person-years) in the FIT×2 control arm (IRR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.81–1.05) (Table 2). Figure 2 shows that the incidence rates and IRRs peaked around year one after randomization in both the primary colonoscopy arm and the FIT×2 arm as compared to respective control arms. The corresponding cumulative incidence proportions at the end of follow-up of CRC were 0.69% (95% CI: 0.66–0.71%) in the primary colonoscopy arm, 0.72% (95% CI: 0.71–0.73%) in the control arm, 0.61% (95% CI: 0.60–0.63%) in the FIT×2 arm and 0.73% (95% CI: 0.72–0.75%) in the FIT×2 control arm (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Yearly incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years) and IRRs of CRCs in total and by stage in the primary colonoscopy arm and FIT×2 arm as compared to respective control arms (reference). CRCs include both screen detected and those diagnosed outside of SCREESCO in a usual care setting. Vertical bars indicate 95% CIs.

The incidence rate of diagnosed stage I–II CRCs in the primary colonoscopy arm was 58.7 per 100,000 person-years compared to 42.5 in the control arm (IRR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09–1.74) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Similarly, the rate in the FIT×2 arm was 52.7 and 44.4 in FIT×2 controls (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.99–1.43). Cumulative incidence proportions were higher in the intervention arms compared to controls throughout most of the study period (Extended Data Fig. 2).

The rate of diagnosed stage III–IV CRCs was somewhat lower in the primary colonoscopy arm than in the control arm (IRR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.67–1.11) and lower in the FIT×2 arm than in the FIT×2 control arm (IRR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.58–0.86) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Cumulative incidence proportions in the intervention arms were initially similar to those in controls but became lower than controls after around 4 years after randomization (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Of CRCs diagnosed in the primary colonoscopy arm and in the FIT×2 arm, 32% and 38%, respectively, were screen detected (Table 2). Few CRCs were diagnosed outside of the trial in individuals who had undergone a screening colonoscopy in the primary colonoscopy arm and in the FIT×2 arm (nine (0.03%) and eight (0.01%) individuals, respectively) during the diagnostic phase. Two of the 170 previously reported CRCs detected within the trial were, after a review of medical charts, deemed not to be CRC. Nine additional CRCs were similarly detected within the trial after the review. All but two of the 177 CRCs diagnosed within the trial were also registered in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Register or the Swedish Cancer Register. Stage disagreed in three (1.7%) and was missing in nine (5.1%) of these CRCs (Supplementary Table 2).

Compared to women, men had a higher rate of CRC in the FIT×2 arm (IRR men / IRR women: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.99–1.67) and especially of stage III–IV CRC in both intervention arms (Supplementary Table 3).

Incidence rates of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events were slightly higher in the intervention arms compared to the control arms during the first year of follow-up but were subsequently more similar (Fig. 3). At the end of follow-up, the incidence rate of cardiovascular events was similar in all arms—that is, 1,475.8 per 100,000 person-years in the primary colonoscopy arm and 1,475.8 per 100,000 person-years in the control arm (IRR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.96–1.05), although the rate of venous thromboembolism was 60.1 in the FIT×2 arm compared to 43.3 in corresponding controls (IRR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.16–1.66) (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4). The rate of gastrointestinal events was somewhat higher in the FIT×2 arm compared to the control arm also at the end of follow-up, primarily iatrogenic bleeding (IRR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05–1.32) and unspecified gastrointestinal bleeding (IRR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04–1.26).

Yearly incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) and IRRs of deaths, gastrointestinal events and cardiovascular events in the primary colonoscopy arm and the FIT×2 arm as compared with respective control arms (reference). Vertical bars indicate 95% CIs.

We previously showed that the proportion of serious adverse events directly linked to screening colonoscopies during the trial was 0.2%, including two bowel perforations and 15 major bleedings17.

Death (from any cause) was similar in all arms, with a rate of 554.6 per 100,000 person-years (825 deaths) in the primary colonoscopy arm and 579.0 per 100,000 person-years (5,163 deaths) in the control arm (IRR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.89–1.03) and 577.1 (1,989 deaths) in the FIT×2 arm and 601.8 (4,145 deaths) in the FIT×2 control arm (IRR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91–1.01) (Table 3 and Fig. 3). We previously reported one death in the FIT group on day 15 after the colonoscopy, which followed a pulmonary embolism in a man with metastatic cancer17.

Men had a similar rate of cardiovascular events, a somewhat lower rate of gastrointestinal events and a higher rate of death than women (Supplementary Table 5).

In this assessment of the diagnostic phase of the SCREESCO trial, there was an increase of stage I–II CRC incidence in the intervention arms compared to usual care, particularly during the first year after randomization when most of the screening colonoscopies were performed. More stage I–II and fewer stage III–IV CRCs were diagnosed in the intervention arms compared to controls after a median follow-up of almost 5 years. Similarly, we found similar incidence rates of death and gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events in all arms, except a slightly higher rate of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events in particular during the first year after randomization.

The only ongoing RCTs other than the SCREESCO trial, involving both primary colonoscopy and FIT, are the Spanish trial COLONPREV16 and the American trial Colonoscopy vs. Fecal Immunochemical Test in Reducing Mortality from Colorectal Cancer (CONFIRM)7,13, neither of which has a control arm. SCREESCO provides a comparison of screening effectiveness between invitation to FIT screening and usual care. In the FIT arms of COLONPREV and CONFIRM, a single stool sample with a higher cutoff was used compared to SCREESCO, which used two stool samples. CONFIRM recruited individuals from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, where the majority of the population were men7.

Similar to the Nordic-European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer (NordICC) RCT, we found in intention-to-screen analyses a higher rate of CRC during the first years since randomization to primary colonoscopy compared to usual care, but the rates were similar later on9. Screening using primary sigmoidoscopy has also been shown to reduce CRC incidence in RCTs compared to usual care18,19,20 and lead to a stage shift toward lower stage, particularly for screen-detected CRCs20. Similar evidence for FIT-based screening compared to usual care is lacking. COLONPREV reported similar rates of screen-detected CRC in the two screening arms16. Previous RCTs on screening using repeated fecal occult blood (FOB) followed by colonoscopy after positive FOB test found an initial increase in CRC incidence and a stage shift toward lower stage, especially in screen-detected CRCs21,22,23,24. In the present study, the rates of stage I–II cancer were higher in both intervention arms compared to controls, in particular during the first years of follow-up when most of the screening colonoscopies were performed. This excess risk decreased with time, and the incidence of stage III–IV simultaneously decreased after around 4 years, particularly in the FIT arm compared to controls. The duration of the trial is likely too short to detect a net benefit of the prevention in terms of a lower CRC incidence in the intervention arms compared to controls and/or to determine if a part of the early-stage CRC excess risk in the intervention arms represents an overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant CRCs25. Taken together with the detection and removal of adenomas, our findings suggest a possible future reduction in CRC incidence and CRC mortality in the intervention arms in the subsequent follow-up of SCREESCO (to be reported with follow-up until 31 December 2030)26.

We previously showed that the rate of serious adverse events directly linked to screening colonoscopies in SCREESCO was low17 and in line with other studies8,16,27,28. The present study indicates that the potential harms of colonoscopy in terms of deaths and gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events were generally similar in individuals invited to screening involving colonoscopy at some step in a routine clinical setting and in non-invited individuals following usual care on a population-based level. Individuals who underwent screening colonoscopy in the FIT×2 arm more often had precancerous lesions needing therapeutic intervention compared to the primary colonoscopy arm; hence, the slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal events (that is, bleeding) is expected. The rate of venous thromboembolism was also higher in the FIT×2 arm than in controls, speculatively because anticoagulant users may have a higher risk of positive FIT and pause their treatment during colonoscopy. We are not aware of any other studies reporting gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events in general on an intention-to-treat level comparing primary colonoscopy or FIT followed by colonoscopy to usual care. Our findings motivate further studies on complications related to therapeutic interventions and use of medications.

This large RCT has several strengths. It was performed in a screening-naive setting covering 18 out of 21 of the Swedish regions, comprising 75% of the total population. It had a unique design using two FIT samples instead of one, an unusually low cutoff (10 μg hemoglobin per g) for the maximum of the two FIT values, two rounds of screening 2 years apart and a control arm following usual care. Thirty-three hospitals and 146 endoscopists were involved, which reflects routine care in Sweden. Follow-up was facilitated through reliable and high-quality Swedish registers and allowed us to assess CRCs, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events and colonoscopies in all arms during the entire diagnostic phase. The Swedish Cancer Register captures almost all cancers29, and the proportion of correctly registered diagnoses in the Swedish Patient Register is generally high30.

This study also has some limitations. Although around half of the invited individuals in the FIT arm participated, which was higher than the COLONPREV study15, most with a positive FIT participated in colonoscopy. Participation in the primary colonoscopy arm was lower than initially expected but similar to, or higher than, that in many other countries31 and similar to the NordiCC study8 (outside Norway) and the COLONPREV study15. The increase in CRC incidence during the diagnostic phase was likely lower than what would be expected in settings with higher participation in screening. Some gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events may not have been registered in the Swedish Patient Register, and some may have been re-registered at subsequent hospital visits, potentially underestimating or overestimating incidence rates, although we expect the coverage to be similar in all arms and, thus, less likely to influence IRRs. Our study was restricted to individuals aged 60 years and does not inform on the tradeoffs between benefits and harms of the interventions in younger or older individuals32,33.

In conclusion, we found that a program of screening, by primary colonoscopy or two rounds of two-stool FIT using a low cutoff, detects more lower-stage CRCs than usual care. Rates of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events were higher in the first year and later on more similar to usual care. The increase in CRC detection implies a benefit of screening while the increase in adverse events suggests some initial harm. Subsequent follow-up of SCREESCO will report CRC mortality (not reported here).

This study has trial number NCT02078804 and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov at https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02078804.

We performed an individual RCT with a study base population from 18 out of 21 regions in Sweden17 comprising 74.5% of the total national population where CRC screening had not previously been offered (Stockholm, Gotland and Västernorrland regions were not included). Residents aged 60 years of age or who turned 60 in the year of randomization were identified from the Total Population Register maintained by the Swedish Tax Agency34. Individuals who had a previous diagnosis of CRC or anal cancer or who had participated in the NordICC trial were excluded8.

All individuals invited for screening signed a written informed consent for the procedure and for biobanking of samples. Individuals assigned as controls were not informed about study participation. The Stockholm Ethics Committee approved the study (2012/2058-31/3) and the review of medical charts (2015/1958-2). The Swedish Ethical Review Authority waived the need for informed consent for accessing pseudonymized register-based data (2022/01946-02 and 2022/06863-2).

Between 11 February 2014 and 1 March 2016, a randomized block method was used to assign 201,000 individuals born 1954–1956 without prior CRC diagnosis to once-only primary colonoscopy, two rounds of FIT 2 years apart (FIT×2) or a usual care control arm with no organized program of screening activity (controls). All controls were intended for use in the separate comparisons of primary colonoscopy versus control and of FIT×2 versus control. Masking was not possible due to the nature of the trial. A list of all eligible individuals within each randomization block, defined by year of randomization, region of residence and sex, was obtained to randomly allocate individuals to the three arms. The target number of randomized individuals within the strata was determined based on the distribution of sex and county among 60-year-old individuals in Sweden (excluding the counties that did not participate in SCREESCO) in 2012. Because of low participation in the primary colonoscopy arm, an additional 77,280 individuals were randomized to primary colonoscopy or control between 30 May 2017 and 25 May 2018. We call the subgroup of controls randomized in 2014–2016 (120,600 controls) ‘FIT×2 controls' because they are appropriate for use in the comparison against FIT×2 (also randomized in 2014–2016). All 186,840 controls were available for comparison against primary colonoscopy (randomized 2014–2018).

All invitees in the primary colonoscopy and FIT×2 arms were sent a letter describing the study and a leaflet about CRC and screening. A reminder was sent after 8 weeks. No contact was made with individuals allocated to the control arm. In the primary colonoscopy arm, a second letter offered a scheduled colonoscopy or, if more convenient, a telephone appointment to schedule a colonoscopy. Individuals assigned to the FIT×2 arm were sent a set of kits for two stool samples each screening round. One central laboratory performed all FIT analyses using a single OC-Sensor DIANA automated analyzer (Eiken Chemical). A fecal hemoglobin concentration of ≥10 μg g−1 feces in either of the stool samples was deemed positive, triggering a colonoscopy invitation. All individuals in the FIT×2 arm, except those requiring colonoscopy surveillance after adenoma removal or after a CRC diagnosis, were offered a repeat FIT after 2 years, irrespective of participation in the first FIT screening round or the results of the first FIT. Colonoscopies were performed at 33 hospitals by 146 endoscopists, with a background training as gastroenterologists, surgeons or endoscopy nurses17.

Individuals were randomized between 11 February 2014 and 25 May 2018 and subsequently invited to screening. Screening colonoscopies in the primary colonoscopy arm and the FIT×2 arm and FITs in the FIT×2 arm were performed between 2014 and 2020. We, therefore, consider the diagnostic phase of the trial to be between 2014 and 2020.

In Sweden, all citizens have access to public healthcare35. A very small minority of individuals have private healthcare insurance on top of this (only 0.6% of Swedish healthcare is funded through insurance). During the study period, there was no national screening. Screening was performed in the Stockholm-Gotland healthcare region but not in the regions where SCREESCO was performed. In usual care, the main driver of colonoscopies is symptoms. During the study period, FIT has been introduced as an intermediate step in the investigation of symptoms to an increasing extent, where elevated hemoglobin in the fecal sample in a FIT taken because of symptoms triggers a colonoscopy. Individuals who are under surveillance due to increased CRC risk (that is, previous CRC diagnosis, inflammatory bowel disease or hereditary/familial CRC syndromes) may undergo colonoscopy during surveillance. Individuals may also be under surveillance after polypectomy of adenomatous colorectal polyps.

The ultimate primary endpoint of SCREESCO, for which the power and sample size calculations were performed, is CRC mortality (intervention versus control) at 15 years, and it will be reported later with follow-up until 31 December 2030. CRC incidence was listed as a primary endpoint in the study protocol, but this is formally a secondary outcome of the trial, along with an analysis of compliance, and exploratory outcomes include analyses of health economy, of colonoscopy quality and of the microbiome in feces.

The study protocol was amended after new power calculations due to an observed 35% participation in the colonoscopy arm (in Swedish, 10 March 2017; translated to English, 29 April 2021). The list of members of the Scientific Committee was updated.

The study protocol was amended after the Scientific Committee decided on a last date of follow-up based on new power calculations. It was also decided that the previously described interim analysis would not be performed. The list of main publications was updated and so was the list of members of the Scientific Committee. A summary of changes to the study protocol and statistical analysis plan was added. Weblinks under ‘Head Secretariat' were updated.

The statistical analysis plan was amended after new power calculations due to an observed 35% participation in the colonoscopy arm.

The statistical analysis plan was amended on 4 November 2024 after the Scientific Committee decided on a last date of follow-up based on new power calculations. It was also decided that the previously described interim analysis would not be performed. Details and clarifications regarding the initial and modified power calculations were added. The analysis of incidence of CRC was changed and is now based on cumulative incidence curves instead of the log-rank test.

Power calculations were performed for CRC mortality at 15 years alone. The initial study protocol and the current study protocol state, however, that the main research questions of SCREESCO are to investigate (1) if screening has an effect on the mortality from CRC, (2) if screening has an effect on the incidence of CRC and (3) what method should be used in Sweden regarding the effect according to (1) and (2). The Scientific Committee found a need for a timely assessment of baseline findings (diagnosed CRCs and adverse events during the diagnostic phase of the trial) that also includes the control arm (usual care) and diagnoses/events occurring in general (not only those directly related to SCREESCO screening colonoscopies). The present study is, therefore, listed as a planned main study (section 9, study protocol version 3). Note that CRC mortality is not assessed in the present study and that this main outcome of the trial will, instead, be presented in the final report of the trial with follow-up until 31 December 2030.

Note that this study does not constitute the interim analyses mentioned of CRC mortality at 5 years and 10 years of follow-up in the original study protocol and statistical analysis plan. An additional power calculation (statistical analysis plan version 3; Table 3) showed that there would be limited power to detect differences in CRC mortality at 10 years (follow-up until 31 December 2024) or earlier. Based on the calculation, the Scientific Committee decided that interim analyses of CRC mortality should not be performed.

The present study focuses on early CRCs and adverse events during the diagnostic phase and is listed as a planned analysis of the study. It builds upon a previous baseline assessment of screen-detected CRCs and adverse events in screening colonoscopies of SCREESCO17 and can be considered an extended baseline report or a 5-year interim analysis of diagnosed CRCs and adverse events occurring during the intervention phase. It includes extended information from Swedish health registers regarding CRCs diagnosed and adverse events in general in both screening arms and in the control arm during the diagnostic phase of SCREESCO when screening FITs and colonoscopies were performed.

The endoscopy units reported serious adverse events that occurred within 30 days of the colonoscopy. A study nurse, together with A.F., checked the case report forms for completeness or inconsistencies and obtained additional information from the screening units if needed. Subsequent monitoring was, and will be, facilitated by follow-up using healthcare registers.

In the present analysis of the diagnostic phase of SCREESCO, the outcomes were diagnostic yield of screening and usual care, in terms of CRC diagnoses (overall and by stage), and adverse events (cardiovascular and gastrointestinal). We also assessed death from any cause as a measure of overall health and a potential harm of screening.

In the present study, individuals were followed from randomization (2014–2018) until positive outcome in the corresponding analysis (CRC diagnosis or adverse event, respectively), emigration, death or end of the diagnostic phase (31 December 2020), whichever occurred first, through linkage between the Cancer Register, the Patient Register, the Total Population Register, the Cause of Death Register and the SCREESCO database.

Data on date of and stage at CRC diagnosis were extracted from the Swedish Cancer Register, to which registration is mandated by law29. Additional data on CRC stage were obtained from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Register that, during 2008–2015, had a completeness of 98.5% for colon cancer and 98.8% for rectal cancer36. We defined CRC according to relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes registered in the Swedish Cancer Register. We used any of the following ICD 10th revision (ICD-10) codes for CRC: C18 (except C181), C19 and C20. We also required at least one of the following SNOMED version 3 (SNOMED/3; morphology code ICD-0/3) codes registered at the same time as the CRC: 81403 (adenocarcinoma), 82113 (tubular adenocarcinoma), 82133 (serrated adenocarcinoma), 82203 (adenocarcinoma in familial polyposis), 82433 (goblet cell adenocarcinoma), 82613 (adenocarcinoma arising from villous adenoma), 82633 (adenocarcinoma arising from tubulovillous adenoma), 84803 (mucinous adenocarcinoma) and 84903 (signet ring cell carcinoma/poorly cohesive carcinoma); or SNOMED/2 (SNOMEDO10; morphology code ICD-0/2): 81403 (tubular, villous or serrated adenocarcinoma), 82113 (tubular adenocarcinoma), 82203 (goblet cell adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma in familial polyposis), 84803 (goblet cell or mucinous adenocarcinoma) and 84903 (signet ring cell carcinoma/poorly cohesive carcinoma). We additionally included CRCs registered in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register36.

The date of CRC diagnosis was defined as the first date of a CRC diagnosis in either of the two registries. Medical charts for individuals with CRC registered in SCREESCO, individuals who after a screening colonoscopy required further investigation or treatment (for example, computed tomography scan) and individuals whose polyp samples were sent to pathology were reviewed to assess the correctness of the CRC diagnosis and to extract additional information on stage. CRCs were considered screen detected if detected at colonoscopy (primary or secondary after a positive FIT) performed within SCREESCO.

Data on stage of CRCs detected at screening colonoscopy within SCREESCO were extracted from the SCREESCO database. Data on stage were also extracted separately for all individuals with a CRC diagnosis in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register and/or the Swedish Cancer Register. We allowed for some administrative lag and included all entries in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register and the Swedish Cancer Register occurring within 90 days from the first date of CRC diagnosis in either of the two registers. The TNM stages were obtained from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register if the CRC was registered there and available (not missing) and, otherwise, from the Swedish Cancer Register if available. The Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register contains both the clinical and pathological TNM, and the pathological TNM was used if available and, otherwise, the clinical TNM. Stage (I–II versus III–IV) was graded similarly to the American Joint Committee on Cancer system, which is based on the TNM classification, with stage I–II if T(any or missing)N0M0, T(0–4)N0M(0/missing) or T(0–1)N(0/missing)M0 and stage III–IV if N1, N2 or M1. Tx was considered as missing T stage and similarly for N stage and M stage. Stage was considered unknown if it did not fulfil any of the above.

Data on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events (events related to colonoscopy—for example, bleedings and injuries) and on colonoscopies registered in an inpatient or outpatient setting were extracted from the Patient Register30. The Patient Register covers all inpatient care in Sweden, and the validity of this register has been found to be high, varying from 85% to 95% among different diseases30. The following ICD-10 codes were used to define gastrointestinal events: K922 (Unspecified gastrointestinal bleeding), S360 (Splenic injury), S365 (Colonic injury), S366 (Rectal injury), T810 (Bleeding iatrogenic) and T812 (Perforation). The following ICD-10 codes were used to define cardiovascular events: I20–I25 (Ischemic heart disease), I26 (Pulmonary embolism), I33 (Acute endocarditis), I46 (Cardiac arrest), I63 (Cerebral infarction), I74 (Peripheral artery embolism) and I81 and I82 (Venous thromboembolism).

Date of death was retrieved from the Cause of Death Register37.

Biological sex (man/woman), year of birth, country of birth (Sweden versus other), region of residence, educational level, Charlson Comorbidity Index, a drug comorbidity index and history of any cardiovascular or gastrointestinal event and type of event (within 10 years prior to randomization) were used to describe individuals by arm. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated based on the Patient Register in the last 10 years before inclusion, and the drug comorbidity index was calculated based on drug prescriptions registered up to 1 year before date of inclusion in the Prescribed Drug Register38,39,40. Country of birth was extracted from the Total Population Register, and educational level and region of residence were extracted from the Swedish Longitudinal Integrated Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market Studies (LISA).

The sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint of CRC mortality. A priori, the study was powered to detect a 17.5% decrease in CRC mortality at 15 years in individuals invited to colonoscopy compared to the control arm and a 15% decrease in individuals invited to FIT compared to the control arm, based on an anticipated 1% cumulative CRC mortality between 60 years and 75 years of age. The original sample size target was 201,000 individuals.

Because of lower participation (35%) in the primary colonoscopy arm than expected (50%), new power calculations were performed to determine the additional number of randomized individuals needed to achieve acceptable power, and two additional age cohorts (born 1957 and 1958) were randomized to primary colonoscopy or control in a ratio of 1:6 (hence the deviation from the initially intended allocation ratio).

In the revised study protocol, we assumed a 15% disease-specific mortality reduction by 15 years of follow-up as a minimal clinically important effect in those invited to FIT×2 compared to the control arm, based on a participation rate of 50%, and a 17.5% disease-specific mortality reduction in those invited to colonoscopy compared to the control arm, based on a 35% participation. To allow these absolute risk reductions to be detected at a two-sided 2.5% significance level with 80% power for the comparison of FIT×2 versus control and 73% power for the comparison of primary colonoscopy versus control, the revised target sample size was 278,280 participants. The significance level was adjusted for two comparisons according to the Bonferroni method. In total, 31,140 individuals were randomized to the primary colonoscopy arm; 60,300 individuals were randomized to the FIT×2 arm; and there were two control groups: 186,840 controls to the primary colonoscopy arm, out of which 120,600 individuals also were controls to the FIT×2 arm (FIT×2 controls).

An additional power analysis was performed to determine when, in calendar time, the main analysis of SCREESCO would be performed because this was not clearly stated in the initial study protocol. The Scientific Committee decided that 31 December 2030 would be the last date of follow-up for the main analysis because power was not expected to meaningfully increase after this date.

In an intention-to-screen analysis, we report the number, proportion and incidence rate per 100,000 person-years of all screen-detected CRCs within SCREESCO and all other CRCs diagnosed in regular clinical practice during the diagnostic phase of SCREESCO, in total and by stage (I–II or III–IV). We similarly report incident cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events diagnosed in regular clinical practice and death from any cause. We compare each intervention arm with the corresponding control arm concerning each of the outcomes using incidence rates and IRRs using Poisson regression models with 95% CIs. Analyses were also performed separately in men and women, and a Poisson regression model with interaction between sex and study arm was used to compare the IRR in men versus the IRR in women under the null hypothesis of no difference (two-sided test of the interaction term). Note that only the FIT×2 controls (individuals randomized 2014–2016, during which individuals could be allocated to FIT×2) were used in the comparison of FIT×2 versus control in this study, whereas all controls (randomized 2014–2018, including the FIT×2 controls) were used in the comparison of primary colonoscopy versus control.

The full follow-up of up to a maximum of almost 7 years was used in the above analyses. In a complementary analysis, we also computed incidence rates and IRRs at each year of follow-up. Individuals were censored if and when they migrated out of Sweden. Individuals were similarly not considered at risk after their date of death. We assessed potential violations of equidispersion for each regression model and computed alternative CIs by use of robust standard errors. Because there were no signs of meaningful underdispersion or overdispersion and results were virtually identical, we did not report these analyses.

In a complementary analysis, we computed competing risk cumulative incidence curves of CRC (overall and by stage) where death from any cause was considered a competing risk.

We report baseline characteristics in participants and non-participants of the intervention arms along with diagnosed CRCs and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events that occurred during the intervention phase. Individuals in the primary colonoscopy arm were considered to be participants if they underwent a screening colonoscopy, and individuals in the FIT×2 arm were considered participants if they returned a FIT in any of the two rounds.

Stata version 13.1 and R version 4.0.2 were used for power calculations. Analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2.

Data centers are being built at a frantic pace all over the world, driven by the AI boom. These facilities consume staggering amounts of electricity. By 2028, AI servers alone may use as much energy as 22 percent of US households. Of course that demand will raise energy prices for everyone, and we'll need more power plants, which means more global warming.

Then there's the water problem. High-density AI chips run so hot that air cooling isn't enough. New facilities are turning to water cooling. The technique of choice is water evaporation. It's more effective and energy-efficient than recirculating water, but a large data center using this method consumes millions of gallons of water a day, draining local water supplies.

So it's no surprise that more and more towns are pushing back on data center projects in their area. But if everyone goes NIMBY, it gets sort of NOMPY—like “not on my planet, you bastards.” What to do? People aren't going to stop using AI. That's why some folks are saying we should build data centers in space.

Just think: You could get 24/7 energy from solar panels—it's always sunny in space—and the thermal stuff wouldn't be an issue because it's so cold out there. You could do the heavy processing in orbiting data centers and beam the results back to Earth just like satellite internet. That's the claim, anyway.

Could this really work? Or is it about as practical as colonizing Mars? I asked Google's AI Overview, and it said, “Yes, data centers can be built in space.” But of course it would say that. I think we'll have to go full renegade and dial up some old-fashioned human intelligence on this.

One of the really big ideas in science is called conservation of energy. This says that for any “system” (any collection of things we pick), the total energy going into the system equals the change in energy of that system plus the energy going out of the system:

Or rearranging, any change in the amount of energy in a system equals the difference of energy inputs and outputs. What this says is that energy can't be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another—like solar panels convert light energy to electric energy.

Energy is measured in joules, but it's often easier to talk about power instead. Power is the change in energy (ΔE) per unit of time (Δt), so it is measured in joules per second, also known as watts. In terms of power, conservation of energy says the power into a system equals the power out of the system plus the power of the change in internal energy.

For example, say the “system” is a desktop PC with a 300-watt power supply. That means the maximum power input is 300 watts. What about the energy changes in the system? Well, it gets hot, so there's an increase in thermal energy. But it soon reaches a stable operating temperature. There's really no other energy changes in the computer, so all 300 watts of power coming in must equal the power going out.

Where does that 300 watts of output go? Well, your PC has a fan that moves air across the processor and GPU. The hot components interact with the air to heat it up. The fan then moves this air out, transferring heat from the computer to your room. Yes, your PC is basically a 300-watt space heater that also plays video games.

If two objects are at different temperatures, thermal energy moves from the warmer one to the colder one. So, that hot computer transfers energy to the cooler air. Because the CPU and air molecules are in contact, we call this heat conduction. It works fast. That's why 70-degree pool water feels so cold: You're immersed in it, so it rapidly sucks a lot of heat energy out of your body.

But there's another way heat can be transferred. If the objects aren't touching but have a direct line of sight, there can be a radiation interaction. This is what happens in an electric oven with no airflow. The heating element doesn't touch your pizza, but it's so hot (like over 1,000 degrees F) that it radiates infrared light, which heats up your food.

Now, what if you put your gaming PC in low Earth orbit? How would we siphon off the waste heat generated? Those fans inside won't help. They can't move air over the processors if there's no air. The only option is to have a radiation interaction with the surroundings, and radiation is not as efficient as conduction.

This is where people often go wrong in thinking about computing off-planet. Actually, space isn't even “cold.” Temperature is a property of matter—it measures molecular motion—and space is pretty much a vacuum. With no molecules to vibrate, it has no intrinsic temperature. And with radiation as the only means of heat transfer, objects in space actually cool down slowly.

We can calculate the rate of thermal radiation (P) for an object using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. It looks like this:

Here ε is the emissivity of the object—how effective it is as a radiator (0 < ε < 1), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area, and T is the temperature (in Kelvin). Since we have temperature to the fourth power, you can see that hotter things radiate much more power than cooler things.

OK, say you want to play Red Dead Redemption in space. Your computer is gonna get hot—maybe 200 F (366 Kelvin). To keep it simple, let's say this is a cube-shaped PC with a total surface area of 1 square meter, and it's a perfect radiator (ε = 1). The thermal radiation power would then be around 1,000 watts. Of course your computer is not a perfect radiator, but it looks like you'd be fine. As long as the output is greater than the input (300 watts), it'll cool down.

Now say you want to run some modest AI stuff. That's a bigger job, so let's scale up our cubical computer with edges twice as long as before. That would make the volume eight times larger (23), so we could have eight times as many processors, which means we need eight times as much power input—2,400 watts. However, the surface area is only four times (22) larger, so the radiative power would be about 4,000 watts. You still have more output than input, but the gap is narrowing.

You can see where this goes. If you keep scaling it up, the volume grows faster than the surface area. So the larger your space computer, the harder it is to cool. If you were picturing an orbiting Walmart-size structure, like the data centers on Earth, that's just not going to happen. It would melt.

Of course, you could add on external radiation panels. The International Space Station has these. How big would they have to be? Well, say your data center runs on 1 megawatt. (Existing AI data centers on Earth use 100 to 1,000 megawatts.) Then you'd need a radiating area of at least 980 square meters. This is getting out of hand.

Oh, and these radiators aren't like solar panels, connected by wires. They need systems to conduct heat away from the processors out to the panels. The ISS pumps ammonia through a network of pipes for this. That means even more material, which makes it that much more expensive to hoist into orbit.

So let's take stock. Even though we set this up with favorable assumptions, it's not looking very good. We're not even taking into account the fact that solar radiation will heat up the computer as well, which will require even more cooling. Or that intense solar radiation will likely damage the electronics over time. And how do you make repairs?

However, one thing is clear: Because cooling is inefficient in space, your “data center” would have to be a swarm of small satellites with better area-to-volume ratios, not a few large ones. That's what most proponents, like Google's Project Suncatcher, are now suggesting. Elon Musk's SpaceX has already requested FCC permission to launch a million small AI satellites into orbit.

Hmm. Low Earth orbit is already congested with 10,000 active satellites and some 10,000 metric tons of space junk. The risk of collisions, maybe even catastrophic Kessler cascades, is already real. And we're going to add a hundred times as many satellites? All I can say is, Look out below!

So what's the answer to our question? Theoretically, you probably could create a computing system off-planet with lots of small satellites, though the launch and construction costs would be astronomical. Whether it's a good idea is another question altogether.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Search Engine for OnlyFans Models Who Look Like Your Crush","https://www.wired.com/story/the-search-engine-for-onlyfans-models-who-look-like-your-crush/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

For three days in February, porn star Alix Lynx flew to Miami for her first exclusive creator gathering where she was in full grind mode: shooting Reels and talking strategy with other creators. “It was kind of like SoHo House for OnlyFans girls,” she says of the experience, which is called The Circle and drew more than a dozen sex workers, including Remy LaCroix and Forrest Smith.

Lynx, who is a former webcam model turned OnlyFans starlet, has a combined 2 million followers across Instagram, TikTok, and X. She joined OnlyFans in 2017 with “the luxury of having my own following,” she says, but those numbers haven't always translated to subscriptions. It's why she was in Miami.

“I don't think people understand. I do a shitload of marketing,” Lynx says.“That's the big misconception with OnlyFans—when creators join they think it's going to be easy. But unless you're a genius at marketing on social media, which is few and far between, it's genuinely hard to get found and gain a following.”

Many of OnlyFans' 4 million creators have said the same thing: native discovery on the platform sucks. “There's just a frustration,” Lynx says. “In a perfect world, there would be that searchability feature because it makes it an even playing field for creators.” (According to OnlyFans, the platform limits its search feature as a safety precaution so users don't accidentally stumble across content they didn't intend to see.)

It's a problem that Presearch—a free, private, decentralized search engine—wants to fix with the launch of its image-based discovery tool Doppelgänger.

Doppelgänger is the newest addition to Presearch's Spicy Mode, a NSFW feature for searching adult content. Users can upload an image of a celebrity—or any person they think is hot—to find OnlyFans creators that resemble them. The technology matches the user with similar creators who want an audience rather than to deepfake platforms that are nonconsensual and illegal. Ever wondered who Sabrina Carpenter's or Pedro Pascal's porn doppelgängers were? Wonder no more.

According to the company, Doppelgänger is built with specific guardrails—no tracking what users search, explicit age-gating—and runs on Presearch's decentralized index, “which surfaces content traditional search engines and commercial AI suppress,” says Brenden Tacon, head of product and business development at Presearch.

“We're trying to offer a place where you might serendipitously become discovered,” Tacon tells WIRED. “You won't on OnlyFans. If you're hustling yourself on Instagram, Reddit, and all these places, it's so hard to break through the noise.”

With 300,000 daily active searches on Presearch—according to the company—Doppelgänger is one of the first tools on the market pushing for ethical discovery of adult creators at scale. Unlike traditional reverse image tools that scan across the open web to locate where a photo appears or attempt to trace someone's identity, Doppelgänger does not search the broader internet, does not surface personal information, and does not attempt to identify a person. “It simply returns visually similar public profiles based on image features, making it structurally more limited and, in many ways, more privacy-protective than a standard reverse image search,” Tacon says.

Still, the accuracy of Doppelgänger could use some improvement. In multiple tests run by WIRED, the AI seems better tailored to find matches for women than men. I had no problem finding look-alikes for Cardi B and Sydney Sweeney. But when searching for Michael B. Jordan look-alikes, it suggested female creators Chanell Heart (the number 3 match) and Chamile Symone, in addition to Uncut Jock NYC, a white-presenting Brazilian sex worker. In fact, five women were suggested among Jordan's top 40. Curious if this was a glitch, I dragged a photo of actor Jeff Goldblum—a perennial “hottie,” according to the subreddit r/VintageLadyBoners—into the image finder, and the top search result was for Jean B, a self-described “twink content creator,” followed by 38 suggestions of large-breasted women. (A second search for Goldblum—who, for what it's worth, is more zaddy than twink—with a different photo, did not fare any better; the lone male “look-alike” was for YCC, who is Chinese.)

According to the company, gender and ethnicity are not used as input features or ranking signals at any stage of the Doppelganger pipeline; their model is optimized purely for visual structure. Tacon says similarity results may vary—surfacing matches that cross gender lines, for example—when the resemblance is strong. He adds that “these behaviors are common across visual similarity systems and are not unique to Doppelgänger,” noting that the company is working to “improve match diversity across underrepresented creator groups.”

Like Doppelgänger, FaceSpy is another similarity search engine trained on OnlyFans creators but, according to an email the company sent WIRED, it is only used by a “few hundred [people] per day.” (The tech also doesn't seem very advanced; when I ran the same four searches on FaceSpy, only Cardi B netted matches.) There's also OnlyFinder, launched in 2020, which uses geolocation and various tags to help users find new creators. With Doppelgänger, Tacon says, the system does not monetize image data or identity inference. “The feature exists to enhance discovery within the platform, not to commercialize personal information.” Creators can opt out of similarity matching at any time.

Even so, look-alike finders raise concerns. Though public figures have long been subject to imitation and other forms of representation beyond their control, including deepfake nudes, “it's another thing when it's a private citizen or someone who is not in the public light,” says Lauren Craig Tilton, a professor of digital humanities at the University of Richmond. “One could imagine really creepy uses like taking a photo of a child or a daughter or a family member that they have an attraction to, and looking for similar people on OnlyFans.”

She worries that AI tools like Doppelgänger haven't considered the long-term consequences.

“While it's not, per se, illegal that this look-alike is serving as a kind of proxy for behavior that the other person didn't consent for, it is bordering on an unethical, inauthentic relationship with the person whose image is being used,” she says. “Somehow the platform suggests that there aren't social implications by doing this. That it's somehow safer. But it's not necessarily safer if one is basically changing the ideas of real people in their lives by offloading that behavior onto another group.”

Presearch's Image Search Terms state that uploading visuals of minors is prohibited. “In theory, someone could try that, but the system will only ever return indexed OnlyFans creators, so no unrelated matches would appear,” Tacon says. Users who do so are subject to “appropriate action, including reporting to relevant authorities.” He adds that while any public platform has “social implications,” the company is “trying to make those implications as positive as possible.”

For creators like Lynx, the tool is a welcome innovation.

“We're fucking tired,” Lynx says, who claims OnlyFans intentionally designed its search function with limited reach as a way to force creators to bring other creators onto the platform through collaboration. “We are working so hard, between social, OnlyFans content, going live, doing custom videos. It is a full-time job times 10. And a discoverability feature would probably make it a little bit easier, where we wouldn't have to work as hard at marketing.”

Additionally, creators are facing pressure from conservative lawmakers who are calling for increased restrictions on adult content, effectively muzzling their visibility and income, with the implementation of age-verification laws and porn taxes. “I keep my Instagram so PG because of that. There are a lot of mine fields we are constantly dodging,” Lynx says.

For now, Doppelgänger only scans OnlyFans profiles, but Presearch hopes to partner with other creator-led platforms like Hidden and Fansly. In April 2025, Stella Barey, a former OnlyFans creator, launched Hidden, the first adult platform owned and operated by sex workers. Barey modeled the platform after TikTok because, like Presearch, she wanted to create a space where real creators could actually get discovered. “Hidden just offers things that I have felt for a really long time we were always missing,” including features like a ForYou page, she told WIRED last November.

Tacon—who says today's internet is optimized for advertisers and app stores, not users or creators—believes Presearch ultimately has universal applications. The company wants to be an alternative to algorithmic gatekeepers like Google and Facebook, Big Tech platforms that control what content, information, or opportunities people see through algorithmic suppression and recommendation.

“We want to drive subscriptions to creators,” Tacon says. “We're beginning with adult creators, but little by little, we actually want to become an advocate for all types of creators as we build out our proprietary index. We want to surface all the journalists out there, all the Substack writers, whomever, that are having trouble being indexed in Google. But we want to perfect this with adult creators first.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The War Over Prediction Markets Is Just Getting Started","https://www.wired.com/story/the-political-war-over-prediction-markets-is-just-getting-started/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 10:30:00 GMT","

The political fight in the US over the future of prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi has escalated into a full-blown war, and battle lines aren't being neatly drawn along party lines. Instead, conservative Mormons have aligned themselves with Las Vegas bigwigs, and MAGA royalty is siding with liberal Democrat lobbyists. One side argues that the platforms are breaking the law by operating as shadow casinos. The other insists they are just giving people access to legitimate financial markets already subject to adequate government oversight. Neither camp is backing down.

Right now, prediction powerhouse Kalshi operates in all 50 states. Its primary rival, Polymarket, was banned from the US in 2022 for operating as an unregistered derivatives market, but it returned in a limited capacity last year. These companies offer “event contracts” to customers, allowing them to trade shares tied to the outcomes of almost anything, from who will win this year's Oscar for Best Actor to what the price of Bitcoin will be at the end of the day. The most popular category by far is sports. Kalshi reported a daily record of over $800 million in trades on Super Bowl Sunday related to the game alone, and over $1.3 billion traded on contracts related to the event altogether.

Once a niche financial experiment, prediction markets have rapidly become entrenched in mainstream culture, a transformation that has brought vast sums of money into play. The industry's leading players are already billion-dollar companies in their own rights. Each day, casual speculators and die-hard sharps log on to predict where the world will go next, choosing between a dizzying array of opportunities to win and lose.

Advocates argue that these platforms democratize access to commodities trading and are useful tools for forecasting the future. And at the end of the day, they say, adults should be able to do what they want with their money. The fundamental difference between a prediction market and a casino is that “on Kalshi, there is no house, users trade against each other. Users benefit from this: They get fair pricing, the ability to cash out at any time for fair market value, and winners are never banned or limited,” says Kalshi spokesperson Jack Such.

But critics say that prediction markets, at least in their current form, are exploitative. “This is illegal gambling,” says former New Jersey attorney general Matt Platkin, who recently launched a boutique law firm focused on consumer protection cases. The industry is “unregulated, untaxed, unsupervised,” he adds.

Prediction markets are overseen at the federal level by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the agency in charge of financial instruments known as derivatives. It has been grappling with the industry since the late 1980s, when the University of Iowa launched the Iowa Electronic Market, an academic project allowing participants to buy contracts based on the election results and public market outcomes.

Attorneys general and gambling regulators in many states say sports contracts on prediction markets should follow state gambling laws. One reason for the pushback is that prediction markets represent a compelling alternative to the regulated gambling industries in places like Nevada, which represent a significant part of the local economy. “The states have such a vested interest,” says Alex Grishman, head of the digital assets practice at the law firm Haynes Boone. “They want to have as much of the tax revenue as they can.”

Kalshi is facing 19 separate lawsuits across the country, and it narrowly evaded a recent temporary shutdown in Massachusetts. Federal lawmakers have also started weighing in; earlier this month, 23 Democratic senators voiced support for efforts to push prediction markets to abide by state gambling laws. Platkin believes the wave of challenges is nowhere near over: “We're just at the beginning of those types of lawsuits.”

Over the past few days, the CFTC has forcefully asserted that it has sole control over the industry. The agency filed an amicus brief in support of the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com in its ongoing legal dispute with Nevada state regulators, who have accused the company of running an unlicensed sports betting operation. (Crypto.com has offered its own sports prediction contracts.) In an unusual video posted to social media the same day, CFTC chairman Michael Selig vowed to fight against what he called an “onslaught” of lawsuits. “To those who seek to challenge our authority in this space, let me be clear—we will see you in court,” Selig said in the video.

Selig is a Trump administration appointee, and there is ample evidence to suggest that President Trump and his inner circle want to ensure prediction markets are treated with a light touch, not the least being that he and his family plan to soon launch their own called Truth Predict. The president's son Donald Trump Jr. is an adviser to both Kalshi and Polymarket, and his firm 1789 Capital is an investor in the latter. The Trump Media and Technology Group also has a strategic partnership with Crypto.com.

But support for Selig's approach isn't confined to Trumpworld. “We have the CFTC for a reason. We have very clear federal legislation going back to the 1930s that gives it exclusive jurisdiction in this area,” says former Democratic congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, who now leads the Coalition for Prediction Markets, a new industry lobbying group. Kalshi also recently hired longtime Democratic strategist and former Biden administration official John Bivona as its head of government relations.

Meanwhile, opposition to prediction markets is growing among conservatives. Some Republican critics of the industry have ties to the legalized gambling movement, like former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who currently advises the American Gaming Association. But others don't. Utah governor Spencer Cox, a Republican from a state that bans sports betting altogether, released a statement on X promising to “beat” the CFTC in court after Selig made his comments. Earlier this week, Senate agriculture chair John Boozman, the Arkansas Republican whose committee oversees the CFTC, likened prediction markets to the ""Wild West” and said he plans to speak to Selig about the issue.

As the regulatory fight unfolds, prediction markets continue expanding their offerings. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have announced a slew of new corporate partnerships designed to cement their role within mainstream finance and media ecosystems. Just this week, Polymarket announced a deal to integrate its data on Substack, and the nonpartisan Federal Reserve released a positive report on Kalshi's efficacy as a forecasting tool. Between the two companies, they've struck data-sharing deals with CNN, CBS, CNBC, and Dow Jones. Quantitative trading firms are diving in too, with Jump Trading taking stakes in both Polymarket and Kalshi.

The battle over regulating prediction markets in some ways mirrors the ongoing conflict over the rise of legal hemp-derived THC products. Cannabis is still federally illegal, yet a growing patchwork of states, including Illinois, New York, and California, collect hundreds of millions of dollars each year from regulated sales. Alongside the official markets for traditional cannabis, a parallel industry offering molecularly identical compounds derived from hemp plants has sprung up by taking advantage of a legal loophole.

Critics and enthusiasts alike have noted that the psychotropic effects from “regular” cannabis and hemp-derived products can be indistinguishable, just as the thrill of winning money on the Super Bowl hits the same whether it came from a sportsbook wager or a prediction market. But each class of products is regulated entirely differently, in a way that can feel capricious. And, just like the war over prediction markets, the fight over THC isn't a right-versus-left affair. In Illinois, for example, Democratic governor JB Pritzker has called for tighter regulation—but Democratic Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson just vetoed an effort to rein in the hemp industry.

One final similarity: Both fights aren't going to be resolved quickly. Americans have spent close to a decade already debating what to do about intoxicating hemp products, and yet that industry's future remains murkier than ever. The Prediction Market Wars are similarly unlikely to be settled anytime soon. Observers don't expect the current crop of court cases to create sweeping change—a win in Nevada, for instance, won't necessarily impact the outcomes of a case in Massachusetts, and any single ruling will likely be appealed. “This fight will, unfortunately, have to get deliberated and litigated in higher courts,” says Alex Grishman.

Wooden barrels are what make the magic happen in your favorite bottle of whisky. They're also the source of a long-standing problem in the spirits industry: They leak. A lot.

At Bacardi Limited, the world's largest privately held spirits company, barrel leakage is a massive headache. Consider the company's Dewar's blended Scotch whisky brand (just one of the dozens it owns). Most of the time, Dewar's will have over 100 warehouses full of aging barrels of whisky, 25,000 casks in each one. Barrels will mature for three to 12 years, and according to Angus Holmes, Bacardi's whisky category director, many of those barrels will develop a leak at some point in their life.

That's not great for business, says Holmes. “How do we make sure that when we come to get that cask, it's got as much whisky in it as possible?”

Given the imperative to find so-called leakers before a decade has come and gone—and taken all the whisky with it—Bacardi engaged the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland. NMIS was presented with the problem, and came up with a surprising solution: Why not adopt a robotic dog?

Andrew Hamilton, head of the Digital Process Manufacturing Centre for NMIS, says the group's first suggestion was that Dewar's might try a Boston Dynamics Spot robot which could roam the warehouse on the prowl for leaking barrels.

But to be a truly effective hunter, the robot dog would need to adopt one of the actual canine family's most well-honed skills: an elevated sense of smell.

Spot on the prowl.

There are two kinds of leaks: liquid spilling or seeping out of the barrel, and loss of liquid through vapor evaporation. A barrel leaking liquid is fairly easy to identify, but if it's losing more than it should through evaporation, that's harder to suss out.

Evaporation is an expected part of whisky maturation, “the angel's share” being a well-understood phenomenon that is widely considered a key part of a whisky's evolution. In Scotland, the angels take about 2 percent of a cask's volume each year, and while some enterprising distillers have attempted to deny the angels their due through experimental techniques like covering barrels in plastic wrap, by and large distillers are happy to give a little whisky back to the universe as a cost of doing business.

“It makes that horrible, horror-movie, floor-scratching sound as it chases after you.”

The problem is when those angels get greedy. High levels of evaporation can invisibly drain a barrel while changing the flavor of what's left inside, and evaporation can speed up when barrels are damaged during handling, the metal hoops holding the staves together come loose, or the stopper sealing the bunghole pops out of place. The natural expansion and contraction of wood over the years can also result in these invisible leaks.

“In a traditional warehouse, workers walk around the racks of barrels and physically knock on the casks,” says Holmes. They can tell by the sound of the thump how full the barrel is and whether it might be in need of inspection or repair.

But at Dewar's, that strategy doesn't work. Workers can't knock on barrels because they're stacked to the ceiling and jammed in together tightly to maximize usage of the available space.

“Our warehouses are palletized, essentially very high stacks of barrels standing upright instead of on their sides,” Holmes says. There's currently no feasible way for human workers to detect most leaking barrels until they're pulled for blending.

Here's where the robot dog is unleashed. Rather than knocking on barrels, it was engineered to detect ethanol vapor in the air.

“Our engineers developed a 3D-printed arm integrated with an ethanol sensing ‘nose' to test how ethanol vapor could be detected,” says Hamilton. The idea is simple: The dog sniffs each barrel, logs the level of ethanol nearby, and reports back with the location of any barrels that are losing too much booze. It sounds costly and complex, but Holmes reports that the price of the robot is less than $100,000.

Good dog.

The modified Spot was first tested on a small selection of controlled barrels to ensure it could properly sniff out the difference between a barrel aging normally and an overly leaky one. Later it was unleashed on the floor of a Dewar's warehouse to further the proof of concept. Holmes says early trials have been a success, with the dog—named Royal Barkla as an ode to Bacardi's Royal Brackla distillery near Nairn, Scotland—being set on a programmatic path. In the field, the robo-pup identified a shocking 10 percent of casks in need of some level of remediation.

Naturally, Royal Barkla has taken the distillery by storm. “It moves with some pace. And it makes that horrible, horror-movie, floor-scratching sound as it chases after you,” Holmes jokes. But seriously, the experiment has been wildly successful. “We found enough leaks to make it worthwhile to continue the work we're doing.”

Hamilton agrees. “If this kind of monitoring can be done in a repeatable, data-driven way, it adds real value,” he says, “helping producers better understand loss rates and plan for the future value of the spirit.”

While the early trials have been successful, Royal Barkla is unfortunately an imperfect solution to the leaker problem for one key reason: It can't climb vertically. “The dog can only reach 1.5 meters in height,” says Holmes, “so for now only the lowest level of barrels can be examined. While he's proved he can work there, now we're taking the proof of concept further.”

On the table are a couple of possibilities for Royal Barkla 2.0.

“We've found a spider robot that can climb,” says Holmes, evoking a much scarier future for leak detection. The other idea is a more familiar one: an ethanol-sensing drone that can fly around inside the warehouse in search of boozy hot spots. Bacardi already uses drones for things like security and roof and fencing examinations, so it would be a natural extension of a technology the company already has access to.

Ultimately, we're still in the early days for leak detection, and Bacardi is eager to find more help on this front—and anything else that might improve efficiency.

“We're open for innovation,” says Holmes. “Come and chat with us.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Leading US Research Lab Appears to Be Squeezing Out Foreign Scientists","https://www.wired.com/story/leading-us-research-lab-appears-to-be-squeezing-out-foreign-scientists/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 10:00:00 GMT","

One of the US government's top scientific research labs is taking steps that could drive away foreign scientists, a shift lawmakers and sources tell WIRED could cost the country valuable expertise and damage the agency's credibility.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) helps determine the frameworks underpinning everything from cybersecurity to semiconductor manufacturing. Some of NIST's recent work includes establishing guidelines for securing AI systems and identifying health concerns with air purifiers and firefighting gloves. Many of the agency's thousands of employees, postdoctoral scientists, contractors, and guest researchers are brought in from around the world for their specialized expertise.

“For weeks now, rumors of draconian new measures have been spreading like wildfire, while my staff's inquiries to NIST have gone unanswered,” Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, wrote in a letter sent to acting NIST director Craig Burkhardt on Thursday. April McClain Delaney, a fellow Democrat on the committee, cosigned the message.

Lofgren wrote that while her staff has heard about multiple rumored changes, what they have confirmed through unnamed sources is that the Trump administration “has begun taking steps to limit the ability of foreign-born researchers to conduct their work at NIST.”

The congressional letter follows a Boulder Reporting Lab article on February 12 that said international graduate students and postdoctoral researchers would be limited to a maximum of three years at NIST going forward, despite many of them needing five to seven years to complete their work.

A NIST employee tells WIRED that some plans to bring on foreign workers through the agency's Professional Research and Experience Program have recently been canceled because of uncertainty about whether they would make it through the new security protocols. The staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, says the agency has yet to widely communicate what the new hurdles will be or why it believes they are justified.

On Thursday, the Colorado Sun reported that “noncitizens” lost after-hours access to a NIST lab last month and could soon be banned from the facility entirely.

Jennifer Huergo, a spokesperson for NIST, tells WIRED that the proposed changes are aimed at protecting US science from theft and abuse, echoing a similar statement issued this week to other media outlets. Huergo declined to comment on who needs to approve the proposal for it to be finalized and when a decision will be made. She also didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers' letter.

Preventing foreign adversaries from stealing valuable American intellectual property has been a bipartisan priority, with NIST among the agencies in recent years to receive Congressional scrutiny about the adequacy of its background checks and security policies. Just last month, Republican lawmakers renewed calls to put restrictions in place preventing Chinese nationals from working at or with national labs run by the Department of Energy.

But Lofgren's letter contends that the rumored restrictions on non-US scientists at NIST goes beyond “what is reasonable and appropriate to protect research security.” The letter demands transparency about new policies by February 26 and a pause on them “until Congress can weigh in on whether these changes are necessary at all.”

The potential loss of research talent at NIST would add to a series of other Trump administration policies that some US tech industry leaders have warned will dismantle the lives of immigrant researchers already living in the US and hamper economic growth. Hiking fees on H-1B tech visas, revoking thousands of student visas, and carrying out legally dubious mass deportations all stand to push people eager to work on science and tech research in the US to go elsewhere instead. The Trump administration has also announced plans to limit post-graduation job training for international students.

Pat Gallagher, who served as the director of NIST from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, says the changes could erode trust in the agency, which has long provided the technical foundations that industry and governments around the world rely on. “What has made NIST special is it is scientifically credible,” he tells WIRED. “Industry, universities, and the global measurement community knew they could work with NIST.”

Like much of the federal government, NIST has been in turmoil for most of the past year. Parts of it were paralyzed for months as rumors of DOGE cuts spread. Ultimately, the agency lost hundreds of its thousands of workers to budget cuts, with further funding pressure to come.

As of a couple of years ago, NIST welcomed 800 researchers on average annually from outside the US to work in its offices and collaborate directly with staff.

Lofgren expressed fear that rumors may be enough to scare away researchers and undermine US competitiveness in vital research. “Our scientific excellence depends upon attracting the best and brightest from around the world,” she wrote in the letter.

United States prosecutors and federal law enforcement spent over a year examining ties between Jeffrey Epstein and Customs and Border Protection officers stationed in the US Virgin Islands (USVI), according to documents recently released by the Department of Justice.

As The Guardian and New York Times have reported, emails, text messages, and investigative records show that Epstein cultivated friendships with several officers, entertaining them on his island and offering to take them for whale-watching trips in his helicopter. He even brought one cannolis for Christmas Eve. In turn, Epstein would bring certain officers his complaints about his treatment at the hands of other CBP and federal agents. Most of the interactions described in the records occurred years after Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of sex crimes in Florida in 2008.

The CBP officers were never charged for any crimes related to Epstein, and at least one later retired from the agency with a pension, suggesting that the government ultimately didn't find any wrongdoing. The documents do, though, describe patterns of behavior—two of the officers referred to Epstein as a “friend”—that one government ethics expert described as inappropriate and possible violations of federal guidance. They also contain grand jury subpoenas that specifically name the officers and compel the recipients, which were largely financial services firms, to aid federal prosecutors who were looking into allegations of a conspiracy to defraud the US government.

CBP and the Southern District of New York US Attorney's Office, which led the investigation into Epstein, did not respond to requests for comment.

For years, Epstein allegedly brought countless women and girls as young as 12 to his private island, Little Saint James, according to a 2020 complaint filed by the former USVI attorney general. Epstein would often fly in and out of USVI on his private jet.

In order to depart from USVI to other parts of the US, Epstein's plane had to be cleared by CBP, according to a November 2020 FBI interview report with Epstein's personal pilot, Larry Visoski.

Visoski told the FBI that some passengers were college students with letters from their schools explaining why they were traveling. Other times, according to the report on Visoski's interview, Epstein traveled with a woman who had a foreign passport. If CBP officers started questioning these passengers, Visoski said, Epstein would intervene and start arguing with the officers.

Visoski, though, told the FBI that Epstein made an effort to be friendly with CBP officers, at times instructing Visoski to collect agents' contact information. (In an email to one CBP officer, Epstein wrote, “as you know Im very respectful of people just doing their job.”) Over the years, emails and text messages show, various CBP officers would try to reach out to Epstein, either directly or through Visoski or other associates. Sometimes, Epstein would have the officers out to Little Saint James.

In May 2014, for example, Visoski emailed Epstein, “While going through customs in STT, our nice person gave me his cell contact.” The pilot added that the “nice person” would be available to visit Little Saint James that week. Visoski also attached the person's contact information. The next day, Epstein's island estate manager emailed Epstein to let him know the person, a CBP officer, would be picked up on Wednesday for lunch. (It's unclear whether this lunch ever happened.)

Emails in 2015 and 2016 show that Epstein would have another officer, Glen Samuel, come to Little Saint James to perform on steel pan drums—a side gig Samuel informally advertised at one point on his Facebook page. In a January 2015 email thread, Epstein asked an associate to clarify Samuel's rate. The associate replied, “Mr. Samuel says he does not intend to charge you. He considers you a friend and was doing this for you. If you wish to give him something, he is appreciative, but there is no fee.” Samuel did not respond to a request for comment.

Epstein would also personally text and email with James Heil, a supervisory CBP officer stationed in USVI. According to an email, Heil initially offered to provide Epstein with Samuel's personal contact information, and told Epstein that Samuel was cleared for outside employment. Heil did not respond to a request for comment, but told The New York Times that he interacted with Epstein in his capacity as a “professionalism service manager” for CBP.

Epstein would occasionally complain to Heil about issues with CBP. In March 2016, Epstein emailed Heil about a supervisor in Newark. Epstein claimed the official took several of his passengers, including a woman with a pending asylum application, to immigration to have their documents reviewed. Epstein also told Heil about an incident in which CBP officials there claimed there was a “glitch” in USVI. Heil said in response that he would follow up with the supervisor in Newark.

On one occasion, Epstein texted Heil complaining that Heil's “guy” was “nasty” and that he asked for a complaint card. Heil responded a minute later and told Epstein that he would speak to him.

On Christmas Eve in 2016, Epstein texted Heil that he had “just landed with your xmas cannolis” and asked Heil for an address so he could have his driver deliver them to him. A few hours later, Heil texted, “Thank you, old friend, the family's thrilled! (Including the mother-in-law!)” There is no indication of government ethics violations by Samuel or Heil.

Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies government ethics, tells WIRED that while federal ethics rules can be technical and have an exception for gifts under a certain amount of money—around $20—the ethics rules are fundamentally about preventing situations where someone would question an employee's impartiality or integrity.

Following Epstein's death in 2019, a CBP supervisor in Charleston filed a report about a CBP agricultural specialist named Tim Routch, in which an associate of Routch made two complaints about the agent to law enforcement.

That October, someone with “FBI New York” in their email signature, whose name the DOJ redacted in its release, said they were opening a preliminary investigation based on the report. Records show that in May 2020, a federal grand jury issued a subpoena to TransUnion seeking information about Routch. Other records dated around that time naming Routch include Google subscriber information, which is normally returned in response to a government request, along with Equifax and Experian credit reports.

One of the reasons the FBI interviewed Visoski was to understand Routch's relationship with Epstein, including why his contact information was found on Visoski's phone, according to email correspondence between the DOJ and Visoski's attorneys.

Notes found in a July 2020 email from someone with “Assistant US Attorney, Southern District of New York” in their signature (the name was redacted) said that Visoski didn't recall Routch, but did remember three other CBP officers. The notes said that Epstein was friends with Heil, and that while some CBP inspectors would delay Epstein, Heil and another CBP officer “wouldn't give him a hard time.” The notes also mentioned that Samuel, the customs officer who played the steel drums, was the third CBP officer.

Documents show that in August 2020, the DOJ sent a grand jury subpoena to TransUnion seeking credit reports, fraud alerts, and other documents related to the three CBP officers that Epstein's pilot named. Both the TransUnion subpoena related to the three men and the subpoena about Routch commanded the company “to testify and give evidence in regard to alleged violations of federal criminal law,” and cited the statute for conspiracy to defraud the US government and other fraud-related charges. None of the four CBP officers were ever formally charged.

The FBI eventually interviewed Routch in 2021 along with a representative from the Department of Homeland Security's office of the inspector general. According to an FBI memo documenting the interview, Routch said he had never participated in any wrongdoing with Epstein and wasn't actually friends with him.

Speaking with WIRED by phone, Routch says he had only ever visited Little Saint James once, to inspect palm trees for potential mites. One part of Routch's professional responsibilities at CBP was to prevent invasive species, and he told WIRED he volunteered to do it. Routch says he traveled to Little Saint James on Epstein's boat.

Routch says he remembers telling a supervisor about the palm inspection, but didn't seem certain about whether he had done it in his professional capacity. He says that if he had been doing it “on business,” he should've had a CBP boat take him over.

“I think I did what I did for the right reasons, but I might not have done it exactly by CBP protocol,” says Routch.

After he inspected the palms, Routch says, he had something to eat at Epstein's tiki bar. According to the FBI notes, Routch “thought it was ‘pretty cool' to have lunch at the home of a billionaire” and estimated the meal he had was under $25.

“To talk about whether the sandwich was less than $20 misses the point,” says Clark, the government ethics expert. “The point was that it was a way for [Epstein] to ingratiate himself with them, making them feel good about him.”

She says that Epstein's talent as a master manipulator who found ways to reduce friction and scrutiny is “how he got away with” trafficking children.

Routch says nothing happened after the FBI interview (besides accidentally going on a blind date several months ago with the mother of one of the FBI agents who interviewed him) and that he turned to writing novels after he left CBP. “He was polite, he was a nice guy, he was easy—well that's the facade,” Routch says of Epstein. “That's how, you know, dangerous people are. They put this facade about them.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere                                


by Alan Boyle on Feb 20, 2026 at 8:54 amFebruary 20, 2026 at 9:01 am

NASA counted down to T-minus 29 seconds during a smooth rehearsal for a historic launch that could send astronauts around the moon for the first time in more than half a century.

The run-through at Launch Complex 39B, at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, was known as a wet dress rehearsal because it involved filling up the propellant tanks on NASA's Space Launch System, a 322-foot-tall rocket that made its debut with 2022's uncrewed Artemis 1 mission.

The only major component that was missing at the launch pad was the crew. NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman, the commander for the Artemis 2 mission, said in a posting to X that he was watching the proceedings from NASA's Launch Control Center.

Once NASA reviews the results of the two-day rehearsal, mission managers will decide whether to give the final go-ahead for the Artemis 2 crew's 10-day trip around the moon and back.

Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for NASA's Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, said the space agency is targeting March 6 for liftoff. “Every night I look at the moon, and I see it, and I get real excited because I can really feel she's calling us,” she told reporters today. “And we're ready.”

This week's simulated countdown provided an opportunity for NASA to check out the Space Launch System rocket, the Orion crew capsule and ground support systems in advance of the actual launch.

An initial rehearsal on Feb. 2 was stopped at roughly T-minus 5 minutes due to a liquid hydrogen leak. Engineers made repairs at the pad, including a replacement of the hydrogen seals, to clear the way for a replay of the rehearsal.

On Thursday night, NASA worked through some communication problems at the pad — and the team dealt with what it called a “booster avionics system voltage anomaly” during the final minutes of the countdown. But the count eventually proceeded as planned to T-minus 33 seconds. At that point the countdown was paused and recycled to T-minus 10 minutes.

It took about an hour to reconfigure the rocket's fueling system for another terminal count. Then NASA's launch team went through an even smoother second countdown and reached the scheduled stopping point at T-minus 29 seconds.

Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, Artemis 2's launch director, said the maximum hydrogen leak rate during fueling was 1.6% — far below NASA's 16% limit. “Really no leakage to speak of,” she said.

John Honeycutt, the chair of Artemis 2's Mission Management Team, had a similarly positive assessment. “Overall it was a good day for us,” he said.

The four crew members for Artemis 2 are due to go into quarantine today. In addition to Wiseman, the crew includes NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Victor Glover, plus Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen. Glaze said the crew was in Florida for this week's rehearsal, but will start their quarantine back in Texas.

Artemis 2's flight plan calls for sending the astronauts on a figure-8 route around the moon and back. The trip will take them as far as 4,600 miles beyond the far side of the moon — farther out than any human has gone before.

Although Artemis 2 will be historic in its own right, the mission's main purpose is to prepare the way for Artemis 3, which aims to land humans on the lunar surface for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972. That mission is officially set for no earlier than mid-2027, but industry experts expect the schedule to slip.

Several companies headquartered in the Seattle area have a significant interest in the Artemis moon program. A facility in Redmond operated by L3Harris (previously known as Aerojet Rocketdyne) builds thrusters for the Orion spacecraft — and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture, based in Kent, is developing a Blue Moon lander that's meant to put Artemis crews on the lunar surface starting in 2030. Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket is expected to send an uncrewed cargo version of its lander to the moon sometime in the next few months.

The Seattle Seahawks have been officially for sale for a day, but the speculation about who could be the next owner of the team has been in high gear for years. National media personalities are now playing catch-up.

“The Rich Eisen Show” on ESPN / Disney+ weighed in Thursday (above) with a flurry of Seattle-connected names who could step in to buy the NFL franchise — some serious and some not so much.

Eisen said that the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen bought the team for about $140 million and change in 1997, and that while he's not an investor, Eisen knows the 2026 price tag “is gonna be more than that.”

The show's mock consulting firm — RES Consulting — then started throwing out names: actors Rainn Wilson, Adam Ray, Joel McHale and Jeffrey Dean Morgan; rockers Eddie Vedder and Jerry Cantrell; hip-hop stars Sir Mix-a-Lot and Macklemore; Kraken co-owner and Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer; and even Bill Nye the Science Guy.

But Eisen listed Bellevue, Wash.-based ex-Microsoft CEO and Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer as perhaps the most legitimate billionaire name on their speculative list. Ballmer, with a net worth of $141 billion, could buy the whole NFL, said one of the show's sidekicks.

“He could be the guy at the end of the day,” Eisen said.

There's a belief in league circles that Jeff Bezos will not be in play for the team, says Mike Florio of NBC's “Pro Football Talk,” reiterating that while the Amazon founder lived in Seattle for 30 years, he's now an East Coast guy down in Miami.

“We'll see, because obviously if he wants it he's gonna get it,” Florio said of Bezos in a nod to his $231 billion net worth.

The bigger possibility, according to Florio, is that there's a tech billionaire out there “that we don't know about, who's gonna show up with the biggest bag of money.”

Florio said the team's valuation, whether it's $6 billion, $7 billion, $11 billion or more, doesn't matter. It's about what someone is willing to pay to be part of the exclusive NFL owners club.

“I'll be surprised if it's less than 9 [billion], I won't be surprised if it's more than 10,” he said.

A concern for Seahawks fans, Florio says, is that a new owner comes in, and despite the turnkey and move-in ready appearance of the championship team, that owner will want to put his or her stamp on things.

“If I'm a Seahawks fan I want someone who just stays out of the way,” Florio said, “and gives the team all the resources that it needs.”

Lucid Motors is laying off 12% of its workforce in a bid to “improve operational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability,” according to an internal memo that was obtained by TechCrunch. 

Hourly workers on the manufacturing, logistics, and quality teams are not affected by the cuts, according to the memo, which was sent to employees being spared by the layoffs. It's unclear exactly how many workers are being laid off, but it is likely in the hundreds. Lucid Motors reported having 6,800 full-time employees globally at the end of 2024.

“Saying goodbye to colleagues is never easy,” interim CEO Marc Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted by today's actions, and we are providing severance, bonus, continued health benefits, and transition support to help them through this period.” The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The cuts come as the company is in the middle of ramping up production and deliveries of its Gravity SUV. While Lucid Motors struggled with Gravity production and quality issues during the first few months, the company has been able to pick up the pace, and ultimately doubled its 2024 output last year.

The company is also preparing to launch a more affordable mid-size EV later this year that is expected to cost around $50,000. It's collaborating with Uber and autonomous vehicle company Nuro on launching a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area this year, too. The company is scheduled to release its financial results for 2025 next week.

“Importantly, today's actions do not affect our strategy,” Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “Our core priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to focus on the start of production of our Midsize platform. With disciplined execution, we are also focused on further expansion into the robotaxi market, continued ADAS and software development, and growth in sales of Lucid Gravity and Air across existing and new geographies.”

Lucid Motors has now gone almost a full year without a permanent CEO. Peter Rawlinson, who was the company's chief executive and chief technical officer, abruptly resigned on February 25, 2025. Since then, Lucid Motors has seen a significant amount of turnover in its executive ranks, including the loss of its chief engineer, who sued the company in December for wrongful termination and discrimination. (Lucid Motors has called his legal claims “absurd.”)

Meta has announced a major update for its immersive virtual world, Horizon Worlds, on Thursday that will see it leave the metaverse behind. The tech giant said it's shifting focus for Horizon Worlds to be “almost exclusively mobile” and that it's “explicitly separating” its Quest VR platform from the virtual world.

Meta's Reality Labs division for VR and smart glasses development has lost nearly $80 billion since 2020. The update to Horizon Worlds, and other recent moves, signals that Meta is significantly rethinking its VR ambitions.

Last month, the company reportedly laid off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit's staff — and shut down several VR game studios. Additionally, it was reported that the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” 

Horizon Worlds originally launched in 2021 as a VR platform and later rolled out to the web and mobile. Meta said Thursday that to “truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we're going all-in on mobile.”

By going mobile-first, Horizon Worlds is positioning itself to compete with popular platforms like Roblox and Fortnite.

“We're in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world's biggest social networks,” Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs' VP of content, said in the blog post. “You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it's our main focus.”

Ryan went on to note that Meta is still focused on VR hardware. 

“We have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” Ryan wrote. 

Meta's metaverse ambitions have effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. After shifting its Reality Labs investments away from the metaverse, Meta is now focused on developing AI wearables and advancing its own AI models. 

During Meta's latest earnings call last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, “It's hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren't AI glasses.”

The exec also stated that sales of Meta's glasses tripled within the last year, calling them “some of the fastest-growing consumer electronics in history.”

Move over, PayPal mafia: There's a new tech mafia in Silicon Valley. As the startup behind ChatGPT, OpenAI is arguably the biggest AI player in town. The company is reportedly now in talks to finalize a $100 billion deal, valuing the company at more than $850 billion.  

Many employees have come and gone since the company first launched a decade ago, and some have launched startups of their own. Among these, some have become top rivals (like Anthropic), while others, just on investor interest alone, have managed to raise billions without even launching a product (see, Thinking Machine Labs).  

In January, Aliisa Rosenthal, OpenAI's first sales leader, spoke a little bit about this growing network. She, like the other OpenAI alums who did not become founders, decided to become an investor and said she was going to tap into the ex-OpenAI founder network to look for deal flow. We know Peter Deng, OpenAI's former head of consumer products (and now general partner at Felicis) already has.  

Below is a roundup of the major startups founded by OpenAI alumni, in alphabetical order. And we are certain this list will grow over time. 

David Luan was OpenAI's engineering VP until he left in 2020. After a stint at Google, in 2021 he co-founded Adept AI Labs, a startup that builds AI tools for employees. The startup last raised $350 million at a valuation north of $1 billion in 2023, but Luan left in late 2024 to oversee Amazon's AI agents lab after Amazon hired Adept's founders.

Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in 2021 to form their own startup, San Francisco-based Anthropic, that has long touted a focus on AI safety. OpenAI co-founder John Schulman joined Anthropic in 2024, pledging to build a “safe AGI.” The company has since become OpenAI's biggest rival and just raised a $30 billion Series G, nabbing a $380 billion valuation in the process. IPO rumors are also swirling, as the company reportedly prepares for a public listing that could come sometime this year. (OpenAI is also allegedly preparing for an IPO this year and is maybe even trying to beat Anthropic to the public market.) 

Three ex-OpenAI staffers (Rhythm Garg, Linden Li, and Yash Patil) have reportedly raised $20 million for a startup called Applied Compute, as reported by Upstart Media. All three of them worked as technical staff at OpenAI for more than a year before leaving last May to launch the startup, per their LinkedIns. The startup helps enterprises train and deploy custom AI agents. Benchmark led the round, valuing the 10-month-old company at $100 million, Upstart Media reported. 

The trio all worked at OpenAI in 2016 and 2017 as research scientists before founding Covariant, a Berkeley, California-based startup that builds foundation AI models for robots. In 2024, Amazon hired all three of the Covariant founders and about a quarter of its staff. The quasi-acquisition was viewed by some as part of a broader trend of Big Tech attempting to avoid antitrust scrutiny. 

Tim Shi was an early member of OpenAI's team, where he focused on building safe artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked at OpenAI for a year in 2017 but left to found Cresta, a San Francisco-based AI contact center startup that has raised over $270 million from VCs like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and others, according to a press release.

Jonas Schneider led OpenAI's software engineering for robotics team but left in 2019 to co-found Daedalus, which builds advanced factories for precision components. The San Francisco-based startup raised a $21 million Series A last year with backing from Khosla Ventures, among others.

Computer vision expert Andrej Karpathy was a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI, leaving the startup to join Tesla in 2017 to lead its autopilot program. Karpathy is also well-known for his YouTube videos explaining core AI concepts. He left Tesla in 2024 to found his own education technology startup, Eureka Labs, a San Francisco-based startup that is building AI teaching assistants.

Margaret Jennings worked at OpenAI in 2022 and 2023 until she left to co-found Kindo, which markets itself as an AI chatbot for enterprises. Kindo has raised over $27 million in funding, last raising a $20.6 million Series A in 2024. Jennings left Kindo in 2024 to head product and research at French AI startup Mistral, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Maddie Hall worked on “special projects” at OpenAI but left in 2019 to co-found Living Carbon, a San Francisco-based startup that aims to create engineered plants that can suck more carbon out of the sky to fight climate change. Living Carbon raised a $21 million Series A round in 2023, bringing its total funding until then to $36 million, according to a press release.

Liam Fedus, OpenAI's VP of post-training research, left the company in March 2025 to team up with his former Google Brain colleague, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, and launch Periodic Labs. The startup seeks to use AI scientists to find new materials, particularly new superconducting materials. It came out of stealth mode in September 2025, armed with a massive $300 million in seed-round funding with backers that included Jezz Bezos, Eric Schmidt, Felicis and Andreessen Horowitz. 

Aravind Srinivas worked as a research scientist at OpenAI for a year until 2022, when he left the company to co-found AI search engine Perplexity. His startup has attracted a string of high-profile investors like Jeff Bezos and Nvidia, although it's also caused controversy over alleged unethical web scraping. Perplexity, which is based in San Francisco, last reported a raise of $200 million at a $20 billion valuation. 

Jeff Arnold worked as OpenAI's head of operations for five months in 2016 before co-founding San Francisco-based accounting startup Pilot in 2017. Pilot, which focused initially on doing accounting for startups, last raised a $100 million Series C in 2021 at a $1.2 billion valuation and has attracted investors like Jeff Bezos. Arnold worked as Pilot's COO until leaving in 2024 to launch a VC fund.

Shariq Hashme worked for OpenAI for 9 months in 2017 on a bot that could play the popular video game Dota, per his LinkedIn profile. After a few years at data-labeling startup Scale AI, he co-founded London-based Prosper Robotics in 2021. The startup says it's working on a robot butler for people's homes, a hot trend in robotics that other players like Norway's 1X and Texas-based Apptronik are also working on.

OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever left OpenAI in May 2024 after he was reportedly part of a failed effort to replace CEO Sam Altman. Shortly afterward, he co-founded Safe Superintelligence, or SSI, with “one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence,” he says. Details about what exactly the startup is up to are scant: It has no product and no revenue yet. But investors are clamoring for a piece anyway, and it's been able to raise $2 billion, with its latest valuation reportedly rising to $32 billion this month. SSI is based in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.

Emmett Shear is the former CEO of Twitch who was OpenAI's interim CEO in November 2023 for a few days before Sam Altman rejoined the company. Shear launched an AI company, StemAI, in 2024 (though it seems to have since rebranded as Softmax). The company, which appears to be a research company, has attracted funding from Andreessen Horowitz.

Mira Murati, OpenAI's CTO, left OpenAI to found her own company, Thinking Machines Lab, which emerged from stealth in February 2025. It said at the time (rather vaguely) that it will build AI that's more “customizable” and “capable.” The San Francisco AI startup, now valued at $12 billion, announced its first product late last year: an API that fine-tunes language models. It recently made headlines when two of its co-founders announced earlier this year that they would return to OpenAI. 

Kyle Kosic left OpenAI in 2023 to become a co-founder and infrastructure lead of xAI, Elon Musk's AI startup that offers a rival chatbot, Grok. In 2024, however, he hopped back to OpenAI, where he remains. Meanwhile, xAI (which acquired Musk's social media site X) was purchased by Musk's SpaceX, giving the coalesce company a valuation of $1.25 trillion. It is looking to go public sometime in June for what could be a historic listing. 

Angela Jiang left OpenAI in 2024, after working as a product manager and on the public policy team. In April 2025, she quietly launched Worktrace, which uses AI to help enterprises make business operations more efficient. It observes employee work patterns and automates workflow, according to the company's website. The business is backed by Mura Murati, OpenAI's former CTO, who went on to launch Thinking Labs. It is also backed by OpenAI's startup fund, in addition to a slew of other OpenAI names, like its chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon. 

In addition to these startups, a number of other former OpenAI employees have founded startups that are still in stealth mode, according to various updates TechCrunch found on LinkedIn. For instance, it seems that former OpenAI researcher Danilo Hellermark has been working on a generative AI stealth startup for the past few years. He officially left OpenAI at the beginning of 2023. There's also one apparently in the works from Lucas Negritto, who worked on OpenAI's technical team and left the company in 2023 after three years. Since then, he's founded one startup and has been working on another since August 2025, according to his LinkedIn.

Peak XV announced on Friday that it has raised $1.3 billion across new India and Asia-focused funds. The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.

The capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.

Peak XV split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia's portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.

The firm's new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.

Singh said Peak XV is not trying to match rivals dollar-for-dollar, emphasizing that the firm's priority is generating strong returns rather than maximizing assets under management. The firm will continue to size its funds based on where it sees the best opportunity to deliver “high-performing funds,” he said.

He added that Peak XV is still building its presence in the U.S. and is selective about where it competes. “In the U.S. market, we are an underdog — and that's great,” Singh said, adding that the firm is focusing on areas where its experience in software, developer tools, and fintech gives it an edge.

The latest fundraise follows a period of leadership changes at Peak XV, including the recent departures of senior partner Ashish Agrawal and investors Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma. Singh told TechCrunch the firm retains significant experience on its leadership team, noting that five of its seven managing partners have been with Peak XV for more than a decade. The broader Peak XV team includes more than 30 full-time investors, with about a dozen leading investments across its markets.

Peak XV has returned more than $7 billion in cash to investors since inception, Singh said, adding that 35 of its portfolio companies have gone public. He declined to specify distributions since the firm's split from Sequoia Capital. In September 2024, TechCrunch reported that the firm had returned about $1.2 billion in the year.

Ahead of the current raise, Peak XV's prior fund was sized at $2.85 billion in late 2021, before the firm split from Sequoia Capital. That figure was later reduced to about $2.4 billion as part of what Singh described as a disciplined approach to capital. The earlier pool included Peak XV's India growth strategy, and Singh said the firm does not plan to raise a new growth fund until more of that dry powder is deployed.

Singh expects to deploy the new capital primarily into AI, fintech, and consumer startups, while also seeing emerging opportunities in deep tech. The firm has made more than 80 investments in AI startups to date. He added that the U.S.-India ties are becoming increasingly important as more founders in the region build for global markets.

For the most sought-after founders, the prestige of a top-tier accelerator is increasingly weighed against giving up a significant ownership stake in their company.

 Ali Partovi, the veteran investor and CEO of venture firm Neo, wants to offer the mentorship and community of one of the most elite accelerator programs — without forcing the best up-and-coming tech leaders to hand over 7% or sometimes 10% of their company before they've even started.

Partovi, who is known for his early investments in Facebook, Cursor, and Kalshi, has just introduced Neo Residency, a new, competitively structured program that combines the firm's now four-year-old accelerator with a track for current college students.

The terms that Neo Residency offers are so founder-friendly as to be “not even comparable to any other accelerator,” Partovi told TechCrunch.

For the cohort of 12 to 15 startups entering the program this summer, Neo will invest $750,000 via an uncapped SAFE — a contract that gives an investor future equity in exchange for money now, with no ceiling on the valuation used to calculate that stake. Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won't receive its equity until the company's next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo's stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm's ownership drops to just 0.75%.

“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.

In comparison, Y Combinator typically takes a fixed 7% of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz's Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.

“We're offering a deal so great that it's appropriate even for founders who are not even considering any other accelerator,” Partovi said.

 The lower equity cost is only part of Neo Residency's appeal.

The founders will work for three months at Neo's offices in San Francisco's Jackson Square district, participate in a two-week bootcamp in the Oregon mountains, and be mentored by about 30 experienced operators, including Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, and Fuzzy Khosrowshahi, CTO of Notion (and the creator of Google Sheets and also Partovi's uncle).

But the program's main draw is its prestige: Seed and Series A investors generally have great respect for founders handpicked by Partovi.

“The one [accelerator] I like right now that has very high signal, and every founder I met there is just wicked smart, is Neo,” Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner of FPV Ventures, said onstage at 2025 TechCrunch Disrupt.

Startups that have gone through the program include Moment, a fintech company that has raised $56 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, and Anterior, a healthcare AI startup backed by NEA and Sequoia.

The Neo Residency will also select five to eight students — either as individuals or small teams — who will receive a $40,000, no-strings-attached grant to take a semester off to work on a project. While there is no requirement to drop out or start a formal company immediately, Partovi said he hopes the students will catch the entrepreneurial bug and, when they eventually launch a startup, turn to Neo for funding.

Neo is keeping the program small and elite: It will cap its two annual cohorts at 20 teams each, consisting of a mix of active startups and student projects.

Why is Neo offering such generous terms? “We have more confidence in our ability to attract and pick out future superstars than ever before,” Partovi said.

His track record suggests that confidence is well-founded. He famously met Cursor co-founder Michael Truell while Truell was still an MIT student and later wrote one of the first checks into the AI coding startup, now valued at nearly $30 billion.

It's no secret that the electrical grid is aging, but one part stands out from the rest. Transformers haven't changed much since Thomas Edison made his first light bulb. 

Now, a string of startups are working to modernize the transformer, replacing it with modern power electronics that promise to give grid operators more control over how and where electricity flows. 

“It becomes a very powerful device, equivalent to your internet router,” Subhashish Bhattacharya, co-founder and CTO of DG Matrix, told TechCrunch.

Three startups recently raised sizable rounds to scale up production of their solid-state transformer technologies. This week, DG Matrix raised a $60 million Series A and Heron Power raised $140 million in a Series B round. In November, Amperesand raised $80 million to chase after the burgeoning data center market.

Existing transformers are reliable and efficient, but that's about it. They're relatively crude instruments, made largely of copper and iron. They react passively to changes on the grid and are capable of tackling only one task per device.

“An old-school steel, copper, and oil transformer doesn't have any monitoring, doesn't have any control,” Drew Baglino, founder and CEO of Heron Power, told TechCrunch. In instances where electricity surges or a power plant trips offline, that can be a liability.

The devices can incorporate power from a range of difference sources — including traditional power plants, renewables, and batteries — and transform that electricity into either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) at a number of different voltages, allowing them to replace several devices.

For data centers, solid-state transformers offer an appealing alternative, allowing them to shrink the footprint of their power systems while giving them finer control over where and how electricity is directed.

Solid-state transformers poised to arrive at a time when existing transformers are aging and demand for new ones is surging — a classic tech supercycle. Most transformers on the grid today are several decades old, according to the National Laboratory of the Rockies. As demand from data centers, EV chargers, and other parts of the grid rises, the NLR expects the amount of power flowing through transformers to double by 2050.

While data centers are the the first market those companies are chasing, they also have their sights set on the electrical grid, which in the U.S. alone hosts as many as 80 million transformers. 

“All of the distribution transformers are ultimately going to need to be replaced. Over 50% of them are 35 years old. There's a big need for an upgrade,” Baglino said.

Because they're are made from silicon-based materials, they're flexible, controllable, and software-updatable. They're also immune from price fluctuations that rock the copper market.

“Power semiconductors keep getting cheaper. Steel, copper, and oil, unfortunately, is not in that situation,” Baglino said. “Commodity prices can move all over the place, and they generally move up.” 

In an old-style transformer, power flows into the transformer through copper wires wound around one side of an O-shaped iron core. As the electricity flows, it induces a magnetic field in the core. On the other side of the core, the magnetic field induces electricity in another set of copper windings. If the wires wrap around the core more times on the input side than the output side, the voltage decreases on the output side. If the ratio inverts, the output voltage increases.

Solid-state transformers eschew the copper windings in favor of semiconductors, using materials like silicon carbide or gallium nitride to handle frequency conversion. They can come in a range of configurations, with the most comprehensive setup consisting of three basic parts: a rectifier that converts alternating current to direct current, a converter that changes the voltage of the direct current, and an inverter that changes the direct current back into alternating current.

Unlike iron-core transformers, solid-state transformers can handle power that flows in both directions, making them useful in places that need backup power, like data centers. 

In a data center, a solid-state transformer can replace several different pieces of equipment, not just the transformer that steps voltage down from the grid. Every data center uses backup power, which requires a string of devices to bring power into the facility. Solid-state transformers can handle all of those duties in one box.

The technology also allows data centers to more easily integrate so-called behind-the-meter power, where generating capacity is connected directly to the data center, not the grid. Those typically require another set of transformers.

And when coupled with grid-scale batteries, solid-state transformers can eliminate uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), too, freeing up space inside the data center for more racks.

“If you add up the cost of everything we've taken out, we're 60% to 70% of that cost,” Haroon Inam, co-founder and CEO of DG Matrix, told TechCrunch.

DG Matrix has been focusing on its Interport technology, which can route power from multiple sources to multiple loads of differing voltages, a setup the company holds multiple patents on.

Heron Power, meanwhile, is working to transforming medium-voltage power in data centers, solar farms, and grid-scale battery installations. In a data center, it's Heron Link transformers can provide racks with 30 seconds of power while backup sources come online. Altogether, Heron Link occupy 70% less space than existing parts. At a solar farm, Heron Power's transformers can perform the duties of an inverter and a transformer for the same price.

In a head-to-head comparison, solid state transformers still command a cost premium over iron-core transformers. For that reason, they're unlikely to replace the giant humming boxes at grid substations in the very near future. 

But in data centers and at EV charging hubs, where solid-state transformers take the place of several pieces of equipment, they'll start making inroads. 

When they finally hit the grid in bigger numbers, they have the potential to cut down on transmission and distribution costs, one of the biggest contributors to utility bill inflation.

Because today's transformers are passive, unable to react to fluctuations, distribution networks have been built with a significant amount of spare capacity, Baglino said. Solid-state transformers, though, and can respond to changing conditions, allowing grid operators to send more power through the same lines.

“You can actually make the infrastructure more affordable because you're putting more kilowatt-hours through the same poles and wires,” he said. “That's where intelligence, in place of passive mechanical objects that were designed 100 years ago, can make a big difference.”

I think Github Co-Pilot is most annoying from what I've tried... it's great for finishing off a task that's half done where the structure is laid out, as long as you put blinders keeping it focused on it.  OpenAI and Google's options seem to get things mostly right, but do some really goofy wrong things from my own experiences.They all seem to have trouble using state of the art and current libraries by default, even when you explicitly request them.

Is the problem you observed true regardless of the model you picked?

reply

If the default option isn't at least arguably the best option I can't really speak to that.  I would suggest that maybe metrics on a given set of technologies be done and that based on the project in use, that it should choose the best option dynamically by default. Such as C#+MS-SQL vs Node+Postgres vs Python+Matlab+DuckDB.

This coding agent is minimal, and it completely changed how I used models and Claude's cli now feels like extremely slow bloat.I'd not be surprised if you're right in that this is companies / management will prefer to ""pay for a complete package"" approach for a long while, but power-users should not care for the model providers.I have like 100 lines of code to get me a tmux controls & semaphore_wait extension in the pi harness. That gave me a better orchestration scheme a month ago when I adopted it, than Claude has right now.As far as I can tell, the more you try to train your model on your harness, the worse they get. Bitter lesson #2932.

The reason these LLM tools being good is they can ""just do stuff."" Anthropic bans third party subscription auth? I'll just have my other tool use Claude Code in tmux.

If that's the case I'd expect local model usage will scale up too and it will get more difficult for enterprise providers.(Nothing is certain but some things have become a bit more obvious than they were 6 months ago.)

Bloated apps are a material disadvantage. If I'm in a competitive industry that slow down alone can mean failure. The only thing Claude Code has going for it now is the loss making $200 month subsidy. Is there any conceivable GUI overlay that Anthropic or OpenAI can add to make their software better than the current terminal apps? Sure, for certain edge cases, but then why isn't the user building those themselves? 24 months ago we could have said that's too hard, but that isn't the case in 2026.Microsoft added all of this stuff in to Windows, and it's a 5 alarm fire. Stuff that used to be usable is a mess and really slow. Running linux with Claude Code, Codex, or Pi is clearly superior to having a Windows device with neither (if it wasn't possible to run these in Windows; just a hypothetical.)From the business/enterprise perspective - there is no single most important thing, but having an environment that is reliable and predictable is high up there. Monday morning, an the Anthropic API endpoint is down, uh oh! In the longer term, businesses will really want to control both the model and the software that interfaces with it.If the end game is just the same as talking to the Star Trek computer, and competitors are narrowing gaps rather than widening them (e.g. Anthropic and OpenAI releases models minutes from each other now, Chinese frontier models getting closer in capability not further), then it is really hard to see how either company achieves a vertical lock down.We could actually move down the stack, and then the real problem for OpenAI and Anthropic is nVidia. 2030, the data center expansion is bust, nVidia starts selling all of these cards to consumers directly and has a huge financial incentive to make sure the performant local models exist. Everyone in the semiconductor supply chain below nvidia only cares about keeping sales going, so it stops with them.Maybe nvidia is the real winner?Also is it just me or does it now feel like hn comments are just talking to a future LLM?

In the longer term, businesses will really want to control both the model and the software that interfaces with it.If the end game is just the same as talking to the Star Trek computer, and competitors are narrowing gaps rather than widening them (e.g. Anthropic and OpenAI releases models minutes from each other now, Chinese frontier models getting closer in capability not further), then it is really hard to see how either company achieves a vertical lock down.We could actually move down the stack, and then the real problem for OpenAI and Anthropic is nVidia. 2030, the data center expansion is bust, nVidia starts selling all of these cards to consumers directly and has a huge financial incentive to make sure the performant local models exist. Everyone in the semiconductor supply chain below nvidia only cares about keeping sales going, so it stops with them.Maybe nvidia is the real winner?Also is it just me or does it now feel like hn comments are just talking to a future LLM?

The advances in the Claude Code harness have been more around workflow automation rather than capability improvements, and truthfully workflows are very user-dependent, so an opinionated harness is only ever going to be ""right"" for a narrow segment of users, and it's going to annoy a lot of others. This is happening now, but the sub subsidy washes out a lot of the discontent.

There are parallels to the silly Metaverse hype wave from a few years ago. At the time I saw a surprising number of people defending the investment saying it was important for Facebook to control their own platform. Well sure it's beneficial for Facebook to control a platform, but that benefit is purely for the company and if anything it would harm current and future users. Unsurprisingly, the pitch to please think of this giant corporation's needs wasn't a compelling pitch in the end.

This whole game is a bizarre battle.In the future, many companies will have slightly different secret RL sauces. I'd want to use Gemini for documentation, Claude for design, Codex for planning, yada yada ... there will be no generalist take-all model, I just don't believe RL scaling works like that.I'm not convinced that a single company can own the best performing model in all categories, I'm not even sure the economics make it feasible.Good for us, of course.

And that's out of the box. With how comically extensible pi is and how much control it gives you over every aspect of the pipeline, as soon as you start building extensions for your own, personal workflow, Claude Code legimitely feels like a trash app in comparison.I don't care what Anthropic does - I'll keep using pi. If they think they need to ban me for that, then, oh well. I'll just continue to keep using pi. Just no longer with Claude models.

Apple can do those things because they control the hardware device, which has physical distribution, and they lock down the ecosystem. There is no third party app store, and you can't get the Photos app to save to Google Drive.With Claude Code, just export an env variable or use a MITM proxy + some middleware to forward requests to OpenAI instead. It's impossible to have lock in. Also, coding agent CLIs are a commodity.

i've been wondering how anthropic is going to survive long term.

That sounds absurd to me. Committing to not building in advertising is very important and fundamental to me. Asking people who pay for a personal subscription rather than paying by the API call to use that subscription themselves sounds to me like it is. Just clarifying the social compact that was already implied.I WANT to be able to pay a subscription price. Rather like the way I pay for my internet connectivity with a fixed monthly bill. If I had to pay per packet transmitted, I would have to stop and think about it every time I decided to download a large file or watch a movie. Sure, someone with extremely heavy usage might not be able to use a normal consumer internet subscription; but it works fine for my personal use. I like having the option for my AI usage to operate the same way.

It's kind of like a new restaurant started handing out coupons for ""90% off"", wanting to attract diners to the restaurant, customers started coming in and ordering bulk meals then immediately packaging them in tupperware containers and taking it home (violating the spirit of the arrangement, even if not the letter of the arrangement), so the restaurant changed the terms on the discount to say ""limited to in-store consumption only, not eligible for take-home meals"", and instead of still being grateful that they're getting food for 90% off, the cheapskate customers are getting angry that they're no longer allowed to exploit the massive subsidy however they want.

Here, they put limits on the ""under-cover"" use of the subscription. If they can provide a relatively cheap subscription against the direct API use, this is because they can control the stuff end-to-end, the application running on your system (Claude Code, Claude Desktop) and their systems.As you subscribe to these plans, this is the ""contract"", you can use only through their tools. If you want full freedom, use the API, with a per token pricing.For me, this is fair.

I am very curious what is particularly illegal about this.

You are paying for access to Claude Code.Is it also illegal that if you pay for Playstation Plus that you can't play those games on an Xbox?Is it illegal that you can't use third party netflix apps?I really don't want to defend and AI company here but this is perfectly normal. In no other situation would we expect access to the API, the only reason this is considered different is because they also have a different service that gives access to the API.

Anthropic provides an API third-party clients can use. The pro-market position is that the API must be available at every pricing tier, as the benefits from increased competition outweigh the imposed restrictions to business practices. The pro-business position is that Anthropic must be allowed to choose which tiers can use the API, as the benefits from increased freedom outweigh the reduced competition in the market.

Or should every app/service be required to expose documented APIs?

While I do personally disagree with thinking that you should be able to do this when it was never sold in that way, at the end of the day as a customer you can choose if you want to use the product in the way that they are saying or use something else if you don't want to support that model.However the person I was responding too brought up legality which is a very different discussion.

But if that is the service they are making and they are clear about what it is when you sign up... That does not make it illegal.I can see why people think they should be entitled to do this, but it does not align with how they are selling the service or how many other companies sell services. In most situations you don't get unlimited access to the individual components of how a service works (the API), you are expected to use the service (in this case Claude Code) directly.

I disagree, in many cases what you are specifically paying for is the combination of the software and the service that are designed to work together. And in many cases do not work independent of eachother.There are countless cases of this, that what you are paying for is a thing that is made up of a piece of software and a serverside component.

If that was true, then getting equivalent usage of the API without claude.ai and Claude Code should cost less, not more.You can try to find all sorts of explanations for it, at the end of the day is quite simple: they are subsidizing one product in order to grow the market share, and they are doing it at a loss now, because they believe they will make up for it later. I understand the reasoning from a business point of view, but this doesn't mean they are entitled to their profits. I do not understand people that think we simply accept their premise and assume they can screw us over just because they asked and put it on a piece of paper.

You'd have to point me to an authoritative source on that (explicitly saying users are allowed to use their models via private APIs in apps of the user's choosing). If something isn't explicitly provided in the contract, then it can be changed at any point in any way without notice.Honestly, I'm not big on capitalism in general, but I don't understand why people should expect companies to provide things exactly the way they want at exactly the prices they would like to be charged (if at all). That's just not how the world/system works, or should, especially given there are so many alternatives available. If one doesn't like what's happening with some service, then let the wallet do the talking and move to another. Emigration is a far more effective message than complaining.

There was a third choice, which was better than both of the ones presented: use any other client that can talk with our API, at whatever usage rate they deemed acceptable. If the ""private API"" was accessible via OAuth, then it's hardly ""private"".We can argue all day, when I signed up there was nothing saying that access was exclusive via the tools they provided. They changed the rules not because it was costing them more (or even if does, they are losing money on Pro customers anyway so arguing about that is silly) but because they opened themselves for some valid and fair competition.

The primary offering is access to the models. That's what the subscription is about. They can try as hard as they want to market it as Claude being the product and access to the model being an ancillary service, but to me this is just marketing bs. No one is signing-up for Claude because their website is nicer, or because of Claude Code.

reply

Yes, that agreement is there, with the condition that their app is used. That's option B. And I'd think it fairly obvious that if one has to go to extraordinary lengths to gain access, like finding a key under a mat, or needing to login with an official client to gain access to a token for an unofficial client, then - implicitly - it's highly unlikely that that method of access is part of the agreement. And Anthropic has now made it explicitly clear that no, that access method is not part of the agreement.

reply

And setting this condition is what constitutes a tie-in sale.> if one has to go to extraordinary lengths to gain accessBS! Sorry, there is nothing extraordinary about using an undocumented API.

The laws prohibiting tie-ins don't make it illegal to sell two products that work well together.  That's literally what the laws are designed to make you do -- seperate products into seperate pieces.  The problem tie-in laws were designed to combat was situations like Microsoft making a popular OS then making a mediocre spreadsheet program and pushing the cost of that spreadsheet program into the cost of buying the OS.  That way consumers would go ""well it's expensive but I get excel with it so it's ok"" and even if someone else made a slightly better spreadsheet they didn't have the chance to convince users because they had to buy it all as one package.Anthropic would be doing something much closer to that if they did what you wanted.  They'd be saying: hey we have this neat Claude code thing you all want to use but you can't buy that without also purchasing third party access. Now some company offering a cheaper/better third party usage product doesn't get the chance to convince you because anthropic forced you to buy that just to get claude code.Ultimately this change unbundled products the opposite of a tie-in.  What is upsetting about it is that it no longer feels to you like you are getting a good deal because you now have to fork over a bunch more cash to keep getting what you want.  But that's not illegal, that's just not offering good value for money.

Look at it this way: the service that you're accessing is really a (primarily desired) side-effect of the software. So re subscriptions, what they're actually providing are the apps (web, desktop, etc), and the apps use their service to aid the fulfillment of their functionality. Those wanting direct access to the internal service can get an API key for that purpose. That's just how their product offering is structured.

I don't have a dog in this fight but is this actually true?  If you're using Claude Code they can know that whatever client-side model selection they put into it is active.  So if they can get away with routing 80% of the requests to Haiku and only route to Opus for the requests that really need it, that does give them a cost model where they can rely on lower costs than if a third-party client just routes to Opus for everything.  Even if they aren't doing that sort of thing now, it would be understandable if they wanted to.

reply

They still have the total consumption under their control (*bar prompt caching and other specific optimizations) where in the past they even had different quotas per model, it shouldn't cost them more money, just be a worse/different service I guess

reply

As things are currently, better models mean bigger models that take more storage+RAM+CPU, or just spend more time processing a request. All this translates to higher costs, and may be mitigated by particular configs triggered by knowledge that a given client, providing particular guarantees, is on the other side.

If subsidizing that offering is a good hook to get higher paying API users on board, then some of that cost is a customer aquisition cost, whereas the cost to them of providing the API doesn't have the same proportion that they can justify as a customer acquisition cost.

This sounds like engineering, finance, and legal got together and decided they were in an untenable position if OpenAI started nudging OpenClaw to burn even more tokens on Anthropic (or just never optimize) + continually updated workarounds to using subscription auth. But I'm sure OpenAI would never do something like that...At the end of the day, it's the same 'fixed price plan for variable use on a constrained resource' cellular problem: profitability becomes directly linked to actual average usage.

You can of course use OpenCode or any other project with the API, which is also offered as a separate product. People just don't want to do that because it's not subsidized, ie. more expensive. But the entire reason it's subsidized is that Anthropic can use the data to improve their product.

reply

This is grade A, absolute crap. It's subsidized because everyone else is subsidizing it, and everyone is doing it because they are trying to lock their consumer share.The solution is quite simple. Just get the FTC to forbid tie-in sales so that we don't get the huge corporations using their infinite resources to outlive the competition. Anthropic/Amazon/Google/OpenAI/Facebook can offer any type of service they want, but if the access to the API costs $X when offered standalone, then that is the baseline price for anything that depends on the API to work.

In reality, heavy subscription users are subsidized by light subscription users.

Probably the ToS change was to make it more clear.To be fair, the developer is the one breaking the ToS in the most significant way, breaking boilerplate reverse engineering clauses.But the user also is very aware that they are doing something funny, in order to authenticate, the user is asked to authorize Claude Code, n ot Opencode or OpenClaw, it's clearly a hack and there is no authorization from Anthropic to OpenClaw, and you are not giving Anthropic authorization to give access to OC, the user asks Anthropic to give access to Claude Code, the only reason this works is because OC is pretending to be Claude Code.The bottom line issue is that as a user you are paying for a subscription to a package that includes an expected usage. That package is not metered, but it is given on the condition that you will use it as it is expected to be used, by chatting manually with the chatbot, which results in a reasonable expected token usage. By using a program that programatically calls the chat interface, the token consumption increases beyond what was part of the original deal, and so the price should be different.A similar scenario would be if you go to an all you can eat buffet, you pay for a single person, but then you actually unload an army of little clones that start eating the whole buffet. Technically it was an all you can eat buffet and you paid the price right? Well no, come on, don't play dumb.

It's just price differentiation - they know consumers are price sensitive, and that companies wanting to use their APIs to build products so they can slap AI on their portfolio and get access to AI-related investor money can be milked. On the consumer-facing front, they live off branding and if you're not using claude code, you might not associate the tool with Anthropic, which means losing publicity that drives API sales.

Instead, many, many websites (especially in the music industry) have some sort of funky API that you can only get access to if you have enough online clout. Very few are transparent about what ""enough clout"" even means or how much it'd cost you, and there's like an entire industry of third-party API resellers that cost like 10x more than if you went straight to the source. But you can't, because you first have to fulfill some arbitrary criteria that you can't even know about ahead of time.It's all very frustrating to deal with.

Spotify in particular is just patently the very worst. They released an amazing and delightful app sdk, allowing for making really neat apps in the desktop app in 2011. Then cancelled it by 2014. It feels like their entire ecosystem has only ever gone downhill. Their car device was cancelled nearly immediately. Every API just gets worse and worse. Remarkable to see a company have only ever such a downward slide. The Spotify Graveyard is, imo, a place of singnificantly less honor than the Google Graveyard. https://web.archive.org/web/20141104154131/https://gigaom.co...But also, I feel like this broad repulsive trend is such an untenable position now that AI is here. Trying to make your app an isolated disconnected service is a suicide pact. Some companies will figure out how to defend their moat, but generally people are going to prefer apps that allow them to use the app as they want, increasingly, over time. And they are not going to be stopped even if you do try to control terms!Were I a smart engaged company, I'd be trying to build WebMCP access as soon as possible. Adoption will be slow, this isn't happening fast, but people who can mix human + agent activity on your site are going to be delighted by the experience, and that you will spread!WebMCP is better IMHO than conventional APIs because it layers into the experience you are already having. It's not a separate channel; it can build and use the session state of your browsing to do the things. That's a huge boon for users.

I totally understand that I should not reuse my own account to provide services to others, as direct API usage is the obvious choice here, but this is a different case.I am currently developing something that would be the perfect fit for this OAuth based flow and I find it quite frustrating that in most cases I cannot find a clear answer to this question. I don't even know who I would be supposed to contact to get an answer or discuss this as an independent dev.EDIT: Some answers to my comment have pointed out that the ToS of Anthropic were clear, I'm not saying they aren't if taken in a vacuum, yet in practice even after this being published some confusion remained online, in particular regarding wether OAuth token usage was still ok with the Agent SDK for personal usage. If it happens to be, that would lead to other questions I personally cannot find a clear answer to, hence my original statement. Also, I am very interested about the stance of other companies on this subject.Maybe I am being overly cautious here but I want to be clear that this is just my personal opinion and me trying to understand what exactly is allowed or not.

These kinds of business decisions show how these $200.00 subscriptions for their slot/infinite jest machines basically light that $200.00 on fire, and in general how unsustainable these business models are.Can't wait for it all to fail, they'll eventually try to get as many people to pay per token as possible, while somehow getting people to use their verbose antigentic tools that are able to inflate revenue through inefficient context/ouput shenanigans.

I used Claude back when API per token pricing was the only option and it was bad for all the usual reasons pay-per-use sucks compared to flat billing: you're constantly thinking about cost. Like trying to watch a Netflix video with a ticker in the corner counting up the cents you owe them.I don't understand your claim that they want people paying per token - the subscription is the opposite of that, and it also has upsides for them as a business since most people don't saturate the usage limits, and the business gets to stuff a bunch of value-adds on a bundle offering which is generally a more lucrative and enticing consumer pricing model.

They've built an industry on the backs of gambling addicts and dopamine feins (I'm generalizing but this is a thing with LLM users (just read vibe coders posts on twitter, they're slot machine users). Ask sports betting operators from back in 2019-2022 how it worked out for them when they tried to give out 1-2k a year to attract new customers, and then realized their customers will switch platforms in an instant they see a new shiny offer. Look up the Fanduel Founders ""exit"" for an insight into this.They have to eventually stop catering to the slot machine users, which are generally paying for these hugely lossy flat rate subscriptions, and somehow get them used to a different type of payment model, or cater strictly to enterprise... Which also aren't going to tolerate paying 20k a month in tokens per developer, is my guess.... Lots of delicate pricing problems to figure out for all these companies.

On the other hand OpenAI and GitHub Copilot have, as far as I know, explicitly allowed their users to connect to at least some third party tools and use their quotas from there, notably to OpenCode.What is unclear to me is whether they are considering also allowing commercial apps to do that. For instance if I publish a subscription based app and my users pay for the app itself rather than for LLM inference, would that be allowed?

Maybe.First, Anthropic is also trying to manage user satisfaction as well as costs. If OpenCode or whatever burns through your limits faster, are you likely to place the blame on OpenCode?Maybe a good analogy was when DoorDash/GrubHub/Uber Eats/etc signed up restaurants to their system without their permission. When things didn't go well, the customers complained about the restaurants, even though it wasn't their fault, because they chose not to support delivery at scale.Second, flat-rate pricing, unlike API pricing, is the same for cached vs uncached iirc, so even if total token limits are the same, less caching means higher costs.

Claude has gotten a lot of popular media attention in the last few weeks, and the influx of users is constraining compute/memory on an already compute heavy model.
So you get all the suspected ""tricks"" like quantization, shorter thinking, KV cache optimizations.It feels like the same thing that happened to Gemini 3, and what you can even feel throughout the day (the models seem smartest at 12am).Dario in his interview with dwarkesh last week also lamented the same refrain that other lab leaders have: compute is constrained and there are big tradeoffs in how you allocate it. It feels safe to reason then that they will use any trick they can to free up compute.

At least weekly I run a set of prompts to compare codex/claude against each other. This is quite easy the prompt sessions are just text files that are saved.The problem is doing it enough for statistical significance and judging the output as better or not.

What is interesting is that OpenAI and GitHub seem to be taking the opposite approach with Copilot/OpenCode, essentially treating third-party tool access as a feature that increases subscription stickiness. Different bets on whether the LTV of a retained subscriber outweighs the marginal inference cost.Would not be surprised if this converges eventually. Either Anthropic opens up once their margins improve, or OpenAI tightens once they realize the arbitrage is too expensive at scale.

I'm rather certain, though cannot prove it, that buying the same tokens would cost at least 10x more if bought from API. Anecdotally, my cursor team usage was getting to around 700$ / month. After switching to claude code max, I have so far only once hit the 3h limit window on the 100$ sub.What Im thinking is that Anthropic is making loss with users who use it a lot, but there are a lot of users who pay for max, but don't actually use it.With the recent improvements and increase of popularity in projects like OpenClaw, the number of users that are generating loss has probably massively increased.

API limits are infinite but you'd blow through $20 of usage in a maybe 1 hours or less of intense Opus use.The subscription at $20/mo (or $200) allows for vastly more queries than $20 would buy you via API but you are constrained by hourly/weekly limits.The $20/mo sub user will take a lot longer to complete a high token count task (due to start/stop) BUT they will cap their costs.

Banning third-party tools has nothing to do with rate limits. They're trying to position themselves as the Apple of AI companies -a walled garden.

Even Kimi K2.5 is a very capable model I find on par with Sonnet at least, very close to Opus. Forcing people to use ONLY a broken Claude Code UX with a subscription only ensures they loose advantage they had.

Google AI Pro is like $15/month for practically unlimited Pro requests, each of which take million tokens of context (and then also perform thinking, free Google search for grounding, inline image generation if needed). This includes Gemini CLI, Gemini Code Assist (VS Code), the main chatbot, and a bunch of other vibe-coding projects which have their own rate limits or no rate limits at all.It's crazy to think this is sustainable. It'll be like Xbox Game Pass - start at £5/month to hook people in and before you know it it's £20/month and has nowhere near as many games.

Google has made custom AI chips for 11 years — since 2015 — and inference costs them 2-5x less than it does for every other competitor.The landmark paper that invented the techniques behind ChatGPT, Claude and modern AI was also published by Google scientists 9 years ago.That's probably how they can afford it.

Google already has a huge competitive advantage because they have more data than anyone else, bundle Gemini in each android to siphon even more data, and the android platform. The TPUs truly make me believe there actually could be a sort of monopoly on LLMs in the end, even though there are so many good models with open weights, so little (technical) reasons to create software that only integrates with Gemini, etc.Google will have a lion‘s share of inferring I believe.

My point was simpler: they're almost certainly not losing money on subscriptions because of inference. Inference is relatively cheap. And of course the big cost is training and ongoing R&D.The real issue is the market they're in. They're competing with companies like Kimi and DeepSeek that also spend heavily on R&D but release strong models openly. That means anyone can run inference and customers can use it without paying for bundled research costs.Training frontier models takes months, costs billions, and the model is outdated in six months. I just don't see how a closed, subscription-only model reliably covers that in the long run, especially if you're tightening ecosystem access at the same time.

It's also false that the technology has changed very little.The jumps from bronze to iron to steel to modern steel and sometimes to stainless steel all result in vastly different products. Not to mention the advances in composite materials for handles.Then you need to look at substitute goods and the what people actually used knives for.A huge amount of the demand for knives evaporated thanks to societal changes and substitute goods like forks.

I only use LLMs through OpenRouter and switch somewhat randomly between frontier models; they each have some amount of personality but I wouldn't mind much if half of them disappeared overnight, as long as the other half remained available.

With the AI models, using a model that is “good enough but cheaper” is already an option.

I imagine the split will look a lot like b2b vs b2c in other technologies, b2b customers tend to be willing to pay for tech when it offers a competitive advantage, reduces their operating costs etc. b2c customers mostly just guzzle free slop.

A model is hard to train but it doesn't need to be hyper up to date / have a new version come out every day. Inference is cheap (it seems?) and quality is comparable. So it's unclear how expensive offerings could win over free alternatives.I could be wrong of course. I don't have a crystal ball. I just don't think this is the same as Google.Of course I could be entirely mistaken and there could emerge a single winner

Software always gets monopoly simply by usage. Every time a model gets used by esoteric use cases, it gets more training data (that a decentralized open weight model doesn't get) and it starts developing its moat.

They bundled it with PC hw and the vast majority of apps only ever got published for windows, and this over decades (one would argue it's still true).The starting point for LLMs is very different. Who would publish today a software that only integrates with chatGPT? Only a small minority.Thus I agree, I struggle to see how a monopoly can exist here. A GPU monopoly or duopoly though, perhaps.

First of all, custom harness parallel agent people are so far from the norm, and certainly not on the $20 plan, which doesn't even make sense because you'd hit token limit in about 90 seconds.Second, token limits. Does Anthropic secretly have over-subscription issues? Don't know, don't care. If I'm paying a blistering monthly fee, I should be able to use up to the limit.Now I know you've got a clear view of the typical user, but FWIW, I'm just an aging hacker using CC to build some personal projects (feeling modern ofc) but still driving, no yolo or gas town style. I've reached the point where I have a nice workflow, and CC is pretty decent, but it feels like it's putting on weight and adding things I don't want or need.I think LLMs are an exciting new interface to computers, but I don't want to be tied to someone else's idea of a client, especially not one that's changing so rapidly. I'd like to roll my own client to interface with the model, or maybe try out some other alternatives, but that's against the TOS, because: reasons.And no, I'm not interested in paying metered corporate rates for API access. I pay for a Max account, it's expensive, but predictable.The issue is Anthropic is trying for force users into using their tool, but that's not going to work for something so generic as interfacing with an LLM. Some folks want emacs while others want vim, and there will never be a consensus on the best editor (it's nvim btw), because developers are opinionated and have strong preferences for how they interface with computers. I switched to CC maybe a year ago and haven't looked back, but this is a major disappointment. I don't give a shit about Anthropic's credit liability, I just want the freedom to hack on my own client.

Anthropic sells two products: a consumer subscription with a UI, and an API with metered pricing. You want the API product at the subscription price. That's not a principled stance about interface freedom, it's just wanting something for less than it costs.The nvim analogy doesn't land either. Nobody's stopping you from writing your own client. You just have to pay API rates for it, because that's the product that matches what you're describing. The subscription subsidises the cost per token by constraining how you use it. Remove the constraint, the economics break. This isn't complicated.""I don't give a shit about Anthropic's credit liability,"" right, but they do, because it's their business. You're not entitled to a flat-rate all-you-can-eat API just because you find metered pricing aesthetically displeasing.

I'm not trying to arbitrage or route around anything, I just want predictable billing to access the model. Maybe the API would be cheaper for me, I don't know. I'm just a normal user, not scheduling an agent army to blast at maximum 24/7.You don't need to explain what Anthropic is selling, I get it, but you're off-base claiming that I'm pretending about editor philosophy as cope. I think Anthropic is where they are today because they have a good model for coding, made popular by software folks who value things like editor choice and customization. Anthropic is free to do as they wish of course, as am I, but I'm displeased with their decision here, and voicing my opinion about it.If usage is truly constrained by the client not the server, I guess I can't argue that, but it still feels bad as an end user. As a consumer, I just want a fair deal and freedom to use what I purchase however I see fit. But that seems harder to find these days, and most businesses seem intent on maximum extraction by any means possible. I might be wrong, but this feels like business move to build a consumer moat by controlling the interface, because consumers don't want the API. It's not in my best interests, which alienates me as a customer.

reply

The issue is not that it's limited or unlimited, but rather about expected token usage across a user cohort. When you set a usage limit on something like Claude, or a gym, or a tutoring center, you need to do two things at once; set the limit high enough to attract the aspirations of your intended client base (""oh good this gym lets me go every day of the month if I want to""), but priced accurately enough so that you actually turn a profit on the average usage across most users (you ended up going 20 times the first month, but settled into 15 times a month after).If there was suddenly a drug that you could take that would, while you slept, make your body walk to the gym and workout, so that you could max out that usage, the gym would be entitled to adjust either the pricing, the limit, or prohibit going to the gym while on the drug, given that they can't actually sustain all their members going every day.As a correction, I've done some reading and when I said tragedy of the commons, what would fit better is a ""congestion externality in a  club good"".

reply

But 'you can't park even though the ticket includes parking' is not an appropriate analogy because 3rd party use is definitely not intended.

This is exactly what my analogy was structured to explain; a Disneyland season pass isn't intended to be used solely for parking.

I think what they want to achieve here is less ""kill openclaw"" or similar and more ""keep our losses under control in general"". And now they have a clear criteria to refer when they take action and a good bisection on whom to act on.In case your usage is high they would block / take action. Because if you have your max subscription and not really losing them money, why should they push you (the monopoly incentive sounds wrong with the current market).

From a backend perspective, the subscription model creates perverse incentives. Heavy users (like developers running agentic workflows) consume far more compute than casual users, but pay the same price. Third-party tools amplify this asymmetry.Anthropic's move is economically rational but strategically risky. Models are increasingly fungible - Gemini 3.1 and Claude 4.5 produce similar results for most tasks. The lock-in isn't the model; it's the tooling ecosystem.By forcing users onto Claude Code exclusively, they're betting their tooling moat is stronger than competitor models. Given how quickly open-source harnesses like pi have caught up, that's a bold bet.

Also, can you not setup a proxy for the cert and a packet sniffer to watch whatever ClaudeCode is doing with respect to API access? To me, if you have ""secret sauce"" you have to keep it server side and make the client as dumb as possible. Especially if your client is executes as Javascript.

This could be used to adhere to Claude's TOS while still allowing the user to switch AI companies at a moment's notice.Right now there's limited customizability in this approach, but I think it's not far-fetched to see FAR more integrated solutions in the future if the lock-in trend continues. For example: one MCP that you can configure into a coding agent like Claude Code that overrides its entire behavior (tools, skills, etc.) to a different unified open-source system. Think something similar to the existing IntelliJ IDEA's MCP that gives a separate file edit tool, etc. than the one the agent comes with.Illustration of what i'm talking about:- You install Claude Code with no configuration- Then you install the meta-agent framework- With one command the meta-agent MCP is installed in Claude Code, built-in tools are disabled via permissions override- You access the meta-agent through a different UI (similar to vibe-kanban's web UI)- Everything you do gets routed directly to Claude Code, using your Claude subscription legally. (Input-level features like commands get resolved by meta-agent UI before being sent to claude code)- Claude Code must use the tools and skills directly from meta-agent MCP as instructed in the prompt, and because its own tools are permission denied (result: very good UI integration with the meta-agent UI)- This would also work with any other CLI coding agent (Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI etc.) should they start getting ideas of locking users in- If Claude Code rug-pulls subscription quotas, just switch to a competitor instantlyAll it requires is a CLI coding agent with MCP support, and the TOS allowing automatic use of its UI (disallowing that would be massive hypocrisy as the AI companies themselves make computer use agents that allow automatic use of other apps' UI)

They are literally alienating a large percentage of OpenClaw, NanoClaw, PicoClaw, customers because those customers will surely not be willing to pay API pricing, which is at least 6-10x Max Plan pricing (for my usage).This isn't too surprising to me since they probably have a direct competitor to openclaw et al in the works right now, but until then I am cancelling my subscription and porting my nanoclaw fork with mem0 integration to work with OpenAI instead.Thats not a “That'll teach ‘em” statement, it is just my own cost optimization. I am quite fond of Anthropic's coding models and might still subscribe again at the $20 level, but they just priced me out for personal assistant, research, and 90% of my token use case.

Many ways, and they're under no obligation to play fair and tell you which way they're using at any given time. They've said what the rules are, they've said they'll ban you if they catch you.So let's say they enforce it by adding an extra nonstandard challenge-response handshake at the beginning of the exchange, which generates a token which they'll expect on all requests going forward. You decompile the minified JS code, figure out the protocol, try it from your own code but accidentally mess up a small detail (you didn't realize the nonce has a special suffix). Detected. Banned.You'll need a new credit card to open a new account and try again. Better get the protocol right on the first try this time, because debugging is going to get expensive.Let's say you get frustrated and post on Twitter about what you know so far. If you share info, they'll probably see it eventually and change their method. They'll probably change it once a month anyway and see who they catch that way (and presumably add a minimum Claude Code version needed to reach their servers).They've got hundreds of super smart coders and one of the most powerful AI models, they can do this all day.

There are lots of ways they could be doing this. And remember again, if they get you, they don't have to tell you how they got you (so you might not be able to even glean information in return for the $200 you'd be losing).Sure the internet has hundreds of thousands of super smart coders, but the subset who are willing to throw money and credit cards down the drain in order to maintain a circumvention strategy for something like this is pretty low. I'm sure a few people will figure it out, but they won't want to tell anyone lest Anthropic nerf their workaround, so I doubt that exploits of this will become widespread.And if you're Anthropic, that's probably good enough.

The feature allows the LLM to edit the context. For example, you can ""compact"" just portions of the conversation and replace it with a summary. Anthropic can see that the conversation suddenly doesn't share the same history as previous API calls.In fact, I ported the feature to Claude Code using tweakcc, so it literally _is_ Claude Code. After a couple days they started blocking that with the same message that they send when they block third party tools.

This is the VC funded startup playbook. It has been repeated many times, but maybe for the younger crowd it is new. Start a new service that is relatively permissive, then gradually restrict APIs and permissions. Finally, start throwing in ads and/or making it more expensive to use. Part of the reason is in the beginning they are trying to get as many users as possible and burning VC money. Then once the honey moon is over, they need to make a profit so they cut back on services, nerf stuff, increase prices and start adding ads.

It suggests to me Anthropic is less concerned with the financial impact of letting subscribers use alternative tools and more concerned with creating lock in to their products and subscriptions. It very well might backfire though, I was not considering alternative models yesterday, but today I am actively exploring other options and considering cancelling my sub. I've been using my subscription primarily through pi recently, so if they aren't interested in me as a customer, pretty much everyone else is.

Regarding consumer freedom, I believe software running on user machines should serve the interests of the user, not the company who wrote the software or anyone else for that matter. Trying to force users to run a particular client written by your company violates this principle.Regarding competition, forcing users to run a particular client is a form of anti competitive bundling, a naked attempt to prevent alternative clients from being able to enter the market unless they are able to build a competing backed as well. Such artificial ""moats"" are great for companies but harmful to consumers.

There is barely any magic in the harness, the magic is in the model.Try it: write your own harness with (bash, read, write, edit) ... it's trivial to get a 99% version of (pick your favorite harness) -- minus the bells and whistles.The ""magic of the harness"" comes from the fun auxiliary orchestration stuff - hard engineering for sure! - but seriously, the model is the key item.

It turns out that ""most of the bell and whistles"" could amount to instructing models how to use tools like tmux

So, which two parties could they be referring to? The Republicans and the Freedom Caucus?

All that to say, don't let the naysayers get you down. I bought my Mac Mini last week and have been really happy with it as an isolated environment. Way better than futzing around with VMs. The always-on nature of OpenClaw means that it's nice to be able to restart my personal laptop or do gaming or whatever else I want and I'm not fighting for GPU resources in the background.

For instance, the other day, the Siri button in maps told me it couldn't start navigation because it didn't know where it was.  It was animating a blue dot with my real time position at the same time.Don't get me started about the new iOS 26 notification and messaging filters.  Those are causing real harm multiple times a day.

The markets value recurring subscription revenue at something like 10x “one-off” revenue, Anthropic is leaving a lot of enterprise value on the table with this approach.In practice this approach forces AI apps to pay Anthropic for tokens, and then bill their customers a subscription. Customers could bring their own API key but it's sketchy to put that into every app you want to try, and consumers aren't going to use developer tools. And many categories of free app are simply excluded, which could in aggregate drive a lot more demand for subscriptions.If Anthropic is worried about quota, seems they could set lower caps for third-party subscription usage? Still better than forcing API keys.(Maybe this is purely about displacing other IDE products, rather than a broader market play.)

Allows them to optimize their clients and use private APIs for exclusive features etc. and there's really no reason to bootstrap other wannabe AI companies who just stick a facade experience in front of Anthropic's paying customer.

Look at your token usage of the last 30 days in one of the JSON files generated by Claude Code. Compare that against API costs for Opus. Tell me if they are eating losses or not. I'm not making a point, actually do it and let me know. I was at 1 million. I'm paying 90 EUR/m. That means I'm subsidizing them (paying 3-4 times what it would cost with the API)! And I feel like I'm a pretty heavy user. Although people running it in a loop or using Gas Town will be using much more.

Over 9 days I would have spent roughly $63 dollars on Codex with 11.5M input tokens plus 141M cached input tokens and 1.3M output tokens.That roughly mirrors the $100-200/wk in API spending that drove me to the subscription.  | Category | Tokens | Rate (/1M) | Estimated Cost |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | Input (uncached) | 11,568,331 | $1.75 | $20.24 |
  | Cached input | 141,566,720 | $0.175 | $24.77 |
  | Output | 1,301,078 | $14.00 | $18.22 |
  | Total | 154,436,129 | — | $63.23 |


BUT... like a typical gym user. This is a 30/d window and I only used it for 9 days, $63 worth. OpenAI kept the other $137.It makes sense though for heavy use.

DeepSeek has the tendency to think... a lot!. Without a good harness I can't evaluate it well; time will tell.OpenAI doesn't; it's embedded into the price, I think.Cheap = we can run 10x the workloads, bigger imagination = innovation. Maybe 10 dumb agents in a loop can beat 1 Opus? Haha.

I don't think Anthropic has any desire to be some B2C platform, they want high paying reliable customers (B2B, Enterprise).

reply

Cloud goes on the books as recurring revenue, not one-off; even though it's in principle elastic, in practice if I pay for a VM today I'll usually pay for one tomorrow.(I don't have the numbers but the vast majority of cloud revenue is also going to be pre-committed long-term contracts from enterprises.)> I don't think Anthropic has any desire to be some B2C platformThis is the best line of argument I can see. But still not clear to me why my OP doesn't apply for enterprise, too.Maybe the play is just to force other companies to become MCPs, instead of enabling them to have a direct customer relationship.

Essentially, I wanted HN to feel like a first-class citizen on macOS, not a website I visit.What it does:- Split-view layout — stories in a sidebar on the left, articles and comments on the right, using the standard macOS NavigationSplitView pattern.- Built-in ad blocking — a precompiled WKContentRuleList blocks 14 major ad networks (DoubleClick, Google Syndication, Criteo, Taboola, Outbrain, Amazon ads, etc.) right in the WebKit layer. No extensions needed. Toggleable in settings.- Pop-up blocking — kills window.open() calls. Also toggleable.- HN account login — full authentication flow (login, account creation, password reset). Session is stored in the macOS Keychain, and cookies are injected into the WebView so you can upvote, comment, and submit stories while staying logged in.- Bookmarks — save stories locally for offline access. Persisted with Codable serialization, searchable and filterable independently.- Search and filtering — powered by the Algolia HN API. Filter by content type (All, Ask, Show, Jobs, Comments), date range (Today, Past Week, Past Month, All Time), and sort by hot or recent.- Scroll progress indicator — a small orange bar at the top tracks your reading progress via JavaScript-to-native messaging.- Auto-updates via Sparkle with EdDSA-signed updates served from GitHub Pages.- Dark mode — respects system appearance with CSS and meta tag injection.Tech details for the curious:The whole app is ~2,050 lines of Swift across 16 files. It uses the modern @Observable macro (not the old ObservableObject/Published pattern), structured concurrency with async/await and withThrowingTaskGroup for concurrent batch fetching, and SwiftUI throughout — no UIKit/AppKit bridges except for the WKWebView wrapper via NSViewRepresentable.Two APIs power the data: the official HN Firebase API for individual item/user fetches, and the Algolia Search API for feeds, filtering, and search. The Algolia API is surprisingly powerful for this — it lets you do date-range filtering, pagination, and full-text search that the Firebase API doesn't support.CI/CD:The release pipeline is a single GitHub Actions workflow (467 lines) that handles the full macOS distribution story: build and archive, code sign with Developer ID, notarize with Apple (with a 5-retry staple loop for ticket propagation delays), create a custom DMG with AppleScript-driven icon positioning, sign and notarize the DMG, generate an EdDSA Sparkle signature, create a GitHub Release, and deploy an updated appcast.xml to GitHub Pages.Getting macOS code signing and notarization working in CI was honestly the hardest part of this project.

I'm probably just a anti-app guy, but I tried it out.First thing I went to do was CMD-F to search for some strings in the comments section.Actually, the real first thing I did, was click on the left-side article preview  on the text that said ""1 hr ago | 63 comments"" thinking it'd navigate me to the comments.  See, I like my native hyper-links.

Am I missing some core concept here?  Why would I want to browse the web in this app as opposed to a web browser?

reply

I like native apps for things, even link aggregators, because my I want to use my OS's native window management and app management instead of just shoving everything into a browser tab, of which I already have too many. Because then it's just CMD+Tab to Chrome, and then figure out which of the 20+ tabs I'm trying to get to instead of CMD+Tab directly to that specific app.Anyway, just a bit of old man yelling at cloud but I've always disliked the proliferation of ""web app all the things."" Might as well not even use a desktop OS at this point and just have a full screen browser window and call it a day.

It's just nice to have HN as it's own app instead of just another tab in a single app. Same reason I use mail.app vs. webmail, native music app vs the web player, etc.PWAs also solve the problem, more or less, but it is nice to have something native.

First feature request from me would be to adjust text size. I've start bumping up the default text size on all sites by one or two notches in the past year. Getting old, y'know. But also, as someone pointed out on a design blogpost a decade ago, why not make things easier to read. I didnt need it then, but I appreciate it now.Really happy that I can run this on MacOS14 cause I've been locked out of some neat things people have built recently. Thanks for targetting older OSes. I'm not upgrading to the crap they've been putting out lately.I'll be able to read details more later (getting ready for the job). Hope I didn't miss anything and comment about something that was already addressed. Congrats on shipping!

This is a good start, but I think a better approach would be to piggyback off of ublock origin's lists. Hopefully less maintenance that way too.

reply

That won't work. uBlock origin is licensed GPLv3 (https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), this code is MIT licensed (https://github.com/IronsideXXVI/Hacker-News).

reply

@IronsideXXVI, are you open to changing to gpl v3? Otherwise, there is probably a decent set of filter lists with an MIT license somewhere. The goal is for you to NOT become a filter list maintainer, and by piggybacking off an already respected set of lists, you'd build user trust in your adblocking.

I don't necessarily have a ready solution to offer, but these are the obstacles preventing someone like me from being able to use apps like this comfortably and safely, especially knowing we are entering a transitional period where new apps are being vibe-coded every day and formal verification has not yet caught up.Even if a given app has had every line of code reviewed by a human, or has well-defined interfaces that allow for sloppier internal code, how do I know that without cracking it open myself or asking an agent to help me audit it?

One thing: I really like the colors of Hacker News. It feels weird to me when Hacker News is presented in other colors.

The best you could do is perhaps model the additional per household cost (which has been done) and issue them checks from the Treasury (stimulus check style), but who is going to pay for it? The taxpayer! There is no way to incur this economic cost on the people who incurred the harm (this administration). You could potentially get the funds back from companies through higher corp taxes.

One that goes through all three branches of government, the way it's been since we decided ""no taxation without representation"" is how such things should be collectively implemented.If a citizen's stance is there is no such thing as a legitimate tax, perhaps there should be a legal process for banishing them from all public services, including roads, electricity, telephone, fire and rescue services, etc. and make consuming them a crime. But I guess even that would be a problem because we need to pay for the justice system that would prosecute such a sovereign citizen that breaks the rules...Basically an ""opt-out"" of modern life almost in its entirety. I think most people that subscribe to ""no legitimate taxes"" might be surprised how isolating that would be if they actually think it through.To be clear, I don't think this is a good idea, it's simply a thought exercise.

No, but you are arguing in a very annoying style.Nobody is claiming it's good or okay that this is happening. What people are discussing is whether it's likely that Trump will order people to ignore the court in this case. This is just a question of predicting probabilities, not morality.And, indeed, the administration has been dropping the ball on following rulings in low-level deportation cases, but hasn't really ignored, or ordered people to ignore, major big-ticket Supreme Court cases. You can't really use one as evidence for the other. This is what people were pointing out to you.But you took them pointing out this factual distinction as somehow defending Trump, which it is not.Imagine you said of a known thief: ""that guy will surely murder someone, look at his long criminal record!"" and someone responded ""but all his crimes are petty theft, none involve violence"". It'd be illogical for you to then get indignant that the other person was defending theft or claiming it's not bad.

In 1909, the US president made 75k - roughly 2.76 Million in today's dollars. This is in comparison to the current 400k dollar salary of the president. As the president is the highest paid government employee by law/custom - this applies downward pressure on the rest of the governments payroll.I see no reason why the president shouldn't be modestly wealthy given the requirements or the role and the skill required to do it well. Cutting the payscale to less than some new grads seems like a recipe for corruption.

But, sometimes a groundswell movement really can build momentum and drive the conversation regardless of what the leaders think about it. Write to your state & national representatives demanding that they publicly support prosecution for the incredible crimes we're seeing committed by this admin. Try to make it a policy platform for your state party. Maybe we can build enough support from the bottom up to get popular momentum behind it. Holding criminals accountable for their crimes is not really a controversial position, we have to demand that they actually do it.

It would need to come with a commitment to a package of difficult to undo (i.e. amendments) reforms. SCOTUS term limits, preventing the Senate from refusing to even consider nominees, bans on justices receiving gifts (https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-un...), revocation of Presidential immunity, etc. You pack the court with an explicit promise to largely return to the old status quo when it's fixed.

reply

On top of that, Clarence Thomas is the oldest person on the court and Alito is only two years younger. By the end of the next Presidential term they'll both be in their 80s. You don't have to pack the court, you just have to be in office for the term or two after this one.

That is not how the Supreme Court works. SCOTUS is a political body. Justices do one thing: cast votes.

That makes zero sense. You mean “by lowering the profit margin on the goods sold to the US by that specific company”.Countries don't pay tarrifs (bar state intervention), companies do.But yes, it's probably a mix of the two: raising prices and lowering profit margins.

The businesses in the other countries are, you know, businesses.  Even if it were Chinese companies that were paying the tariffs, that will be baked into the cost of the good.This is literally first-day economics. No such thing as a free lunch.

If there are suspicions that the tariffs are temporary then they might be willing to eat the cost temporarily so it's not passed onto the consumer immediately, but that's inherently temporary and not sustainable especially if it would make it so these companies are losing money.

  A tariff or import tax is a duty imposed by a national government, customs territory, or supranational union on imports of goods and is paid by the importer. Exceptionally, an export tax may be levied on exports of goods or raw materials and is paid by the exporter.

If an analysis says that ""domestic consumers are paying 90%"" of a tariff then they are simplifying the process that others are describing here as ""baked into the cost"" and I would say, more accurately, ""the cost of tariffs are recouped from consumers/businesses by those who paid them (the importer)""  The economic burden of tariffs falls on the importer, the exporter, and the consumer. [Wikipedia]

If economists are saying ""consumers pay tariffs"" then I would expect to see a notation on the price tags and a line-item on my receipts, but the cost of the tariff must be paid by the importer, or there won't be a consumer who can purchase the goods, let alone bear the costs of their tariffs.

Eh, standard business school logic these days is that if you want to maximize profits, you should charge what the market will bear, not your costs + some fixed profit.So if you're already charging what the market will bear, there may be more wiggle room to absorb some of the hit of tariffs, so long as it still leaves you making enough profit or in a favorable position. It still comes down to what maximizes tariffs: at higher prices, demand drops, but at lower prices, your profit/item drops.Still, yeah, from what I understand, the bulk of the tariff costs were passed along to customers.

As far as I can tell the US system is designed for gridlock.  Things like filibuster, lower house elections every two years, state elected upper body, electorate system are all designed to create girdlock.While Americans as a whole are to blame for some of this they are working in a completely broken system.  In tech we try not to blame a person when something goes wrong so we look at what process allowed this to happen.  I think many of the US problems are explained by their underlying system which is basically a copy of the English one at the time of Independence with a monarch and a parliament.  Unlike the English system though it barely evolved since then.

At the federal level the US system was designed for gridlock on purpose, with the premise that something shouldn't be federal policy without widespread consensus, and without that consensus it should be left to the states.The problem is really that many of the gridlock-inducing measures have been thwarted, e.g. delegation of rulemaking power from Congress to the executive and direct election of Senators to prevent state-representing Senators from voting down federal overreach. But those things weren't just there to induce gridlock, they were also the accountability measures, so without them you put corruption on rails and here we are.

The Senate was originally selected by the state govts, not direct election... the Vice President was originally the runner-up, not a paired ticket and generally hamstrung as a result.  The VP didn't originally participate in the Senate either, that came after WWII.The good part about the constitution is there is a reasonable set of ground rules for changing said constitution with a minimum that should clearly represent the will of the majority of the population.  (corrupt politicians not-withstanding)

The reasonable set of ground rules seem to favor states over the will of the majority of the population.  It is possible to change the constitution with states representing only 25% of the population.  And remember you'd only need a majority in each of those states so could be way less of the population.Overall the system seems flawed in that instead of having clearly delegated areas of responsibility to states and then doing the federal system as based on the population of the whole country it muddled areas and then made a federal system that couldn't respond to the population.

This was still a huge issue in 1848 when a lot of Europe was grappling with how to do a constitution.So it stayed broken and here we are.

If the majority of American voters elect snoopy the dog snoopy can do all of the things snoopy wants to do within the bounds of the law.  Snoopy can use his bully pulpit to fight against dog restrictions in restaurants and grant pardons to previous offenders.  Snoopy can ensure efficient spending of money on public water fountains accessible to canines... but if snoopy starts issuing open hand-outs to the red baron (snoopy in a moustache) that's when the other branches of government are supposed to step in - we aren't supposed to need to wait four years for the next election to stop open corruption (especially since corruption is really good at funding more corruption so there's a vicious cycle that can begin if you let it fester @see the recent FBI raid on GA election offices).

I think it's extremely clear 3 was the best choice, but it was the least popular of the three.

I don't know about trust but the constitution isn't what enabled this type of behavior, it's the legislature. They've been abdicating their duties to executive controlled bodies (FCC, FDA, FTC, EPA, etc.) and allowing the president to rule through executive action unchallenged. They could have stopped these tariffs on day one. SCOTUS isn't supposed to be reactionary, congress is.The constitution has all the mechanisms in place to control the president, they just aren't being used by the legislature.It's a tricky problem that has a number of proposed solutions. I'm not going to act like it's a silver bullet but I think open primaries in federal elections would go a _long_ way towards normalizing (in the scientific meaning) the legislature and allowing people who want to do the job, rather than grandstand,  into the offices.

Even if part of the tariffs are rolled back, we may see other ones remain. And I bet they will not make it easy for people to get their money back, and force them into courts. Not that it matters. If people get their money back, it will effectively increase the national debt which hurts citizens anyways.And let's not forget the long-term damage of hurting all of the relationships America had with other countries. If Trump wanted to use tariffs as a tool for emergency purposes, he should have just taken action against China and made a case around that (pointing to Taiwan, IP theft, cyber attacks, etc). Instead he implemented blanket tariffs on the whole world, including close allies like Canada.In the end, my guess is China and India gained from this saga. And the Trump administration's family and friends gained by trading ahead of every tariff announcement. Americans lost.

This is kind of a bizarre whataboutism to throw in there. The current administration (with the full support of Congressional majorities in both houses that have largely abdicated any pretense of having their own policy goals) has been flouting constitutional norms pretty much nonstop for a year now and literally ignoring court orders in a way that probably no administration has ever done before, and yet the playbook they're following for extrajudicial activity apparently is from the Democrats? Just because there's bad behavior on both sides doesn't mean that the magnitude of it is equal, and in terms of respect for the rule of law the behavior of the current administration really has no comparison.

That's correct, the laws exist but it's up to the executive to enforce them. The US has not meaningfully enforced any anti-trust laws since the Microsoft web browser bundling case in the 90s.  There was a brief glimmer of anti-trust being resuscitated by FTC during the Biden admin, but the tech company monopolies got so spooked by that that they brought all their resources to bear in 2024 to ensure their guy won, and he did. Anti-trust remains dead in the US for at least another generation.

By the neo-royalist [1]interpretation of the current administrations policies, many countries have either decided to pay for the royalty fee to get tariff exemption in a way aristocats in pre-Westphalian Europe dealed with each other.

That said, I'm still a proponent of having the bulk of the federal budget based on tariffs and excise taxes.  I don't like income and property taxes in general.  I'd be less opposed to income taxes if there was truly a way to fairly leverage them, there simply isn't.  VAT is at least more fair IMO.  I also wouldn't mind a tax as part of leveraged asset loans (including cars/homes) with maybe a single exclusion for a primary residence and vehicle under a given price.

We should curtail a lot of the limitations granted and actually hold executives responsible for their decisions.

A corporation is not a person, that a corporation exists is fine, that they've been shielded from responsibility altogether in that limited liability now means you can literally destroy towns and executives and boards face no consequences is deplorable.Governments should be limited, by extension the shields govt grants to corporations should similarly be limited.

But no. The court pretty much says the president decides what's an emergency, leading us to having 51 active emergencies [0], with one starting back in 1979 (in response to the Iran hostage crisis) and with Trump leading the pack with 11 of such declarations. Congress didn't say ""the president can just decide and that's it"", but that's what's happening because of the SC's deferential posture.Deferring so much to the political sphere (which is the reason behind this posture) is leading to a much less stable and more ""swing-y"" country.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_i...

Even if you're still making the same money per unit, tarriffs mean you sell fewer units. So many less that it's an existential threat to many businesses.

Kavanaugh's dissent is particularly peculiar as he wrote 'refunding tariffs already collected could be a “mess” with “significant consequences for the U.S. Treasury.”'So, the justification is that undoing an illegal act is going to be unwieldy for the govt, so presumably, as a corollary, the govt must be allowed to continue doing illegal acts. This honestly reads as a blanket support for Trump personally, than any reasoned legal argument.

As carbon emissions push Earth's temperature higher and higher, Antarctica is taking the brunt of the impact. This frozen continent is warming nearly twice as fast as the rest of the world, threatening its ecosystems, driving sea level rise, and destabilizing global food chains.

Humanity's choices over the next decade will determine Antarctica's fate, according to a study published Friday in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Science. The researchers, led by Newcastle University glaciology professor Bethan Davies, modeled the best- and worst-case scenarios for the Antarctic Peninsula, the warmest part of the continent. To avoid the worst outcomes, the world needs to advance toward net-zero emissions as quickly as possible.

“It is definitely possible—we can definitely do this,” Davies told Gizmodo. “It means thinking logically about how we power our countries, how we heat our homes, [making] policy decisions about how we live our lifestyles. All of this is manageable and is doable.”

For their study, Davies and her colleagues analyzed CMIP6 climate data. CMIP6 is a coordinated set of standardized simulations from dozens of climate models that allows scientists to predict how Earth's systems will respond to different rates of greenhouse gas emissions while minimizing uncertainty.

The study considers three different scenarios: low emissions, medium-high emissions, and very high emissions. The low-emissions (or best-case) scenario would result in no more than 3.24 degrees Fahrenheit (1.8 degrees Celsius) of global warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100.

This future would spare the Antarctic Peninsula from the worst environmental damage and avoid the most severe global consequences of that damage. Winter sea ice extent would only be slightly less than it is today, and the Peninsula's contributions to sea level rise would amount to just a few millimeters. Glaciers and their supporting ice shelves would remain largely intact.

Unfortunately, that's not the path humanity is currently on. The world is on track for a medium- to medium-high emissions future, in which the global average temperature rises 6.5 degrees F (3.6 degrees C) above pre-industrial levels by 2100.

Under that scenario, temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula would be 6.12 degrees F (3.4 degrees C) warmer than they are today. There would be roughly 19 more days above 32 degrees F (0 degrees C) per year, and more precipitation would fall as rain than snow.

Increased ocean temperatures and upwelling would also accelerate glacial retreat. The Peninsula would also experience more extreme weather events, and native species—such as the Adélie penguin—would be displaced by inhospitable climate conditions.

“The Adélie penguin is a hardy little animal, but it can't tolerate its chicks getting wet,” Davies explained. “What happens when we get rain on the Antarctic Peninsula is you can lose the whole breeding colony—you can lose all the chicks.” She said researchers are already seeing the Peninsula's Adélie population contract as other penguin species move in.

Then there's the very high emissions scenario, in which the global average temperature rises nearly 8 degrees F (4.4 degrees C) above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This would be catastrophic for the Antarctic Peninsula, triggering ice shelf collapse, major sea ice loss, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, and dramatic declines in native species.

The damage would be irreversible, Davies said. While the world isn't currently headed toward that worst-case scenario, it describes what could happen if humanity overshoots emissions targets and fails to curb emissions in the coming decades.

“The risk of that is that even if we then bury all the carbon in the ground and come up with a magic technology to do that, we've already crossed key tipping points on the Antarctic ice sheet, as well as other tipping points globally,” Davies said.

To researchers like Davies who conduct fieldwork on the Antarctic Peninsula, the impact of global warming is already starkly apparent. She has seen ice shelves smattered with meltwater puddles and rainstorms even during the dark winter months. In some cases, researchers have had to abandon field sites because melting has made them too dangerous to access, she said.

“We can think of the Antarctic Peninsula, specifically, as that canary in the coal mine,” Davies said. “It's the warmest part of Antarctica [and] the place where you're seeing the changes happen first.” What happens there will trigger changes across the rest of the continent and the world, she added.

The key takeaway from her team's findings is that it's not too late to change course. If the world acts quickly to curb carbon emissions, Antarctica's future could look very different from the most likely scenario outlined in this study. Humanity's choices over the next decade will be critical to stabilizing this vital region.

In the last year, AI agents have become all the rage. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic all launched public-facing agents designed to take on multi-step tasks handed to them by humans. In the last month, an open-source AI agent called OpenClaw took the web by storm thanks to its impressive autonomous capabilities (and major security concerns). But we don't really have a sense of the scale of AI agent operations, and whether all the talk is matched by actual deployment. The MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) set out to fix that with its recently published 2025 AI Agent Index, which provides our first real look at the scale and operations of AI agents in the wild.

Researchers found that interest in AI agents has undoubtedly skyrocketed in the last year or so. Research papers mentioning “AI Agent” or “Agentic AI” in 2025 more than doubled the total from 2020 to 2024 combined, and a McKinsey survey found that 62% of companies reported that their organizations were at least experimenting with AI agents.

With all that interest, the researchers focused on 30 prominent AI agents across three separate categories: chat-based options like ChatGPT Agent and Claude Code; browser-based bots like Perplexity Comet and ChatGPT Atlas; and enterprise options like Microsoft 365 Copilot and ServiceNow Agent. While the researchers didn't provide exact figures on just how many AI agents are deployed across the web, they did offer a considerable amount of insight into how they are operating, which is largely without a safety net.

Just half of the 30 AI agents that got put under the magnifying glass by MIT CSAIL include published safety or trust frameworks, like Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy, OpenAI's Preparedness Framework, or Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. One in three agents has no safety framework documentation whatsoever, and five out of 30 have no compliance standards. That is troubling when you consider that 13 of 30 systems reviewed exhibit frontier levels of agency, meaning they can operate largely without human oversight across extended task sequences. Browser agents in particular tend to operate with significantly higher autonomy. This would include things like Google's recently launched AI “Autobrowse,” which can complete multi-step tasks by navigating different websites and making use of user information to do things like log into sites on your behalf.

One of the troubles with letting agents browse freely and with few guardrails is that their activity is nearly indistinguishable from human behavior, and they do little to dispel any confusion that might occur. The researchers found that 21 out of the 30 agents provide no disclosure to end users or third parties that they are AI agents and not human users. This results in most AI agent activity being mistaken for human traffic. MIT found that just seven agents published stable User-Agent (UA) strings and IP address ranges for verification. Nearly as many explicitly use Chrome-like UA strings and residential/local IP contexts to make their traffic requests appear more human, making it next to impossible for a website to distinguish between authentic traffic and bot behavior.

For some AI agents, that's actually a marketable feature. The researchers found that BrowserUse, an open-source AI agent, sells itself to users by claiming to bypass anti-bot systems to browse “like a human.” More than half of all the bots tested provide no specific documentation about how they handle robots.txt files (text files that are placed in a website's root directory to instruct web crawlers on how they can interact with the site), CAPTCHAs that are meant to authenticate human traffic, or site APIs. Perplexity has even made the case that agents acting on behalf of users shouldn't be subject to scraping restrictions since they function “just like a human assistant.”

The fact that these agents are out in the wild without much protection in place means there is a real threat of exploits. There is a lack of standardization for safety evaluations and disclosures, leaving many agents potentially vulnerable to attacks like prompt injections, in which an AI agent picks up on a hidden malicious prompt that can make it break its safety protocols. Per MIT, nine of 30 agents have no documentation of guardrails against potentially harmful actions. Nearly all of the agents fail to disclose internal safety testing results, and 23 of the 30 offer no third-party testing information on safety.

Just four agents—ChatGPT Agent, OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini 2.5—provided agent-specific system cards, meaning the safety evaluations were tailored to how the agent actually operates, not just the underlying model. But frontier labs like OpenAI and Google offer more documentation on “existential and behavioral alignment risks,” they lack details on the type of security vulnerabilities that may arise during day-to-day activities—a habit that the researchers refer to as “safety washing,” which they describe as publishing high-level safety and ethics frameworks while only selectively disclosing the empirical evidence required to rigorously assess risk.

There has at least been some momentum toward addressing the concerns raised by MIT's researchers. Back in December, OpenAI and Anthropic (among others) joined forces, announcing a foundation to create a development standard for AI agents. But the AI Agent Index shows just how wide the transparency gap is when it comes to agentic AI operation. AI agents are flooding the web and workplace, functioning with a shocking amount of autonomy and minimal oversight. There's little to indicate at the moment that safety will catch up to scale any time soon.

In 1994, Russian archaeologists unearthed a tiny cemetery with a grave holding a mummified woman wearing a wig. More than 30 years later, researchers revisited the long-dead body—exposing what appears to be a primitive prosthetic in her jaw.

In a statement, archaeologists at Novosibirsk State University in Russia announced that a recent analysis of a 2,500-year-old skull found that the woman likely received jaw surgery after a serious head injury. The researchers performed a CT scan of the skull, revealing signs of severe physical trauma and, more importantly, remnants of an “elastic material” that would have been a “surgical ligature to stabilize the jaw,” they said.

“The CT scanner acted as a ‘time machine,' providing non-destructive access to anatomical structures,” Vladimir Kanygin, head of the university's Laboratory of Nuclear and Innovative Medicine, said in the translated statement.

The mummy was found on the Ukok Plateau, a region in southern Siberia associated with the Pazyryk culture, a nomadic population from the Iron Age. At the time of excavation, researchers estimated the woman's age at around 25 to 30 years. But that was about it. Only a part of her head was mummified, making it difficult for archaeologists to fully investigate the body. A patch of mummified skin on the skull prevented researchers from studying the skull without disturbing the remains.

The CT scans revealed far more than the researchers expected. The facial injury had destroyed the woman's right temporomandibular joint (TMJ), a small section of the upper jaw near the ear. The severity of the injury suggested that the woman wouldn't have been able to eat or speak.

That was the least surprising part. Further examinations uncovered thin canals drilled into the woman's temporomandibular joint, in addition to a ligament structure that might have been horsehair or animal tendon.

What's more, the woman's teeth on the left side were severely damaged compared to the right, hinting she was mostly chewing with her left teeth, meaning she survived for an extended period after the surgery. New tissues grew inside her mouth, and the prosthetic allowed her to move her jaw to a certain extent.

The team isn't sure what caused the injury, although the woman may have fallen from a horse, considering the nomadic lifestyle of the Pazyryk.

The researchers note that while the new discovery was unexpected, it wasn't “particularly surprising.” Archaeologists knew the Pazyryk people had a nuanced response to injuries and death—the “Siberian Ice Maiden,” a mummy found in a Pazyryk tomb with perfectly preserved tattoos, being a prime example.

The Pazyryk people were also skilled seamstresses, creating sophisticated, lightweight leather coats stitched in fine parallel rows, added Natalia Polosmak, an archaeologist with the Russian Academy of Sciences. These motor skills certainly would have come in handy for surgical operations, she said.

Importantly, the findings further exemplify the Pazyryk culture's deep respect for life, the researchers said. For example, the mummy's burial was considered to be “ordinary” compared to that of the Siberian Ice Maiden, suggesting she may have been of a lower status.

Her injuries would also have left her face distorted. The prosthetic allowed her jaw to move again, but probably with a lot of pain, the researchers noted. Needless to say, that likely curtailed the woman's contributions to her community, which arguably made her a burden in the already harsh conditions the Pazyryk had to weather.

Yet, the archaeological record clearly demonstrates she was properly treated and later buried in a proper coffin of wood—a valuable resource for the region.

“We don't know what her personal value to society consisted of,” Polosmak mused. “In this society, everyone was valued in life simply for their existence and honored after death.”

A new bill proposed in the California State Assembly could potentially require the makers of 3D printers to confirm that they are using algorithms or other technologies to prevent the printing of firearms.

The new bill is AB-2047, and it mostly mimics Washington's HB 2321 and New York Assembly's S9005/A10005, all proposed recently in 2026. However, California goes one step further by ""[banning] the sale or transfer of any 3D printer in California unless it appears on a state-maintained roster of approved makes and models.""

 






If the bill is passed as is, then by July 2027, the California Department of Justice would be required to publish guidance on certifying 3D printers and their software controls to block the printing of gun parts. The department would accept applications for approval before January 2028, and six months later in July 2028, every company intent on making or selling a 3D printer in California would need to attest that they have met those stanards. That September, the stated would publish a list of authorized makes and models to be updated quarterly.Unauthorized printers would be banned from sale beginning on March 1, 2029.

As with the Washington and New York bills, circumvention of these measures would be made illegal. The California bill specifically states the following:(A) For firmware design, guidance for how vendors are required to demonstrate that their technology will ensure a printer directs potential print jobs to the algorithm before printing can occur.

(B) For integrated preprint software design, guidance for how vendors shall demonstrate that printers will accept print jobs exclusively from a single preprint software and will not accept print jobs from any other preprint software, including from a user seeking to evade a detection algorithm.

Washington's bill, meanwhile, states the measures ""cannot be overridden or otherwise defeated by a user with significant technical skill."" This could ultimately mean every printer in the state would have a locked bootloader, firmware, and/or slicer.

Adafruit, which sells tools and supplies to makers, points out on its blog that the combination of the three states represents a significant slice of the 3D printing market, for a combined 20% of the U.S.' population, and 24% of the nation's GDP. If all three bills pass, 3D printing vendors could balk at making and maintaining separate product lines for California, Washing, New York state, and the rest of the country.

Update 2/20/2026 8:40 am PT: We have added Acer's statement to Tom's Hardware below, along with other updates on the situation.

It's not a fun time to be a computing enthusiast in Germany. Besides the high RAM and SSD prices everyone else is experiencing, both Asus and Acer's German websites are completely down due to the companies' recent spat with Nokia over the HEVC codec — meaning customers can't find any downloads or reach support pages for their hardware. (For example, obtaining BIOS updates and drivers.) Computerbase.de first reported the news.

 






It's not just the German websites that are offline; any German user trying to work around the issue by visiting the US version of the websites will also be redirected to a page stating the sites are unreachable. Trying to use a VPN and setting (for example) a U.S. location to reach the German sites doesn't work either. Their only recourse is to use a VPN endpoint outside Germany and visit the non-German websites to find downloads for their wares.

In a further update to the original story, ComputerBase has now confirmed that affected users can obtain drivers for Asus motherboards using the Asus DriverHub; this won't work on notebooks or NUCs, and requires the aforementioned software (the site is still inaccessible). The site has further identified a workaround enabled by visiting Acer's Swiss support website, which is published in German, so it doesn't even require translation.

The origin of this issue is the recent lawsuit from Nokia against both companies over royalties for the HEVC codec. Nokia managed to get a German court to issue an injunction against both makers, blocking them from ""offering, placing on the market, using, or importing or possessing such devices in Germany."" It's worth noting that Germany is the largest consumer computing market in Europe.

In a public statement, Asus said that ""all after-sales services in Germany remain fully operational, and existing customers will continue to receive uninterrupted support in full compliance with the current court order,"" adding that it is ""evaluating and pursuing further legal action to reach a fair resolution as soon as possible"".

The fact that the websites are completely down runs counter to this statement. There's no telling if email support has also been taken offline, but you couldn't even find that to begin with. The fact that — at least for Asus — the blocking also affects German users visiting the U.S. website also seems excessive.

In a further response to this story, Acer issued Tom's Hardware with the following statement: ""Acer respects the intellectual property of other companies and organizations. In accordance with a ruling by the Munich Regional Court between Nokia and Acer we were required to temporarily suspend our sales activities in Germany for the impacted products. At the same time, we are reviewing additional legal options in order to reach a fair solution as quickly as possible. As long as the litigation is ongoing, we cannot comment on further details. Numerous product categories such as monitors, routers, e‑scooters, and accessories are not impacted by the ruling and remain available.""

While it's hard to pin down the exact rationale for a complete geo-block of both German websites and German users, it's simply due to unintended consequences. In theory, all the companies would have to do would be to ensure that their respective German online stores are disabled, and that any other regions' stores no longer ship to Germany, but the block is much broader.

It's also not impossible that the injunction's wording could be overly broad, and the companies are playing on the safe side. In the past, Oppo/OnePlus, Vivo, and Lenovo went through similar situations, but reports indicate that their respective websites weren't completely taken offline.

Sometimes, laptops aren't designed for budget customers, but rather those willing to pay top dollar for design and performance. Samsung's Galaxy Book6 Ultra (starts at $2,449.99, with US availability not yet specified) fits in the latter category – this 16-inch creator-focused laptop courts those who might otherwise default to a 16-inch MacBook Pro. Final pricing wasn't available as of this review, but the hardware configuration – the latest Intel “Panther Lake” Core Ultra H-class CPU and an Nvidia “Blackwell” RTX 5070 GPU – signal a flagship laptop. Complemented by a premium metal build and a superb AMOLED touch display, the Galaxy Book6 Ultra is clearly designed to compete at the top of the market.

Once glance at the Galaxy Book6 Ultra justifies Samsung's reputation for quality and style, and also a strong resemblance to Apple's MacBook Pro. The gunmetal chassis and contrasting black keyboard deck gives the system a clean, ultramodern aesthetic. The all-metal exterior feels unquestionably solid and shows virtually no flex under pressure. I also noted it showed almost no fingerprints after several days of use. There's refreshingly minimal branding aside from Samsung's lettering on the back of the lid and under the screen.

Despite housing a 16-inch display and powerful silicon, the Ultra maintains an impressively slim profile. Measuring 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.46 inches (WDH), it's 0.2 inches thinner than the Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches) and over a pound lighter, at 3.5 pounds versus the Apple's 4.67 pounds. It also undercuts Dell's 16 Premium (14.1 x 9.4 x 0.75 inches, 4.65 pounds) on both size and weight.

Connectivity is good for a system this thin. On the left edge, you'll find two Thunderbolt 4 ports and HDMI 2.1, while the right edge offers USB-A, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a full-size SD card slot, enough variety that most users shouldn't need dongles. Wireless support is also up-to-date, with support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 from an Intel BE211 networking card.

Our Galaxy Book6 Ultra review unit features a Core Ultra 7 356H processor, an Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD. This is a potent configuration for demanding tasks, especially content creation. Though this isn't a gaming laptop, the dedicated Nvidia GPU is also capable of some play.

For performance comparisons, we included the Apple MacBook Pro 16-Inch ($3,649 as tested) running the M4 Pro processor, the Dell 16 Premium ($2,799) featuring a Core Ultra 7 255H, and the Framework Laptop 16 ($2,396) with a Ryzen AI 7 350. These laptops all fit in the same class, though the MacBook ought to have the strongest CPU.

In the cross-platform Geekbench CPU test, the Samsung had the best overall showing among the Windows laptops, with 16,655 points in multi-core to practically tie the Dell (16,850) and lead the Framework (12,399). None challenged the MacBook's commanding 22,822 points in multi-core, and it also dominated single-core, with 3,910 points to Samsung's 2,852.

The situation improved for the Samsung in the Handbrake 4K-to-1080p video transcoding test, where it finished in just 3 minutes and 18 seconds, outpacing the Dell by 32 seconds. The MacBook again commanded the lead, with 2 minutes and 38 seconds.

In our 25GB file transfer test, Samsung was at the middle of the pack at a rate of 1,467.5 MBps, ahead of the Dell's 1,080 MBps but trailing the Framework (1,725 MBps) and the MacBook (2,237.5 MBps).

To stress-test productivity laptops, we run 10 loops of Cinebench 2024. During the test, scores ranged between 1,212 and 1,221 points, an exceptionally tight range suggesting consistent performance for long-running CPU workloads.

What really makes this system a stunner is its AMOLED screen. With a 2880 x 1800 resolution, touch support, and 120 Hz refresh rate, it's truly remarkable for any kind of content, particularly colorful media. Watching Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, I felt immersed by the strong contrast in space scenes, bright flashes of lightsabers and blaster bolts, and the vibrancy of Endor's forests. I even fired up Borderlands II for a little gaming action, admiring the smooth picture courtesy of the high refresh rate. It's truly a first-rate picture.

 




Display measurements confirm the Galaxy Book6 Ultra's visual excellence, with 121.2% of sRGB color and 85.8% coverage of DCI-P3. Framework's system had higher DCI-P3 coverage, but it wasn't quite as bright, which is important considering Framework uses IPS while Samsung uses AMOLED, a technology that has historically trailed IPS in peak luminance. The Dell is the only other system using OLED, yet it falls well short in brightness at 367 nits versus Samsung's 451 nits. The Galaxy Book6 Ultra not only outperforms its OLED peer but raises the bar for this type of panel.

Samsung's black keyboard contrasts nicely against the gunmetal gray palm rest, with three-level white backlighting for a professional look. The typing experience, however, doesn't live up to the aesthetics. Shallow key travel and the resulting limited tactile feel makes it hard to build confidence while typing. I normally average between 115-120 words per minute and near-perfect accuracy in the MonkeyType typing test, but I only managed 102 wpm and 95% accuracy on this keyboard after several tries. Granted, my muscle memory would probably compensate over time, but it doesn't compete with my daily-driver ThinkPad for responsiveness or assurance.

 




At least the keyboard layout is sensible, with arrow keys that are all the same size and no oddball key placements. The absence of dedicated home, end, page up, and page down keys is a downer, but not a dealbreaker since they are available pressing Fn + arrow keys.

Samsung fared better with the touchpad. Its massive size (5.9 x 4.1 inches) and smooth surface feel luxurious, making sweeping multi-figure gestures effortless. I thought the haptic feedback felt too light at first, but it can be adjusted for more intensity in the Windows Settings app > Bluetooth & Devices > Touchpad. It felt more responsive after I switched to Light click force and upped the click intensity.

Though the grilles on either side of the Galaxy Book6 Ultra's keyboard the actual speakers face downward under either side. Provided the laptop is on a solid surface, this setup produces remarkably full sound. Watching the F1 movie, I was taken by the fullness of the voices, convincing surround-sound effects when cars drove by, and the impactful bass. Music was equally impressive, with a wider soundstage than I expected and plenty of volume to entertain a few people sitting around the laptop to watch at once.

The key to the speakers sounding their best is the Dolby Access app, which provides Atmos effects. The usual music, movie, and game presets are present, but Dynamic mode unlocks the best sound and provides much more volume than the other equalizers.

User-upgradeable components in the Galaxy Book6 Ultra include the storage and battery, but most other components are soldered. The screw-free bottom suggests there's no way to get inside, but Philips-head screws are hidden behind the rubber feet. I used a plastic toothpick to get leverage, then popped them off. The feet are secured by threads rather than adhesive, and are easily pressed back in. Note the front feet are shorter than the rear feet.

With the screws removed, I used a plastic trim tool to go in the speaker outlets and pry around the edges of the chassis, popping the clips free with minimal effort. Once I had worked my way to the rear corners, a lip along the rear edge allowed me to pry against the display hinge and pop all the clips there, at which point the entire panel came free.

Inside, the storage slots are below the battery. The main M.2 2280 slot is beneath a heatshield while the other extends to its right. Overall, there's not a lot of upgradeability here, but it's not uncommon these days for most components to be soldered.

 




In our battery test, which includes web browsing, video streaming over Wi-Fi, and OpenGL workloads at 150 nits, the Galaxy Book6 Ultra lasted a respectable 15 hours and 21 minutes. While that doesn't come close to matching the MacBook Pro's 21-plus hours, it more than satisfies for all-day use. The Dell 16 Premium (7:15) and Framework Laptop 16 (8:20) barely managed half the Samsung's runtime.

 




The Galaxy Book6 Ultra uses a two-fan cooling system with airflow against the display hinge. It's effective: during our Cinebench stress testing, which lasted almost an hour, surface temperatures peaked at 92 degrees Fahrenheit between the keyboard G and H keys, 83 F on the touchpad, and 103 F on the bottom panel. Internally, the Core Ultra 7 356H averaged 84 degrees C.

The fans operate quietly, with only the sound of air escaping through the vents and no motor noise or whine. While playing Borderlands II, the laptop's speakers easily overpowered the fans and allowed me to hear small details, like footsteps.

The Galaxy Book6 Ultra's webcam is properly placed over the center of the display but doesn't stand out in visual quality. The soft-focus picture doesn't look that sharp and tends to blow out highlights, with fuzzy details. There's also noticeable grain in low-light situations. Its 1920 x 1080 resolution is the minimum expected on anything not considered a budget laptop; on one this expensive, a 1440p sensor would have been better. There's no privacy shutter, but the webcam can be electronically disabled pressing Fn + F11.

For biometric facial recognition, the camera has an IR sensor. There's also a fingerprint reader built into the power button at the keyboard's top right.

Minimal software is included on the Galaxy Book6 Ultra beyond the usual smattering of Windows 11 default apps. The Galaxy Book Experience app is a generic app for launching other apps, most Samsung-centric. For instance, Multi Control lets you control your Galaxy phone or tablet from your PC, including file sharing. There's also a nearby device app that lets you find other devices nearby, such as TVs, and share content.

I stumbled through Galaxy Book Experience for a while before finding the Samsung Settings app, which has Galaxy Book6 Ultra-specific settings. Display settings allow you to turn HDR on and off, automatic color temperature control, and a focus mode that darkens areas outside of your current window, a unique setting for OLED displays. There are also preferences, such as automatically starting the laptop when the display is opened or the charger connected, keyboard backlighting timeout, and a battery protection mode to limit charge to 80%. Tinkerers can also experiment with the laptop's performance mode: Quiet minimizes fan noise at the expense of performance while High Performance results in higher fan noise, with a toggle for maximum fan speed.

Samsung backs the Galaxy Book6 Ultra with a one-year warranty.

We reviewed the Galaxy Book6 Ultra with a 2880 x 1880 OLED touch display, Core Ultra 7 356H processor, GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD. Availability isn't certain yet, but this model's projected price is $3,199.99.

Samsung's international press release suggests that other models starting at $2,449.99 will be available with other “Panther Lake” CPUs, including the Core Ultra X7 and X9 chips featuring powerful Arc integrated graphics, as well as RTX 5060 models. Memory scales between 16GB and 64GB and storage between 512GB and 2TB. The OLED screen is standard across all models.

Samsung's pricing comes on the lower side of Apple's MacBook Pro 16-inch, which starts at $2,499. Adding the nano-texture display, the M4 Max chip with its upgraded GPU cores, and 36GB of RAM brings it to $3,649, and doubling the storage to 2TB brings it to $4,049. While that doesn't make the Ultra a bargain, it isn't outlandishly expensive.

Samsung's Galaxy Book6 Ultra makes an impressive statement. Premium design, top-tier quality, strong performance, and vibrant visuals coalesce for an elite computing experience. It's a natural choice for those who gravitate towards a 16-inch MacBook Pro but prefer Windows or use software that only works on Microsoft's operating system. Though we didn't have pricing when we did this review, it's safe to say it will be priced to match what it's offering. We'd like more communicative keyboard feedback the next time around, but otherwise, there's very little not to love here.

Among women who had a pregnancy with preeclampsia, those who exercised regularly had better cardiovascular function before conceiving again than those who did not exercise and were less likely to develop the condition in the next pregnancy.

“Aerobic exercise performed between pregnancies may substantially improve the cardiovascular profile of women with a history of preeclampsia, thereby reducing the risk of recurrences,” the researchers of the study wrote. “Exercise counseling should be integrated into postpartum care for women with prior preeclampsia.”

The study was led by Gian Paolo Novelli, MD, PhD, and Marco Silvestrini, MD, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy. It was published online on February 12 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

The study excluded women with obesity or hypertension and those using assisted reproduction; thus, women chose whether to exercise, which may have introduced selection bias. Exercise adherence was also self-reported.

The authors received no funding for this study. They reported having no conflicts of interest.

Individuals with a history of cholecystectomy have higher sleep energy expenditure, lower respiratory exchange ratios (RERs), and greater lipid oxidation than those without, suggesting that gallbladder removal may influence metabolic fuel selection and basal metabolic rate, according to a cross-sectional study of Indigenous American adults.

“[Cholecystectomy] may have lasting effects on energy metabolism and substrate utilization, highlighting the need to consider metabolic outcomes when deciding on surgery and managing patients post-surgery,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Beyza N. Aydin, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Phoenix. It was published online in Obesity.

Only Indigenous American participants were included, limiting generalizability to other populations. The cross-sectional design prevented the assessment of temporal changes in energy metabolism. Habitual food intake before the inpatient stay may have influenced RER measurements.

The study was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Among patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), bariatric surgery was associated with early significant reductions in the prevalence of MASLD and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis as assessed using FibroScan.

""Bariatric surgery was observed as an extremely effective treatment for MASLD,"" the authors of the study wrote. ""Fibroscan is an invaluable tool that enables non-invasive assessment of MASLD and hepatic fibrosis, which may help in identifying excellent and poor responders,"" they added.

This study was led by Wymin Sivakumar, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland. It was published online on February 09, 2026, in Scientific Reports.

The study was limited by the relatively small sample size and the lack of histologic confirmation. Follow-up data were limited.

The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has granted approval to zanidatamab (Ziihera, Jazz Pharmaceuticals) for the treatment of adults with advanced biliary tract cancer. 

The treatment was approved through the International Recognition Procedure (IRP), which allows the MHRA to rely on decisions by trusted international regulators.

The authorisation applies to patients whose tumours demonstrate high HER2 expression (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+) and who have progressed after at least one prior systemic therapy. It addresses an unmet need for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease for whom surgery is no longer feasible.

Zanidatamab is a bispecific antibody that employs a dual-binding strategy, attaching to two non-overlapping sites on the HER2 protein. This mechanism enhances receptor internalisation and effector cell recruitment, improving targeting of tumour cells with elevated HER2 expression.

Zanidatamab is administered by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight.

The approval was based on data from the phase 2b HERIZON-BTC-01 trial, which included 80 patients with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer not amenable to surgery. The single-arm study evaluated zanidatamab in a treatment-resistant population without a placebo comparator.

Among the 62 patients with high HER2 levels, approximately 52% experienced tumour reduction or complete elimination after an average follow-up of 34 months. The confirmed objective response rate was 41.3% across all participants, with a median duration of response of 14.9 months.

In patients with IHC 3+ tumours, the response was 51.6%, with a median overall survival of 18.1 months.

Zanidatamab demonstrated a manageable safety profile. Grade 3 treatment‑related adverse events were observed in 18% of patients, most commonly diarrhoea (5%) and decreased ejection fraction (3%). No grade 4 treatment‑related adverse events or treatment‑related deaths were reported. 

Full prescribing details, including contraindications and the complete adverse event profile, will be published on the MHRA's website within 7 days of approval.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a clinical entity characterized by a persistent sensation of burning heat or pain in the oral cavity in the absence of visible lesions or objective findings on clinical examination. It is a chronic disorder that presents both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, given the subjective nature of its symptoms and the absence of a clearly defined etiology.

Clinically, BMS manifests primarily as a localized burning sensation, most frequently affecting the tongue, although the palate, lips, and oral mucosa may also be involved. Symptoms are typically continuous or recurrent, with spontaneous onset and no identifiable triggers. In many cases, this condition is accompanied by dry mouth, taste disturbances, or dysesthetic sensations without any corresponding objective clinical findings. The absence of objective signs makes BMS a diagnosis of exclusion, which is achieved only after ruling out other oral or systemic conditions that could account for the symptoms of BMS.

Epidemiologic Profile

Multiple studies have consistently reported a higher prevalence of BMS in women, particularly in middle-aged and older individuals, with a notable increase during the postmenopausal period. This distribution has prompted speculation about the possible role of hormonal factors in its development, although no direct causal relationship has been established to date. Prevalence estimates vary considerably across studies, reflecting the heterogeneity of the populations examined and the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria.

Etiopathogenic Complexity

The etiopathogenesis of BMS is complex and multifactorial. It is currently accepted that local, systemic, neurologic, and psychological factors may all contribute to its development. From a neurologic standpoint, some authors have proposed that BMS may represent a sensory neuropathy linked to alterations in the nerve fibers responsible for transmitting pain and taste. This hypothesis is supported by the dysesthetic nature of the symptoms and the partial response observed in some individuals to neuromodulatory treatments.

Possible associated systemic factors, including metabolic disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and changes in salivary composition or flow, have also been described. These factors may contribute to the onset or persistence of symptoms; however, in a considerable number of cases, no clear organic cause is identified. The absence of objective findings reinforces the classification of BMS as a functional disorder with a complex origin.

Psychological Dimensions

Several studies have reported a higher frequency of anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders in patients with BMS. However, debate persists as to whether these psychological disturbances are the primary cause, predisposing factors, or consequences of persistent chronic pain. Regardless, the interaction between psychological factors and pain perception is fundamental to understanding the clinical course of BMS.

Diagnostic Approach

The diagnosis of BMS rests principally on detailed clinical history and systematic exclusion of other conditions. A thorough oral examination is essential, and supplementary investigations should be performed to rule out infections, inflammatory processes, endocrine disorders, nutritional deficiencies, or adverse drug effects. The persistence of symptoms over several months in the absence of objective clinical findings indicates a diagnosis of BMS.

Treatment Options

Currently, no universally effective treatment is available for BMS. In many cases, management must be individualized and is multidisciplinary. Various therapeutic strategies have been used, including neuromodulatory agents, treatments aimed at alleviating dry mouth, and psychological and behavioral approaches to manage this condition. The response to treatment is typically variable and frequently incomplete. Therefore, it is essential to appropriately counsel those affected about the chronic nature of BMS and set realistic expectations from the outset.

Conclusion

BMS is a chronic and complex condition that significantly affects patients' quality of life. Its multifactorial character and the absence of objective clinical signs necessitate a careful diagnostic approach and personalized management that address both physical and psychological dimensions. Continued research is essential to advance the understanding of its etiopathogenesis and develop more effective therapeutic options.

Physicians perceive themselves as caring professionals who want to do their best for their patients, but the experience of many Indigenous patients in Canada hasn't borne out this perception.

In recent years, medical professionals and organizations have begun to acknowledge their role in harms caused by the healthcare system to generations of Indigenous peoples, including in a 2024 apology by the Canadian Medical Association (CMA).

The harms identified by the CMA include the Indian hospital system, in which Indigenous patients received substandard care and were subjected to abuse, experimental treatments, and forced sterilization. Although most Indian hospitals are now closed, the damage to Indigenous communities remains.

Other harms were inflicted by the residential school system, where medical experimentation, such as withholding necessary care and studying the impact of malnourishment, was conducted on Indigenous children. In addition, Inuit patients were forced to relocate to tuberculosis sanatoriums far from their homes and communities.

In its apology, the CMA acknowledged that some harms to First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples continue to this day.

“None of this exists only in history,” Jaris Swidrovich, PharmD, PhD, assistant professor of pharmacy at the University of Toronto, Toronto, told Medscape News Canada. For Indigenous people, “it's [still] happening to us, our relatives, and our communities.”

Incidents of forced sterilization of Indigenous women in Canada continue to be reported, according to a study by the Standing Senate Committee on Human Rights. A bill introduced in 2025 to criminalize this practice has not yet been passed into law.

In 2020, Joyce Echaquan, a 37-year-old Atikamekw mother of seven from the community of Manawan, died in a Quebec hospital after recording a Facebook Live video of racist behavior from hospital staff. A coroner's inquiry determined that racism had played a role in Echaquan's death.

These examples illustrate some of the harms that Indigenous patients face today. Research also shows that discriminatory attitudes and systemic challenges are common in the healthcare system. Supporting this finding, data from a recent Statistics Canada survey found that about 1 in 5 Indigenous people reported experiencing unfair treatment, racism, or discrimination from a healthcare professional over the previous year.

Surveys like this don't show the whole picture because Indigenous patients who experience harm in the healthcare system may not be willing to answer a phone call from the government, said Swidrovich.

Mistrust can prompt Indigenous patients to avoid care, which directly affects their health, Terri Aldred, MD, family physician for Carrier Sekani Family Services in British Columbia and academic lead for the National Collaborating Centre for Indigenous Health, told Medscape News Canada. This avoidance, along with intergenerational trauma, has led to health disparities among Indigenous peoples, such as higher rates of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes compared with the non-Indigenous European population.

Nevertheless, “being Indigenous is not a risk factor for any of these conditions,” said Swidrovich. “There's this perception that [Indigenous peoples] are unhealthy, which is completely false. The only risk factor here is racism.”

Margot Burnell, MD, CMA president and medical oncologist, said that the association's apology represents “the beginning of a journey with the Indigenous peoples to build back trust. Moving forward, it is critical to identify truth and work with Indigenous peoples toward self-determination with respect to the medical system.”

The CMA developed a ReconciliACTION Plan outlining its next steps, with guidance from a group of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis leaders, experts, elders and Knowledge Keepers. This plan includes providing funding to Indigenous-led organizations and initiatives and updating its code of ethics to strengthen provisions against racism and discrimination.

“Indigenous peoples are going to be looking at how we are doing,” said Burnell. “When their communities feel comfortable visiting health institutions and when they report no racism or discrimination, then we will have been successful.”

Aldred said that she appreciates elements of the CMA's apology, such as “recognizing Indigenous peoples' inherent right to be leaders or co-leaders in their health.” But “we're probably not going to dismantle systems of oppression, particularly in our current challenging environment, within a year or 2.”

It's going to take more than an apology for Indigenous peoples to feel like the healthcare system can provide care without prejudice and hold itself accountable, agreed Swidrovich.

There needs to be “zero tolerance for extreme acts of racism like forced sterilization, with consequences for people who have committed those acts,” he said. He also supports mandatory skills-based antiracist training for medical education programs and strict guidelines for health clinics and hospitals on tracking and addressing incidents of racism.

Culturally safe health spaces are also needed, he continued. These spaces could be as simple as a clinic with an Indigenous name, artwork, or imagery. But such a space would only be the beginning.

“If a clinic doesn't have Indigenous employees, they could at least have some Indigenous consultants or work alongside people with lived experiences to inform their work,” said Swidrovich, “until they reach a point where they have Indigenous folks to lead or co-lead.”

Aldred pointed to recent successes in British Columbia. For example, the First Nations Health Authority is opening a series of First Nations-Led Primary Health Care Centres, and the province has a virtual services program that provides culturally safe care for patients who don't have a family doctor or nurse practitioner.

In addition, clinics such as the Lu'ma Medical Centre in Vancouver are leading the way in taking a “two-eyed seeing” approach to primary care that incorporates both Indigenous and Western healing.

These kinds of initiatives must be made sustainable, but Aldred “imagines that eventually some of these safe spaces may start blending together as they grow.”

At the end of the day, “when we go to a provider, we all want to feel like we can trust what they say and that the system is going to serve us if we get sick,” she said.

Swidrovich, Aldred, and Burnell reported having no relevant financial relationships.

On February 17, 2026, Lizette Rivera did not clock in for her regular shift in the ICU at West Anaheim Medical Center in Anaheim, California. Instead, she joined her colleagues on the picket line. It's a decision that the registered nurse (RN) doesn't take lightly.

“Nobody ever wants to strike,” Rivera said. “It's something that we try to avoid at all costs…we always hope that we can settle something before having to strike.”

Nurses have been bargaining with West Anaheim Medical Center for a year with no resolution to their concerns about patient care, safe staffing, and retention and recruitment, leaving RNs feeling like a strike was their only option.

“[Unsafe staffing levels] means that patients aren't always getting optimal care,” Rivera said. “Appropriate staffing, competitive wages, and competitive benefits would make nurses feel acknowledged, make them feel…appreciated and make them want to stay for the long term and build a career.”

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Future of Nurse Unions Report 2025 found that:

Rivera is not alone on the picket lines. In January of this year, 30,000 nurses walked off the job at Kaiser Permanente facilities in California and Hawaii and 15,000 nurses went on strike in New York City. Low wages and high turnover have been pervasive issues, leading to unsafe staffing levels and concerns about patient safety in the nurse's view. In fact, 68.3% of nurses reported that there were not enough staff and 77.3% cited workloads that were unsafe for patients.

Rivera received 6 weeks of training when she joined one of the highest-admitting units at West Anaheim Medical Center in 2024. Within 5 months, she was promoted to charge nurse and started training other nurses — and she was still a recent nursing school graduate.

“It's not an appropriate assignment,” she said. “Having competitive wages and benefits would allow us to retain our nurses rather than have them come in, get minimal experience, and move on to hospitals with better options.”

The impact of low wages, high turnover, and unsafe staffing levels are visible at the bedside and have been linked to poor patient outcomes, including higher risk for preventable infections, falls, and deaths, according to Linda H Aiken, PhD, RN, professor and founding director at the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. These issues are at the root of nursing strikes.

“Nurses don't strike unless they believe their patients are unsafe,” said Aiken. “And they strike as a last resort.”

Despite persistent concerns, only two states — California and Oregon — have enacted minimum nurse staffing requirements. Aiken noted that the lack of policy guardrails in other states allows unsafe staffing levels to persist and is among the reasons that nurses continue to strike.

The nurses at West Anaheim Medical Center went on strike in August 2025. The walkout was an effort to secure a contract that addressed high turnover, and included improved efforts to attract and retain nursing staff, and required strict adherence to nurse-to-patient ratio requirements.

“We didn't want to strike,” Rivera added. “We were on strike for 1 day to show [the hospital] that we care and we want the attention from management to take us seriously.”

Hospital systems have called nursing strikes “unnecessary [and] disruptive” and referred to the RNs requests as “extreme economic demands” that put patients at risk. But RNs do think about how strikes affect their patients; awareness of care disruptions is among the reasons that nursing strikes tend to be time-limited, according to Aiken.

“Nurses only strike when it's absolutely necessary, and they try to keep the time out to a minimum,” Aiken told Medscape Medical News.

In New York, nurses at Montefiore, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Mount Sinai Morningside and West were on strike for four weeks before reaching a tentative agreement. Nurses at NewYork-Presbyterian rejected a proposal because the hospital did not agree to safe staffing protections and remain on the picket lines.

The 2026 strike at the West Anaheim Medical Center was scheduled to last for 3 days. Rivera hopes that the scheduled strike forces hospital leadership to deliver a suitable contract that addresses RN concerns.

“We are there for our patients…to give the best care that we can,” she said. “We care about the outcomes and [the hospital] puts us in situations where we feel undervalued.”

New contract agreements might mean an end to a strike, but RNs could end up back on the picket lines in the future.

Aiken points to hospital consolidation and corporatization as factors that influence wages, benefits, and staffing, leading to higher patient-to-nurse ratios, unsafe staffing levels, increased burnout, and lower job satisfaction.

“Because hospitals are more and more part of these large organizations and…people further and further away from patient care and further and further away from the communities where the care is taking place are making decisions about their staffing levels with pretty disastrous consequences,” she added.

Union contracts have become one of the few mechanisms to negotiate staffing language in the absence of statewide mandates. Strikes might be inevitable if hospitals refuse to negotiate agreements that reflect changing economic factors and refuse to listen to nurses on the front lines of patient care.

“Nurses are striking because we don't really have any standards,” Aiken said. “What we've reverted to is relying on unions where they exist [and] unions are providing the only guardrail…through their periodic renegotiations of contracts that involve staffing.”

The FDA has approved topical difamilast for treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults and children aged 2 years or older, according to a press release from the manufacturer, Acrotech Biopharma.

Difamilast, a topical phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor that will be marketed as Adquey, in a 1% ointment formulation, is applied twice daily.

Approval was supported by studies that included several phase 3, randomized, controlled trials, which found that after 4 weeks, a higher proportion of patients treated with difamilast achieved Investigator's Global Assessment success than those who received a vehicle, according to the company. The most common adverse reactions associated with treatment have been nasopharyngitis, reported by 6% of patients, the company said.

Difamilast was approved for AD in Japan in 2021 where it is marketed as Moizerto. The US approval marks the third approval of a PDE4 inhibitor for AD; crisaborole was approved in 2017 and in 2024, and topical roflumilast (Zoryve) 0.15% in adults and children aged 6 years or older. In 2025, the FDA approved topical roflumilast 0.05% for treating mild-to-moderate AD in children aged 2-5 years. No date has been identified for when difamilast will be available for clinical use in the US, according to the company.

The meta-analysis was not funded; the individual studies were funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company and Acrotech Biopharma.

Flawed clinical judgement and breakdowns in communication between patients, their families, and doctors, as well as among providers themselves, are largely to blame for malpractice suits against cardiologists, according to a national malpractice insurer.

The report from The Doctors Company analyzed 321 cardiology-related malpractice claims closed between 2010 and 2025. Of those, 36% arose from medical treatment. Another 36% stemmed from diagnosis-related factors, including delayed diagnosis or failure to diagnose. Although 69% of the filed claims ended without any payout to the plaintiffs, the remainder resulted in an average payout of $394,000.

The report found that even claims that do not end up with a payout-imposed cost on the defendant doctors and insurance company at an average of $79,000.

“While the findings are consistent with previous years for the contributing factors, a notable trend exists in the behavioral factors associated with patient adherence to treatment regimens, medications, follow-up appointments, and diagnostic tests,” Julie Ritzman, senior vice president for patient safety and risk management at The Doctors Company, told Medscape Medical News.

She noted these factors have shown the highest mean paid indemnity.

“This underscores the critical importance of diligently following up with patients to ensure they attend their follow-up appointments, complete the prescribed tests, and adhere to their medication schedules,” Ritzman added. “Implementing a robust tracking system and meticulously documenting the steps taken to ensure patient compliance is essential for all medical specialties, including cardiology.”

The average payout for malpractice claims in cardiology falls “near the middle” compared with other specialties, Ritzman said. She cited an analysis by Milliman that showed the closed claim cost for cardiology through 2022 was nearly $400,000 vs more than $1.1 million for obstetrics and about $300,000 for general surgery.

The likelihood of a cardiologist getting sued for malpractice today is about a third of what it was a decade ago, said Fred Kusumoto, MD, director of heart rhythm services at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Kusumoto is the lead author of a recent analysis of previous data from The Doctors Company from 2010 to 2023.

“The likelihood of facing a malpractice claim appears to be lower — now 3% when previously it was reported to be 9% a decade ago,” he said. “However, the claim will more likely be settled (29% of claims) compared to 14% a decade ago.”

The findings in the earlier data aligned with the latest report.

Patient nonadherence to their doctors' recommendation was the largest prevailing factor for malpractice suits targeting cardiologists, Kusumoto said, particularly related to recommended treatments. This nonadherence was most commonly due to not taking medications but also included failure to get recommended blood tests for follow-up, he noted.

However, nonclinical factors were more common than clinical factors and patient factors as a reason for malpractice claims, Kusumoto said. Among the nonclinical factors were doctors' lack of availability during a shift or during off hours, documentation, and communication between providers and between the doctor and patient.

“Now that cardiology care is often delivered by multiple providers often employed in large care groups, these care groups should ensure that effective communication with the patient and among providers is present, develop processes that verify accurate documentation (perhaps aided by artificial intelligence), provide mechanisms for follow-up, and address off-hours care,” he said.

Cardiologists should be mindful in order to minimize their liability, said Cathleen Biga, MSN, immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and a member of the ACC Medical Professional Liability Insurance Work Group. “Don't forget the soft skills,” she said. “Don't forget that the communication is really, really important. Understand if your patient is noncompliant, document it.”

She noted that relying too much on electronic medical records (EMRs) can also give providers a false sense that they're covering their liability exposure. “If your patient is noncompliant document it,” Biga said. “What's such a problem in our healthcare system today is, time is of such an essence and the EMR with check boxes doesn't help us document some of the information that's critically important.”

Biga added, “EMR has not necessarily been our great friend as it relates to meaningful documentation.”

Coordination among providers is also key to mitigating liability, Biga said. Handing off patients from one provider to another can be particularly problematic. “As we get more and more subspecialized, especially in the United States, communication with all the different EMRs, all the different methods of documentation that we have, it can be very difficult to ensure we have solid communication,” she said.

Daniel Cassavar, MD, medical director of TDC Group, parent company of The Doctors Company and a practicing cardiologist, said the findings emphasize four key points for cardiologists to minimize their liability.

“Maintain a broad differential diagnosis during initial evaluation; clearly discuss management strategies, including treatment and procedural options; transparently articulate the clinical reasoning behind therapeutic decisions and recommendations; and take patient complaints seriously, particularly when symptoms escalate, as failure to do so may undermine patient trust,” Cassavar said.

Kusumoto and Biga reported having no relevant financial relationships. Ritzman and Cassavar reported being employees of TDC Group.

A study conducted at European University and published in the journal Sport Training finds that 46% have active dental caries and 70% have periodontal disease. Experts say the very context of high-performance sport is an independent risk factor for oral pathology.

Elite athletes' oral health is significantly worse than would be expected, even in professional settings with continuous medical and nutritional follow-up, Fernando Mata, professor in the Department of Pharmacy and Nutrition at the European University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, and Cristina López de la Torre, Department of Biomedicine and Dentistry, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences and Sports at the European University of Andalusia, Málaga, Spain, told El Médico Interactivo. Both authored a study on athlete oral health that was published in Sport Training.

The study shows a very high prevalence of dental caries, dental erosion, and periodontal disease, with average rates of active caries near 46% and periodontal disease that can exceed 70% in some groups. Poor oral health is not merely an aesthetic or isolated problem; it has direct repercussions on athletic performance, recovery, systemic inflammation, and overall health.

The authors note factors inherent to high-performance sport — including a diet high in sugars, dehydration, oxidative stress, and changes to the oral microbiota — promote the development of oral disease. They recommend integrating oral health and sports dentistry into the multidisciplinary care of athletes, since oral health can be considered a silent determinant of sporting performance and long-term health.

The highest-risk profile for poorer oral health includes athletes who train and compete very frequently, especially in endurance or high-intensity sports. Also at risk are athletes who consume excessive sports drinks, gels, and supplements rich in fermentable carbohydrates and acids, resulting in repeated exposure of their tooth enamel.

Experts also point out that it's important to consider those who suffer dehydration during exercise, which reduces salivary flow and diminishes saliva's protective capacity, as well as those with insufficient or irregular oral hygiene habits, often due to lack of time, awareness, or regular access to the dentist. Furthermore, this group includes those who use mouthguards for extended periods, as this can lead to changes in the oral microbiota if not properly cleaned.

Another element to consider is that poor oral health tends to be more frequent and severe in men, both in the general population and among athletes. According to Mata and López de la Torre, men show a higher prevalence of periodontal disease, while women generally exhibit better oral hygiene habits and greater adherence to preventive checkups, which could explain part of the difference. Nevertheless, the problem is relevant in both sexes, and the differences may be modulated by the type of sport, diet, and competitive level.

The highest prevalence is observed in athletes and young adults, generally aged between 20 and 35 years, coinciding with the years of peak athletic performance. This finding is especially relevant because these are ages in which general health is theoretically optimal, and the early appearance of caries, erosion, or periodontitis indicates that factors associated with sport accelerate oral deterioration.

In most cases, affected athletes do not have relevant preexisting systemic conditions. Poor oral health appears mainly associated with chronic oxidative stress induced by intense training, low-grade inflammation, and changes in the oral microbiota related to the athletic lifestyle. This supports the idea that the context of high-performance sport is an independent risk factor for oral disease, beyond preexisting illnesses.

Nutrition is a key factor in this relationship. Frequent consumption of fermentable carbohydrates like gels, sports drinks, and bars increases the risk for caries, and acidic sports drinks promote dental erosion, especially when consumed during exercise and with low saliva flow. By contrast, diets high in protein and dairy may have a partially protective effect on enamel, and omega-3 fatty acids exhibit an anti-inflammatory effect beneficial for periodontal health.

Poor oral health affects performance through several mechanisms, the authors note, including pain and inflammation that interfere with sleep, concentration, and recovery; systemic inflammation that can compromise training adaptation; a higher risk for muscle and joint injuries, especially associated with periodontitis in sports such as soccer; and a negative impact on quality of life and psychological well-being. All of this can translate into reduced performance, increased fatigue, and decreased competitive availability.

In conclusion, the authors of this study say that current evidence confirms that oral health is an essential component of an athlete's performance and health, and neglecting it has consequences that go far beyond the oral cavity. Integrating dentistry, nutrition, and training is not optional but a necessity grounded in science.

Mata and López de la Torre reported having no conflicts of interest.

Imagine balancing a ruler vertically in the palm of your hand: you have to constantly pay attention to the angle of the ruler and make many small adjustments to make sure it doesn't fall over. It takes practice to get good at this. 

In engineering, this is called the ""inverted pendulum"" or ""cart-pole"" problem, in which a control system learns to balance an upright pole hinged to a moveable cart. This problem is used as a benchmark in fields like robotics, control theory, and artificial intelligence to gauge if a control system can adaptively process and respond to information in a useful way. It's relevant even in our earliest days-every human infant needs to solve a problem just like this in order to become a toddler. 

Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, trained brain organoids, tiny pieces of brain tissue grown in the lab, to solve this fundamental benchmark problem. By using electrical signals to send and receive information from the organoids, the researcher's software coached the lab-grown brain tissue to significantly improve its performance at the cart-pole problem. 

The team, led by Baskin School of Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Ph.D. student Ash Robbins, ECE Professor Mircea Teodorescu, and Distinguished Professor of Biomolecular Engineering David Haussler, demonstrate their findings in a paper published in the journal Cell Reports. 

This research aims to uncover how information is transmitted in the brains of complex organisms through the electrical spiking of neurons in such a way that they can learn to get better at tasks, and has implications for basic science and health research. Understanding how complex neural circuits function and adapt could provide a powerful new tool for studying how neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, stroke, concussion, Autism, Schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, dyslexia and ADHD, can change or impair the brain's capacity to learn. 

""We're trying to understand the fundamentals of how neurons can be adaptively tuned to solve problems,"" Robbins said. ""If we can figure out what drives that in a dish, it gives us new ways to study how neurological disease can affect the brain's ability to learn."" 

This research is the first rigorous academic demonstration of goal-directed learning in lab-grown brain organoids, and lays the foundation for adaptive organoid computation-exploring the capacity of lab-grown brain organoids to learn and solve tasks. 

""These are incredibly minimal neural circuits. There's no dopamine, no sensory experience, no body to sustain, no goals to pursue. And yet, when given targeted electrical feedback, this tissue is plastic enough and structured enough to be pushed toward solving a real control problem. That tells us something important: the capacity for adaptive computation is intrinsic to cortical tissue itself, separate from all the scaffolding we usually assume is necessary,"" said Keith Hengen, an associate professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved with this study. 

Organoids, which are heart, liver, lung, brain and other types of tissues grown in the lab from stem cells, have been used extensively in biomedical research for about 15 years, but researchers are only now in the initial stages of exploring how they could be used to understand how brains learn. 

Brain organoids mimic early brain development, structure, and function. They are smaller than a peppercorn, but nevertheless can contain a network of several million neurons, the brain cells that fire off electrical signals to transmit information through the body. By placing the organoids on a specialized chip, the researchers can observe neurons firing within the organoid tissue, and also stimulate selected neurons to fire. 

From an engineering perspective, what makes this powerful is that we can measure, stimulate, and adapt in the same system. This is not just recording neural activity. It is a closed-loop bioelectrical interface where the tissue's response directly shapes the next input. That is what allows us to study learning as a physical process, which has been very difficult to study directly in intact brains.""

Mircea Teodorescu, ECE Professor 

The research team, associated with the Braingeneers group within the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, set out to understand if the organoid neurons could succeed at the cart-pole task, drawing inspiration from foundational work at Caltech and Georgia Tech decades earlier by Steve Potter.

Using organoids derived from mouse stem cells and an electrophysiology system developed by industry partners Maxwell Biosciences, the researchers use electrical simulation to send and receive information to and from neurons. By using stronger or weaker signals, they communicate to the organoid the angle of the pole, which exists in a virtual environment, as it falls in one direction or the other. As this happens, the researchers observe as the organoid sends back signals of how to apply force to balance the pole, and they apply this force to the virtual pole. 

For their pole-balancing experiments, the researchers observe as the organoid controls the pole until it drops, which is called an episode. Then, the pole is reset and a new episode begins. In essence, the organoid plays a video game in which the goal is to balance the pole upright for as long as possible.

The researchers observe the organoid's progress in five-episode increments. If the organoid keeps the pole upright for longer on average in the past five episodes as compared to the past 20, it receives no training signal since it has been improving. If it does not improve the average time it keeps the pole upright, it receives a training signal. 

Training feedback is not given to the organoid while it is balancing the pole-only at the end of an episode. An AI algorithm called reinforcement learning is used to select which neurons within the organoid get the training signal. 

""You could think of it like an artificial coach that says, 'you're doing it wrong, tweak it a little bit in this way,'"" Robbins said. ""We're learning how to best give it these coaching signals.""

The results of this study prove that the reinforcement learning algorithm can guide the brain organoids toward improved performance at the cart-pole task-meaning organoids can learn to balance the pole for longer periods of time. 

The researchers adopted a rigorous framework for success to make sure they were observing true improvement, and not just random success, including a threshold for the minimum time an organoid needs to balance the pole to ""win"" the game. 

They found that using their coaching technique led to significantly better performance than organoids coached at random, from just a 4.5% ""winning"" rate for random training, to a 46% winning rate for adaptive training with reinforcement learning. 

""When we can actively choose training stimuli, we can actually shape the network to solve the problem,"" Robbins said. ""What we showed is short-term learning, in that we can take an organoid in one state and shift it into another one that we're aiming at, and we can do that consistently."" 

However, the organoids seem to ""forget"" most of what they learn during long periods of inactivity. After balancing the pole over many episodes for 15 minutes, the organoid rests for 45 minutes. The researchers found that after this rest period, the organoid's performance drops back to baseline, indicating it is not retaining its training. 

Haussler said this lack of retention might be overcome by using more complex organoids. 

""It is likely that more sophisticated organoids, perhaps grown to include multiple brain regions involved in animal learning, will be needed to recapitulate the kind of long-term adaptive performance improvement we see in animals"" Haussler said. ""We'll see.""

The researchers are interested in further exploring why their coaching technique works-which neurons are best to target, which training signals might work best, and how long-term learning may arise. 

To enable this, Robbins developed an open-source software tool to complement these experiments, called BrainDance. The technology is designed for anyone with the biological skills to culture brain organoids to be able to conduct neural simulation learning experiments and analyze results, without needing to code a game, hardware interface, or training environment themselves-with the goal to enable more people to participate in organoid research and accelerate the field. 

""This software makes running really complicated experiments extremely easy. Usually labs spend years building up all of this kind of software themselves,"" Robbins said. ""Now, any biologist could download our software very easily and run these types of experiments in just minutes.""

""Ash's software could build a larger community around adaptive organoid computation. But we want to make it clear that our goal is to advance brain research and the treatment of neurological diseases, not to replace robotic controllers and other kinds of computers with lab-grown animal brain tissues,"" Haussler added. ""The latter might be considered cool, but would bring up serious ethical issues, especially if human brain organoids were used.""

Structurally, they look similar: MNK1 and MNK2 belong to the same enzyme family and are best known for regulating how cells make proteins. Their starring role in such a crucial cellular function has cast them into the spotlight as potential drug targets to treat nervous system disorders and chronic pain. But would it matter whether a drug targets only one of them?

In a study published in ""Molecular Psychiatry,"" researchers led by Rosalba Olga Proce, a doctoral student in the Molecular and Cellular Basis of Behavior lab led by Dr. Hanna Hörnberg at the Max Delbrück Center, set out to determine whether the two enzymes – also called kinases – perform distinct functions in the brain. The team found clear differences. Mice lacking MNK1 showed less interest in newly introduced objects than controls and impaired memory of objects. By contrast, mice without MNK2 appeared normal in object recognition tests but showed enhanced interest in social contacts. 

""The behavioral differences we observed suggest that each kinase has a specialized function,"" says Proce. ""It might be preferable to target each kinase individually when designing drugs."" 

To uncover how these behavioral changes arose, the researchers used genetically engineered mice in which either the MNK1 or MNK2 gene was knocked out. They then combined behavioral testing with large-scale molecular analyses of brain tissue.

The team focused in particular on the cerebral cortex and on synapses – contact points where neurons communicate. Using proteomics, transcriptomics, and phosphoproteomics, they compared protein levels, gene expression, and protein phosphorylation patterns between the two types of mice. 

Mice lacking MNK1 had an abundance of ribosomal proteins, which play a central role in transcribing messenger RNA into proteins. By contrast, in mice lacking MNK2, the expression and phosphorylation of proteins responsible for transmitting messages in synapses was reduced.

Notably, the researchers found that the molecular differences between the two kinases were far more pronounced in synapses than in whole-brain samples.

We were surprised to see these differences. This suggest that the kinases may have different functions in the cell body compared to synapses.""

Dr. Hanna Hörnberg, Max Delbrück Center

Instead of broadly inhibiting both kinases, future therapies might selectively target one kinase or the other to achieve more specific effects, Hörnberg adds. 

She and her colleagues now aim to identify other molecules with which MNK1 and MNK2 interact. They also plan to study in greater detail, how these kinases regulate translation of messenger RNA into proteins during synaptic plasticity – the strengthening or weakening of connections between neurons over time. Synaptic plasticity is the fundamental mechanism underlying learning and memory ­– enabling the brain to rewire itself based on experience.

By clarifying how protein synthesis is fine-tuned at synapses, the team hopes to lay the groundwork for more precise interventions in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Scientists have long known that people living at high altitudes, where oxygen levels are low, have lower rates of diabetes than people living closer to sea level. But the mechanism of this protection has remained a mystery.

Now, researchers at Gladstone Institutes have explained the roots of the phenomenon, discovering that red blood cells act as glucose sponges in low-oxygen conditions like those found on the world's highest mountaintops.

In a new study in the journal Cell Metabolism, the team showed how red blood cells can shift their metabolism to soak up sugar from the bloodstream. At high altitude, this adaptation fuels the cells' ability to more efficiently deliver oxygen to tissues throughout the body, but it also has the beneficial side effect of lowering blood sugar levels.

The findings solve a longstanding puzzle in physiology, says Gladstone Investigator Isha Jain, PhD, the senior author of the study.

Red blood cells represent a hidden compartment of glucose metabolism that has not been appreciated until now. This discovery could open up entirely new ways to think about controlling blood sugar.""

Isha Jain, PhD, core investigator at Arc Institute and professor of biochemistry, UC San Francisco

Jain has spent years probing how low blood-oxygen levels, called hypoxia, affect health and metabolism. During a previous study, her team noticed that mice breathing low-oxygen air had dramatically lower blood glucose levels than normal. That meant the animals were quickly using up glucose after they ate-a hallmark of lower diabetes risk. But when the researchers used imaging to track where the glucose was going, major organs couldn't account for it.

""When we gave sugar to the mice in hypoxia, it disappeared from their bloodstream almost instantly,"" says Yolanda Martí-Mateos, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in Jain's lab and first author of the new study. ""We looked at muscle, brain, liver-all the usual suspects-but nothing in these organs could explain what was happening.""

Using another imaging technique, the team revealed that red blood cells were the missing ""glucose sink""-a term used to describe anything that pulls in and uses a lot of glucose from the bloodstream. The cells, having long been considered metabolically simple, seemed like unlikely candidates.

But further mouse experiments confirmed that red blood cells were indeed absorbing the glucose. In low-oxygen conditions, mice not only produced significantly more red blood cells, but each cell took up more glucose than red blood cells produced under normal oxygen.

To understand the molecular mechanisms of this observation, Jain's team collaborated with Angelo D'Alessandro, PhD, of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, and Allan Doctor, MD, from University of Maryland. who has long studied the function of red blood cells.

The researchers showed how, in low-oxygen conditions, glucose is used by red blood cells to produce a molecule that helps cells release oxygen to tissues-something that's needed in excess when oxygen is scarce.

""What surprised me most was the magnitude of the effect,"" D'Alessandro says. ""Red blood cells are usually thought of as passive oxygen carriers. Yet, we found that they can account for a substantial fraction of whole-body glucose consumption, especially under hypoxia.""

The scientists went on to show that the benefits of chronic hypoxia persisted for weeks to months after mice returned to normal oxygen levels.

They also tested HypoxyStat, a drug recently developed in Jain's lab to mimic the effects of low-oxygen air. HypoxyStat is a pill that works by making hemoglobin in red blood cells grab onto oxygen more tightly, keeping it from reaching tissues. The drug completely reversed high blood sugar in mouse models of diabetes, working even better than existing medications.

""This is one of the first use of HypoxyStat beyond mitochondrial disease,"" Jain says. ""It opens the door to thinking about diabetes treatment in a fundamentally different way-by recruiting red blood cells as glucose sinks.""

The findings could extend beyond diabetes to exercise physiology or pathological hypoxia after traumatic injury, D'Alessandro notes, where trauma remains a leading cause of mortality in younger populations and shifts in red blood cell levels and metabolism may influence glucose availability and muscle performance.

""This is just the beginning,"" Jain says. ""There's still so much to learn about how the whole body adapts to changes in oxygen, and how we could leverage these mechanisms to treat a range of conditions.""

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can cause certain types of cancer or autoimmune diseases, but how the body controls this common viral infection is largely unknown. Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn (UKB) and the University of Bonn have now identified genetic and non-genetic factors that help the body fight EBV. To do this, they evaluated genome sequencing data, which is actually intended for characterizing the human genome, in a new way. Using the new technique, they were able to estimate the amount of EBV in the blood and find correlations in large health data sets – for example, an increased viral load in people with HIV infections, but also in smokers. There were also indications of new genes that play key roles in EBV immunity. Their findings have now been published in the renowned journal Nature.

Approximately 90 to 95 percent of the global adult population is infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV infection is a risk factor for various types of cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). After infection, which commonly occurs in childhood, EBV remains hidden in certain white blood cells, the B memory cells, for life. The virus is usually inactive in these cells and, in this so-called latency phase, evades removal by the immune system. The virus is reactivated spontaneously, but also as a result of stress, and then switches to an active state. ""Despite its high relevance, very little is known about how exactly the immune system controls lifelong EBV infection and how this contributes to the development of diseases such as cancer or autoimmune diseases. This is largely due to a lack of suitable data-for example, large population-based studies such as biobanks lack direct measurements of EBV viral load."" says corresponding author Prof. Kerstin Ludwig from the Institute of Human Genetics at the UKB, who is also a member of the ImmunoSenstation3 and the Transdisciplinary Research Areas (TRA) ""Life and Health"" & ""Modeling"" at the University of Bonn.

""To overcome these limitations, we established that the amount of EBV in human blood can be estimated using genome sequencing data. Genome sequencing data is actually collected to characterize the human genome – so we have 'repurposed' it a little,"" says lead author Dr. Axel Schmidt from the Institute of Human Genetics at the UKB. The research team examined genome sequences (GS) from the blood of 486,315 participants in the UK Biobank and 336,123 participants in the All of Us project and found short DNA segments that could be attributed to the EBV genome, so called EBV reads, in 16.2 percent and 21.8 percent of the individuals, respectively. ""People in whom such EBV reads are detected have, on average, an increased EBV viral load. We were able to demonstrate this with laboratory tests. Since large biobanks, such as the UK Biobank, have collected genome sequencing data for all participants, we now have a measure with which the EBV viral load can be estimated on a large scale,"" says Schmidt. ""This opens up completely new possibilities for investigating the many questions that still remain on the subject of EBV immunity.""

First, the authors investigated which non-genetic factors influence EBV viral load. They were able to show that the number of EBV reads was increased in immunocompromised individuals and also in smokers. Smoking is a risk factor for several EBV-associated diseases, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. ""Our data indicate that current smoking in particular increases EBV viral load. Other groups have already shown that current smoking has an influence on the innate immune system. This could therefore be an indication that this interaction also plays a role in EBV control,"" says Schmidt. Another interesting observation was a correlation between the viral load and the season in which the sample was taken – on average, more EBV sequences were found in winter and fewer in summer.

At the genetic level, the Bonn researchers found a strong association between EBV viral load and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus. This section of our genome contains blueprints for special proteins that help the immune system recognize germs such as viruses or bacteria, making this DNA region a key player in the immune system. In addition to the MHC locus, associations were found in 27 regions of DNA outside the MHC that were largely consistent across both biobanks. Among the genes located in these regions are some with known functions in the immune system that could play a plausible role in controlling EBV viral load, but also a large number of new candidates. Analyses of genetic overlap with EBV-associated diseases also led to new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms involved in MS and identified new diseases for which EBV could be pathophysiologically relevant, such as type 1 diabetes.

Prof. Ludwig sums up: ""Our results serve as a basis for understanding EBV immunity, and they also open up avenues for new mechanistic studies and therapeutic approaches for EBV-associated diseases. In a broader sense, our study illustrates how by-products of human genome sequencing data can be used to investigate persistent viral infections.""

Institutions involved: In addition to the UKB and the University of Bonn, the University of Tokyo in Japan was also involved in the study.

Past studies in animals have shown that a highly processed diet is linked to memory problems and inflammation in the aged brain – and the effect can happen fast, after just three days of poor eating.

A new study suggests another dietary pitfall could have a similar damaging effect in a similarly short amount of time in older adults: a lack of fiber.

The study in rats also points to the amygdala – the small structure governing emotional memories, especially related to bad experiences – as a brain region that is particularly sensitive to a highly processed diet. Every type of refined diet fed to old animals was associated with cellular and behavioral signs of cognitive problems traced to this emotional memory center of the brain.

""The amygdala is important for learning the association between something fearful and a bad outcome. And we found that all of the refined diets, whether they were high fat, high sugar, low fat, low sugar, it didn't matter. They all impaired memory that's governed by the amygdala,"" said co-lead author Ruth Barrientos, an investigator in the Institute of Brain, Behavior and Immunology at The Ohio State University.

""And when we looked to see the common thread among all of those diets, the one thing that became very obvious was that they all lack fiber.""

Not learning the association between an action and its outcome, especially when it's dangerous or risky, may increase the risk for physical or financial harm, said Barrientos, also an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health and neuroscience in Ohio State's College of Medicine.

""The amygdala plays a role in that kind of awareness and learning,"" she said. ""Its vulnerability to a refined diet is therefore concerning for older adults who are at greater risk of financial exploitation and scams.""

The research was published recently in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.

Barrientos has studied the effects of high-fat and highly processed diets on the aged brain for several years, seeing behavioral results and related indications of inflammation in both the amygdala and the hippocampus, which is important for spatial, autobiographical and episodic memory.

In this work, she and colleagues focused on disentangling the diet contents to see whether fat or sugar, or something else, had the strongest link to cognitive impairment in rats.

Young and aged male rats were fed either normal chow or one of five experimental diets for three days: low fat, low sugar; low fat, high sugar; medium fat, low sugar; medium fat, high sugar; or high fat, low sugar.

Behavioral tests showed that old animals that were fed all of the refined diets – no matter the level of fat or sugar – had impaired long-term emotional memory based in the amygdala compared to young rats on the same diets. In contrast, memory-related behavior traced to the hippocampus was negatively affected only by the high-fat, low-sugar diet.

And then there was the no-fiber factor. All of the experimental diets lacked fiber, and examination of the rats' guts and blood showed a significant reduction in a key molecule, called butyrate, that is produced in the gut and circulated in the blood when dietary fiber is broken down by gut microbes.

Previous research by other labs has shown that butyrate has anti-inflammatory effects and can cross the blood-brain barrier, which may mean a deficiency in butyrate caused by a lack of dietary fiber could be linked to unregulated inflammation in the brain, Barrientos said.

What our study really brings to light is the complexity of diet and how it affects so many different things, even the brain. There's not a magic bullet, but in this case, low butyrate, as a result of a lack of fiber, is a culprit.""

Kedryn Baskin, co-lead author, assistant professor of physiology and cell biology, Ohio State University

At the cellular level, the researchers found the most compelling evidence of refined diet-related damage in the mitochondria of microglia, cells that have multiple functions important to memory function. When exposed to experimental energy demands in cell cultures, mitochondria from young brains could adapt to the changes, but these power centers in aged brain cells were not able to rise to the challenge.

""The mitochondria are still functioning, but they're showing depressed respiration and are functioning at a much, much lower rate in the aged compared to the young,"" Baskin said.

Though the refined diets caused some weight gain, Barrientos said the findings put to rest the notion that obesity brought on by a highly processed diet is the primary driver of impaired cognition.

""These effects on the brain after you eat something are pretty rapid,"" she said. ""You can experience this unhealthy cognitive dysfunction well before you reach obesity.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study analyzes alterations in the cerebral cortex in people with psychosis","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260220/Study-analyzes-alterations-in-the-cerebral-cortex-in-people-with-psychosis.aspx","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 13:04:00 GMT","

Researchers at the University of Seville have analyzed alterations in the cerebral cortex in people suffering from psychosis. Their findings show that psychosis does not follow a single trajectory, but rather its evolution depends on a complex interaction between brain development, symptoms, cognition and treatment. The authors therefore emphasize the need to adopt more personalised approaches that take individual differences into account in order to better understand the disease and optimize long-term therapeutic strategies.

Psychosis is a set of symptoms—such as hallucinations and delusions—that are common in schizophrenia and involve a loss of contact with reality. From their first manifestation, known as the first psychotic episode, these symptoms can appear and evolve in very different ways between individuals, thus making schizophrenia a particularly complex disorder.

The results of the study show that, at the time of the first episode, people with psychosis present a reduction in cortical volume, which is particularly marked in regions with a high density of serotonin and dopamine receptors, key neurotransmitters in both the pathophysiology of psychosis and the mechanism of action of antipsychotics. The data also suggest that both neurons and other brain cells involved in inflammatory and immunological processes may play an important role in the disease.

These structural differences tend to diminish during treatment, thereby suggesting that the rate of brain deterioration is attenuated by clinical intervention. However, more marked differences persist in people who receive higher doses of antipsychotic medication over time. This does not necessarily imply that the medication causes volume loss, but rather that those patients with more severe symptoms often require higher doses.

The study also confirms that these patients show cognitive impairments from very early stages. Throughout follow-up, many individuals experienced improvement in both symptoms and cognition, thus suggesting that clinical stabilisation may be accompanied by partial recovery of these functions. However, this improvement is less pronounced in those who require higher-dose treatments.

In the study led by Claudio Alemán Morillo and Rafael Romero García at the Neuroimaging and Brain Networks Laboratory of the University of Seville, and published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, magnetic resonance images were acquired to calculate the volume of different regions of the cerebral cortex in 357 patients with schizophrenia and 195 controls.

One of the most relevant aspects of the study is that the participants were evaluated over a period of ten years, thereby allowing an analysis of how the brain changes in the long term and how these changes are related to clinical symptoms and cognitive performance, including possible difficulties in attention, memory, or processing speed. In addition, the study applies a percentile-based analysis for the first time. Just as percentiles are used in paediatrics to identify deviations in weight or height, they can now be used to detect whether certain brain regions have atypical volumes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","$8.7 million award supports faster genetic diagnosis of lymphatic diseases","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260219/2487-million-award-supports-faster-genetic-diagnosis-of-lymphatic-diseases.aspx","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 03:47:00 GMT","

A team of researchers led by Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons has been awarded an up to two-year $8.7 million contract from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to create genetic tests to speed the diagnosis of patients born with defects in the lymphatic system.

""Discovering genes that cause lymphatic anomalies and using this information to create new clinical tests will not only accelerate the diagnosis of patients, but will also lead to improved treatments and, most importantly, save lives,"" says Carrie Shawber, PhD, associate professor of reproductive sciences at VP&S and principal investigator of the CLARUM (Comprehensive Lymphatic Anomaly Revealing and Understanding Genomics) project. 

CLARUM includes collaborators at Arkansas Children's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, the Broad Institute, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), City St. George's University of London, and NYU Langone Health. 

The funding is provided by the ARPA-H LIGHT (Lymphatic Imaging, Genomics, and pHenotyping Technologies) program, which aims to illuminate the unseen aspects of the lymphatic system through novel diagnostic approaches and significantly improve patient care and outcomes by gaining a deeper understanding of its critical role in health.

Most people have heard about their lymph nodes, which are often inflamed during infections, but are less familiar with the rest of their lymphatic system. 

Sometimes called the ""forgotten circulation,"" the lymphatic system is a network of vessels, ducts, and nodes that moves fluid throughout the body, ensuring that tissues maintain normal fluid levels and that fats, hormones, and immune cells reach their destinations. The lymphatic system also prevents organ damage and promotes organ regeneration. 

Defects in the lymphatic system can disturb the flow of this liquid (called lymph) and cause a variety of serious health problems, from trouble breathing caused by swelling around the lungs to increased vulnerability to severe infections.

Approximately one in every 3,500 babies is born with a lymphatic defect and often requires intensive care soon after birth. Many people with lymphatic anomalies die from sepsis because they cannot mount an immune response to infections.

Severe lifelong consequences from the defects continue to accumulate as the patients age.

In many cases of lymphatic anomalies, the lymphatic system continues to grow abnormally, affecting every organ. ""The growth damages the organs and eventually causes organ failure, particularly in the spleen, heart, and lungs,"" says Shawber. 

Lymphatic diseases are often confused with other conditions, and it can take years for some patients to receive the correct diagnosis.

Diagnosis can be sped up by looking for genetic mutations that are known to cause lymphatic diseases. But many genetic causes are yet to be identified, and most cases cannot be attributed to a known genetic cause. Genetic diagnosis is also limited to a few specialized centers in the U.S., primarily in large urban hospitals.

The goal of CLARUM is to develop new genetic tests that can identify more cases of congenital lymphatic disease and can be requested by doctors' offices across the country.

""A problem with genetic testing today is that patients in rural America don't have access to these tests, and so they're not diagnosed or treated appropriately,"" Shawber says. ""Because of limited access to testing, it's thought that we may be missing almost 80% of patients.""

Shawber expects that the CLARUM team will find 15 or more new genetic mutations that cause lymphatic disease and increase the predictive value of genetic testing.

Today, about 20-30% of patients with lymphatic anomalies caused by specific mutations may be helped by treatments that target those mutations. 

""Since the first genes that cause lymphatic disease were identified about a decade ago, three therapies have been identified and those patients are responding very well to the treatments and seeing significant improvements in their quality of life,"" says Shawber. ""Genetics research has changed the landscape of treatment for lymphatic anomalies, but it hasn't gone far enough yet to help the majority of patients. So there is a desperate need to identify more genes.""

Congenital lymphatic anomalies are rare, and no single medical center sees enough cases to permit robust gene discovery. CLARUM brings together six academic medical centers that will combine forces to look for genes in 2,000 patients.

Columbia and CHOP will develop, in parallel, two comprehensive genetic panels to screen specimens generated by standard clinical care. 

The other parts of project will focus on increasing the diagnostic yield of these genetic panels by identifying novel mutations in known and unknown genes. 

Arkansas Children's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Columbia, and City St. George's University of London will contribute unique cases, and Broad will apply its advanced genetic bioinformatic pipeline to identify novel genes.

Another challenge is that most mutations identified to date are variants of uncertain significance (VUS), lacking sufficient evidence that they cause disease. NYU Langone, City St. George's, and Columbia will develop cell- and zebrafish-based models to rapidly screen VUS's to determine if they are disease-causing. 

The Columbia team will also work with collaborators at Broad on developing a robust and reproducible method to detect mosaic mutations before birth, which may prevent fetuses with cystic lymphatic malformations from being treated prior to receiving a genetic diagnosis with potentially ineffective therapies that carry the risk of side effects. 

CLARUM aims to develop two different genetic tests that will be ready for clinical use within two years. The tests will use common specimens (tissues and lymph-containing fluids) generated from standard care to detect lymphatic anomalies and simultaneously screen for both germline and mosaic mutations in 73 genes associated with primary lymphatic anomalies. The team aims to shorten the time for genetic diagnosis of lymphatic anomalies from years to weeks, which may speed access to FDA-approved therapies that target mutated genes linked to lymphatic anomalies. 

The CHOP and Columbia teams will work closely with their technology ventures programs to commercialize the genetic panels for nationwide clinical use. 

""It's taken decades for us to find and evaluate the mutations that enabled current genetic tests,"" says Shawber. ""With the help of ARPA-H's LIGHT Program, we can make a substantial leap forward.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Italian registry sheds light on acute coronary syndromes in women","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260219/Italian-registry-sheds-light-on-acute-coronary-syndromes-in-women.aspx","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 04:43:00 GMT","

Preliminary results from an Italian registry describe the risk profile of women experiencing acute coronary syndromes and provide insights to improve management. These findings were presented today at the EAPCI Summit 2026, a new event organized by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), an association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

Ischaemic heart disease is a common condition in which the coronary arteries become narrowed due to the build-up of fatty material. Acute manifestations of ischaemic heart disease – called acute coronary syndromes (ACS) – include angina and heart attacks (myocardial infarction [MI]).

ACS shows important differences between men and women. Evidence suggests that although fewer women develop ACS than men, women are at greater risk of dying than men in the same age group.

As explained by Doctor Francesca Napoli from IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, more needs to be done to understand ACS and its effective treatment in women: ""There is underrepresentation of women with ACS in clinical trials, despite cardiovascular disease being a leading cause of mortality."" She continued: ""The Gender, Diversity and Inclusion–Acute Coronary Syndromes (GEDI–ACS) registry is the first multicentre, prospective Italian registry dedicated to studying ACS in women. We aim to integrate clinical, sex-specific, socioeconomic, psychosocial, biochemical and molecular data to capture a multidimensional perspective and ultimately advance more accurate diagnosis, equitable management and improved outcomes for women with ACS.""

The study is enrolling 100 consecutive women presenting with ACS (ST-segment elevation MI [STEMI], non-ST-segment elevation MI [NSTEMI]) or unstable angina) across multiple centres in Northern and Southern Italy: IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan), AOU Federico II Naples (Naples), Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Milan) and Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico (Milan), ensuring the inclusion of patients from different geographic, socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.

Clinical data from the first 68 patients were presented at the EAPCI Summit. The median age of the study population was 68 years and 7.4% were non-Caucasian. Most women (85.3%) had low health literacy.

Cardiovascular risk factors were frequently observed: 83.6% had dyslipidaemia, 77.9% had hypertension and 50.0% had a history of smoking. In total, 32.3% reported miscarriage and 16.2% reported premature menopause. Autoimmune diseases were present in 32.2% of patients, while 16.2% had a history of cancer and almost half (42.6%) experienced anxiety/depression.

For most patients, ACS (86.0%) was the first manifestation of cardiovascular disease, with chest pain (88.2%) the main symptom. The type of ACS was STEMI in 38.2% of women, NSTEMI in 36.8% and unstable angina in 25.0%. Over one-third (38.2%) had MI with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), a condition that occurs when patients have a heart attack without evidence of major blockages to the coronary arteries. 

Outcomes were favourable – no deaths, strokes or reinfarctions occurred during the first 30 days. Recurrent chest pain was experienced by 11.3% of patients.

Doctor Napoli discussed the implications: ""ACS often represented the first cardiovascular event. The common coexistence of ACS with noncardiac comorbidities, miscarriage and premature menopause provide insights into how we may be able to tailor preventive approaches. MINOCA was also a frequent finding and yet the best way to treat it is still unknown. The high levels of anxiety/depression and poor health literacy we found are important considerations as we try to support women with ACS more effectively to enhance recovery.""

The registry will continue with additional enrolment and follow-up. We will also combine clinical findings with genetic and molecular data to deepen our understanding of disease mechanisms and contribute to more precise and inclusive approaches to ACS care in women.""

The Hebrew University of Jerusalem is proud to announce the establishment of the Sally Einstein Brain Research Program, made possible by a ₪1,000,000 (USD $300,930) grant from the Sim Einstein Research Foundation, Inc.

The university extends its warmest congratulations to Dr. Or Shemesh and his team at the Hebrew University School of Pharmacy on receiving this prestigious award. Their two-year research project, titled ""The Infectious Etiology of Brain Disease,"" will pioneer a cross-disciplinary approach to understanding how pathogens contribute to some of the world's most challenging neurological conditions.

The Shemesh Lab will investigate the role of infectious agents in a broad spectrum of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, PANDAS & PANS, ALS, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. While these conditions are often studied in isolation, Dr. Shemesh's team aims to identify shared pathways and pathogens that may drive brain pathology across all of them.

""We are thrilled to receive this support, which allows us to compare disease mechanisms across seemingly different conditions,"" said Dr. Or Shemesh. ""By uncovering the 'common denominator' pathogens that trigger brain inflammation and degeneration, as well as identifying disease-specific pathogens that may define a unique cranio-biome for each neurological disorder, we are taking the first step toward developing innovative treatments that could halt disease progression.""

The grant was provided by the Sim Einstein Research Foundation, Inc. and is part of the global Alzheimer's Pathobiome Initiative (AlzPI) consortium, co-founded and led by Nikki Schultek of the Pathobiome Research Center at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. Dr. Shemesh and his team have been members of AlzPI for many years to accelerate our understanding of infectious drivers of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases through global, multidisciplinary collaboration.

New insights into spontaneous coronary artery dissection – a devastating cause of heart attacks in young, healthy patients – were presented today at the EAPCI Summit 2026. The summit is a new event organised by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), an association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an emergency condition in which an inner layer of a coronary artery tears away from the outer layer. Blood collects in the space between the layers, causing a haematoma that reduces blood flow and can lead to a heart attack (myocardial infarction [MI]). Most patients affected by SCAD are healthy women with few traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.

SCAD was considered rare but awareness of the condition is growing. SCAD still remains under-diagnosed and under-studied with few, if any, randomised trials conducted to define the most appropriate treatment approach. The mechanisms responsible for MIs after SCAD are very different from MIs caused by atherosclerosis and yet they are often treated in the same way. We created a national prospective registry to understand more about SCAD, treatment practices and outcomes, and to fill a gap in knowledge about patients from Eastern European countries.""

Professor Svetlana Apostolović, study presenter, University Clinical Center Nis, Serbia

This analysis of the Serbian SCAD Registry included 123 patients who attended 14 centres specialising in interventional cardiology from November 2021 to November 2024. In total, 27 patients were retrospectively studied and 96 were prospectively studied. Intracoronary imaging techniques were used to establish the SCAD diagnosis in 26.0% of patients.

The majority were female (85.4%) and the mean age was 47.5 years. In total, 6.7% of patients were pregnant or in the postpartum period, while 36.2% were menopausal. The most frequent risk factors were hypertension (49.6%) and dyslipidaemia (46.3%). Where known, the most common precipitating factors were mental stress (38.5%) and physical stress (10.7%).

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 41.5% of patients, which involved stent implantation in 28.5% of all patients. Medical therapy alone was received by 58.5%. Overall, more than half of patients received dual antiplatelet therapy (58.5%) and low-molecular weight heparin (56.9%).

During hospitalization, 23.6% of patients experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE: recurrent MI, hemodynamic instability, malignant arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, unplanned revascularisation or a cerebrovascular event) and 8.1% of all patients died.

In the 30 days after hospitalization, 18.1% of patients experienced MACE and 0.8% died. Independent predictors for MACE included stent implantation (p=0.010) and depression (p=0.008).

Full resolution of SCAD was observed in 62.2% of patients after 30 days.

Professor Apostolović summed up the findings: ""SCAD was most common in non-pregnant young women and menopausal women, with intracoronary imaging found to be particularly useful in enabling accurate diagnosis. SCAD often resolved fully and stent implantation was not beneficial in the majority of patients. Careful observation alongside beta-blockers, blood-pressure lowering medication, cardiac rehabilitation and psychological support may improve outcomes and reduce the impact on patients' daily lives, but more studies and trials are needed.""

Further insights regarding epidemiology, presentation, management and outcomes will be provided by the ESC's ongoing large, multinational SCAD registry.

A new research paper was published in Volume 18 of Aging-US on February 8, 2026, titled ""Single-cell transcriptomics reveal intrinsic and systemic T cell aging in COVID-19 and HIV.""

In this study, co-first authors Alan Tomusiak from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the University of Southern California, and Sierra Lore from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the University of Copenhagen, together with corresponding author Eric Verdin from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, developed a new single-cell transcriptomic clock called T immune cell transcriptomic clock (Tictock) to measure aging in specific immune cells. 

Immune aging increases susceptibility to infection, cancer, and chronic inflammatory disease. Most aging clocks, used to measure it, rely on bulk measurements from mixed cell populations. As a result, they cannot determine whether age-related signals reflect shifts in cell proportions or true molecular aging within defined immune cells.

To address this limitation, the research team used single-cell RNA sequencing, a method that measures gene expression in individual cells. They analyzed nearly two million immune cells from the blood of healthy adults to develop Tictock. This tool integrates automated classification of six canonical T cell subsets with cell-type specific age prediction models. This design enables the separation of systemic aging, reflected by changes in cell proportions, from intrinsic aging, which occurs within individual cells.

When the team applied Tictock to patients with acute COVID-19, they found two clear effects. First, COVID-19 altered T cell composition, including significant reductions in naïve CD8 and naïve CD4 T cells. Second, the infection increased the biological age of naïve CD8 T cells. In people living with HIV who were receiving long-term antiretroviral therapy, T cell proportions remained largely stable. However, naïve CD8 T cells still showed signs of accelerated aging.

The study also uncovered shared biological pathways linked to immune aging. Many of the genes that predicted age were involved in ribosomes, the structures that help cells produce proteins. The researchers also observed that older immune cells often had shorter average transcript lengths, a feature previously linked to aging. These findings suggest that changes in protein production and gene regulation play an important role in immune decline.

""Gene Ontology enrichment of 209 genes shared across six clock models identified common pathways including the cytosolic small ribosomal subunit, TNF receptor binding, and cytosolic ribosome components.""

Overall, Tictock was designed to measure relative aging within defined T cell populations rather than overall biological aging. By distinguishing systemic from cell-intrinsic immune aging, it provides a clearer understanding of how viral infections such as COVID-19 and HIV reshape immune function. This approach enables the study of immune aging at single-cell resolution and may support improved immune risk assessment in clinical and research settings.

Can fragments of tumor DNA in the blood predict whether chemotherapy will be effective? Researchers at the Princess Máxima Center investigated this question together with experts from Italy and Slovakia. They focused specifically on young adults with germ cell tumors for whom standard chemotherapy doesn't work well. 

Blood samples from young adults treated at hospitals in Italy and Slovakia were analyzed before and during chemotherapy. The researchers searched these samples for fragments of tumor DNA circulating in the blood. They identified specific changes in the genetic material that came from cancer cells resistant to standard chemotherapy. The team then looked at whether these characteristics were linked with how long the cancer stayed away after treatment in young adults with germ cell tumors. 

The findings are promising: a blood test could potentially help doctors make more personalized decisions about whether initiating this intensive therapy is worthwhile, particularly in what may be the patient's final phase of life. 

Further research is required before this approach can be implemented in clinical practice. The next step is to confirm these findings in a larger group of people, including blood samples from children with germ cell tumors. 

This research was made possible by Stichting Kinderen Kankervrij (KiKa) and the Italian Ministry of Health. 

Germ cells are responsible for the development of sperm in men and eggs in women. The precursor cells of these germ cells can develop into cancer. This happens mainly in boys and young men, both in the testis and in other places in the body. 

In the Netherlands, approximately 30 children are diagnosed with a germ cell tumor each year, as well as around 850 young men with testicular germ cell tumors. Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men aged 15 to 35. In one in ten of these young adults, standard chemotherapy doesn't work well enough. Despite treatment with high-dose chemotherapy, half of this group ultimately dies. 

For this reason, researchers from the Looijenga group at the Máxima Center worked with scientists from the Italian IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori ""Dino Amadori"" to study biomarkers that could predict clinical response and treatment outcome. In the future, this could help improve the quality of life in the patient's final phase of life. 

The study was published today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. 

Blood samples from 69 patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and 26 patients receiving standard chemotherapy were analyzed using shallow whole genome sequencing. In circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA), the researchers assessed tumor fraction (TF) and copy number alterations (CNAs). These results were compared with an existing biomarker, miR‑371a‑3p. The team then evaluated associations with progression-free survival and overall survival. 

Analysis of cfDNA provides valuable prognostic information in germ cell tumors that do not respond adequately to, or recur after, standard chemotherapy. These minimally invasive biomarkers may refine risk stratification and support decision-making about whether to initiate a final, highly intensive course of chemotherapy in relapsed germ cell tumors. The insights gained could also help identify new targets for the development of less toxic treatments. 

The researchers now plan to validate these results in a larger cohort of adolescents and children with germ cell tumors, within an international collaboration. If the follow-up study confirms the findings, clinicians may be able to use them in practice to determine the most appropriate treatment for patients with germ cell tumors. Researchers will also be able to more effectively explore alternative treatments that are both more effective and associated with fewer side effects.

Getting enough sleep may be more important for heart health than many busy professionals realize. A new multicenter study conducted by researchers from Kumamoto University and the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, has found that insufficient sleep is linked to a higher risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) among working-age adults.

AF is the most common type of heart rhythm disorder and is associated with serious complications such as stroke and heart failure. Although previous studies suggested a connection between sleep and AF, most relied on self-reported sleep data. This new research used an objective method: a one-week Holter electrocardiogram equipped with a built-in accelerometer to continuously estimate actual sleep duration during daily life.

The team analyzed anonymized data from individuals in their 50s-considered peak working age-and those in their 70s, representing retirement age. Among participants in their 50s, shorter sleep duration was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of AF. In fact, each additional minute of sleep was linked to a measurable reduction in AF risk. In contrast, no clear association was observed among participants in their 70s.

Interestingly, while longer sleep generally reduced AF risk, excessively long sleep did not provide additional benefit, particularly in older adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep may be a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, especially for middle-aged individuals exposed to occupational stress and demanding schedules.

""Our results provide objective evidence that sleep duration matters for heart rhythm health, particularly in working adults,"" said Dr. Tadashi Hoshiyama of Kumamoto University. ""Securing sufficient sleep may help reduce the burden of atrial fibrillation.""

As modern lifestyles increasingly compress sleep time, these findings underscore a simple but powerful message: protecting your sleep may help protect your heart.

A pioneering personalized mRNA vaccine study reveals lasting immune responses in triple-negative breast cancer, offering early signals that tailored cancer vaccination may help improve long-term outcomes pending larger trials.

In a recent study published in the journal Nature, researchers evaluated the feasibility, safety, immunogenicity, and long-term clinical outcomes of an individualized neoantigen messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine in patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

TNBC accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases and is associated with a high risk of early recurrence. TNBC lacks expression of estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which limits eligibility for targeted hormonal or HER2-directed therapies. Recurrence risk peaks within the first three years after diagnosis, particularly among high-risk patients.

Advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled the identification of tumor-specific somatic mutations known as neoantigens, which can serve as personalized vaccine targets. mRNA vaccine platforms offer a rapid and adaptable strategy to stimulate immune responses against tumor-specific mutations. However, long-term immune durability and demonstrated clinical benefit remain uncertain, necessitating further investigation into whether personalized vaccination can prevent relapse in high-risk TNBC populations.

This first-in-human exploratory clinical trial enrolled patients with early-stage TNBC within one year of completing standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. All participants had undergone surgery with curative intent. Tumor-specific somatic mutations were identified through next-generation sequencing of resected tumor tissue and selected as individualized vaccine targets.

Personalized vaccines were manufactured by encoding up to 20 patient-specific cancer mutations into two RNA-lipoplex (RNA-LPX) mRNA molecules formulated in liposomal nanoparticles for intravenous administration. This design aimed to enhance antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II pathways to stimulate both cytotoxic and helper T cell responses.

Participants received eight intravenous doses over nine weeks, consisting of six weekly and two biweekly administrations. Three initial patients underwent dose escalation before receiving the target dose of 50 micrograms. Peripheral blood samples were collected at baseline and after vaccination to evaluate immune responses.

Immune responses were assessed using interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays. Additional immunologic analyses included human leukocyte antigen multimer staining, intracellular cytokine profiling, bulk and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing, and transcriptomic phenotyping. Long-term follow-up was conducted to monitor relapse-free survival and to investigate potential immune-escape mechanisms in patients who experienced recurrence.

All 14 evaluable patients generated vaccine-induced or amplified T cell responses against at least one personalized neoantigen. Most individuals mounted responses against multiple mutations, and nine patients developed T cell responses targeting five or more neoantigens, indicating broad immune activation.

High-magnitude immune responses were detected in 86% of patients via ex vivo interferon gamma ELISpot assays, with several individuals demonstrating 2,000 to 4,000 interferon gamma-producing cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Among the evaluated neoantigens, 82.9% elicited measurable immune responses that were not detectable before vaccination. Immunogenic targets arose from insertions, deletions, and single-nucleotide variants.

In patients with sufficient samples for in vitro stimulation assays, 51.8% of tested mutations elicited T cell responses. Among these, 64% were mediated exclusively by cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) positive T cells, 20% by cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and 16% by both CD4 and CD8 T cells. This distribution reflects engagement of helper and cytotoxic T cell compartments, although the trial was not designed to establish a direct causal link between immune responses and clinical outcomes.

Multimer staining confirmed rapid expansion of mutation-specific CD8 positive T cells during vaccination. In certain patients, neoantigen-specific cells constituted up to 17.5% of circulating CD8 positive T cells and persisted for years. In one case, 10.3% of circulating CD8 positive T cells recognized a single mutation at treatment completion, with more than 3% remaining detectable two years later without booster vaccination.

Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that many vaccine-induced T cells differentiated into late-stage cytotoxic effector memory CD45RA-expressing cells capable of rapid tumor cell killing. Concurrently, a subset developed into stem cell-like memory T cells expressing T cell factor 1 and interleukin 7 receptor alpha, markers associated with long-term immune regeneration and potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade.

These findings suggest durable immunologic memory capable of sustained tumor surveillance based on mechanistic observations, though not definitively linked to clinical relapse prevention.

After a median follow-up of 62 months (range, 15 to 80 months), 10 of 14 patients remained relapse-free. One additional patient remained relapse-free until death from unrelated causes. Three patients experienced recurrence.

Among these cases, one patient exhibited the weakest vaccine-induced immune response but subsequently achieved a complete response lasting 15 months following anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy combined with sequential chemotherapy. Another recurrence arose from a genetically distinct primary tumor not represented in the vaccine design. The third case demonstrated tumor immune escape associated with downregulation and loss of MHC class I expression, impairing antigen presentation but not fully neutralizing circulating T cell responses.

This study demonstrates that personalized mRNA neoantigen vaccines are feasible, safe, and highly immunogenic in patients with early-stage TNBC. Vaccination induced long-lasting and functional T cell responses that persisted for years without booster doses. The generation of cytotoxic effector and stem-like memory T cells supports the biological plausibility of sustained immune surveillance.

Although most participants remained relapse-free during extended follow-up, the small sample size and absence of a randomized control group limit definitive conclusions regarding clinical efficacy. Observed immune escape mechanisms highlight the complexity of tumor-immune interactions and underscore the need for combination strategies or refined antigen selection.

Overall, these findings position individualized mRNA neoantigen vaccination as a promising adjuvant strategy in high-risk TNBC. Larger, controlled clinical trials are required to determine its impact on long-term relapse-free survival and overall survival in broader breast cancer populations.

A new electronic implant system can help lab‑grown pancreatic cells mature and function properly, potentially providing a basis for novel, cell-based therapies for diabetes. The approach, developed by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, incorporates an ultrathin mesh of conductive wires into growing pancreatic tissue, according to a study published today in Science.

""The words 'bionic', 'cybernetic', 'cyborg', all of those apply to the device we've created,"" said Juan Alvarez, PhD, an assistant professor of Cell and Developmental Biology. While these terms may sound futuristic, he noted this approach is already in use in the form of deep brain stimulation, which treats neurological conditions. ""What we're doing is like deep stimulation for the pancreas. Just like pacemakers help the heart keep rhythm, controlled electrical pulses can help pancreatic cells develop and function the way they're supposed to,"" he said. 

In Type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly attacks clusters of hormone-secreting cells called islets, destroying their ability to make the blood-sugar lowering signal insulin. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that in 2021 about two million Americans of all ages had this condition. In the most serious cases of Type 1 diabetes, and occasionally Type 2 diabetes, patients need to replace the lost and damaged cells - either with a whole pancreas, segments of it, or islet cells by themselves.

All of these options are often in short supply, forcing patients to wait a year or more for either a pancreas or islet cell transplant. After the procedure, they must take immunosuppressant drugs their entire lives to ensure that their bodies don't reject the transplant. However, pancreatic tissue grown in the lab doesn't present these drawbacks.

Researchers in Alvarez's lab partnered with the Jia Liu lab at Harvard University to implant a fine, electrically conductive mesh into pieces of developing pancreatic tissue, capable of detecting the electrical signals from the islet cells. They then introduced a natural, 24-hour rhythm in electrical activity, prompting the cells to mature and respond properly to sugar - overcoming a major challenge to growing fully functional pancreatic tissue outside the body. Such alternative transplants promise to dramatically expand the supply of new tissue and, if engineered properly, reduce the risk of rejection. 

This approach of coaxing human stem cells to produce beta and other hormone secreting cells is already being tested in clinical trials. Still, a key challenge remained: even with this electrical boost, the lab-grown cells often don't fully mature and may not release insulin and other hormones as reliably as natural ones.

Alvarez and co-senior author Jia Liu, PhD, set out to understand how the cells could become able to fulfill their calling. ""I like to call it when cells get their PhDs,"" Alvarez said. ""It is when cells stop being undecided undergrads, and commit to their career path of being pancreatic or islet cells.""

Alvarez's lab specializes in growing three-dimensional pieces of pancreatic tissue called organoids, while Liu's lab develops tissue-like electronic implants. To create the cyborg tissue, they placed a stretchable mesh- thinner than a piece of human hair- between layers of cells, which then clustered together to form islets. This set up allowed the team to record the electrical activity of individual islet cells over two months, and gain new insight into this transition, including the role of circadian rhythms. 

In previous research, Alvarez's lab showed that exposing functionally immature cells to a circadian rhythm - like the body's natural 24-hour internal clock that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, digestion, and other systems - prompts the cells fully develop into their mature, specialized roles. The team found that after four days, the cells continued cycling on their own.

This new rhythm prompted the islet cells to mature so that they secreted hormones at the right times. The data, meanwhile, showed that not only did the initial cycles teach individual cells new electrical behavior, but it seemed to help the cells start working in sync with each other, like a coordinated team, Alvarez said. 

Alvarez foresees two ways this research could lead to transplant alternatives. Perhaps lab-grown islet cells could be ""zapped"" to prepare them to go into a patient, then left on their own to produce, store, and release insulin. Or, maybe the mesh could be left in place to monitor and stimulate islet cells. This approach could ensure the cells don't regress and so stop responding to insulin, as can happen with stress or disease. 

Eventually, AI could control such a system, monitoring the cells and stimulating them when needed. ""In the future, we could have a system that runs without human intervention,"" Alvarez said.

A large, multi-center study recently published online in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (JNCCN) provides new insight into the long-term health effects of contemporary chemotherapy regimens used to treat testicular cancer, highlighting differences in renal function, cardiovascular risk, and the overall burden of chronic health conditions among survivors. It's expected these study findings will be used to inform national follow-up guidelines for cisplatin-treated testicular cancer survivors in the future.

Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men aged 18-39, and modern cisplatin-based chemotherapy cures more than 95% of patients. However, as survival has improved, attention has increasingly shifted to the long-term health consequences faced by testicular cancer survivors who may live for many decades after completing treatment.

In the largest real-world study to date comparing contemporary National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended chemotherapy regimens, researchers evaluated nearly 800 long-term testicular cancer survivors treated at eight major cancer centers in North America. The study assessed a broad range of adverse health outcomes and quantified survivors' cumulative burden of morbidity more than a decade after treatment.

""Our findings show that while today's standard chemotherapy regimens are highly effective at curing testicular cancer, they're associated with meaningful long-term health risks that appear to differ by treatment approach,"" said Sarah L. Kerns, PhD, MPH, corresponding author and associate professor of radiation oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. ""Understanding these differences allows clinicians and patients to make more informed decisions and emphasizes the importance of long-term survivorship care.""

The study (https://doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2025.7120) found that testicular cancer survivors treated with four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EPx4) had significantly higher odds of renal impairment, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy compared with those treated with three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEPx3). Nearly 41% of all survivors in the study showed some degree of at least mild renal dysfunction, which was strongly associated with cumulative cisplatin dose.

Importantly, reduced renal function was linked to higher risks of developing hypertension, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease later in life - conditions that can significantly impact long-term quality of life and survival.

""This study demonstrates for the first time that even mild reductions in renal function after chemotherapy can signal elevated later cardiovascular risk in testicular cancer survivors,"" said Lois B. Travis, MD, ScD, senior author and the Lawrence H. Einhorn Professor of Cancer Research at the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""These findings underscore the need for lifelong monitoring of both renal and cardiovascular health in this young survivor population.""

Researchers also found that the overall cumulative burden of morbidity - a measure that captures both the number and severity of chronic health conditions - was similar between EPx4 and BEPx3, but significantly worse among survivors who received more intensive regimens. Worse morbidity scores were closely linked to poorer self-reported physical health, reinforcing the clinical relevance of these long-term effects.

Because the health conditions identified in the study are often detectable through routine clinical evaluations, the authors emphasize that many of the risks can be identified early and potentially mitigated through targeted surveillance, lifestyle interventions, and preventive care.

The study was conducted as part of the multi-center Platinum Study and was supported by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.

CVS Pharmacy has signed a pair of sponsorship agreements with U.S. Soccer and the NWSL, a significant expansion of the pharmacy chain's involvement in women's soccer. The brand is also adding team-level deals with the NWSL's Seattle Reign and K.C. Current after serving as the front-of-kit sponsor for the Washington Spirit since 2020. 

Octagon represented CVS in negotiations with the properties. Terms of the agreements were not disclosed.

CVS is U.S. Soccer's first-ever sponsor in the retail pharmacy category, and its addition brings the firm's roster of corporate partners to 25 with the men's FIFA World Cup in North America four months away. CVS will serve as the presenting partner for the U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year Award and the SheChampions Mentorship Program. 

With the NWSL, CVS will be designated as an official health and wellness partner. The brand will receive entitlement rights for NWSL Youth Clinics and support the NWSL Combine and Youth Combine. CVS will also have virtual signage exposure across all NWSL matches and collaborate with the league on a new social content series designed to translate health expertise into practical guidance for fans, families and young athletes. 

CVS has also signed former USWNT player Alex Morgan as an endorser. Morgan will be involved in the brand's efforts to develop community multiuse soccer fields in select markets through 2028. ","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

Who else will join Zoey Deutch and Emily Bader on Netflix‘s “The 99'ers,” the streamer's drama about the 1999 US Women's National Soccer team?  Deadline reports that Emilia Jones and Alessandro Nivola are the latest to join the cast.  Jones will play US team member Julie Foudy in the film, while Nivola is Tony DiCicco, the team's head coach from 1994-1999.

Nicole Kassell directs “The 99'ers,” based on Jeré Longman‘s 2000 book “The Girls Of Summer: The U.S. Women's Soccer Team And How It Changed The World.”  For those who don't remember, the 1999 US Women's National Soccer Team won the World Cup Final against all odds, claiming victory on a dramatic penalty kick against China.

Deutch will play soccer executive Marla Messing in the film, while Bader plays soccer star Mia Hamm.  Katie Lovejoy, Dana Stevens, and Peter Hedges co-write the film, with Jill Mazursky and Jamee Decio original writers on the project.

Producers on the “The 99'ers” include Liza Chazin via 3Dot Productions, Hayley Stool and Ross Greenburg, with Messing, Mazursky, and Krista Smith on board as executive producers.

Jones is fresh off Brad Ingelsby‘s HBO drama “Task,” as well as Edgar Wright‘s “The Running Man.”  Other upcoming projects for the actress include A24‘s Anthony Bourdain biopic “Tony” opposite Dominic Sessa.

As for Nivola, he's coming off a hot couple of years that include pivotal roles in “The Brutalist,” “The Room Next Door,” and “Downtown Abbey: The Grand Finale.”  He also starred in the Apple TV+ series “The Big Cigar,” and currently stars in the FX limited series “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette” as fashion designer Calvin Klein.

Expect “The 99'ers” to premiere on Netflix in 2027, but a late 2026 release isn't far-fetched.

Toronto FC is in the final stages of acquiring United States international and Norwich City forward Josh Sargent, sources confirmed to ESPN.

The deal will see Toronto pay Norwich a fee of $22 million, which could rise to $27 million if certain incentives are met. Sargent traveled to Toronto to complete his medical Friday.

The fee currently ranks in the top five that an MLS side has ever paid for an incoming transfer. The highest-ever fee is believed to be the $26m that LAFC paid for Son Heung-Min last summer, which the Sargent move will eclipse if all the incentives are reached.

The Daily Mail was the first to report the news of Sargent's impending transfer.

The move, if completed, completes a bitter transfer saga that began last December when Toronto first made its approach for $18m.

Sargent was keen to make the move given his desire to have him and his family return to North America. When talks appeared to break down in January, Sargent sat out an FA Cup match against Walsall on Jan. 11, and following a meeting with sporting director Ben Knapper and manager Philippe Clement, Sargent was sent to train with the Canaries' under-21 side.

Sources tell ESPN that during that meeting, Knapper made comments about Sargent's family. Sargent was seen to be visibly upset by these remarks, and he never played for Norwich again. The breakthrough was finally made in the last few days when the two clubs at last agreed on a price.

Sargent finishes his Norwich career with 55 goals and 15 assists in all competitions. He scored seven goals in 23 league matches this season. His international prospects have dwindled this campaign, with his last callup to the U.S. men's national team occurring back in September. He hasn't scored for the U.S. since 2019.

The move is the latest in a lengthy rebuild for Toronto that finally appears to be coming to fruition. Toronto claimed a domestic treble of MLS Cup, Supporters Shield and Canadian Championship back in 2017, but the last time the Reds qualified for the postseason was in the Covid-impacted season of 2020.

In the last year, Toronto has acquired midfielder Djordje Mihailovic, U.S. World Cup veteran Walker Zimmerman as well as midfielder Dániel Sallói.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

·20 Februari 2026

The start of the Major League Soccer regular season this weekend means a multitude of U.S. Men's National Team hopefuls returning to action – and indicates the soccer world moving one step closer to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino is still making decisions for his World Cup roster and the first few months of the MLS season, along with the upcoming March friendlies in Atlanta against Belgium and Portugal, will be an opportunity for many of those wanting to represent the Stars and Stripes to make their case.

The USMNT is currently unbeaten against World Cup-qualified opponents in five consecutive matches, including the 2025 finale, an emphatic 5-1 victory against Uruguay. Here are some USMNT players who contributed to those results and are gearing up to compete this MLS season:

Defender Tim Ream played in 13 matches last year to bring his total to 79 USMNT caps. The 38-year-old has become a leader from the backline over his 15-year career with the U.S., captaining the squad 25 times and 16 under Pochettino. He started in all four matches for the U.S. in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and he is set to begin his second full season with Charlotte FC.

Another player on the U.S. backline alongside Ream is defender Miles Robinson, a two-time MLS All-Star and Best XI honoree who has earned 38 caps and scored three goals with the U.S. since his senior team debut in 2019. Robinson suffered an Achilles injury in 2022 which eliminated his chance at competing in Qatar. The center back kicks off 2026 with FC Cincinnati against his former club, Atlanta United FC, and Paraguayan midfielder Miguel Almirón, who is set to open 2026 FIFA World Cup group play against the U.S.

Cristian Roldan is beginning his 12th MLS season and is looking for another title with 2025 Leagues Cup winner Seattle Sounders FC. The midfielder returned to the USMNT in 2025 after a nearly two-year absence,assisting both goals in the 2-1 win over Australia in October and earning his 42nd and 43rd caps in November. After being named to the 2022 World Cup roster but not seeing any minutes on the field, Roldan looks to have a more central role this summer, especially with the U.S. hosting Australia in the group stage at his club's home venue, Lumen Field.

 – Kamis, 19 Februari 2026

Last year, USMNT fans saw a lot more of Diego Luna, the 22-year-old currently competing with Real Salt Lake. It was a breakout year for the midfielder, who recorded four goals and four assists in 17 appearances.He scored both goals in the 2-1 win over Guatemala in the 2025 Gold Cup semifinal and was one of three Americans named to the tournament's Best XI. Luna looks to not only make his first World Cup roster but to build off his 16 goal contributions last season with RSL to make a deep playoff run.

Defender Max Arfsten also broke onto the USMNT scene last year, where he earned his first 16 caps. The wingback tallied one goal and five assists and was named a nominee for 2025 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year. Arfsten is headed into his fourth season with 2023 MLS Cup and 2024 Leagues Cup champion Columbus Crew.

Vancouver Whitecaps FC host a trio that are also in the hunt to make Pochettino's roster this summer. Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, defender Tristan Blackmon and striker Brian White had a stellar 2025 with the Canadian-based club that won its fourth consecutive Canadian Championship and reached both the Concacaf Champions Cup and MLS Cup Finals. 

Blackmon earned his first two USMNT caps last fall and 2025 MLS Defender of the Year honors in his eighth professional season. Berhalter also earned all nine of his caps last year and scored his first international goal in the win over Uruguay. White scored his first international goal in January against Costa Rica in his third USMNT cap.

 – Selasa, 17 Februari 2026

Taking over between the posts in the second half of 2025 for the U.S. was New York City FC's Matt Freese. The 2025 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year Finalist earned his first cap in June, then started all but one of the remaining matches to finish the year with three clean sheets in 13 appearances. Freese looks to build on that momentum with NYCFC, which made it to the Eastern Conference Final last season.

Another goalkeeper to watch is Matt Turner, who played every minute and recorded two clean sheets for the U.S. in the 2022 World Cup. Turner made three appearances for Pochettino last year and returned to the New England Revolution on loan from Olympique Lyonnais in August. He'll look to help the Revs improve from an 11th place finish in the Eastern Conference table in 2025. 

Columbus Crew's Patrick Schulte played in the 2025 opener, a 3-1 win against Venezuela, and FC Cincinnati's Roman Celentano and Chicago Fire's Chris Brady both earned call-ups last year, creating more competition among the goalkeeping group that will be one to watch heading into this summer.

MLS

Lionel Messi receiving MLS' MVP award Megan Briggs / Getty Images

A new Major League Soccer season is nearly here, and I'm already dialed in.

MLS involves some of the best players in the world, from Lionel Messi to Son Heung-min, and this season will be monumental in preparing some of them for the biggest competition of their lives, the 2026 FIFA World Cup co-hosted on U.S. soil.

The emotions, excitement and intrigue around soccer will be at an all-time high thanks to the summer tournament. You can already feel that steady build-up.

This MLS season will be the last to feature a February-to-December format, with the league aligning with a European calendar in 2027. As players focus on starting their MLS seasons strong, most will keep one eye on the World Cup. Hopefully, the league and its players will continue to ride that momentum into MLS Cup at the end of the year.

I have a lot of confidence in what we're going to see this season. Expect high-quality play and some intriguing and important MLS storylines to watch out for as we inch closer to opening day this weekend.

All the shine will be on Inter Miami. The 2025 MLS Cup champions are opening a brand-new stadium. They made key additions to their roster in the offseason. The club is clearly trying to maximize what it can do when Lionel Messi is still on the pitch, which is the absolute right thing to do.

After winning the MLS Cup, and with Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba retiring, the club used the offseason to bring in players who make the team even more prolific. They signed Dayne St. Clair, the reigning MLS goalkeeper of the year, and Micael, a standout center back. It also brought in Germán Berterame, a $15 million forward who will enhance Miami's already dangerous attack. There's also Sergio Reguilón, who could play a massive role on the back line if healthy.

In his second year on the touchline, Javier Mascherano managed squad rotation superbly across multiple competitions, a crucial improvement from the previous year's postseason stumble.

Mascherano's boldest decisions came at the most decisive stage, trusting budding Argentine Matteo Silvetti over Luis Suárez, a move that worked to perfection. But success has only raised expectations.

This is a club you need to watch, because as good as it was last year, it strengthened some of its weaknesses, and Messi is still Messi. The Argentine captain will also be motivated to be at his best heading into what is expected to be his last World Cup.

Can Inter Miami keep up that same pace, continue to be the shining light in MLS, and perhaps land a historic treble of Supporters' Shield, MLS Cup and the Concacaf Champions Cup?

Those factors are going to be a constant narrative throughout the year.

A lot has been made of Son Heung-min coming into the league and taking it by storm – and then there's the partnership he has since formed with LAFC teammate Denis Bouanga. They have a great understanding of one another, and that is so key in this league – they score free kicks, run at you one-v-one, and can create in the attacking third. So, what more can they do?

LAFC has become known as such a transition team – where it's very good at the counterattack, but in terms of keeping possession and pinning teams back, it struggles. Teams have realized the way to beat LAFC is by denying them space and then countering.

LAFC must figure out how to adapt from what former head coach Steve Cherundolo had them doing for so long. New coach Marc Dos Santos has a lot to prove after failing in Vancouver, and this hire was a safe in-house choice. Son and Bouanga make LAFC so dangerous, but what does that midfield composition look like? That's something I will be looking out for from the real contenders to Inter Miami coming out of the Western Conference.

Tata Martino is back at Atlanta United, a team he turned into a championship side with Miguel Almirón and Josef Martínez, and that's exciting to see. Martino can get them back to being a competitive team that's in the mix for MLS Cup. The first target needs to be making a strong playoff run and putting themselves into the contender category.

Then there's the New England Revolution and Marko Mitrović. He has done relatively well with U.S. youth national teams, and now gets his first opportunity to shine as a head coach at the professional level. The team has some good bones already, with a solid core.

With the Revs, Mitrović has reinvigorated the squad with youth. There's a lot of potential and quality, and maybe he can now marry that with the experience on the team to build a squad that can compete in the Eastern Conference. That is something I'm really going to watch – and not just because of my history with the club.

One team that isn't being talked about as much as it deserves is Nashville SC.

We're talking about B.J. Callaghan, former interim USMNT manager. He was my assistant head coach while at Philadelphia Union and was always a guy who would work extra with players who needed it. He wasn't afraid to have honest conversations.

Callaghan is a winner. He won the Concacaf Nations League as USMNT interim and, in his first full season in Nashville, lifted the U.S. Open Cup. Mike Jacobs, who's running the front office, has done a tremendous job of capitalizing on available deals in the MLS market, finding hidden bargains — and in the case of this winter, stud playmaker Cristian Espinoza as a free agent — to boost the roster.

Callaghan has also created an identity with this team and given them the confidence to win a trophy. They're a team to be wary of.

Then there's the Chicago Fire. Gregg Berhalter lifted the Fire from the bottom of the league in his first year and more progress may be on the way. His system can be a dream for forwards to play in because they're guaranteed to get opportunities.

Hugo Cuypers (17 goals last season) has shone, while Philip Zinckernagel (15 goals, 15 assists) is technical and underrated. Getting a stadium in Chicago will be a massive step in the right direction, too, so I look forward to seeing them play in their new arena when it's built.

Finally, San Diego FC was sensational in year one. No one expected that, outside of maybe sporting director Tyler Heaps and head coach Mikey Varas. But the second year is always much more difficult.

Much will depend on whether Anders Dreyer (19 goals, 19 assists in 2025) can continue his golden form. This time around, there is a target on his and the team's backs. Responding to that challenge will be the determining factor for the club.

It's the award no team wants, but someone always deserves — the MLS wooden spoon, given to the team that finishes at the bottom of the 30-team league.

It's not the rosiest thing to talk about, but for fan bases and supporters around the country who support those three teams, you're kind of thinking, “What are we doing here? There's not much hope.”

I played for D.C. United, and I want them to be successful, but year after year, the supporters grow increasingly frustrated by what feels like a lack of investment and a clear long-term vision.

All signs point to a battle between D.C. United, Sporting Kansas City, and CF Montréal to avoid the bottom spot, with none of the three having the strength, depth, or difference-makers to move into a loftier place in the table.

Several American players in MLS stand a chance to break into the USMNT's World Cup roster, and it will be an unavoidable factor at the beginning of this new season.

Mauricio Pochettino has proven to the European-based USMNT stars that he doesn't care where you play and that he respects MLS by giving players in the league opportunities. Who's to say that if someone has an incredible start to the season, he wouldn't include them?

We all know that people feel pretty good about Diego Luna, who's 22 and has shown that he has the mentality you would want on a national team, along with the quality. There's also Sebastian Berhalter, who has been fantastic with the opportunities he's received from Pochettino. He keeps getting better, and his set-piece delivery really stood out against Uruguay.

The same can be said of Cristian Roldan, an experienced midfielder in Seattle who Pochettino has already called his “perfect player.” Any potential goalkeeper battle, namely between Matt Freese and Turner, will also take place in MLS, giving the league's opening months a bit more importance from a U.S. perspective.

A drawn out saga seems to be at an end

After a fallout with Norwich leadership, USMNT forward Josh Sargent is nearing a deal to come to MLS and join Toronto FC. The striker had been a key player for the Canaries and even captained the side until struggling this season. Things got ugly between the player and club with accusations that management made personal statements about Sargent's family during a meeting about his future last month. As a result, Sargent has been training with the reserves while pursuing a transfer as he was heavily linked with Toronto FC.

With the MLS transfer window still open, it seems that move is set to take place. Tom Bogert reported that Toronto and Norwich have agreed on a deal worth $22 million that will send the striker to Canada.

While Sargent put up good numbers in the Championship for his club, scoring 51 goals in the last four seasons, he only has two goals to his name with the USMNT in his career. With two friendlies coming up at the end of March and the striker position suddenly becoming very competitive for the national team, Sargent may be on the outside looking in unless manager Mauricio Pochettino sees something new when the MLS season opens.

The move is also a rare case of a national team player coming back to play in the domestic league in the prime of his career. While players like Gio Reyna have been linked with moves to MLS, the trend lately is for USMNT players to stay abroad and challenge themselves at the highest level even as MLS has elevated its game.

For the first time in the 30-year-history of Major League Soccer, the starting World Cup goalkeeper for the U.S. men's national team is expected to come from the domestic league, which kicks off its 2026 season on Saturday.

Think about it. The top American keeper at each World Cup since MLS was founded in 1996 — whether it was Kasey Keller (1998), Brad Friedel (2002), Keller again (2006), Tim Howard (2010 and 2014), or Matt Turner (2022) — always played his club ball overseas, usually in the Premier League.

That's where Turner was employed four years ago, having moved to mighty Arsenal from the New England Revolution a few months before he backstopped the USA to a round-of-16 appearance, which included posting group stage clean sheets against England and Iran.

But he then lost the main job to New York City FC's Matt Freese midway through 2025. Turner – who made just 31 appearances for Arsenal, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace over his three seasons in England – returned to the Revs last summer in an effort to boost his chances of manning the USA net in a second consecutive World Cup.

That means MLS will be the stage that Turner and Eastern Conference rival Freese use to prove their case to USA coach Mauricio Pochettino, who will be watching closely. Pochettino will also be getting regular feedback from Toni Jiménez, his longtime goalkeeping coach. 

""Last season, we began a system of watching live MLS games of the goalkeepers on our shortlist, visiting their training facilities to observe practices, and exchanging ideas with their coaching staffs, including the head coach and goalkeeping coach,"" Jiménez told me earlier this week. ""We're going to use a similar process for this upcoming season.""

Jiménez will be a busy man. The shortlist he mentioned includes several other U.S.-based goalkeepers, too. It's entirely possible — and perhaps even likely — that all three keepers who are eventually named to Pochettino's final 26-man World Cup roster in May will be MLS players.

Presumed third-string keeper Patrick Schulte of the Columbus Crew has been called up consistently since Pochettino was appointed to succeed Gregg Berhalter back in September 2024. Schulte, a 2023 MLS Cup winner who started for Team USA (composed of mostly the under-23 team) at the 2024 Paris Olympics, has three senior caps.

- 2026 World Cup: USA's Roster Projection: Who Makes The Cut?

Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati) was included in two of Pochettino's final three camps of 2025. Chris Brady (Chicago Fire), was in the one camp last fall and served as the third string behind Freese and Turner during the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. Brady and Celentano are both uncapped, as is Jonathan Klinsmann, the only World Cup roster candidate who has played consistently in Europe this season. Klinsmann (the son of former USA manager Jürgen Klinsmann) starts for Cesena in Italy's second tier.

So while U.S. assistants Jesus Perez and Miguel D'Agostino have crisscrossed Europe all winter keeping tabs on top American field players like Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, much of Jimenez's focus has been on this side of the Atlantic.

""There is communication between myself and several of their goalkeeping coaches, as well as the goalkeepers themselves,"" said Jiménez, who worked with the likes of French World Cup winner Hugo Lloris at Tottenham and Costa Rican legend Keylor Navas at PSG.  ""These communications, notifications, and updates are always shared with the rest of the national team coaching staff.""

He knows what Pochettino is looking for.

""The first thing we evaluate is whether they have the qualities to operate within Mauricio's playing principles,"" Jimienz added. ""The goalkeeper must establish a connection with the team to contribute to both defensive and offensive play. This defines the profile of the goalkeeper we need.""

With that keeper in MLS, look for Jiménez at a stadium near you in the weeks and months ahead.

""I'll be traveling two weeks before the March training camp and will be able to attend a series of games and training sessions,"" he said. ""And I'll be conducting another tour between March and May as we consider the final roster selections for the World Cup.""

The striker battle got even more interesting on Monday, when Haji Wright's hat trick against Middlesbrough leapfrogged Coventry over their English Championship rivals and back to the top of the Premier League promotion race. It heated up further midweek. Here's who's trending up and down right now:

In Monaco's biggest game of 2025-26 so far, Balogun scored twice against PSG  in the Ligue 1 rivals' UEFA Champions League knockout round playoff first leg. Although Monaco went on to lose 3-2, it was a big-time performance from the 24-year-old, who now has 10 goals in 30 games across all competitions this season.

Lyon keeps winning and the Alabama-born Tessmann keeps starting. Last weekend, the former Clemson University football recruit logged 90 minutes for the fourth consecutive Ligue 1 contest, all of them wins.

Luciano Spalletti wasn't kidding when he said that the outrageously versatile McKennie is good enough to play as a striker — Juventus' manager backed up those words by deploying the Texan up top in Juve's Champions League playoff opener against Turkish behemoth Galatasaray in Istanbul. McKennie responded by setting up Teun Koopmeiners with a perfectly weighted assist. The best spell in McKennie's already-career season continues; the 27-year-old has two goals and three assists in his  last four Champions League and Serie A games this month.

Through no fault of his own, could Pepi actually miss out on a second straight World Cup roster? The Texas native and former FC Dallas standout has been injured most of this season and won't return from his broken arm until next month. This is all while Balogun, Wright and Derby County's Patrick Agyemang are all scoring goals for their clubs. The popular assumption is that Pochettino will take three dedicated strikers to the World Cup. Could he bring four? Wright can also play on the wing after all, and the USA will need goals this summer. If not, Pochettino will have a hard decision to on who gets cut.

It's been more than a month now since Reyna has been on the field for ‘Gladbach, and the club has been worryingly coy about what's keeping the oft-injured 23-year-old attacker on the shelf. Time is clearly running out for Reyna to be ready for the March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal, if not the World Cup itself.

Has Tillman lost his spot at Leverkusen? Or is he just nursing a minor injury? The silky German-born playmaker had been in the lineup for 10 of the club's last 11 Bundesliga games before coming off the bench last weekend against St. Pauli (and USMNT teammate James Sands). Tillman was a second half sub again on Wednesday, entering after the scoring was over in a 2-0 win over Olympiacos in Athens.","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

Clubs who did not play are to get solidarity payments

No formula determined for dividing the money

Frustration is growing among clubs globally at the extended wait for £185m of solidarity payments promised by Fifa on the back of last summer's Club World Cup.

Clubs that did not participate in the tournament were promised a share of the sum, designed to ensure a proportion of the event's funding was distributed throughout the football pyramid. If shared equally it would amount to about £50,000 for every top-flight club in the world but, more than seven months after the Club World Cup's conclusion, there is no sign of the money and no timescale for its distribution. The Guardian understands Fifa is yet to determine how the money will be allocated.

There is no suggestion that the windfall will go unpaid but clubs in smaller leagues are growing particularly impatient. The £740m set aside as prize money is understood to have been released; the winners, Chelsea, are thought to have earned about £84m. In comparison the solidarity sum may seem a drop in the ocean but the cash injection would make a significant difference to those in less glamorous settings.

An executive from one of Europe's smaller leagues told the Guardian there had been no clear answers about when their clubs will be paid despite continued inquiries. In environments where domestic television rights deals are increasingly precarious, and in certain cases nonexistent, a five-figure windfall has the potential to be a lifeline.

Numerous clubs, including some on other continents, have painted a similar picture. In Europe there is a perception that Fifa has dragged its feet on reaching a final formula for the payments' distribution. On some occasions Fifa is believed to have postponed meetings on the topic. Fifa has been in dialogue for several months with the powerful European Football Clubs body, which reached an agreement last year for about 13% of Club World Cup revenue to be reserved for solidarity payments. In some quarters there is sympathy for Fifa, acknowledging the complexity and political sensitivity of the task.

One sticking point is that no formula has been determined for dividing the £185m between the six confederations, who were represented at the Club World Cup to wildly differing extents. In practice, clubs are highly unlikely to receive identical amounts. Additionally, most confederations do not have a mechanism for distributing such payments. Uefa has experience of handing out solidarity funds to clubs that do not qualify for the league phase of European club competitions and is likely to employ a similar formula when the final sums are known.

Fifa sources said they were in regular discussions with the confederations and clubs about how the money will be distributed, and that they wanted all stakeholders to benefit from what they regard as successful tournament.

A source from the Union of European Clubs (UEC), which represents more than 140 non-elite clubs around Europe, said none of its members had received any information about when payments might be received. “UEC as an organisation has not heard anything and no member clubs we have consulted with have heard anything either,” they said.

The last-minute nature of Fifa's funding deal for the Club World Cup is unlikely to have helped the process to run quickly. It was only in March, three months before the tournament, that the prize money and solidarity pots were agreed. That followed the £787m agreement with the Saudi-backed streaming platform Dazn, reached in December 2024, to air all the competition's games free of charge.

...

FIFA were so enamoured with the perceived success of the Club World Cup last summer in the United States, that they intend to follow their practice with the World Cup and expand the tournament. The next edition is not due to take place until 2029, before the next World Cup, although there has been some suggestion that FIFA are also keen to make the tournament more regular.

It is not yet clear where the Club World Cup will take place, with the World Cup itself split between Portugal, Spain and Morocco. It has been suggested that FIFA would also like to make the tournament come around every two years too.

According to Marca, FIFA want to expand the tournament from 32 teams to 48 teams, an increase of 50% as they have done with the World Cup itself. They also reveal that FIFA are open to hosting the 2029 event in Spain and Morocco as a test run for the main event the following year, but the USA remains an option to host it again.

However FIFA have been stalled by some opposition from UEFA. The European football body contributed 12 teams to the tournament, the most of any continent, and are not convinced by the idea of adding more games and more teams due to fixture congestion. UEFA themselves recently added an extra four games to the Champions League season for teams that go through the play-off round. Then Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti had criticised the added fixture congestion of the tournament as it was last season, although he later walked his statements back.

On top of that, The Guardian report that there is growing frustration from a number of clubs at the non-payment of prize money from FIFA. They say that €212m is yet to be dispersed among the Federations in promised solidarity payments, but there is no update on when the money will be paid. Divided up, around €57.3k was due to be distributed to every top flight club around the world.

FIFA only managed to agree a TV deal with DAZN, backed by Saudi Arabia, three months before the tournament, which was worth around €900m but was aired free on the DAZN app. FIFA were also forced to slash ticket prices to around $10 (€8.50) for some games due to empty stadiums.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Roughly four months and 120 miles away from the Los Angeles-area stadium, where he will likely make his World Cup debut, Matt Freese was staying in the moment. In that particular moment, it was probably just as easy said as it was done – there were fire pits and palm trees in his line of sight, he and his New York City FC teammates trading one of the East coast's most brutal winters in recent memory for comfortable days in Palm Springs with a week and change left to go until their MLS season opener at the LA Galaxy.

It is a perfect place to settle back into the rhythms of professional soccer, but far from the only pocket of North America where the cadence is shifting. A new MLS season finally begins on Saturday, one that will keep a wide range of people busy, each of them saddled with a variety of tasks, all of it in the shadow of this summer's World Cup. The world's biggest sporting event returns to the continent for the first time since 1994, the circumstances and spotlight as different as it gets from the last time around. MLS' decision makers will have their hands full with capitalizing on an event that rarely comes to their shores, all while hoping the arrival of global superstars like Lionel Messi and Son Heung-min creates meaningful momentum along the way. They will balance those tasks with implementing the finishing touches on their switch to a fall-to-spring calendar that will be complete next year, a move that brings them in alignment with many of the sport's top leagues.

For a selection of players, though, the timing is more pressing. The start of the MLS season marks a final chance to impress national team coaches before roster selections are due in late spring, a feeling that is especially pertinent for American players. Since taking charge in October 2024, U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has picked frequently from MLS' talent pool and is slated to bring a healthy number of players from the domestic league to a World Cup on home soil. The odds of earning a role that only comes around every four years naturally vary from player to player, but they share both a common goal and the unique balancing act of club and country responsibilities in a World Cup year. In some sense, the two tasks go hand in hand.

""[I'm] incredibly grateful for that opportunity,"" Freese said about his reps with the USMNT before pivoting, ""and really, really just focused on staying as present as possible and doing as well as I can and improving every day so that I can pay them back for that trust they've shown in me.""

Freese was a regular fixture with NYCFC before he received his first call-up to the national team last January and did not earn his first cap until June, his rise up the USMNT's goalkeeper depth chart hard to predict. It happened all at once, though – successive starts en route to the Concacaf Gold Cup final and some penalty heroics along the way mean the job has been his ever since, a quick turn of events. If it has felt like a whirlwind, the 27-year-old does not show any signs of it.

""I think a lot more opportunity presented itself and a lot more minutes but it wasn't necessarily unexpected because I had been training for that and working for that moment, so that when it came, because I had faith that it would come, just to be ready for it,"" Freese said. ""It happened quickly, but it was what I had been working for and what I had been preparing for and so no, I didn't do too much reflecting on that or anything like that in the offseason.""

Heading into his eighth MLS season and his fourth as a regular starter, the new campaign will be his first with a World Cup on the horizon, which comes with a new workload – but not with new priorities in the offseason. He did not have a specialized training regimen during the winter and instead stuck to familiar patterns, including a chance to unwind after the 2025 campaign came to a close. 

""I think it would be a mistake to change the way I prepare for a season just because of the potential of such a big moment in the middle of it,"" he said. ""The first 10 days of every offseason for me and many of the guys is really just absolutely no soccer conversations, nothing – no soccer-watching, soccer playing, no working out, nothing. Either you go on vacation or you just hang out. I had been on the road – I think I was in a hotel like 170 days last year, so I didn't really want to travel. I just chilled at home in my apartment, I saw friends. I just tried to keep it as low-key as possible because I wanted the reset to be refreshing rather than tiring.""

The way his season ended, with a 5-1 defeat at Inter Miami a week before the Florida side won their first MLS Cup, keeps him just as motivated to perform for NYCFC as a chance of impressing during his first World Cup does.

""I want to win a trophy,"" he admitted. ""I look at our new sporting director, Todd [Dunivant, a four-time MLS Cup-winning player], and he has so many trophies in his cabinet and when I heard about him and quickly read up on him when he was named the sporting director, my first thought was, 'Oh my god, he has so many trophies and accomplishments,' and that example kind of shows how trophies live forever and that really just your name or your team's name in history so that is, on the club side, a massive, massive goal from me this year.""

Freese's ambitions are lofty, which only reinforces his need to stay focused on what's directly in front of him.

""I'm a pretty old-fashioned, stay in the moment-esque guy,"" he said. ""I don't use my phone a lot. I really try to just avoid the distractions that come with being a professional athlete in the 21st century and two more things. I meditate a lot. I don't sleep in the room with my phone in it. I like to be really just ingrained in what is currently and presently happening, and what currently is presently happening is I'm in preseason with my team and trying to just focus on my team and spend time with them and gel off the field and on the field and FaceTime my loved ones back home when I can.""

Getting too far ahead of himself is not his style, joking that he will reflect on his career when he's 40 and retired. It is not the only thing he's saving for a conversation a decade and change from now.

""It's a long story,"" he said apologetically in reference to a remark about penalty kicks ""being his thing"" during last summer's Gold Cup. ""I don't really want to get into it. Sorry … That's another thing, when I'm 40, I'll talk about it.""

While Freese is likely to be a headliner on a list of MLS players who will be World Cup-bound in the summertime, the league's 30 clubs are full of players who will take a very different approach to the upcoming tournament. There's Cade Cowell, a one-time U.S. youth international who is the New York Red Bulls' marquee signing ahead of a rebuilding season. Reminders of the senior national team are all around him, even if he has not been in camp for roughly two years – the World Cup is top of mind for most, while the Red Bulls' new head coach Michael Bradley comes with a decorated USMNT pedigree of his own.

""I think every American player, it's still a goal to be on the World Cup [roster] and last year, I didn't get a chance to go to any camps,"" he said. ""I know the window's tight, but it's in God's hands and whatever happens, I'm going to work my hardest to get there … When you're in the camps it's a very, very good culture. Everyone is very nice. It's very, very fun. I do miss it and it'll definitely be back.""

Pochettino's project to cast a wide net with his player pool means players like Cowell still hope for a World Cup roster spot, even if there are only 26 to go around every four years, the dream at least providing ""motivation to keep [going],"" in the player's words. Pochettino's open-door policy comes with a hint of added incentive for someone like Cowell, a winger hopes to integrate seamlessly into Bradley's version of the Red Bull way that hopes to attack quickly and settle into a defensive shape just as fast.

""I would say help defensively a little bit more, I can always do that,"" he said. ""Every attacker doesn't like to do it but it's something we have to do and finishing off plays, whether that's a shot or a cross and just making the right decision once you're in front of goal.""

Then there's LAFC captain Hugo Lloris, for whom World Cup experiences are unforgettable – and in the rearview mirror. He captained France to their World Cup triumph in 2018, took part in their run to the final in 2022 and retired from the national team soon after, now in a fully different phase of his career ahead of his third MLS season.

""I'm more relaxed than I used to be,"" he noted. ""I take football in a less intense way, I would say, and that's also one of the reasons I come to discover a new football, a new environment and in a way, I can also enjoy my time with my family so it's a good mix but I still want to compete and I still want to challenge myself but I would say in a different way. It's very different than [what] I used to face in Europe but my motivation is still the same.""

He has chosen the route of focusing solely on the club game, no small tasks ahead of him. LAFC, now under the steward of former assistant and new head coach Marc dos Santos, are angling for silverware as they balance the demands of MLS, the Concacaf Champions Cup and the Leagues Cup in 2026.

""I think we used to be really good and we developed a strong reputation the way we used to play, especially in transition, using the speed and the pace from offensive players,"" Lloris said. ""I think today we want to keep this strength but at the same time, we want to get more control of games so we try to be more in possession, try to occupy our opponents' field in a better way, so by bringing more discipline in terms of positions with and without the ball. Also, we want to keep something that we used to do well the last two years, the way we used to press the opponent, we want to keep the same philosophy but I think we just want to become more dominant and manage games in a way we really want and it doesn't matter who we are facing, who is the opponent, we just want to play in the same way.""

Lloris' World Cup days are behind him but as he contemplates at age 39 if this will be his final season as a professional, he embodies the multi-pronged approach many in North America have taken with this summer's tournament in mind. The ex-France international is an ambassador for soccer in a country that's still learning to embrace it, choosing to carry out his duties by sharing his experiences with players and other club staff eager to integrate any lessons in their day-to-day.

""For me, it's very simple,"" he said about his objectives for the year ahead. ""It's to keep enjoying football, the competition. There is no limit. I'm also here to share my experience in football so I have this responsibility to lead the youngest players in a roster. I'm here to help but the main thing is to keep enjoying my football. I know that I don't see further than next year and I don't want to see it so I just enjoy day by day.""

He is, at times, an influential observer of soccer's grip on the U.S., boasting the expertise to know what a successful run for the USMNT could mean for the sport's future in the country. Lloris, though, feels that things are already trending in the right direction.

""I really see a development,"" he said. ""I see my girls competing, playing soccer [at school] and I see parents, I will say, dedicated to the game and I think it's coming. It's growing in terms of popularity. It's growing in terms of demand and I think for the American national team, it's also a big challenge ahead of them because they [have a] responsibility, they are the face of soccer in the U.S. and they have to perform and show a great identity towards their fans but I'm quite comfortable about the future of soccer. I'm sure it will continue to grow in the U.S.""

At the start of 2026, FIFA completed its latest club competition, with Arsenal claiming the inaugural Women's Champions Cup.

FIFA made a major splash on the global club calendar last year by launching a revamped Club World Cup tournament. Chelsea emerged victorious, and FIFA rewarded those involved. The governing body allocated a total prize fund of $1 billion to generate early interest in the tournament but initially failed to attract significant commercial support. 

Broadcasters appeared disinterested until the world soccer federation was rescued by DAZN's $1 billion acquisition of global media rights to the tournament, supported by funding from Saudi Arabia.

In 2026, FIFA again turned to DAZN for media rights coverage of the Women's Champions Cup, with the OTT platform offering a global free-to-air feed to fans worldwide, supporting FIFA's goal of building excitement and viewership for its newest event. Unlike the men's Club World Cup, however, FIFA excluded DAZN's global coverage in the four home markets of participating teams. 

This led to agreements with Sky Sports in the UK, CazéTV in Brazil, and TelevisaUnivision in the United States. No domestic broadcaster was officially announced in Morocco. The rights process highlighted broader hesitation in the global market, with limited interest in FIFA's latest tournament addition, and partners announced only 13 days before the tournament began in England.

From a sponsorship perspective, the new tournament can again be linked to broader market challenges. The Champions Cup announced its first tournament-focused deal—naming Kynisca as its presenting partner—on 22 January 2026. The tournament's initial partnerships grew to only three deals by the start of the competition. Visa continued its commitment to women's soccer by joining the competition's portfolio. 

The financial services brand has built a long-term strategy around supporting women's soccer since 2018, when it became the first-ever sole sponsor of UEFA women's soccer, and again with FIFA in 2021. The third partner added to the Champions Cup was Aramco, a brand with a complicated relationship with women's soccer. 

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

In 2024, more than 100 women's soccer players wrote an open letter to FIFA urging it to end its partnership with the Saudi Arabia-based energy company. The estimated annual revenue from these deals to FIFA is $2.25 million.

The Champions Cup tournament staged its final four matches in London in 2026. Both semi-finals were played on the same day at Brentford Community Stadium, with the third-place playoff and the final held at Emirates Stadium. Attendance peaked at the final between Arsenal and Corinthians, with 25,031 spectators. 

While it is important for marquee matches to be played at the biggest and best stadiums available, the final drew only a 41.2% capacity crowd at the Emirates. This level of unused capacity is particularly notable given the recent success of the Arsenal Women's team in attracting the highest regular-season audiences in the Women's Super League. 

Attendance at the final was below Arsenal's average attendance in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season (34,110), with all matches played at the Emirates Stadium. The team drew a season-high of 56,700 for its match against Tottenham Hotspur, highlighting the potential to attract more fans to Arsenal matches in North London.

As with last year's men's FIFA Club World Cup, FIFA invested significant revenue in its prize funds to help drive interest and competitiveness among participating teams. The 2026 Champions Cup paid out $3.95 million across the six teams involved (including the two teams that did not reach the semi-finals of the competition in London). 

Of this total, $2.3 million was awarded to the inaugural champions, Arsenal. To illustrate the tournament's financial appeal, Arsenal earned just €500,000 ($590,000) for winning the 2024/25 UEFA Women's Champions League title.

Although the Champions Cup is a much smaller tournament in terms of matches, teams, and dates, its prize fund pales in comparison with FIFA's investment in its new men's tournament in 2025. The FIFA Club World Cup paid the champions, Chelsea, £85 million ($115.5 million). Meanwhile, all 32 competing clubs were guaranteed £28 million ($38 million) from the participation fee alone.

FIFA plans to launch a women's version of the Club World Cup in 2028, which is expected to feature 16 teams from around the world. To match the men's investment, FIFA would need to invest $500 million in the 2028 tournament. However, history suggests this is unlikely, as a gap remains on the path toward true equality in global soccer.

Although the new Women's Club World Cup is still two years away, FIFA has faced criticism over the proposed addition to the calendar. The criticism has focused on the suggested January 2028 dates. Clubs have raised concerns about the potential impact on domestic scheduling, with the proposed window expected to affect up to five rounds of matches in the Women's Super League. 

Despite all the initial lack of interest in its new tournaments, it appears FIFA is sticking by its greater investment in club soccer. Despite initial reservations with these tournaments, commercial streams will likely grow for FIFA as the tournaments build their status and popularity within the global soccer community. 

For FIFA, its greater involvement is about long-term success in boosting revenue streams outside the FIFA World Cup every four years.

Seven months after the Club World Cup, which ended with Chelsea's 3-0 victory over PSG, FIFA has yet to deliver the approximately 212 million euros promised to first division clubs (about 57,000 euros per club). There is no forecast for when these amounts will be allocated.

According to The Guardian, there are no signs that the entity managing world football will fail to pay this solidarity mechanism. Even so, clubs from smaller leagues are increasingly dissatisfied with the delay. The prizes for the participants have all been paid, totaling 926 million euros, but the approximately 57,000 promised are crucial for the majority of the clubs waiting, potentially representing a lifeline, writes the English newspaper.

One of the sensitive issues is the reduced likelihood that clubs from the six confederations will receive identical amounts. Additionally, some federations do not have a mechanism to distribute these funds. FIFA sources mention that regular discussions are ongoing with the confederations and clubs regarding the distribution of the money.

FIFA's late decision regarding the financing agreement for the tournament has hardly accelerated the process. It should be remembered that only in March of last year—three months before the start of the competition—were the prizes and the solidarity mechanism defined. The 926 million euros were agreed upon after DAZN, funded by Saudi Arabia, acquired the broadcasting rights and aired the games for free worldwide.

US soccer fans are furious over a major World Cup fan fest in New Jersey being axed.

The event was set to take place in the shadows of MetLife Stadium, which will host the final on July 19.

But the massive World Cup fan fest that was planned for Liberty State Park in Jersey City was stunningly ditched on Thursday.

The event was scheduled to take place from June 11 through July 19.

But New Jersey scrapped the plans and instead revealed it will launch a $5 million community initiative to spread the soccer festivities around the state.

“From fan zones to neighborhood watch parties to street fairs, we are investing in the communities and small businesses that make New Jersey extraordinary,” Gov. Mikie Sherrill wrote in an X post.

The money will go towards major fan zones and community watch parties, and festivals.

Fans have shared their disappointment over the fan fest decision.

“As a JC resident, this is devastating news,” one wrote on X.

“that's terrible. this is a great location for a fanfest,” another said.

“PLEASE TELL ME THIS A JOKE,” a third added.

A spokesperson for Jersey City shared a statement following the cancellation reveal.

“The Governor made the right call. It became increasingly clear that there was no workable, cost-effective way to manage the influx of tens of thousands of fans into Liberty State Park, while maintaining access to the members of the Jersey City community,” wrote communications director Nathaniel Styer.

The fan fest cancellation decision came just four months before the start of the World Cup.

Tickets at the cost of $10 had been on sale to fans before the axing.

Those fans who had purchased tickets will receive refunds, per multiple reports.

Thursday's announcement didn't share why the Liberty State Park fan fest was eliminated.

Fan fests with big video screens have been a part of each World Cup's organization since 2006.

“That is going to be the one fan fest, I believe, across the country that is going to be up and running for all games of the World Cup as opposed to just the games that are happening in our region,” Tammy Murphy, wife of of then New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and chair of the New York/New Jersey host committee's directors, said previously at the time the fan fest was announced in a press conference.

Endrick has five goals in six games for Lyon on loan from Real Madrid Olivier Chassignole/AFP via Getty Images

Endrick has had quite the start to life on loan at Lyon.

Since arriving from Real Madrid in the recent winter transfer window, the 19-year-old forward has made six appearances for the French club, scoring five goals and providing two assists. He picked up the Player of the Match award after getting the winner on his debut and has now also been named Player of the Month in Ligue 1, the top division of the game in France.

Advertisement

Endrick started this season with one thing on his mind: staying with and succeeding at Madrid, where he arrived from Palmeiras in his homeland of Brazil in July 2024, just after turning 18, in a deal worth an initial €35million (£30.6m/$41.2m at the current rates) and up to €25m more in potential add-ons. Around €50m of that has already been paid.

That plan changed in mid-October when, given the lack of opportunities he was getting under Madrid's then head coach Xabi Alonso, a loan to Lyon emerged as a potential option.

Alonso had already told the teenager in the summer that it would be difficult for him to get regular playing time in his Madrid side, with Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior, two of the biggest names in world football, ahead of him in the pecking order. However, Endrick, who is very confident in his potential, insisted on staying.

His start to 2025-26 with Madrid was not helped by a setback in his recovery from a hamstring injury suffered late last season, which allowed academy graduate Gonzalo Garcia to step up to the first-team squad to take his place. After finishing as joint-top goalscorer at the Club World Cup, Gonzalo was promoted to the senior setup on a permanent basis and given a new and improved contract. The 21-year-old has gone on to make 27 appearances for Madrid this season, scoring six times — while Endrick only played 99 minutes across three matches, making his sole start against third-tier opposition in the Copa del Rey.

When Endrick was again an unused substitute while Gonzalo was introduced from the bench in a La Liga fixture against Getafe on October 19, the player decided to listen to close advisers who were recommending a loan move in the winter window.

There was, however, some division over the idea at Madrid. This was a player they had managed to sign despite rival interest from Barcelona, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain — and had paid that €50m, a figure which could still rise. Some at the club could not understand why Alonso was not giving him more playing time, and there was an increasing concern over potential stagnation if that continued.

Sources familiar with the situation — speaking anonymously to protect relationships, like all those consulted for this article — say many clubs showed interest in Endrick, but once Lyon took the lead, the player did not want to hear from any others. He saw it as the best option for him to continue growing as a player.

Lyon made him feel from the outset that he would have a very important role with them. Their Portuguese head coach Paulo Fonseca was key to this, as was the number of Brazilians to have enjoyed successful spells there down the years, a list including Sonny Anderson, Juninho Pernambucano, Edmilson, Michel Bastos, Bruno Guimaraes and Lucas Paqueta.

As at Madrid, Endrick would wear the No 9 shirt, which is always special for a striker.

By November, a simple loan for the rest of the season — with no option to buy attached — was almost wrapped up. Only a serious injury to one of Madrid's established forwards would have caused it to be called off.

A clause that was included in the agreement also helped to suggest that Lyon's good intentions would be translated into action.

The Athletic revealed in early January that Lyon could pay up to €1million for Endrick but for every five games he starts for them, that fee will be reduced by €200,000. So if he were to start 25 times, they would pay Madrid nothing at all.

The 14-time Brazil international arrived in Lyon, France's third biggest city, at the end of December with a large entourage, including some who have been with him since he was a young teenager. He also brought along Guido Spirandelli, a physiotherapist he had been working with at Madrid — a move that was the player's idea rather than the club's. His team includes a nutritionist, a chef, a social-media consultant and a media consultant, as Endrick himself told The Athletic in December 2023.

He was unable to make his debut against Monaco in Ligue 1 on January 3, as under French football's regulations a player has to wait four days from a transfer being registered before they can feature for their new club, but the wait proved worth it. He instead made his first appearance on January 11 in the Coupe de France, starting, playing 72 minutes and scoring what proved the winner in a 2-1 victory at Lille in the round of 32.

As was the case in Madrid, where he was nicknamed ‘Bobby', after mentioning Manchester United and England great and 1966 World Cup winner Sir Bobby Charlton when talking about his idols in an interview, Endrick has settled perfectly into the Lyon dressing room. Able to speak Portuguese, Spanish, English and some French, he has adapted quickly — and the goals have followed.

His impressive start to life in Ligue 1 will surely have moved him closer to his target of representing Brazil at the World Cup this summer.

The 2-0 home win against Nice on Sunday was Lyon's 13th victory in a row in all competitions, a remarkable run dating back to early December. Endrick was suspended for that game, having been sent off in a 1-0 defeat of Nantes the previous weekend — the only low point of his short time at Lyon.



An initial straight red card was later downgraded to a second yellow, though. That means he will be available to face seventh-placed Strasbourg on Sunday, with visitors Lyon currently third in the table, seven points behind leaders Lens.

“Endrick has adapted to the club very well and very quickly,” Lyon's technical director Matthieu Louis-Jean tells The Athletic.

“Endrick isn't here by chance. We absolutely needed a No 9 capable of giving us a real attacking boost, and we believed that Lyon was a very good environment for the development of a young striker of his level. The idea was simple: it has to be a win-win situation for him and Lyon.

“We've noticed an ‘Endrick effect' on shirt sales since his announcement in December, which intensified once he started playing. As for social media, we've gained more than a million followers across all our platforms.”

Madrid have been delighted with his performances, although they are keeping their distance.

Sources say contact with Endrick and Lyon has been minimal, and that nothing happening with him in France has been influenced by his parent club — including his increased use on the right wing, where he would perhaps fit into the team more easily when he's back at the Bernabeu.

Madrid are counting on him for next season, although his situation will be reviewed in the summer. Endrick is under contract until 2030 and his priority is to succeed with the Spanish giants, but at the same time he wants real opportunities to show his qualities.

His presence, or otherwise, at the upcoming World Cup may have an influence on this.

Sources close to both Brazil coach Carlo Ancelotti and Endrick explain that, although his chances of being called up for two friendlies in the next international window against France (March 26) and Croatia (March 31), both in the United States, have increased considerably after this move to Lyon, no decision or communication has yet been made. He was not part of the two previous Brazil squads in October and November and hasn't played for his country since last March.

“Endrick is really motivated,” Lyon coach Fonseca tells The Athletic. “Everyone knows he wants to be in the Brazil team, and he understands how important it is to perform here to achieve this goal. I think he suffered a little with too much attention from the opponents in these last games, but also we cannot forget that he's a young player and there's big pressure — everyone speaks about Endrick.

“I'm trying to keep him balanced, humble and responsible. To help him understand that he can help the team — but also that the team can help him. He's a very good kid, he works hard. He's a unique talent and, if he continues to focus, he will have a great future.”

Lawrence will welcome the Algerian men's national soccer team, serving as its official base camp for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Lawrence 2026 announced in a press release Thursday that the North African team will use Lawrence as its home base for the World Cup. The Algerian national team will play in the fifth FIFA World Cup in its history, with its last appearance coming in 2026. The team will train at Rock Chalk Park, according to Jason Booker, deputy athletic director for the University of Kansas.

Ruth DeWitt, director of community relations for Explore Lawrence, the city's convention and visitors bureau, said Lawrence has been preparing to welcome visitors for the past year and a half, and she is happy the players, staff, family and fans of the Algerian men's team will use the city as its “home away from home” this summer.

“We all join in saying, ‘Welcome home, Algeria,'” DeWitt said.

Lawrence had long been aiming to get a national team to choose the city as a base camp. As the Journal-World reported, Lawrence was included in FIFA's official list as a potential base camp in June 2024, with plans that teams would train at the University of Kansas's Rock Chalk Park and stay at the Oread Hotel, 1200 Oread Ave.

In January 2025, a Unified Command structure was formalized for Douglas County organizations to coordinate preparations for the tournament. It formed Lawrence 2026 as part of its efforts to bring together individuals and organizations from across Douglas County to address logistics for an influx of thousands of visitors drawn by the base camp and the nearby matches.

Booker said he and KU Athletics were thrilled with the various partners helping organize the effort to bring a national team to Lawrence and Rock Chalk Park, which he said many countries visiting the region scouting base camps called a “world-class facility.” The Algerian team will train and prepare at the facility during the tournament, and he is excited that KU and Lawrence will be put into the global spotlight.

“This summer offers a tremendous opportunity to showcase the broader university, Lawrence, Douglas County and our surrounding region,” Booker said. “I am very appreciative of the tremendous collaboration across all parties to make this a reality.”

Algeria is one of four countries that will use the greater Kansas City area as their home base for the World Cup. The Netherlands, England and Argentina had previously announced their national teams will use facilities around the region during their stay in the tournament, which will take place from June 11 to July 19 across multiple cities in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Algeria is one of the four teams in Group J, which features the reigning World Cup winners Argentina, Austria and Jordan. Algeria is scheduled to play two matches at Arrowhead Stadium during the group stage: the first match against Argentina on June 16 at 8 p.m., and the final game of group stage play on June 27 at 9 p.m. In between those matches, Algeria will play against Jordan at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on June 22.

Lawrence 2026 said now that Algeria has chosen the city as a base camp, the group will “zero in on the particular needs ­- linguistic, cultural and otherwise — of fans and players” in its preparations.","{'href': 'https://www2.kusports.com', 'title': 'KU Sports'}","soccer"

NEW YORK -- The New York and New Jersey World Cup host committee has canceled its fan festival that had been planned to be held at Liberty State Park in Jersey City.

The committee scrapped plans for the weekslong festival that would have been held about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, where the final will be played on July 19.

The FanFest was announced in February 2025 by Tammy Murphy, wife of then-New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and chair of the New York/New Jersey host committee's directors, who said it would be open for all 104 matches of the tournament, which starts June 11.

The committee said in a statement Friday an ""expanded network of fan zones and community celebrations across 21 counties in New Jersey will serve as a cornerstone of the region's official fan engagement program.""

Mikie Sherrill, Murphy's successor as governor, announced a $5 million initiative Thursday to fund community World Cup initiatives.

Tickets for the FanFest had been put on sale in December.

Plans for a FanFest in New York City's Corona Park in Queens did not move forward. One is now planed for the U.S. Tennis Association's Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens from June 17-28 and a fan village is scheduled for Manhattan's Rockefeller Center from July 4-19.

Fan fests with large video screens have been a part of each World Cup's organization since 2006.

FIFA is running the World Cup itself unlike in the past, when a local organizing committee was in charge of logistics. The host committees are limited to sponsorship agreements in categories not reserved by FIFA.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Kirsty Coventry says the organisation will investigate if IOC member Gianni Infantino breached the terms of its charter when attending the inaugural meeting of The Board of Peace, which was established by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Infantino, the president of football's world governing body FIFA, appeared at the meeting in Washington D.C. on Thursday, flanked by politicans and sporting a red hat with ‘USA' on the front and the numbers ‘45-47' — a reference to Trump's non-consecutive presidencies.

Infantino also used the occasion to announce that FIFA had signed what he described as “a landmark partnership ⁠agreement” with The Board of Peace, which was meeting primarily to discuss plans to rebuild Gaza.

“I wasn't aware of that, that we had an IOC member front and centre,” Coventry told a press conference during Winter Olympic Games in Milan-Cortina, when asked about the hat and Infantino's presence.

“Now that you guys (journalists) made us aware of it we will go back and have a look at it. The IOC Charter is very clear what it expects of its members. We will go and research into the alleged signing of documents.”

The IOC's charter states that members must act independently of political and commercial interests, and cannot accept “from governments, organisations, or other parties, any mandate or instructions liable to interfere with the freedom of their action and vote”.

“I think from the IOC's point of view we will continue to be politically neutral,” Coventry added. “That's the only way for us as an organisation to ensure that we allow for there to be fairness on the field of play. That's what we will continue to do as we walk into the future.”

Infantino has allied himself closely with Trump since the latter's return to office in January 2025, and in December awarded him the inaugral ‘FIFA Peace Prize' at the World Cup draw in Washington, D.C.

In November, Infantino was accused of a “clear violation” of FIFA's own statutes on neutrality by Miguel Maduro — a former chairman of FIFA's Governance Committee — after appearing to endorse Trump's political agenda. The Swiss had said during a speech in Miami that “we should all support what he (Trump) is doing”.

The following month, FairSquare — a a non-profit organisation and advocacy group — made an official complaint to FIFA's Ethics Committee, alleging “repeated breaches” of FIFA's duty of political neutrality by Infantino.

All four of the alleged breaches outlined by FairSquare related to Infantino's relationship with Trump, including the decision to award him FIFA's Peace Prize.

FIFA wants to build 50 mini-pitches near schools and residential areas in Gaza, five full-size pitches across multiple districts, a state-of-the-art FIFA academy ⁠and a new 20,000-seat national stadium in the territory, the governing body said.

It's not just athletes who will be winning when the FIFA World Cup kicks off this summer. You could score a financial win if you want to be an Airbnb host.

Turning your home into a short-term rental for the World Cup could net you some decent cash, and now Airbnb is offering a bonus to anyone who lists their ""whole home"" on the site through the end of July.

Under Airbnb's offer, new entire home hosts in any of the 16 World Cup host cities in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. who welcome their first guests between now and July 31, 2026, are eligible to receive $750.

Stream NBC10 Boston news for free, 24/7, wherever you are.

""We're seeing a huge amount of demand for the World Cup and for using Airbnbs during the World Cup,"" Airbnb spokesperson Kevin Munoz said.

Airbnb's chief business officer says this bonus is the ""biggest new host incentive ever."" There are specific zip codes that qualify in the Boston, Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island, area, so you'll need to check that.

Airbnb is a FIFA World Cup partner.

""We know a lot of people are going to come to Boston, to New York, New Jersey, to all of these cities, and they want to come with their family and friends. So we think it's really important that we offer that flexibility,"" Munoz said. ""And so with all of that demand, we really want to make sure that more people are participating in the Airbnb tourism economy.""

NBC10 Boston took a look and found some homes already available, some billing themselves as ""World Cup basecamps."" You could pay anywhere from a couple hundred dollars a night to a couple thousand per night.

Of course there are other companies that facilitate short-term rentals, and we took a look at some others and found plenty of expensive stays available.

If you do list, just be sure to check to see if your town allows short-term rentals. Some have restrictions, including Foxboro, Mass.

Bayern Munich boss Vincent Kompany has criticised Benfica manager Jose Mourinho for bringing Eusebio's name into the Vinicius Junior racism row that has been sparked on the back of an eventful Champions League clash at Estadio da Luz. Ex-Real Madrid coach Mourinho has sought to defend his player, Gianluca Prestianni, and Portuguese supporters.

Brazil international Vinicius scored a stunning goal in Lisbon as Real took control of a keenly-contested knockout phase play-off clash. He celebrated in front of agitated home supporters after finding the top corner.

The South American superstar was booked, much to his disgust, before returning to his own half of the field. After lining up opposite Argentine winger Prestianni, Vinicius raced towards the match referee to report allegations of racist comments being aimed in his direction - with a European rival covering his mouth with his shirt in order to avoid having his lips read.

The game was halted for 10 minutes, with Benfica boss Mourinho whispering into the ear of Vinicius at one stage. Quizzed afterwards on what he said, the 63-year-old told reporters: “I told [Vinicius], when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. 

“When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person in the history of this club [Eusebio] was black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist. If in his mind there was something in relation to that, this is Benfica.”

Mourinho's statement attracted plenty of criticism, with the former Chelsea and Manchester United manager being accused by Dutch legend Clarence Seedorf - who was on punditry duty for Amazon Prime Video - of trying to “justify racial abuse”.

Ex-Manchester City star Kompany, who is now in charge of Bundesliga title holders Bayern, has given his take on more unfortunate scenes and comments, with alleged racism in football generating headlines across the world.

The Belgian said: “It's a difficult topic. I watched the game and was really intrigued by it. There are two different components to the story. First, what happened on the pitch - second, what happened with the fans as well. And then there's what happened after the game. We need to separate them. 

“When you watch the action itself and how Vini reacted, that reaction cannot be faked. You can see it was an emotional reaction. I don't see any benefit for him to go to the referee and put all this misery on his shoulders. In that moment he saw that it was the right thing to do.

“Kylian Mbappe normally always stays diplomatic, but he was very clear about what he saw and heard. Then there's the Benfica player who was hiding what he was saying in his shirt. In the stadium you can see there were people doing monkey signs, it's in the video. And for me, what happened after the game is even worse. 

“Jose Mourinho has basically attacked the character of Vini Jr by bringing in the type of Vini's celebration to discredit what he was doing at that moment. It was a huge mistake in terms of leadership. 

“On top of that, Mourinho mentioned the name of Eusebio. He said Benfica cannot be racist because their best ever player was Eusebio. Do you know what black players had to go through in the 60s? Was he there to travel with Eusebio every away game and see what he went through. To use his name today to make a point about Vini Jr. 

“To be honest, I don't actually see my place in a lot of things that are happening today, so I don't want to be part of one group or the other. I met 100 people who worked with Jose Mourinho. I've never heard someone say something bad about Jose. All his players love him. 

“I understand the person he is, I understand he fights for his club. I know deep down he's a good person. I don't need to judge him on that. But I also know what I've heard. I understand what he's done, but he made a mistake. Hopefully it won't happen again in the future, and we can move on together.”

Vinicius Junior is said to have found Jose Mourinho's response to the racism allegations that he levelled against Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni “repulsive”. Former Real Madrid manager Mourinho spoke with Brazil international Vinicius during an unscheduled break in play at Estadio da Luz. The Portuguese refused to condemn his player afterwards, leading to widespread criticism of the so-called ‘Special One'.

A Champions League knockout phase play-off encounter in Lisbon was brought to a halt early in the second half. Blancos superstar Vinicius opened the scoring when firing into the top corner.

He riled the home support when celebrating by the corner flag, leading to a yellow card being flashed in his direction and tempers in the Benfica to become frayed. Angry words were exchanged before Vinicius returned to his half of the field.

Before the game could be resumed, Prestianni - with his shirt being pulled up over his mouth - said something to Vinicius. The South American raced off towards the match referee and claimed to have been subjected to racist comments. UEFA protocols were then followed over the course of a 10-minute delay.

Benfica expressed their support for Prestianni afterwards, with the Argentine winger saying in a post-match statement: “I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard. I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.”

Vinicius said in a statement of his own - having been backed on the field by club colleague Kylian Mbappe - “Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to show how weak they are. But they have the protection of others who, theoretically, have an obligation to punish them. Nothing that happened today is new in my life or in my team's life. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, it was just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.”

Mourinho spoke with Vinicius at the time of the incident, before receiving a red card himself, and told reporters afterwards: “Regretful for what? I've spoken with both of them. Vinicius says one thing, and Prestianni says another. I don't want to be ‘red'… and I don't want to say that I 100% support Prestianni; but I can't be ‘white' and say that what Vinicius told me is the truth. I can't, I don't know; only that up until the goal, it was a great match.

“I already said it in the flash interview, and I've tried to be more balanced than [Alvaro] Arbeloa and Mbappe. It's not that I want to say Vinicius is a liar and mine is an incredible kid. They've gone down a different path. It happens in so many stadiums, and it's always the same thing… Something's not working. Vinicius scored a fantastic goal. Why didn't he celebrate like Eusebio, Pele, or [Alfredo] Di Stefano? Why didn't he? The game was over with that play.”

Spanish news outlet El Chiringuito claim that Vinicius has been left angered by Mourinho's comments. He cannot understand how his goal celebrations could be considered “provocative” and finds the narrow-mindedness of a vastly-experienced coach to be “repulsive”.

UEFA have opened an investigation into what went on, alongside the Portuguese government, with a verdict expected to be delivered shortly - which could lead to sanctions being handed out.

Mourinho will already be serving a touchline ban when Benfica head to Santiago Bernabeu for their return date with Real next Wednesday. He is likely to be quizzed on the Prestianni incident again before and after that encounter.

Vinicius' stunning strike at Estadio da Luz was the only goal of the game during a keenly-contested first leg, meaning that Real hold a narrow lead as they attempt to secure safe progress into the last-16 of elite European competition.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Marmoush truly announced his arrival at City with a stunning hat-trick in a 4-0 rout of Newcastle in just his third match following his £63 million move from Eintracht Frankfurt a year ago, and he was similarly ruthless in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg earlier this month, scoring twice in the space of 22 minutes to put the tie out of the Magpies' sight and rubber stamp City's trip to Wembley to face Arsenal.

But leaving aside his impressive record against Newcastle, Marmoush is yet to really justify his price tag. He has only started four Premier League games this season, and while that low number has a lot to do with Egyot reaching the semi-finals of the African Cup of Nations and missing more than a month due to a knee injury, it is also a sign of how difficult it is to compete for a City starting berth with Erling Haaland.

Marmoush now faces more competition for his place following Antoine Semenyo's January arrival, and the former Bournemouth forward has hit the ground running, scoring more goals in his first month at City than Marmoush has managed all season. So, as the business end of the season approaches, it is time for the real Marmoush to stand up and start providing his share of the goals City need to secure silverware.

Marmoush was an obvious choice to boost City's flailing attack amid their terrible run of results in the first part of last season, having scored 19 goals and provided 11 assists for Eintracht Frankfurt. He was thrown straight into City's line-up, too, starting 14 of their 16 remaining league games of the season while appearing in four of their five FA Cup matches, including starts in the semi-final and final. 

For the most part, he shared the attack with Haaland, apart from during the Norwegian's five-week absence with an ankle injury, and in addition to his treble against Newcastle, Marmoush hit the net against Brighton, Leicester City, Crystal Palace and twice against Bournemouth, scoring the winner in the FA Cup quarter-final tie with the Cherries before later landing an outrageous rocket in May which was named Premier League Goal of the Season. 

The only negative note came when Marmoush was denied from the penalty spot by Dean Henderson in the FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace, though Haaland earned more criticism for shirking responsibility at Wembley.

""Last season when he arrived he was unbelievable for two or three months,"" Guardiola said of Marmoush's impact when speaking in January. ""Without him, it would have been impossible to achieve qualification for the Champions League or reach the FA Cup final. He is a special player, not old, not young, but has margin to improve and a sense of goal [with] dynamic energy in his runs, which is really good.""

Guardiola, not for the first time, was being brutally honest with his assessment, and it is fair to say that Marmoush has struggled to live up to his thrilling start to life in England. He has scored only one Premier League goal this season, against Wolves, with his other three strikes coming in the Carabao Cup. 

What should be more concerning for the forward is that he has been called upon so rarely. Marmoush went more than four months without starting a league game, only getting his chance when Guardiola would make sweeping changes to his line-up while otherwise having to make do with a smattering of minutes from the bench. 

While last season the coach saw no problem with playing Marmoush alongside Haaland, for much of this campaign it seemed as if he would pick one or the other. And with the Norwegian scoring 25 goals between August and December, there was really only going to be one winner in that battle.

But while Marmoush was at the AFCON, Haaland became worn out by being City's only available striker, going nine matches without scoring from open play. The team's form dipped too as they failed to win any of their first four league games of 2026. 

Marmoush has subsequently grown in importance since returning from international duty, playing in all eight of City's matches across all competitions, including making five starts. He was surprisingly named in the starting line-up at Liverpool alongside Haaland, and started with him against Galatasaray too, although he did not cover himself in glory in either game and was taken off each time.

His best displays in this run have come when playing up front alone, against Wolves and Newcastle.

It was telling that when Guardiola praised Marmoush after the Wolves game, he emphasised that he saw the Egyptian as ""more of a striker than a proper winger"". Marmoush has, however, tended to operate on the left of City's 4-1-4-1 shape when playing with Haaland, while only leading the line when the Norwegian has been left out. 

His hopes of locking down a role out wide have been rocked by Semenyo, who has started the last five games in the Premier League and been in terrific form, posting five goals and two assists in his nine appearances thus far. The Ghana forward can play on the left and right, while he also played in a front two with Haaland against Fulham.

It says a lot of the ruthlessness at City that Marmoush has been usurped by another new arrival just one year after joining, while the imminent returns from injury of Savinho and Jeremy Doku are set to create more competition in forward areas. That is great news for City as they compete to win four trophies over the next three-and-a-half months, but it begs the question whether Marmoush can step up or if he will be left back on the bench, which in turn could lead to him following Julian Alvarez's lead in being a Haaland back-up who wants to leave.

It will come down to whether Marmoush's main ambition is to be part of an ultra-competitive team that fights for every title or whether he wants to make a name for himself. Given City's embarrassment of attacking riches, his work is cut out if he wants to achieve the latter, but claiming silverware could yet appease him.

""I cannot deny I want to win trophies,"" he said upon arriving at the Etihad. ""City have been the most successful club in England for many, many years, so I know I am joining a winning environment and winning culture. I want to learn from the staff and my team-mates, and I want to become a valued member of this winning team.""

Marmoush had the misfortune to join City during only one of two trophy-less seasons under Guardiola, but there is a renewed hunger around the squad and a clear belief that they can continue to chase down Arsenal in the title race. And Newcastle, City's next obstacle on that journey, just happen to be Marmoush's favourite opponent.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly facing further enforcement action from bailiffs as the legal dispute with Kylian Mbappe takes another bitter turn. Despite a court order demanding over €60 million, a multi-million euro discrepancy remains unpaid, Mbappe insists. The Real Madrid star's legal team is now prepared to seize the remaining funds as the club misses its final deadline.

The high-profile legal fallout between PSG and their former talisman, Mbappe, has escalated following the club's failure to fully comply with a December 2025 court ruling. While the French giants have made significant strides in settling the debt, a €2m shortfall has prompted the player's legal team to threaten a second visit from bailiffs to the club's administrative offices, according to L'Equipe.

The dispute stems from a ruling by the Paris industrial tribunal which ordered PSG to pay a total of €60m to the Madrid forward. This figure covers unpaid wages, signing bonuses and accrued interest from the final months of his tenure in the French capital. Although PSG initially settled the primary €55m sum, they only recently added a further €4m following a physical intervention by enforcement officers, leaving the final balance outstanding.

Despite the pressure, the club maintains that its financial obligations have been met in full, citing technicalities regarding tax and social security. A spokesperson for PSG stated that ""all sums due to Mbappe have been paid by the club,"" explaining that the current discrepancy is simply down to ""the amount of employee social security contributions.""

This financial tug-of-war has become a matter of public image for the Ligue 1 champions. Reports suggest that PSG are desperately attempting to negotiate a deal with Mbappe to avoid a humiliating court-mandated penalty. The tribunal's judgment included a clause requiring the club to publish the full text of the legal defeat on the home page of their official website for an entire month.

Mbappe's camp has remained firm, showing no intention of waiving the publication requirement or the remaining €2m. This steadfastness has left the PSG hierarchy in a precarious position as they balance their legal defense with the risk of further public embarrassment. The club had until February 19 to file an official appeal against the comprehensive ruling, a deadline that has kept both parties on edge.

The breakdown of the verdict highlights the scale of the financial commitment PSG failed to honour. The court established the France captain's gross reference salary at a staggering €11.8m per month. According to the judgment, the player was entitled to €36.6m gross ""as a reminder of the third instalment of the signing bonus,"" along with a further €3.6m in associated holiday pay.

The industrial tribunal's decision left very little room for interpretation regarding the back-pay owed for the player's final quarter at the club. The court awarded the 26-year-old €17.2m gross ""as a reminder of salaries for the months of April, May and June 2024,"" plus an additional €1.7m in ""paid leave"" for that same period.

Furthermore, the judge ordered the payment of €1.5m ""as an ethics bonus for the months of April, May, and June 2024"" and €150,000 in associated holiday pay. To round off the financial blow to the Parisian side, the court also mandated that PSG cover €5,000 in legal costs incurred by the player's legal team during the proceedings.

This series of rulings represents a definitive defeat for the PSG hierarchy, who had previously argued that Mbappe agreed to waive these bonuses when he was sidelined from the squad in 2023. These arguments have consistently failed to hold up under scrutiny, with the industrial tribunal becoming the second independent body to side with the player over the club's management.

As the legal teams continue to squabble in the boardroom, the focus of both parties has returned to the pitch, albeit under the shadow of litigation. Les Parisiens must decide whether to continue challenging the court's decision in a higher court or ultimately settle the balance to avoid further bailiff intervention. On the pitch, PSG are currently trying to reclaim the top spot in Ligue 1 from Lens, who are one point ahead at the top. Luis Enrique's team face Metz at home on Saturday.

For Mbappe, the focus remains on finishing the season strongly with Madrid. Los Blancos currently lead La Liga by two points over Barcelona and face Osasuna on Saturday. After that, they will prepare for the second leg of their Champions League knockout playoff against Benfica next week. However, the French international's legal team is expected to pursue seizure of funds if the €2 million remains unpaid.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'A load of rubbish!'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/rubbish-anthony-gordon-arsenal-liverpool-transfer-links-newcastle/blt4fc34caf9a348f31","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 07:42:53 GMT","

Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon has branded rumours linking him with moves to Arsenal or Liverpool as a “load of rubbish”. The England international has been making headlines again after registering four goals for the Magpies in their 6-1 Champions League mauling of Qarabag. Transfer talk has resurfaced, but the 24-year-old forward is paying no attention to that gossip.

It is not the first time that Gordon has found himself at the centre of speculation. He saw a return to his Merseyside roots discussed just 18 months after completing a £40 million ($54m) switch to St James' Park in January 2023.

Everton academy graduate Gordon grew up as a Liverpool supporter and has never shied away from the fact that he would like to don a famous red jersey, having been released by Anfield-based heavyweights at the age of 11.

He has previously conceded that a failed move to Merseyside in 2024 - a summer that included his first major tournament as a senior international - messed with his head and left him seeking a break from the stresses of professional football.

Gordon told the Daily Mail: “It was difficult for me because one, I had the Euros, which was horrendous for me mentally. I was there but I wasn't playing. Then I had the transfer stuff. With PSR [profit and sustainability rules], I thought I was going to leave at some point in the window. It didn't happen. I had to get my head around that [idea of joining Liverpool] to begin with, and then to get my head around it again [when it didn't happen] was hard. I'm a human being. It's really difficult.”

Gordon is attracting admiring glances again, with Premier League leaders Arsenal said to form part of an ever-growing list of suitors. They will have been impressed by the jet-heeled winger's four-goal salvo against Qarabag.

A man hoping to make another England squad this summer for the 2026 World Cup is, however, turning a deaf ear and blind eye to any reports of a big-money transfer being lined up.

He said when asked about his future: “It's the same old, same old. I haven't heard anything, they might want to tell me before they tell you (the media). I have gone through enough transfer stuff now to know that it is all a load of rubbish.

“I am focused on me and focused on the team, I am focused on right now. You look too far in the future and you start to underperform. And believe me I have done that (before) and I am not going to do that now.”

Gordon is fully focused on his performances for Newcastle, as he faces fierce competition for places in Eddie Howe's side. A stunning outing against Qarabag saw him reach 10 goals for the season in European competition, and 14 in total.

He believes he could have left Azerbaijan with two match balls, having squandered a couple of opportunities, and makes no apologies for taking two penalties against Qarabag - having briefly argued with Kieran Trippier when refusing to give up the second of his spot-kicks, when he had already completed his hat-trick.

Gordon added on his goal-getting exploits: “I should have scored more – I should have had six goals. I missed two chances that I should score. I don't want to call them easy but they were chances that I should score. I am always looking for more. I scored four but I am that type of person, I am not fully happy with what I have achieved, it should have been six, maybe next time.”

Newcastle are all but guaranteed a place in the last-16 of Champions League action, ahead of a return date with Qarabag on Tyneside next week, and are also into the FA Cup fifth round - where they will face Manchester City.

A top seven finish in the Premier League is also there to be shot at, which would confirm European qualification for next season, and the Magpies will be back on a domestic stage when taking in a trip to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday - where they will once again face title-chasing City.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 There will be plenty of elite singles firepower in the doubles draw at next month's BNP Paribas Open, with teams accepted into the draw including Daniil Medvedev and Learner Tien, Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Sebastian Korda, and Alex de Minaur and John Peers.

Medvedev and Tien is an eye-catching duo, given their budding Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry (Tien leads 3-1). The American shed light on their partnership Thursday at the Delray Beach Open.

""I think his coach texted my coach last minute, maybe the day before the deadline. I said, 'Sure', I thought it would be fun and so I'm looking forward to it,"" Tien said. ""It was kind of random, because I don't think he plays that much doubles and neither do I, so I think we'll just go out and have fun.""

 Six of the Top 10 players in the PIF ATP Rankings have entered the doubles field at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells. World No. 2 Jannik Sinner and the big-serving American Reilly Opelka are currently alternates, and will need a wild card to enter the draw because their combined ranking of 71 was not high enough to make the cut.

 Sinner holds a 26-25 tour-level doubles record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The 24-year-old Italian lifted his only ATP Tour doubles trophy so far with Opelka in Atlanta in 2021. 



 Alexander Zverev and good friend Marcelo Melo, his regular doubles partner, are also alternates. The pair reached a Masters 1000 final in Monte-Carlo in 2024. Ben Shelton and fellow American Emilio Nava will also require a wild card.  

 Regular doubles pairings that will headline the field in Indian Wells include Australian Open champions Christian Harrison and Neal Skupski, Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos, Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool and defending champions Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic.

Losses have been rare for Jannik Sinner in recent years. That is why when the Italian does fall short, it grabs plenty of people's attention.

Jakub Mensik, last year's Miami champion, upset the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 Thursday in the Qatar ExxonMobil Open quarter-finals. This was straight off the back of a semi-final defeat to Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open.

It had been a year and a half since Sinner lost before the final at two consecutive tournaments. It last happened in 2024 at Wimbledon and at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Montreal (both quarter-finals).

Sinner is now 138-14 since the start of the 2024 season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, giving him an astonishing 90.8 winning percentage during that period. For context, Novak Djokovic owns the best tour-level winning percentage on record at 83.3 per cent.

Since Sinner lost in the Montreal quarter-finals in 2024, he has played 19 tournaments and made the final in 15 of them, lifting 10 trophies. His five championship-match defeats came against Carlos Alcaraz.

So while Sinner has now lost in consecutive events before the final, that speaks to his consistency in recent years. Mensik will play Arthur Fils Friday for a place in the Doha final.

Thursday's Play has resumed at the Rio Open presented by Claro after a second rain delay. 

Following about an hour-long wait, Joao Fonseca will play Ignacio Buse on Quadra Guga Kuerten. Matteo Berrettini vs. Dusan Lajovic was scheduled to follow but was moved to Quadra 1. 

The first delay happened for approximately 45 minutes when Tomas Martin Etcheverry was three points from victory against Vilius Gaubas at 7-6(1), 5-3 15/15. The Argentine returned to seal a 7-6(1), 6-4 win.

Ignacio Buse spoiled Joao Fonseca's pursuit of home glory at the Rio Open presented by Claro on Thursday when he upset the Brazilian 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 in the second round.

Despite losing the first set in the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, Buse eventually capitalised on Fonseca's 43 unforced errors to triumph in a two-hour, 26-minute battle. With the victory, he became the first Peruvian to reach an ATP 500 quarter-final since the series was introduced in 2009.

""Today was a really difficult match,"" Buse said. ""We all know the potential that Joao has. We are really close friends. So that was also hard today.""

One year ago, Buse was No. 230 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Now the 21-year-old is at a career-high No. 91 and on the rise.

""I tried to deal with the pressure the best that I can,"" Buse said. ""I did it well today. And next time if I do it bad, I will learn and try to do it better.""

In a match delayed by an hour due to rain, Buse kept his composure under pressure. He crucially saved eight of the nine break points he faced, including three in the opening game of the second set and three at 4-3 in the third set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. The Peruvian fired his eighth ace to complete the upset and advance to the biggest quarter-final of his career, in which he will face Matteo Berrettini.

Berrettini also earned a hard-fought three-set win in the second round, defeating Dusan Lajovic 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 in two hours and nine minutes. With the win, the Italian reached his first tour-level quarter-final on clay since claiming his last title in Kitzbuhel in 2024. 





In other action, eighth seed Tomas Martin Etcheverry advanced to the last eight with a 7-6(1), 6-4 win over Lithuanian qualifier Vilius Gaubas, who was aiming to reach his first tour-level quarter-final. 

Etcheverry was forced to navigate late drama in the second set when he missed a match point on Gaubas' serve while leading 5-2. The Argentine then stepped up to serve for the match, but rain suspended play before he could seal the win. Upon returning to the court, he was broken, but immediately responded by breaking Gaubas back to triumph.

With his two-hour, seven-minute victory, the Argentine is up to No. 44 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, securing a return to the Top 50 for the first time since April last year. Etcheverry will next meet lucky loser Jaime Faria. 

The Portuguese player, who defeated two-time defending champion Sebastian Baez in the first round for the biggest win of career, beat Damir Dzumhur 7-6(1), 6-4 in two hours and three minutes to reach the quarter-finals.

Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten are beginning to turn the tide in their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry with Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, following a composed championship-match victory at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open on Friday.

The third-seeded Heliovaara and Patten completed a spotless run to the ATP 500 title in Doha with a 6-3, 6-3 win over the top-seeded defending champions. Also winners in Adelaide, they became the second team to win multiple titles this season, joining Montpellier and Dallas champions Theo Arribage and Albano Olivetti.

After losing their first four meetings against Cash and Glasspool, Heliovaara and Patten have now reduced the deficit to 2-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. They also defeated the top seeds in the ATP Masters 1000 final in Paris in October.

“We finished the end of 2025 really strong and just to keep that form in 2026, it's been a dream six months for us,” said Heliovaara, who won his maiden Nitto ATP Finals trophy with Patten in November. “With Henry, it's always lovely to play. I had my family here in Doha this week — my wife and two kids — so it's always special to travel with them.”

Heliovaara and Patten saved all seven break points they faced in the 69-minute final, according to Infosys ATP Stats. They are now up eight spots to No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings, continuing their strong start to the season.

Learner Tien was not ready for his Delray Beach Open to come to an end.

The 20-year-old was two points from defeat against defending champion Miomir Kecmanovic — who served for the match at 5-4 in the deciding set — but rallied for a 6-4, 6-7(4), 7-6(5) victory and a place in the quarter-finals.

“I just kept believing,” Tien said in his on-court interview. “I got broken on kind of a bad game at four all, but just tried to put that behind me as best I could, and just made him beat me.”

Kecmanovic showed no signs of nerves when he served for the match, hammering away from the baseline and putting consistent pressure on the home favourite. But Tien played great defence, turning into a brick wall at the most critical moment.

Once the reigning Next Gen ATP Finals champion retrieved the break, he was able to surge to the finish line and take a 2-1 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“I got a little lucky. I think luck always plays a little bit of a role,” Tien said. “But I think just fighting, just staying in there every point, and really making him close me out, I think [that] just paid off.”

Tien is fresh off a run to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, where he beat a former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Daniil Medvedev, and pushed Alexander Zverev to a fourth-set tie-break. The lefty will next take on Frances Tiafoe, who won the first ATP Tour title of his career in Delray Beach in 2018.

""I played him in the first round of the [US] Open a few years ago. Obviously he's a totally different player,"" Tiafoe said. ""I'm excited to get up and play him. It's funny how things turn. Now I'm the underdog in that match, so I'm happy to get out there and play against him.""

The eighth-seeded Tiafoe clawed past qualifier Zachary Svajda 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 to reach his first quarter-final since July of last year.

""I'm just happy to be competing. It feels good competing,"" Tiafoe said. ""It's nice to put some matches together. Happy I get to play another match tomorrow. It's going to be another tough opponent, so excited to get out there and compete.""





Top seed Taylor Fritz also battled through a tough test, eliminating #NextGenATP Spaniard Rafael Jodar 7-6(4), 6-4 in the last match of the day. The home favourite hit 15 aces and saved two of the three break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Fritz has shown good form since returning to the United States, advancing to the Dallas semi-finals last week. The 2023 and 2024 Delray Beach champion will continue his title chase against close friend Tommy Paul, a 7-6(11), 6-3 winner against lucky loser Adam Walton.

Jessica Pegula improved to 5-0 against Amanda Anisimova, and advanced to her 21st career final, after coming from a set and a break down to win their Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships semifinal.

No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula pulled off a comeback from 6-1, 3-1 down to maintain her perfect record against No. 2 seed Amanda Anisimova, advancing to the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships final 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 in 2 hours and 2 minutes.

Dubai: Scores |  Draws | Order of play 

Pegula now leads her head-to-head against Anisimova 5-0, backing up her wins in the 2020 Western & Southern Open second round, 2024 Charleston second round, 2024 Toronto final and last month's Australian Open quarterfinals. Three of Pegula's five wins have come in three sets.

The 31-year-old booked her spot in her 21st career final on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, and 10th at WTA 1000 level or above. She is a three-time WTA 1000 champion (Guadalajara 2022, Montreal 2023 and Toronto 2024), a four-time WTA 1000 runner-up (Madrid 2022, Cincinnati 2024, Miami 2025, Wuhan 2025), and was also a finalist at the 2023 WTA Finals Cancun and 2024 US Open.

Pegula will face either No. 3 seed Coco Gauff or No. 7 seed Elina Svitolina as she bids to lift the Dubai trophy for the first time. She leads her head-to-head against Gauff 5-3 (including 3-1 on outdoor hard courts) and against Svitolina 5-3 (including 5-2 on outdoor hard courts).

Pegula can usually be relied upon for concise and accurate match analysis as soon as her on-court interviews. This time, even she seemed mystified.

""At the start of the third, it was 1-1,"" she said. ""I just looked at my coach and I was like, 'I'm just happy I'm still even here right now.' She was playing some incredible tennis, and I just came out a little slow. And when you come out slow against Amanda, she can really just wipe you off the court, which is what she was doing.

""I held on to my serve there in the second set. I just kept telling myself that. I had some break points in the first set, even though it was convincingly the other way, and I knew I could get some break points back. That's really all I was focusing on.""

Indeed, there was no single, dramatic turning point. Pegula clawed her way back into the match gradually -- it was the work of the whole set, game by game. To break it down further, here are the key moments:

Even though Pegula hadn't fully turned the scoreboard in her favour at this point, her tactics were beginning to wrest the match away from Anisimova's first-strike territory. Pegula was beginning to draw overhead errors with sky-high defensive lobs, and disrupt Anisimova's timing with defensive slices. She levelled again at 4-4 -- and this time, ran away with the momentum. From 4-3 down, Pegula won seven of the next eight games to go up 4-1 in the third set.

""I was running a lot,"" Pegula said in her press conference. ""I knew I had to use my legs, get my feet under me ... get my feet under and stay in the points because she was hitting a really big ball. I was just having trouble, like, starting the points.

""I had to really make it a little physical there for a while. Then obviously at the end when I gained that momentum, it felt like there was a little bit of a lull in the energy where she was maybe, I don't know, a little tired. It was definitely mental and physical at the end.""

The end result was a turnaround in Anisimova's fortunes -- just 24 hours earlier, she had pulled off a comeback of her own, defeating Mirra Andreeva 2-5, 7-5, 7-6(4) from 6-2, 2-0 down.

Pegula modestly claimed bafflement on this front, too.

""It's a really tough matchup,"" she said. ""It's not like we have easy matches. We have battles every single time.""

But her pundit's hat soon came out, and her analysis was again on point.

""I do think that I'm able to take some time away from her,"" she said. ""I'm able to hit a low, flat ball, and not let her set up and go for her big shots, which is what she's good at. I try to utilize that the best I can and then mix in some variety, change things up. We had a lot of cat-and-mouse points, and they mostly went my way. So that was good.""

And even if Pegula isn't taking it for granted, her perfect history against Anisimova is a reminder that, even when the scoreline's against her, she's never out of the match.

""I'm sure it helps me,"" she said in her press conference. ""I'm not sure what she's thinking about. I think I know that I can turn matches around.

""I know what I can do to kind of bother her game. I just felt like I couldn't quite get into that yet as the first set went. I feel like I just need to get to that part where I'm starting to bother her with my strategy and what I'm doing. She was doing a very good job of not letting me get there ... Once I dug in, maybe she lost her timing a little bit, I was able to take my opportunity to do what I know probably bothers her.""

Coco Gauff employed a classic strategy to deal with an enthusiastic crowd at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Thursday, most of whom there to support Gauff's opponent Alexandra Eala.“I had a similar match at French Open last year so I brought that mindset today,” Gauff explained on court after defeating Eala, 6-0, 6-2. “Whenever you guys were cheering for Alex, I was pretending it was my name. I think that it helped me a lot!“If you can't beat ‘em, you've got to join them,” the American added with a laugh.This bit of reverse psychology has become popular for taking on tough crowds over the years, most notably from 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, who often found himself up against fan favorites like Roger Federer.“I have to say, it's great to be on a crowded court,” said Gauff, who hailed Eala's exploding fanbase as “great for tennis” ahead of their Dubai quarterfinal. “I've played this tournament for many years and to see the stadium full means a lot.”

Eala has been one of the Hologic WTA Tour's biggest breakout stars since her run to the Miami Open semifinals last spring. The Rafael Nadal Academy alum brings full crowds to nearly all of her matches, creating a standing-room only environment in her first round at the Australian Open back in January.“I'd like to thank Alex for bringing a new demographic to the sport. I really appreciate it,” Gauff continued. “I think it's great. I know sometimes it's tough when you're playing against a ‘home' crowd, but I think that it's great for the sport, so keep being enthusiastic and keep rooting for your player.”The 20-year-old was looking to make her second WTA 1000 semifinal against Gauff, a former doubles partner at the 2025 Internazionali BNL d'Italia, having ousted former Dubai champion Jasmine Paolini in the second round on Tuesday and backing that win up against Sorana Cirstea in the Round of 16.

But the Filipina sensation was up against an on-fire Gauff, who stormed through the first 10 games of their first singles encounter. Eala finally got on the board but was unable to create opportunities on Gauff's sometimes-shaky serve. Winning 77% of points on her first serve, Gauff was able to apply consistent pressure on return, converting six of nine break points across the 67-minute clash.Into her second Dubai semifinal, Gauff shook off an early stumble to her Middle East swing when she lost early at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open last week and recovered from the brink of defeat against Elise Mertens in the previous round.Awaiting Gauff in the semifinals is arematch of her Australian Open quarterfinal against Elina Svitolina.

After winning an epic quarterfinal against defending champion Mirra Andreeva at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Thursday, Amanda Anisimova couldn't stop thinking about her opponent.After seeing Andreeva come back from 5-3 down in the third to force a winner-take-all tiebreaker, Anisimova confessed she was almost in tears. But when Andreeva's final backhand went long to hand Anisimova the hard-fought  2-6, 7-5, 7-6(4) win, the 18-year-old could hardly contain the emotions of seeing her chance to become the first woman since Elina Svitolina in 2017-18 to win Dubai in back-to-back years end.She doubled over with her hands on her knees, and after hugging it out with Anisimova, left the court teary-eyed. And in her on-court interview, the American offered a metaphorical shoulder to cry on.""It was such a tough battle, and I thought we played incredible tennis,"" Anisimova, who has been open about her own mental health struggles, said. ""Seeing Mirra down like that, it's understandable. We both fought so hard today, and it made me emotional seeing her like that. She was playing so well, she's the defending champion and I feel like we both won on the court today. These type of matches, it's always tough that someone has to lose at the end of the day.""In her press conference, Anisimova expanded on what she said on court, saying that Andreeva is doing ""all the right things"" despite the dramatic defeat, and two earlier-than-expected exits from her last two events following a title at the Adelaide International.

Q. You seemed really touched by when she broke down at the end. Can you talk about that moment.AMANDA ANISIMOVA: Yeah, made me like really emotional because I feel like we both sort of felt that way throughout the match probably because it was such a roller coaster, so up and down. Despite whichever way it was going, I feel like we were both fighting with everything we had and trying our best.Yeah, it's not easy to see someone that gives their all and then to react like that. It made me really sad for her. In my mind, I was just, like, thinking if she keeps playing like this, there's a title around the corner for her. Obviously she's going to have a great year. She seems to be doing all the right things. Yeah, not easy to be a defending champion. But I feel like she did an amazing job.Yeah, that's kind of why I felt like that. I mean, there will be many more matches for us to come, I'm sure.For a spot in the final, Anisimova will face No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula, who topped No. 12 seed and defending finalist Clara Tauson in another three-set quarterfinal. Anisimova will hope for some revenge after losing in two sets to Pegula in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open.

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Charles Leclerc sets the fastest lap of day 6 of Bahrain testing

It has been a tricky pre-season for Aston Martin and power unit provider Honda.

Aston Martin's new power unit partner, Honda, have released a statement following the disruptions to the team's programme on the second day of the final pre-season test at the Bahrain International Circuit.

Fernando Alonso was behind the wheel of the AMR26 during Thursday afternoon's session in the Sakhir desert when he encountered problems under braking for Turn 4 and came to a halt shortly afterwards.

That ended Aston Martin's running for the day and marked another setback in their preparations for the 2026 campaign, after a late debut for the car at the Barcelona Shakedown and struggles throughout the two Bahrain gatherings.

Chief Trackside Officer Mike Krack admitted last week that “we know we are missing pace and we have areas we know we need to improve”, while driver Lance Stroll claimed Aston Martin are as much as “four-and-a-half seconds” behind the front-runners.

Responding to the latest incident, a Honda statement read: “Our last run with Fernando Alonso yesterday showed a battery-related issue that impacted our test plan with the Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 Team.

“Since then, we have been carrying out simulations on the test bench in HRC [Honda Racing Corporation] Sakura. Due to this and the shortage of power unit parts, we have adapted today's run plan to be very limited and consist only of short stints.”

Speaking before the stoppage, two-time World Champion Alonso also gave his assessment of where Aston Martin stand, saying they have “no doubt” over technical chief Adrian Newey's abilities and that “we will find a way to have the best car eventually”.

“We need to unlock more performance,” Alonso commented. “Missing [most of] Barcelona was not ideal. This is the very first test for us, so we're still going step-by-step into the car. We are a little bit on the back foot, we have to admit that, but hopefully there is time to improve.

“On the chassis there is no doubt, we have the best with us. After 30-plus years of Adrian Newey dominating the sport, I think no one will doubt that we will find a way to have the best car eventually.

“On the power unit, we need to wait and see when we unlock all the performance, where we are and what is missing, and then work hard.”

Stroll is scheduled to complete Aston Martin's testing programme on Friday, though they were the only outfit not to emerge from the pit lane in the opening couple of hours of the morning session.

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Charles Leclerc sets the fastest lap of day 6 of Bahrain testing

With the second and final Bahrain pre-season test drawing to a close, George Russell has set out the areas in which he feels that Mercedes need to improve.

George Russell believes that Mercedes need to “keep on improving reliability” after experiencing some gremlins during the Bahrain test, with the Briton also suggesting that race starts could be the “tallest hurdle” to the team's potential.

Kimi Antonelli saw his running on the final morning of pre-season testing reduced when the W17 stopped out on track due to a pneumatic issue, while the Italian also suffered some technical problems during the first test one week earlier.

Speaking to the media on Friday morning, Russell conceded that there have been strong points for Mercedes across the two tests but also acknowledged that there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of reliability.

“I think there definitely have been positives, but for every time there is an issue it does definitely set you back quite a lot,” he explained.

“Unfortunately for Kimi this morning, he had an issue on track and he lost a good couple of hours, and the first test in Bahrain last week we also had quite a few issues.

“There are positives to take – the car is feeling good, the new power units are feeling fast and we're making improvements every single day. However, we need to keep on improving the reliability.”

Russell went on to reflect on how race starts are another area of focus for Mercedes, with the 28-year-old adding: “I think we've got a lot of potential beneath us, but to win a race you've also got to get off the line quite well, and I think the two [practice] starts I've made were worse than my worst-ever start in Formula 1 – Lewis [Hamilton] down in P11 got into P1.

“So at this stage I don't think it matters how quick you are – the thing that's going to trip you up is going to be that tallest hurdle, and that's what we're trying to get our heads around right now and we're stumbling on some at the moment.”

Russell spoke highly of Red Bull's performance during the first Bahrain test and the British driver continued to praise the Milton Keynes-based squad's energy deployment one week on, as he looked ahead to how the picture could evolve at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.

“Their deployment still definitely looks the best on the grid, which is kudos to them and I think it was a bit of a surprise to everybody, so I think let's see come Melbourne how things shake up,” said Russell.

“I think the Mercedes-powered teams have made a lot of improvement since Day 1 of Bahrain last week, so that gap has closed drastically. But we're obviously Day 6 of Bahrain testing now, whereas in Melbourne you've got three hours of practice, and that's the main point of the concern.”

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Charles Leclerc sets the fastest lap of day 6 of Bahrain testing

F1.com's Lawrence Barretto examines the key developments from Day 2 of the second 2026 pre-season test in Bahrain.

Formula 1 teams started to chase performance on the penultimate day of pre-season testing in Bahrain and, while it's still hard to define a pecking order, there are definitely some trends that have emerged to help build a picture...

No one has wanted to wear the favourite tag throughout pre-season in Bahrain, with Mercedes saying Red Bull are favourites, McLaren saying Ferrari and Mercedes are favourites, and Red Bull saying Mercedes are favourites.

It still remains unclear who is actually top of the pile, but there does seem to be a consensus up and down the paddock that the teams that finished in the top four last year – McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari – are still the top four now.

McLaren chief Zak Brown said on Thursday: ""I think we'll be in the big four – I don't think we're in the front of the big four, but it's going to be a long season with a lot of development.""

But that doesn't mean it'll be same-same all year. Brown makes a good point that whoever does end up fastest in Australia may not be the ones to beat throughout the season, given there's expected to be a development race as there usually is when sweeping new regulations are introduced.

Ferrari kicked off 2026 with a Spec-A car so that they could focus on the fundamentals before bringing new parts. That analysis continued into the first week of Bahrain testing, though the team introduced a few new bits midway through the test.

Then on the first day of the second test, they added a neat beam wing behind the exhaust that turned heads before creating a big scene on Thursday when Lewis Hamilton ran a radical flip rear wing element that rotates itself upside down in straight line mode.

The team called the wing a 'test' item and have yet to confirm whether they will run it in the future. They also removed it in the afternoon while they completed their long runs.

Nonetheless, having gone under the radar in the first week in Bahrain, they have emerged as one of the most impressive teams in testing – with their starts particularly eye-catching – and could well be at the sharp end come Australia.

Aston Martin were in desperate need of mileage heading into the penultimate day of testing but they did not get what they hoped for after yet more technical issues.

Fernando Alonso only managed 68 laps across the day, with his afternoon session ending early after Honda identified an issue with the power unit which forced the team to stop the car out on track as a precaution.

While the car returned to the garage, the double World Champion didn't rejoin, thus ending his pre-season on a sour note – and leaving Aston Martin with a steep hill to climb.

""It was important to get some mileage in, but it wasn't enough, and we couldn't complete our run plan due to a PU-related issue that caused an early finish to the afternoon session,"" he said.

""There are many things we need to fix, but I know everyone at the track and at the campus is working at 100% capacity to find solutions.""

George Russell and Kimi Antonelli combined to clock 157 ""trouble free"" laps in Bahrain, with Mercedes trackside chief Andrew Shovlin saying the high mileage helped the squad ""recover a good chunk of the ground we lost with several stoppages last week"".

The team focused on running a series of test items, continuing to build their understanding of the W17 as they honed the set-up when running the C3 compound tyre.

As it was Antonelli's last evening session, when conditions are most representative, the team gave him some lower fuel running towards the end of the day – and he went on to set the fastest time. Russell will get the same chance when he closes the test out by running in the PM on Friday.

Antonelli, though, remained cautious about Mercedes' impressive form. ""We were able to get through everything we had planned and end the day P1,"" he said. ""While that is positive, the gaps between those at the front are already incredibly small and down to a matter of hundredths today.""

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Charles Leclerc sets the fastest lap of day 6 of Bahrain testing

After George Russell went fastest on the first day of the second pre-season test in Bahrain, it was the turn of Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli to top the timesheets on Day 2.

Kimi Antonelli set the pace on Day 2 of the second 2026 pre-season test in Bahrain, with the Mercedes racer heading the timesheets from McLaren's Oscar Piastri and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen.

Lando Norris had led the way during Thursday's morning session on a 1m 33.453s – but as the times came down further across the afternoon, it was Antonelli who ended the day on top with his effort of 1m 32.803s.

Lewis Hamilton was the first to hit the track when the day's second segment got underway at 1500 local time, the Ferrari man seemingly keen to get more mileage after completing only five laps earlier.

Others soon started to join the fray, with some drivers taking over from their team mates for the afternoon session including Piastri, Antonelli and Haas' Ollie Bearman.

Shortly after Verstappen beat Norris' earlier time to put himself at the top of the timesheets less than one hour into the afternoon, fellow World Champion Fernando Alonso brought out the red flags after stopping his Aston Martin out on track.

After the AMR26 was safely cleared away, the action resumed with just under three hours left on the clock for the teams and drivers to continue with their programmes. Several set about adding further laps to their tally, with Hamilton making up for lost time by gaining further mileage while Antonelli was racking up a solid number of tours.

Some also appeared to be pushing as the sun began to set and more representative conditions started to kick in at the Bahrain International Circuit, as the likes of Hamilton and Alpine's Franco Colapinto experienced lock-ups.

Others took the opportunity to complete some soft tyre runs, with Williams' Alex Albon and Sergio Perez in the Cadillac both switching to the red-walled rubber during the latter stages of Thursday afternoon.

The name at the top of the board continued to change as the session progressed; Piastri had bettered Verstappen's effort to go fastest, before Antonelli displaced the McLaren in the P1 slot with a time set during the final hour.

As was the case on Day 1, Thursday's session ended with a practice new race starts light procedure – though there were seemingly issues for Piastri in the closing minutes of Day 2, the Australian pulling over to the side of the track before then getting going again.

In terms of the timesheets, Antonelli's lap of 1m 32.803s remained unbeaten, with Piastri 0.058s adrift in second while Verstappen – who clocked the day's highest lap count of 139 –  was just over three-tenths back from Antonelli's time in third.

Hamilton slotted into fourth, while Norris' morning session lap kept him in fifth place ahead of Colapinto, Audi's Nico Hulkenberg, Mercedes' George Russell, the Haas of Esteban Ocon and Liam Lawson in the Racing Bulls.

Albon was 11th for Williams, followed by Gabriel Bortoleto in the Audi, Bearman, Perez and Alonso, the latter completing just 68 laps after failing to rejoin the session following his earlier stoppage. Valtteri Bottas was the final classified name for Cadillac, with six drivers having not participated in Thursday's running while their team mates took over driving duties.

There is now just one day of 2026 pre-season testing in Bahrain remaining, with the teams and drivers set to return on Friday for a final chance to run their cars ahead of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on March 6-8.

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Charles Leclerc sets the fastest lap of day 6 of Bahrain testing

McLaren topped the times from Red Bull and Mercedes during Thursday morning's session in the Sakhir desert.

Lando Norris posted the fastest time as pre-season testing continued at the Bahrain International Circuit on Thursday, leading the way from Max Verstappen and George Russell.

McLaren driver Norris clocked a 1m 33.453s during the first four-hour session of the day, putting him just over a tenth ahead of Red Bull rival Verstappen, and some six-tenths up on Mercedes man Russell.

Norris and Russell both worked their way past race distances in productive outings, before they move aside for team mates Oscar Piastri and Kimi Antonelli this afternoon – five teams opting to swap drivers over lunch, and six sticking with a single driver all day.

Alex Albon, Ollie Bearman and Franco Colapinto also got a solid amount of mileage on the board for Williams, Haas and Alpine, placing fourth, sixth and seventh respectively, and sandwiching the Audi of Gabriel Bortoleto.

Bortoleto and Liam Lawson both spent lengthy spells in the pits as Audi and Racing Bulls worked on their cars, limiting them to around half a race distance, with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso also below the 57-lap milestone.

Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari completed the fewest laps of the session, though – unspecified issues interrupting the seven-time World Champion's programme and limiting him to a handful of tours after he emerged with an intriguing test item.

Indeed, Ferrari got technical figures talking up and down the pit lane when the upper element of their rear wing appeared to flip upside down in ‘Straight Mode', seemingly to further explore Active Aero options and the transition between straights and corners.

Valtteri Bottas brought up the rear for 2026 newcomers Cadillac with a time some 6.7s slower than Norris' benchmark, after the team spent the first hour or so of the session in their garage for the second successive test day.

Despite that lengthy delay, the Finn managed to get a full race distance on the board – and gather another round of useful data for the squad to dig into – ahead of team mate Sergio Perez's stint at the wheel in the afternoon.

F1 drivers and teams will now take a break for lunch, with the penultimate afternoon session in Bahrain due to get under way at 1500 local time – running until 1900 as the sun sets and the floodlights switch on.

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Charles Leclerc sets the fastest lap of day 6 of Bahrain testing

While Cadillac experienced some issues as the second pre-season test in Bahrain got underway, Team Principal Graeme Lowdon is ""very happy"" with how the new squad's programme has progressed.

Cadillac's Graeme Lowdon has suggested that onlookers should not “read too much” into “small issues” experienced by the squad as the second pre-season test in Bahrain got underway, with the Team Principal reiterating that the new outfit are still in the very early days of their time in F1.

Sergio Perez spent the opening stages of Wednesday morning in the garage while the team worked through sensor issues, the Mexican later heading out for his first installation lap around 75 minutes into the session.

Following this slow start, Perez went on to complete 24 laps before team mate Valtteri Bottas added 35 to the squad's tally during the afternoon.

During Thursday's team representatives press conference in Bahrain, Lowdon was asked about how the team had made up for that bumpy day as they continued to put laps on the board into Day 2 of the second test.

“I wouldn't read too much into yesterday – yesterday was day nine of running a Formula 1 car and today's day 10,” the Briton explained. “We're up against teams who have been doing this for a very, very long time.

“I'm very happy. We're working through the programme, had no major issues – just small issues that I think every team in the paddock will have had before.

“[I'm] extremely happy with the way that the team is working together. We've got a lot of experienced people in the team, as I think people will have seen, but experience of working together as the Cadillac Formula 1 team is less than 12 months.

“I would say, to sum it up, extremely happy with the team, very, very happy with the platform that we're building, and can't wait for Melbourne.”

Cadillac went on to record a total of 108 laps between Bottas and Perez on Thursday, with the team and the rest of the field now preparing for the final day of 2026 pre-season testing on Friday.

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Charles Leclerc sets the fastest lap of day 6 of Bahrain testing

Mark Hughes takes a closer look at the unusual features spotted on Ferrari's car during the second pre-season test in Bahrain.

Ferrari generated plenty of attention on the first day of the second pre-season test in Bahrain thanks to their unusual vane (termed a flow turning device by the team) located behind the exhaust. On the second day they continued to get people talking with a radical flip rear wing element, which rotates itself upside down in straight line mode.

Technical contributor Mark Hughes delves into each of these designs to examine what they are intended to do...

Ferrari's 'flow turning device' is located close to the bottom of the wing assembly. It is roughly square in section – and aligned with the gap ahead between the two rear wing pillars – and is angled very steeply upwards.

It appears to be directing exhaust flow to the underside of the rear wing main plane, but it is almost certainly also energising the airflow exiting the diffuser in that central part of its width.

However, this unique feature is built upon another – one that was already on the car in the first Bahrain test: lower bodywork which extends the diffuser expansion ramp further back than the regulation rearmost point for the diffuser. This bodywork – separate from the actual physical diffuser – effectively makes the diffuser longer and therefore more effective in speeding up the underfloor's airflow and thereby increasing downforce.

It seems such an obvious benefit that it begs the question as to why only Ferrari have done it. The answer lies in the Ferrari's differential and driveshafts.

The complex series of dimensional boxes to which the bodywork must comply stipulate that any bodywork in this lower section of the car can extend back no more than 6cm from the driveshafts. On other cars, 6cm back from the driveshafts would still be within the diffuser region.

However, Ferrari has placed the diff so far back and angled its driveshafts back to such an extreme degree that it opens out this extra volume behind the diffuser in which the aerodynamic-aiding bodywork has been made possible.

The regulations stipulate that the diff can be sited plus or minus 6cm from the rear axle line. Ferrari had chosen to put it the maximum 6cm back so as to create the volume behind the diffuser in which to fit the extra diffuser-enhancing bodywork.

The technical limitation on how far the driveshafts can be angled is formed by the constant velocity joints, which connect the gearbox to the differential and the driveshafts to the diff. They allow the driveshafts to rotate while accommodating the suspension's movement.

Accommodating angled driveshafts involves careful design of linkages to prevent vibration and failure. This in turn impacts upon the design of the whole transmission assembly, so copying the Ferrari layout during the season would not be feasible for other teams. The Haas and Cadillac cars however use the Ferrari gearbox so, in theory, they might be able to emulate the swept back driveshafts to take advantage of the bodywork loophole.

Using the diffuser-extending bodywork as the foundation, Ferrari has introduced this new vane to direct exhaust flow to the rear wing underside. The faster the air flows over the rear wing underside, the lower the air pressure there and the bigger the difference between the high pressure of the wing's top surface and the low pressure of the underside – boosting the downforce.

Exhaust blowing the wing underside is not a new technology – it featured on cars in the 2010s – but it was effectively outlawed by dimensional restrictions. The new set of dimensions of the 2026 regulations has opened up the possibility of doing it once more.

Ferrari has spotted this opportunity and incorporated it into the SF26, but the exhaust blowing is quite possibly just supplementary to the flow turning device's main function of speeding up flow from the diffuser. The faster the air flows over the top of the diffuser, the greater its pull on that coming through and this device will act as a gurney flap in that section of the diffuser-extending bodywork, which is restricted by the twin wing pillars, speeding up the more restricted flow in compensation.

Ferrari has apparently found an ingenious loophole with this diffuser-extending ruse and that is all the more valuable in how difficult it is to copy.

Rather than simply switching from an angled position to flat when in straightline mode, the new test item Ferrari was trying on the second day in Bahrain flips completely to an upside down position.

This appears to create a bigger slot gap for the air to travel through for a further reduction in drag. In normal downforce mode, the wing's upper surface is of a smaller surface area than the underside. It is this which creates the air pressure difference between above and below – and that, in turn, creates downforce.

With the wing flipped, the smaller surface area becomes the lower one – thereby creating more space in the gap than in a conventional flattened (but not upside-down) flap.

If successful, this will be easier to copy than the diffuser-extending bodywork but further illustrates the creative thinking going on at Maranello.

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Charles Leclerc sets the fastest lap of day 6 of Bahrain testing

Ferrari topped the times over Mercedes and McLaren in the penultimate session of 2026 pre-season testing.

Charles Leclerc posted the fastest time as pre-season testing continued at the Bahrain International Circuit on Friday, slotting ahead of Kimi Antonelli and Oscar Piastri in the morning session.

Leclerc worked his way down to a best time of 1m 33.689s across four hours of running in typically hot weather conditions, putting him just over two-tenths up on Antonelli and some six-tenths ahead of Piastri.

After Ferrari got the paddock talking with their exhaust winglet on Wednesday and ‘upside down' rear wing on Thursday, the team's positive test continued thanks to Leclerc charging through a race distance and gathering plenty more data.

Antonelli and Piastri, meanwhile, both lost some track time – the Mercedes stopping out on track due to a pneumatic issue and causing a red flag with a couple of hours left on the morning clock, and McLaren working on the rear of their car for around half an hour.

Haas' Esteban Ocon was another busy driver, ticking off a race distance and more en route to fourth, with Isack Hadjar fifth in a solid morning for Red Bull, even if the Frenchman was seeing punching the air in frustration after going deep at Turn 8.

Pierre Gasly and Arvid Lindblad followed in sixth and seventh for Alpine and Racing Bulls respectively, the latter being praised by his race engineer during a longer run, ahead of Williams' Carlos Sainz and Audi's Nico Hulkenberg.

Cadillac made a quiet start for the third successive day, with Sergio Perez short of mileage for opening 90 minutes or so, but their programme gradually ramped up and the Mexican ended the morning with a healthy number of laps to his name.

At the bottom of the list were Aston Martin, who suffered a stoppage with Fernando Alonso on Thursday afternoon and did not appear on Friday until the final 20 minutes of the morning session – the squad's difficult pre-season continuing.

New power unit partner Honda issued a statement confirming that a battery-related issue halted Alonso, with checks back at their headquarters in Japan and a shortage of power unit parts meaning any runs from Stroll will be “very limited”.

Six teams will change their drivers over the lunch break, with Mercedes also fitting a new power unit following Antonelli's stoppage, while Ferrari, Williams, Racing Bulls, Aston Martin and Alpine will stick with Leclerc, Sainz, Lindblad, Stroll and Gasly.

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Charles Leclerc sets the fastest lap of day 6 of Bahrain testing

Aston Martin have struggled for mileage across pre-season testing, with issues delaying their programme.

Aston Martin Team Representative Pedro de la Rosa has made clear that Aston Martin are “not where they want to be” amid a difficult pre-season period, with the squad working “flat-out” to get on top of their issues.

After debuting the new Honda-powered AMR26 late at the Barcelona Shakedown, Aston Martin have faced various reliability problems across the two Bahrain pre-season tests, limiting their mileage and data gathering.

The latest problem led to Fernando Alonso stopping out on track during Thursday afternoon's session in Sakhir, with Honda subsequently releasing a statement to explain the cause and how their Friday programme has been impacted.

Expanding on that in a conversation with F1 TV, former F1 driver De la Rosa said: “Yesterday we had some battery issues on Fernando's car, and therefore Honda is carrying out test simulations on the test bench in Sakura.

“Due to this fact, and also the fact that we have a shortage of parts, we will be doing very limited runs today. They will be short and they will be separated by a minimum of half an hour so that it allows us to really look into the data, and be able to test some things in these few runs. We won't be doing long runs today, for sure.”

He added: “Definitely we are not where we wanted to be. We have been the team with the [fewest] number of laps during pre-season testing. We would have preferred to do a lot more. But despite the fact that we haven't done a lot of laps, we have an enormous amount of data to look into and to prepare ourselves for Australia.

“It's a new set of regulations, everything is new, we have a new partner in Honda, a new gearbox, new rear suspension. There are so many things actually that we already have a good understanding on, and we really know the places and the areas of the car we need to focus on.

“It's not where we wanted to be, we would have preferred to do a lot more quantity of laps, but the laps we've done is showing us a direction for the future. There is a lot of work to be done still behind the scenes.”

As such, De la Rosa and Aston Martin are braced for a challenging start to the 2026 campaign, but the Spaniard emphasised how every department is pulling together to make progress and become a competitive force.

“Yeah, of course it will be [tricky],” he said. “When you start on the back foot, it's always more difficult. We have great partners, we have Honda, we have a fantastic campus and people working flat-out trying to get us to the best possible compromise for Australia.

“We only have to work hard based on what we have already learned so far this pre-season, which is a lot, and start from there. It's a long journey, it's a long season as well, but we still have a mission to be completed.”

At the Berlin Film Festival, the Oscar-nominated director of 'It Was Just an Accident' declined his long-delayed Golden Bear and put the focus on Iranians killed and detained in a brutal crackdown.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Oscar-nominated Iranian director Jafar Panahi (It Was Just an Accident) used a rare public appearance at the Berlin Film Festival to denounce what he described as an “unbelievable crime” unfolding in his home country, as independent filmmakers mounted a parallel campaign to spotlight artists killed and detained in a sweeping crackdown by the Islamic Republic.


	In an on-stage discussion with The Hollywood Reporter's European Bureau Chief Scott Roxborough in Berlin on Thursday, Panahi said the festival wanted to retroactively present him with the Berlinale Golden Bear honor he won in 2015 for Taxi [the director, under a travel ban at the time, was unable to attend in person]. He said he declined, wanting to keep attention fixed on the Iranian regime's violent repression of protestors, which has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.

	“They wanted to give me the Golden Bear I had won for Taxi, and I refused it, because of the situation in Iran,” Panahi said. “An unbelievable crime has happened. Mass murder has happened. People are not even allowed to mourn their loved ones…The regime is forcing them into these acts. People do not want violence. They avoid violence. It is the regime that forces violence upon them.”


	Panahi has long resisted the label of political filmmaker, even as his work and his life have been shaped by the state's response to dissent. The current moment, he suggested, has made silence impossible.


	“Artists do not want to be politically active by themselves. It is the regimes and governments that force them into political engagement,” he said. “Artists try to avoid being politically active, but socially engaged artists cannot stay silent about what happens in society. That is why so many artists, actors and actresses, and superstars have stood with the people of Iran and now face consequences. We have many artists in prison — documentary filmmakers as well. During previous protests and demonstrations, filmmakers were arrested. When an artist is silent, they are complicit in violence.”

	











	Panahi's It Was Just an Accident, was written after the director spent seven months in Iran's notorious Evin Prison and was inspired by the stories of the political prisoners he met inside. The film follows a group of former prisoners who kidnap the man they believe to be their torturer, debating whether to kill or forgive him.


	“I did not know I wanted to make a film about this,” Panahi said. “But when I left prison, when the doors opened and I walked out and looked back at the huge walls behind me, I thought about those still inside. It became a weight on my shoulders. After weeks and months, it grew heavier, and I decided to make a film about them.”


	To render that world authentically, he enlisted several of his fellow inmates, including political activist Mehdi Mahmoudian, to co-write the screenplay. Mahmoudian was recently re-arrested for condemning the actions of Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei and is currently out on bail. 


	“Mehdi Mahmoudian has spent nearly a quarter of his life in prison. He had more contact with people inside than anyone else. He knew the torturers very well — how they think, what their ideology is. That was a great help to me.”


	In December, while touring with It Was Just an Accident outside Iran, Panahi was sentenced, in abstentia, to a year in prison and another travel ban, for  “propaganda activities” against the government. He said following the Oscars — It Was Just an Accident is nominated for best international feature and best original screenplay — he will return to Iran. 

	











	“Half of my existence is in Iran — my family, my mother, my sister, my brother, my son, my friends, and the society I work for. If I did not return, I would betray what I believe. As a socially engaged filmmaker, my duty is to stand with the people I belong to. A doctor can save lives anywhere. But my cinema exists there. I must go back and make films there. That is the right thing to do. I will return, 100 percent, because of who I am and because of my beliefs.”


	His remarks in Berlin unfolded alongside a coordinated effort by the Iranian Independent Filmmakers Association (IIFMA) to draw attention to artists killed and detained in the latest wave of repression. The association, founded in 2023 in the wake of the Woman Life Freedom movement, returned to the Berlinale with a stand, a panel and a flashmob on Potsdamer Platz.


	At a panel in Berlin, IIFMA board member Mahshid Zamani screened footage compiled from social media and material sent directly from Iran documenting the Jan. 8 and 9 crackdown.


	“Each frame captures the courage, hope and longing that define the Iranian spirit while also shedding light on the brutal realities imposed by a repressive, fanatic, Islamic, terrorist regime,” he said. “Tens of artists were murdered while bravely standing up for their beliefs in the uprising of January 8 and 9.”


	Zamani then read aloud the names of musicians, filmmakers, actors and other arts professionals confirmed killed or detained, asking the audience to applaud each one. Later, IIFMA members staged a flashmob reenacting rows of body bags in Berlin's festival district in commemoration.

	











	According to IIFMA, the following arts and culture professionals have been killed:


	Ahmad Abbasi – filmmakerShokoufeh Abdi – photographerMelika Dastyab – musicianPouya Faragardi – musicianShabnam Ferdowsi – puppeteer, graphic designerJavad Ganji – filmmakerSorena Golgoun – musicianYaser Modir-Rousta – musicianSanam Pourbabaei – musicianSahba Rashtian – painter and animation directorFoad Safayi – musicianMehdi Salahshour – sculptorZohre Shamaeizade – script supervisor and voice actorMohammed “Shahou” Shirazi – singerMostafa Rabeti – filmmakerReyhaneh Yousefi – actorAmir-Ali Zarei – musician, art student

The 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Euphoria' actor died at age 53 following a battle with ALS.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Senior Editor, Digital


	Following the death of Eric Dane, Sam Levinson, Ashton Kutcher, Nina Dobrev, Alyssa Milano, Kevin McKidd, James Pickens Jr., Michael Grassi, Selma Blair and Alexander Ludwig are among those in Hollywood paying tribute to the actor.


	Dane, known for his role as plastic surgeon Mark Sloan, aka “McSteamy,” in Grey's Anatomy, Cal Jacobs in Euphoria and commanding officer Tom Chandler in The Last Ship, died Thursday afternoon at age 53 following a battle with ALS. He initially revealed publicly in April 2025 that he had been diagnosed with the rare degenerative disease.

	“He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world,” his reps shared in a statement. “Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time.”


	Levinson, the creator of Euphoria, said in a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter, “I'm heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend Eric. Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric's family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing.”

	











	The official Instagram account for Euphoria and HBO Max wrote in a joint post, “We are deeply saddened by the news of Eric Dane's passing. He was incredibly talented and HBO was fortunate to have worked with him on three seasons of Euphoria. Our thoughts are with his loved ones during this difficult time.”


	McKidd, who played Dr. Owen Hunt on Grey's Anatomy, wrote on his Instagram Story, “Rest in Peace Buddy.”


	Pickens Jr., who also worked with Dane on Grey's Anatomy, playing Dr. Richard Webber, wrote on Instagram, “Rest in Peace.” Sarah Drew, who played Dr. April Kepner, also shared a similar message on her Instagram Story.


	ABC and 20th Television released a joint statement, which reads, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of Eric Dane. His remarkable talent and unforgettable presence on Grey's Anatomy left a lasting impact on audiences around the world, and his courage and grace during his battle with ALS inspired so many. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as the many fans whose lives were touched by his work.”


	Milano, who worked alongside Dane on Charmed, shared in a tribute, “I can't stop seeing that spark in Eric's eye right before he'd say something that would either make you spit out your drink or rethink your entire perspective. He had a razor-sharp sense of humor. He loved the absurdity of things. He loved catching people off guard.”


	“And when it came to his daughters and Rebecca, everything in him softened. He carried them with him even in rooms where they weren't present. You could see it in the way his voice changed when he said their names. A breathtakingly beautiful family,” Milano continued. “The spark. The mischief. The tenderness he kept guarded but never totally hidden.”

	











	Dobrev, who starred in 2022's Redeeming Love with Dane, wrote in a tribute on her Instagram Story, “Heartbroken to hear about the passing of Eric. He was warm, generous, prepared, and so passionate about what he did. He led with kindness and made everyone on our set feel seen. ALS is a cruel and unforgiving disease. May his memory inspire more research, awareness, and progress toward a cure. He will be deeply missed. Sending love and heartfelt condolensces to his family.” 


	Grassi, the creator of Brilliant Minds, shared in a statement, “Eric was a TV icon who lit up our screens for decades and it was the greatest honor of my career to work with him. Not only was he a tremendous talent, he was also generous, kind and brave. I'm thinking about his family and loved ones today. He will be missed.” Dane guest-starred in a second-season episode centered on ALS.


	DeMane Davis, producing director and executive producer of Brilliant Minds, also shared a statement. “Watching Eric Dane do what he loved — act in his final role on Brilliant Minds — was an honor. He adored being on set, cracking jokes in-between takes. Our crew and cast loved him. It was an gift to witness his talent, determination and joy,” Davis said. 


	Ludwig, who starred in 2024's Bad Boys: Ride or Die with Dane, wrote on his Instagram Story, “Ugh this hurts so much. Will miss you Eric and loved our time together. You were a joy to work with.”


	Blair, who appeared with Dane in an episode of Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane in 2000, shared a video of the sitcom on Instagram and wrote, “I love you. And yours.”

	











	Travis Van Winkle, the actor's Last Ship co-star, wrote on his Instagram Story: “I learned so much from Eric. He was a great man. I'm sad to see him go in this way. I'm sending love to his family. Thanks for the memories my friend.”

And a reminder after watching the HBO true-crime doc: ""Meth messes with your head.""


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Beyond its ponies and bourbon, Louisville, Kentucky, is not all glitter balls and glamour.


	The birthplace of the disco ball — locally called “glitter balls” — is also the tragic death place of Jamie Carroll. The hairdresser and drag performer was brutally murdered in 2010 by either Joey Banis or Jeffrey Mundt, depending on whom you believe. In HBO‘s two-part true-crime doc Murder in Glitterball City the former lovers point fingers at each other for the crime — only one, Banis, is currently in prison, even though both participated in the basement burial of Carroll following a wild night of sex, drugs and slaughter.

	The separate trials — due to the he said-he said accusations, since Banis and Mundt could not be tried as co-defendants — as well as the two-part documentary series from Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato hinge on a “confession” video self-recorded by Banis. In a motel room, seemingly holding Mundt at gun point, Banis admits to the murder and absolves his partner of any wrongdoing.


	It might be an open-and-shut case if not for the minutes-earlier footage that sees Mundt basically scripting the entire spiel for Banis. It appears Mundt is the one in control of the situation. So why would Banis play along? For starters, Bailey and Barbato say, crystal meth is a helluva drug.


	“I think it was all part of this drug-fueled haze. It was a strategic, transactional act that Joey was making. It was all part of the confusion of the dynamics of this relationship. [Mundt] is saying [Banis] did it and [the confession] is real, and [Banis] was crazy,” Barbato told The Hollywood Reporter. “And [Banis] is saying, I [confessed] because [Mundt] asked me to do this — he demanded I do this for whatever reason.”

	











	The defendants both said they feared one another. Regardless, the “confession” tape was used to convict Banis on a murder charge, and saved Mundt from the same fate.


	“They were both on trial for the same crime, and yet, just wrapping your head around how the outcome was completely different is very — it's kind of bizarre,” Bailey said.


	Beyond the tape, Banis and Mundt were very different in their presentation. Mundt speaks intelligently (though condescendingly, as numerous doc participants point out) and sports a clean-cut, corporate look. On the other end, Banis sports a blue mohawk, piercings and landing-strip soul patch.


	But appearances are often deceiving — especially in Glitterball City.


	“You're in Old Louisville, which is this haunted neighborhood where people dress up, pretending to be characters from the past and ghosts and things,” Bailey said. “Meth messes with your head, but [the setting] also messes with your head: Which dimension are we in?”


Murder in Glitterball City is more sympathetic to Banis, who participates from prison and has what Bailey calls a “slim” possibility of being granted an appeal, compared to Mundt. Barbato said they repeatedly “tried until very late in the process” to get in touch with Mundt for the doc, but “it was radio silence” on his end.


	Though their doc takes a side, Bailey and Barbato aren't necessarily all #JusticeForBanis — they want justice for Carroll, which in their eyes includes Mundt behind bars as well. The way they see it is, regardless of who wielded the knife and discharged the gun, anyone who buries a body in the basement and continues on with their lives for months on end — even if at times feeling under duress — should be behind bars.

	











	Mundt is not unfindable, and despite double jeopardy laws, there is still probably a way to put him where Bailey and Barbato feel he belongs. That's not the only goal, however, for Murder in Glitterball City.


	Bailey says it's important they use their platform to not allow society to dismiss murders in the LBGTQ community, which he says especially happens when the victim is involved in illicit acts.


	“As queer filmmakers, what happened to Jamie and the way that maybe people look at drug dealers and drag queens, or trans or people who are engaged in illegal activity like drug dealing… the goal, our goal, was to tell the story as fully as we could,” he said.


Murder in Glitterball City, from World of Wonder Productions, premiered both episodes back to back on Thursday, Feb. 19 beginning at 8 p.m. on HBO. Both parts will be available to stream on HBO Max.

A love story, with Sam Claflin and Simone Ashley attached; a Dusty Springfield project; and a film driven by music by Bastille's Dan Smith and To Kill a King's Ralph Pelleymounter feature on the slate of the longtime Quentin Tarantino collaborator and sync powerhouse.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Hollywood producer and long-time Quentin Tarantino collaborator Shannon McIntosh (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Hateful Eight) has struck a deal with Universal Music Group U.K.'s Globe business for a slate of music-driven feature films.


	Led by president Marc Robinson, the London-based Globe has been expanding into the U.S. and looking beyond its traditional sync business. McIntosh's McIntosh Films has now partnered with the Globe Originals arm on what the two companies described as “a bold slate of music-driven feature films.”

	The firms, which previously partnered on Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, said they were “in active development on a slate,” mentioning several projects. Falling, written and directed by BAFTA-winning filmmaker Dominic Savage, has Simone Ashley,  Evan Peters and  Sam Claflin attached and is described as “a modern-day love story developed in close collaboration with acclaimed music producer and composer  Marius de Vries.”Dusty vs Dusty, a new twist on the biopic, will explore identity, artistry and self-creation, with two actors set to portray Dusty Springfield, with producer Kate Driver attached. The project is the brainchild of Sophie Edelstein  and is co-written by  Emma-Jane Unsworth.And Annie Oakley Hanging, called a “fully music-driven feature ” and “a rebellious love story set in the wild American frontier,” will feature an original soundtrack created by Dan Smith, songwriter and lead singer of Bastille, and  Ralph Pelleymounter, songwriter and lead singer of To Kill a King.

	The projects “bring together Globe Originals' access to world-class artists, composers and music catalogue with McIntosh Films' track record in distinctive cinema,” the partners said. Globe Originals' mission is to develop films with music as the creative engine, “opening opportunities for artists in new avenues.”


	“These are films where music isn't ornamental — it's structural,” McIntosh emphasized. “Globe Originals creates an extraordinary bridge between artists and filmmakers, and this slate reflects a shared ambition to make cinema that feels emotionally and culturally alive.” Said Marc Robinson, president, Globe Originals: “There is huge opportunity to bring together the worlds of music and film — and this partnership is designed to do just that. Working with Shannon and McIntosh Films allows us to develop projects where artists, filmmakers and composers collaborate from the very beginning to create truly special audio and visual experiences.”

The Boss' beef with the Trump administration is cooking.  


													By
												

	Lars Brandle



	The United States simply isn't big enough for two bosses. That's one takeaway from a new missive from the White House, which has dismissed Bruce Springsteen as a “loser” with “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and an atrophying brain, doing so by way of a statement.


	With the announcement that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will head back out on the Land of Hope and Dreams American tour, the White House is chiming in. Only this time, the titles of several choice Springsteen work are woven in for added effect.

	











	“When this loser Springsteen comes back home to his own City of Ruins in his head, he'll realize his Glory Days are behind him and his fans have left him Out in the Street, putting him in a Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out because he has a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his brain,” reads the message from White House comms director Steven Cheung, issued to Politico.


Billboard has reached out to Springsteen for comment.


	The iconic rocker had laid into the Trump administration in January with his anti-ICE song, “Streets of Minneapolis,” inspired by what the Rock Hall-inducted singer called the “state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis” in a statement at the time.


	Specifically, the song called out the killings of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti, both 37, who were gunned down in Minneapolis by immigration enforcement troops in the midst of the so-called Operation Metro Surge enforcement action that has seen thousands of border patrol and ICE agents descend on the city.

	











Springsteen found himself back at No. 1 with “Streets of Minneapolis,” which debuted atop Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart dated Feb. 7. It was the highest selling song in the United States for the week, even with it being available for just two days of the tracking cycle.


	The White House had words at the time, one of which was to snub Springsteen as “irrelevant.”


	Springsteen is many things, but a “loser” — as the administration has referred to him — isn't one of them. Across a 40 year-plus career, the rocker has collected 20 Grammys, won an Oscar and a Tony, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, received a Kennedy Center Honor and, in November 2016, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And his album sales are north of 150 million, reps say.


	After 129 shows, the Springsteen and E Street Band 2023-25 tour grossed $729.7 million and sold 4.9 million tickets, according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, for the biggest result of his career.


	The rock legend embarks on his 20-date arena outing at Minneapolis' Target Center on March 31, and ends with one stadium show on May 27 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.


	“We are living through dark, disturbing and dangerous times, but do not despair — the cavalry is coming!” said Springsteen in a statement Tuesday (Feb. 17) when announcing the forthcoming tour.


	He added, “We will be rocking your town in celebration and in defense of America — American democracy, American freedom, our American Constitution and our sacred American dream — all of which are under attack by our wannabe king and his rogue government in Washington, D.C. Everyone, regardless of where you stand or what you believe in, is welcome — so come on out and join the United Free Republic of E Street Nation for an American spring of Rock n' Rebellion! I'll see you there!”

Two-phone Baby Keem has returned.

	Michael Saponara



	Gambling can bring out the highest of highs and lowest of lows, but Baby Keem is back to roll the dice. Keem returned on Friday (Feb. 20) with his Ca$ino album, his first project since 2021's The Melodic Blue.

	Keem ended the nearly five-year drought with an album announcement for Ca$ino on Feb. 10, which sent his fanbase into a frenzy. “Took your time bro this better be a classic,” one person commented.


	The Las Vegas native has released an accompanying multi-part Ca$ino documentary on YouTube, which featured Keem in the studio with Kendrick working on “Good Flirts.”


	“Walking in the party, I don't feel nobody/ What the f—k,” K. Dot raps. “Is it fake, is it love, probably/ I smell something.”


	Part one features Keem's family members and Lamar describing the 25-year-old's upbringing. “I understand the hardships before he was born. Knowing his mom, that's my first cousin,” Lamar said. “I already knew what she was going through, just the history of our family in general. We don't call ourselves the hillbillies for nothing.”


	Kendrick continued: “Section 8, welfare … This is a story of a warfare environment and a warfare psychologically trying to change our generational curses.”

	











	Baby Keem released his The Melodic Blue debut album in September 2021 and the LP peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard 200. Keem also released a deluxe for the album in October 2022 featuring assists from Lil Uzi Vert and PinkPantheress.


	Keem will embark on a tour later this month, in support of his sophomore collection. Produced by Live Nation, The Ca$ino Tour opens in North America on April 15 in Raleigh, NC, and hits major cities including Los Angeles, New York, Montreal, Dallas and Atlanta, before coming to a halt June 7 in Boston, MA. 


	The jaunt then shifts to Europe and the United Kingdom from Aug. 31 in Cologne, Germany, and includes shows in Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, London, Glasgow, and more, before wrapping up Sept. 18 in London.

Discovery; Netflix Notes Rival Is “A Long Way” From Getting Regulatory Signoffs — Update","https://deadline.com/2026/02/paramount-clears-us-antitrust-hurdle-warner-bros-discovery-1236730560/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 15:01:00 GMT","


					By Jill Goldsmith 

Co-Business Editor


Paramount has cleared a 10-day waiting period after responding to a second request for information from the DOJ around its unsolicited offer for Warner Bros. Discovery. 


	The company said today that the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act means “there is no statutory impediment in the U.S. to closing” the acquisition. Paramount, unusually, had moved on regulatory approvals without a deal in hand so there is nothing, in fact, to close on. WBD has agreed to a sale of its assets to Netflix.


	In a statement, David Hyman, Netflix's Chief Legal Officer, objected to Par's characterization. “Paramount Skydance continues to mislead stockholders and distract from the facts. The facts are that routine HSR milestones do not signal DOJ approval nor that any decision has been made. They have not secured approvals needed to close and they are a long way from doing so.”

	











	Netflix representatives have been warning investors not to confuse the expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period with regulatory clearance, citing examples where DOJ investigations have continued, per a note from analyst firm Guggenheim this week. Last year, Bill Rinner, then a top DOJ antitrust official, warned of mistakenly believing “that expiration of the statutory waiting period constitutes ‘clearance' or ‘approval' of a transaction.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix is in the process of responding to the DOJ's second request for information, which will be followed by a 30-day waiting period. Deadline understands that the waiting period for all-cash offers like Paramount's is shorter. Paramount's chief legal officer is Makan Delrahim, who led the Justice Department's Antitrust Division in Donald Trump's first term.


	Par has launched a hostile tender offer for $30 a share in cash for all of WBD. The Netflix deal is a mix of cash and stock pegged at $27.75 for Warner Bros. streaming and studio assets. WBD has repeatedly rejected the overtures of the David Ellison company but this past Tuesday the two began seven days of talks giving Paramount an opportunity to address the WBD board's concerns over its latest offer. Most observers believe Paramount will need to pony up more cash.

	











	Warner Bros. has set a March 20 date for shareholders to vote on the deal with Netflix and on setting the process of spinning out Discovery Global.


	The DOJ can still chose to sue to block a deal at any stage. Along with the WBD stockholders and the DOJ, Netflix or Paramount would both require clearances from regulators around the world. The transactions have raised a host of questions and flurries of protest from lawmakers, unions and industry players. 


	Senate Democrats have threatened an investigation of Paramount as they fired off a letter to CEO David Ellison, seeking information on the company's contacts with the Trump administration and the president himself over its attempts acquire WBD.

How about this: neither Netflix or Paramount get to buy Warn Bros. Shut the deals down.

You buy it then 😂

WB is the one that needs buying.

They wouldn't be on sale of they didn't need to be.

Corruption. I hope EU, UK will kill his chances. As well as Democrats will investinge and grill him when they got back in power.

Cool…. but when is Ellison going to testify?

You can't really be a serious contender for a big deal like that if Paramount Skydance's leader doesn't testify about various things like Sarandos already did.

Is David afraid of the questions or something?

He won't have advance notice of those that's for sure.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Donald Trump did not have the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, a rebuff of the president's central economic policy. 


	The court, in a 6-3 opinion (read it here), ruled that the president lacked the justification to impose the tariffs during peacetime.


	Trump had invoked his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs, but the high court ruled that the law did not give him the ability to do so without congressional approval.


	“The President asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. “In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The court found that the Trump administration's interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act unconvincing, concluding that their argument extrapolates sweeping authority from individual words in the law.


	Roberts wrote: “We claim no special competence in matters of economics or foreign affairs. We claim only, as we must, the limited role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution. Fulfilling that role, we hold that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.”


Read the Supreme Court tariff decision.


	Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on overseas movie and TV production, and his authority to do so was in doubt even before Friday's decision. He had cited national security when he originally said that he wanted to impose the levies last May.

	Trump's tariffs had upended global trade, leading to countries like Canada to recalibrate their economic partnerships in response to the punitive actions. The president had reached frameworks of deals with a number of countries, though in many cases the details remained to be worked out.


	The president had insisted that other countries ultimately paid the tariffs, even while many economists insisted that consumers of the imports in the United States ultimately would pay.


	It's unclear what happens to the tens of billions collected from the new tariffs that Trump imposed since taking office. The U.S. collected $264 billion from tariffs last year, per Factcheck.org, more than three times the previous year.

	In a dissenting opinion, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the majority “says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a ‘mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.”


	California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has challenged the tariffs in a state lawsuit, posted on X, “Issue an immediate refund to all Americans for your illegal tax. Now.”


	When the ruling came down, Trump was addressing state governors at a White House meeting, but the press pool was escorted out of the event.


	Ironically enough, the decision might give a boost to the economy, perhaps easing prices at a time when affordability is front and center in the midterm elections. Trump, though, was expected to try to invoke other authority to keep the tariffs active, but the Supreme Court ruling may foreclose other options as well.


	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement, “Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly. We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.”

As Nelson Mandela Muntz Sr.from the Simpson's would say, “Ha-Ha”

Soooo, do we get a refund? I want my money back

So much winning

If the Supreme Court decision does help the economy, Trump will take the credit. Mark my words.

There it is. The people have burn the brunt of the far-reaching tariff costs, and it is not wartime. Ergo, it has been a widespread tax on Americans. Only Congress can pass tax laws. 

This is basic Econ 101. It should never have had to go to the Supreme Court but as this president thinks he's a ruler, not a president, once again, here we are.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


	The BBC has set cast for its Killing Eve prequel Honey. 


	While not yet acknowledging that Honey is a predecessor show to Killing Eve (Deadline brought you that news last year), the BBC has announced Ann Skelly (House of Guinness) in the lead role of Martha Schmitt, alongside Nate Mann (Masters of the Air & Licorice Pizza) as Kurt Fischer, Jannis Niewöhner (Munich: The Edge of War, Napoleon) as Friedrich Bauman, and Rory Kinnear (The Diplomat, The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power) as Graham Anderson.  


	Schmitt is a deep cover agent for MI6. Surrounded by enemies and constantly under threat of her cover being blown, she tries her hardest to avoid detection by Friedrich, the new Stasi Head of Counterespionage against British Targets. Also joining the cast are Oliver Cudbill as Stefan Weiss, Sonita Henry as Anne Anderson, Victoria Mayer as Ingrid Schimmel, Valentino Dalle Mura as Rolf Muller, July Namir as Kamilla Akhmedova, Julian Niedermeier as Otto Kowalski, Sofia Oxenham as Greta Abstreiter and Daniel Zielinski as Tomas Klein.

	The show, which was the first to emerge from the BBC and German network ZDF‘s co-pro partnership, comes from Killing Eve maker Sid Gentle and is penned by Emma Moran. As we revealed last year, Martha Scmitt is in fact a younger Carolyn Martens, who was played with BAFTA-winning aplomb by Fiona Shaw in Killing Eve. In Killing Eve, young Carolyn is played in one ep by Black Mirror actor Imogen Daines, but the BBC has opted for up-and-comer Skelly in Honey, which looks set to be one of its biggest 2026 launches. The BBC has so far declined comment on Honey being the long-gestating Killing Eve prequel.


Honey was commissioned by Lindsay Salt, Director of BBC Drama, for BBC iPlayer and BBC One, and Frank Seyberth, Head of Coproduction, International Fiction, for ZDF. It is made by Sid Gentle Films, part of BBC Studios, for the BBC and ZDF, in association with Fifth Season, which will distribute the series globally. Moran is the lead writer and executive producer. Emme Hoy is also a writer on the series. It is executive produced by Sally Woodward Gentle and Lee Morris for Sid Gentle Films and the producer is Christopher Hall. Toby MacDonald directs episodes 1 – 3 and Michelle Savill directs episodes 4 – 6.

They don't want to admit that it's a Killing Eve prequel because of how they ruined that show in the final season.

I thought the 2nd season was decent

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Editor-In-Chief


UPDATED: Grey's Anatomy has lost one of its own. Eric Dane, one of the venerable ABC medical drama's most popular cast members, died Feb. 19 at the age of 53 after battle with ALS.


	The series is expected to pay tribute to the actor in the upcoming episode next week when Grey's returns after a break.


	Introduced as a guest star in Season 2, Dane became a series regular the following season, playing the beloved character of Mark Sloan aka “McSteamy.” He remained on the show until the Season 9 premiere when Mark, along with Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), died as a result of the plane crash in the Season 8 finale. The characters' presence has remained on the show, as Seattle Grace Mercy West was subsequently renamed Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in their memory.

	Longtime Grey's cast member Kim Raver, who spent three seasons on the show with Dane, remembered the late actor on Instagram.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Eric was a light,” she wrote next to an episodic image of the two of them on Grey's and a red carpet photo of her, Dane and his wife Rebecca Gayheart. “You'd see it effortlessly shine from him on the set of Grey's as well as when he was with Rebecca and the girls. During filming he'd get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you! You will be missed.”


	Fellow veteran Grey's Anatomy cast member Kevin McKidd, who co-starred alongside Dane for four seasons, posted a photo of Dane from his time on the show with the caption, “Rest In Peace Buddy…”

	











	Similarly, original cast member James Pickens Jr., who was on Grey's for Dane's entire tenure, posted a tribute photo with the message “Rest In Peace.”


	Another OG Grey's star, Patrick Dempsey, opted to honor his former colleague by posting a clip from Dane's September video in support of ALS research, in which he says, “I'm Eric. An actor, a father and now a person living with ALS.”


	Dempsey shared memories about Dane, including his final days, on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show Friday morning.


	“He was bedridden and it was very hard for him to swallow, so the quality of his life was deteriorating so rapidly,” Dempsey said. “He was the funniest man – he was such a joy to work with and I want to just remember him in that spirit because any time he was on set, he brought so much fun to it.


Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes, speaking on behalf of her company Shondaland, which produces the show, called Dane “a beloved member of the Shondaland and Grey's Anatomy families.”


	“He was truly a gifted actor whose portrayal of Dr. Mark Sloan left an indelible mark on the series and on audiences around the world,” she wrote in a post next to photos of her and Dane through the years. “We are grateful for the artistry, spirit, friendship and humanity he shared with us for so many years. Our hearts are with his family, loved ones, and all who were touched by his work.”


	Shondaland posted a moving “Celebrating Eric Dane” montage of some of his most memorable moments on Grey's, which you can see below.


	ABC and 20th Television, the studio behind Grey's Anatomy, issued a joint statement Thursday night.


	“We are deeply saddened by the loss of Eric Dane,” the companies said. “His remarkable talent and unforgettable presence on Grey's Anatomy left a lasting impact on audiences around the world, and his courage and grace during his battle with ALS inspired so many. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as the many fans whose lives were touched by his work.”


	Dane and Leigh returned during the pandemic-themed 2020-21 season as part of the beach-themed dream sequences while Covid-stricken Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) was in a coma. Fittingly, it was Mark and Meredith's sister Lexie who ultimately convinced her to fight and choose life, with her coming out of the coma shortly thereafter. 


	In a touching moment from Dane's 2021 return to Grey's Anatomy, Mark addresses in one scene what he misses about being alive and he mentions his daughter Sofia, sharing that he talks to her all the time.


	In an interview with Deadline about his guest appearance, Dane, himself the father of two young daughters, elaborated on Mark's conversations with his daughter from beyond. “Whether she's listening to me or not, you always have somebody looking over you,” he said.

Bad Bunny and Gabriela Berlingeri were spotted out together after reigniting their romance.

The “DtMF” hitmaker was pictured stepping out with Berlingeri in São Paulo, Brazil on Wednesday for dinner. 

The Super Bowl halftime performer went casual in blue jeans and sunglasses paired with a beige ball cap, while Berlingeri rocked a copper floor length dress with a thigh high slit.

Last Thursday, the Puerto Rican musical phenomenon, 31, was spotted on an early Valentine's Day dinner date with Berlingeri, 32, in Buenos Aires. 

Photos obtained by Page Six showed the “Yo Perreo Sola” rapper going incognito outside the restaurant in a checkered face mask, ball cap, and blue hoodie.

Berlingeri followed behind him, walking alongside a restaurant staffer, and wore a brown leather jacket with matching pants for the dinner date.

For that outing, the musician — whose given name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasion — stopped to shake hands with several young fans as Berlingeri waited nearby in a vehicle. 

The pair became the target of reconciliation rumors after Berlingeri attended the Super Bowl, where the “Tití Me Preguntó,” singer headed up the halftime show on Feb. 8.

The duo previously dated off and on from 2017 to 2022.

He also famously dated “The Kardashians” star Kendall Jenner, 30, for nearly a year before their split in December 2023 — though they briefly reconciled in May 2024 before splitting again.

Through it all, the Grammy winner has remained famously tight-lipped about his relationships. 

“They don't know how you feel, they don't know how you live, they don't know anything, and I really don't want them to know,” he told Vanity Fair in 2023, referencing fan interest in his love life. 

“I'm not really interested in clarifying anything because I have no commitment to clarify anything to anyone. I am clear and my friend Jomar … and my mother is clear. They are the only ones to whom I have to clarify anything.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Why Eric Dane's wife, Rebecca Gayheart, withdrew divorce filing after actor's ALS diagnosis","https://pagesix.com/2026/02/19/celebrity-news/why-eric-danes-wife-rebecca-gayheart-withdrew-divorce-filing-after-actors-als-diagnosis/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 04:55:00 GMT","

Rebecca Gayheart withdrew her divorce filing from Eric Dane after the late actor was diagnosed with ALS because she wanted to teach their children to “show up for family.”

The actress explained her decision on the “Broad Ideas” podcast last November, saying that by calling off their divorce, she hoped to teach their daughters, Billie, 15, and Georgia, 13, to be there for their family even “when times are at their worst.”

“We tell them, ‘We show up for people no matter what. He is our family. He is your father,'” Gayheart shared.

The mom of two also said that throughout Dane's diagnosis and navigating their relationship, her main focus was on the girls' well-being and that they felt “taken care of” even though “things are hard and sad and bad.”

The former couple wed in 2004 and after 13 years of marriage, the “Jawbreaker” star filed for divorce in 2018. 

Last March, they called off their divorce after seven years of separation. One month later, the “Grey's Anatomy” star went public with his ALS diagnosis. 

During the November interview, Gayheart, 54, also detailed their “super complicated” dynamic and admitted that she wasn't sure if she was handling the situation “the wrong way or right way” by withdrawing the filing.

“I'm just showing up and trying to be there for [my kids]. I guess time will tell,” she said.

In a vulnerable essay for The Cut published last December, Gayheart said her and Dane's “love may not be romantic, but it's a familial love.”

She also clarified that the two “haven't lived in the same home for eight years.”

Gayheart addressed that they both have had romantic relationships with other people — she's been linked to billionaire Peter Morton and he dated filmmaker Janell Shirtcliff last June — but they regularly see each other for family gatherings.

“This year, the girls and I have spent a lot of time at Eric's house, which is about a 12-minute drive away from our home,” the essay continued. “We have a lot of meals together. We do a lot of drop-by visits — well, I don't just drop by. I always call and say, ‘I'm coming up the hill' or ‘I'm dropping Georgia off.'”

Dane passed away on Thursday, 10 months after announcing his ALS diagnosis. He was 53 years old.

Dane's family shared in a statement to People, “With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS.”

“Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight,” the statement continued. “He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Honor takes a beating in a bruising A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms","https://www.avclub.com/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-recap-season-1-episode-5","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 03:59:00 GMT","

A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms, just like the novellas on which it is based, derives its narrative strength by being told entirely from the perspective of Ser Duncan The Tall (Peter Claffey). Gone are the location jumps and gnarled ensembles that pack full hours of Game Of Thrones and House Of The Dragon. This series appreciates the virtues of smallness, that intimacy can reveal a world far more nimbly than scale. One half hour from the eyes of Ser Dunk is all there is and all there needs to be.

This creative direction has its obstacles: On the page, we read Dunk's thoughts, know his memories as they spring to mind, and infer from those he represses the parts of his life he'd rather not dwell on. On the screen, the showrunner and this episode's co-writer, Ira Parker, must externalize these thoughts and memories in live action, just in case some viewers may have missed all the finer nuances that add up to the great wonder that is Ser Dunk The Lunk.

“In The Name Of The Mother,” the penultimate episode in Parker's agreeably earthy and entertaining debut season, begins and ends with the fateful Trial Of Seven, in which Ser Dunk faces his accuser, Prince Aerion “Brightflame” Targaryen (Finn Bennett), who just one night before tormented an innocent puppeteer and paid for it with a few fists and feet to his royal personage. Aerion rallies his father, Prince Maekar (Sam Spruell), the three Kingsguard who attended his family at the Ashford Meadow tourney, his drunkard brother Daeron (Henry Ashton), and the treacherous Ser Steffon Fossoway (Edward Ashley) to fight against Dunk—who, as we saw last week, had a much tougher time rallying heroes to his cause than the realm's royal house. 

Yet true company arrives, thanks to his squire, Aegon “Egg” Targaryen (Dexter Soll Ansell). He brings Sers Baratheon (Daniel Ings), Beesbury (Danny Collins), Hardyng (Ross Anderson), and Rhysling (William Houston) to fight under Dunk's star-lit standard, joining brave Raymun Fossoway (Shaun Thomas), who offered his sword in service to Dunk and was anointed in the mud. Rounding out Dunk's six champions—to the tourney audience's confusion and/or awe—is Prince Baelor “Breakspear” Targaryen (Bertie Carvel), who declares for Dunk in an act of chivalry so enormous that it could only end in doom. Remember: In Westeros, virtue has a half-life of hours.

It's a thematic point that perhaps explains why this week's episode, so named for a knight's vow to protect the innocent (and a rallying cry for Ser Arlan Of Pennytree, as it happens), takes the added measure of flashing back to a fateful day in Dunk's past just before judgment comes crashing into his present. It's a risky creative choice to pause ser's trial at its most dramatic moment just to show us how Dunk learned how to fight dirty in, as George R.R. Martin's prose puts it, “the shadowy wynds and crooked alleys” of King's Landing, where Dunk grew up. With thorough detail, we're shown what compels Dunk to gather strength enough to beat Prince Aerion, twenty minutes of screentime to express this one line from the novella: “[Aerion] could vanquish Ser Duncan The Tall, but not Dunk Of Flea Bottom.” 

And so, with a swing of Aerion's morningstar, Dunk is sent into a brief, muddy sleep, remembering his last days as a thief in King's Landing. We see him, roughly thirteen years ago, scavenging steel and leather from the fallen knights and renegades upon the Redgrass Field, where the last battle of the first Blackfyre Rebellion was decided. (You'll recall some of its finer details were discussed in song by Egg during “The Squire.”) It was there that Princes Baelor and Maekar formed the hammer and anvil that smashed Daemon I Blackfyre's forces and secured King Daeron's rule for a while longer—now a graveyard and primary source of income for Dunk (Bamber Todd) and Rafe (Chloe Lea). “We'll all be plundering that tomb for a dragon's age,” a fence grumbles to the kids when they bring him their findings. 

They're not just scraping for food; Rafe wants to ferry Dunk across the Narrow Sea for a fresh start in the Free Cities. Their chances of making this lateral move dim in the narrow causeways of Flea Bottom, where drunks and thieves like City Watchman Alester (Edward Davis) bully lowborn like Dunk and Rafe for sport. It's impressive how foul and claustrophobic this part of Flea Bottom looks: Men scream as surgery is done on them in the open; women weep in corners; people stagger into each other, leaving themselves vulnerable to pickpocketing or, as Rafe later learns to Dunk's woe, a strategically thrust dagger. Even the one place Dunk and Rafe find relative peace is below the streets, lower in the world still. 

“What if this is the best there is?” wee Dunk asks his companion, who responds: “That would be quite sad.” Even at this late hour, it's a neat bit of groundwork for Dunk's world philosophy, why protecting people with his size and strength matters to him, and why Ser Arlan (Danny Webb), for all his failings, appealed to him so. “You want a family?” Rafe says. “Go out there and get a family.” We know he does, and now we have the additional knowledge that his found families—made with Ser Arlan and, one day, with Egg—are built on her memory.

Was this time out worthwhile? It depends on your point of view. For those who want literal world-building where this series otherwise takes a subtler approach, “In The Name Of The Mother” provides us the first glimpse at the Blackfyre Rebellion—or at least its aftermath. Considering how little of this Westerosi history was mapped out when Martin wrote The Hedge Knight, filling these gaps brings welcome heft and history. This episode should serve future seasons exploring the many complex Targaryen rifts and the lingering revolts spawned from them. It also reiterates a pervasive theme in this franchise, courtesy of Rafe's quick tale of fellow roughs Pudding and Cedric: Payment for past wrongs always comes with compound interest—if not now, then when one least expects it. “No one forgets shit,” she says. “You hurt someone, they hurt you back.” 

For folks here to see some rock-'em-sock-'em knighttime action, still amped up from Prince Baelor's declaration for all that is just and good last week, this pause will chafe. Everything we learn from this flashback is already present in the series: Dunk seeks family where he can; he was taught to soften his edges for those he cares about; he can be provoked to violence by unchecked cruelty. We've seen all this, know all this. This late into the series, it feels like padding. Still, it's well-directed, well-written padding, rife with narrative echoing: Ser Alran blorfs before protecting Dunk, just as Dunk blorfs before standing up to Prince Aerion; and wee Dunk hoists Ser Arlan's penny-hilted sword just as Egg takes it for practice years later. These added textures of Dunk's origin are appreciated, but at this defining moment? They scrape the nerves of folks spoiling to see the outcome of Dunks' Trial Of Seven. 

Which brings us back to the present, where Dunk rallies with the few commanding words from Ser Arlan we've yet to hear: “Get up.” Up is where Dunk goes, though not without effort (that lance through his side meekened him even before he was unhorsed). The scope of this fight, fittingly, leans on subjectivity instead of choreography. Here, Dunk's point of view is severely diminished by that narrow slit in his helm, and later, one of his eyes is closed shut, so we miss the peripheral thrills one might expect from this fracas (such as Ser Lyonel laughing his way through Maekar's defenses, the Fossoway cousins letting off long-fermenting steam between them, etc). We do see the only moment that counts: Prince Aerion dropping his dragon's facade under Dunk's relentless pummelling, yielding his accusations before all in Ashford Meadow. (Had he not thrown in the towel, would Dunk have risked killing a prince?) 

What we don't see is Maekar's blow to his older brother's head, which crushes Baelor's helm and removes another good man from the realm—one whose life might have changed much for Westeros had it not ended here. The man called “Breakspear” for trouncing the traitor Daemon Blackfyre's armies on the Redgrass Field, who ruled in the name of Daeron “The Good” and would have made a fair and just king himself, dies in service to a hedge knight who reminded him what justice looks like when those who swore to uphold it remember their vows. What might the realm have looked like under the rule of Baelor, second in line to the Iron Throne? We'll never know. In Westeros, much as it is in life, few good deeds go unpunished.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Frederick Wiseman understood the subtle architecture of humanity","https://www.avclub.com/frederick-wiseman-documentaries-systems-humanity","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 07:09:49 GMT","

We meet many people in Frederick Wiseman's films. The crass American diner sticking his face into a plate of haute cuisine and taking a big whiff in Menus-Plaisirs, Les Troisgros. The migrant worker telling a harrowing story about her daughter's journey on foot to America in In Jackson Heights. The Black security guard slowly losing his patience with the racist ranting of an elderly white man in Welfare. The former schoolteacher, naked and shivering, shoved into a bare cell in Titicut Follies. And yet, none of Wiseman's documentaries are really about these individuals.

The Thin Blue Line director and fellow documentary legend Errol Morris used an entomological metaphor to describe Wiseman's work, writing in 2011 that he “has poked his camera into some truly nasty termite pile[s] and watche[d] with bemused satisfaction as the termites scurry around carrying odd parcels and such.” Where many documentarians would zoom in to focus on one particularly industrious (or lazy) insect, Wiseman could see the whole colony. 

His films are about people in general, their follies and worries and the things they do to get through the day. He loved to film closeups of faces, cutting between the individuals in a crowd as they reacted to a speech or a performance or a long-winded lecture from a teacher or a supervisor or a judge. But why, his films ask, do they carry these specific burdens, and why do they cope with them in the ways that they do? That's where the systems come in. 

It was not some sick fetish for bureaucracy that drove Wiseman's interest in the workings of institutions both seemingly frivolous (he documented the rarified worlds of both modeling and ballet, although he always found meaning in them in the end) and unbearably heavy (1989's Near Death is particularly sobering). Rather, he wanted to understand how the systems we live in shape human behavior, influencing the way we think and feel about the world. Heartbreaking moments are interspersed with silly ones—Wiseman loved a singing telegram—forming complete portraits of humanity in miniature.

Wiseman's 1975 masterpiece Welfare is a prime example. Early in this sprawling (yet relatively compact, compared to his later work) documentary, the employees at the New York City welfare office profiled in the film seem callous and unfeeling, denying desperate people emergency assistance on minor technicalities. But as Welfare wears on and the sheer scale of the poverty on display—not to mention the brokenness of the system supposed to address it—becomes apparent, it also becomes clear that the office workers are not sadists who revel in the suffering of others. They simply have no incentive to alleviate it. 

Although it's subtle, the editing in that film reveals Wiseman's personal feelings about the welfare system. In his later years, the filmmaker dismissed the more obvious commentary found in his early work as “heavy-handed.” But although he doubled down on his strict verité style over the subsequent decades—Frederick Wiseman documentaries have no interviews, no archival footage, and no narration—the very act of choosing what to include, what to condense, and what to leave out of his documentaries was itself an elegant form a storytelling. He was a master of the wraparound structure, and even when his subjects are tedious, his films are fascinating.

Famously uncompromising and independent, Wiseman refused to alter either the reality of the situations he was filming—in 2005, he admitted to Werner Herzog that he might illuminate a room if it was too dark, but that was about it—or the resulting work. His debut Titicut Follies was banned in Massachusetts from 1967 to 1991, and one of his films, 2004's The Garden, was shelved due to copyright issues. (Madison Square Garden sued; he countersued; the film remains unreleased.) For decades, the only way to see one of Frederick Wiseman's movies outside of its initial run was to write a letter to the director's own Zipporah Films, which would decide whether it would lend out one of the 16mm prints in its possession for an officially sanctioned screening. In 2007, he began selling individual titles on DVD through the Zipporah Films website. In 2018, Zipporah made a deal to make Wiseman's films accessible through the library-based streaming service Kanopy, but it took until 2023 to digitize all 45 of them.

Why was a filmmaker who was equally interested in the highest and lowest echelons of society so resistant for so long to making his work more widely accessible? The answer may lie in the work. Watch a couple of Frederick Wiseman documentaries, and it becomes obvious that no one understood the ways that individual people work within systems, and how those systems flatten and dehumanize them in turn, better than he did. Perhaps he was afraid of what might happen, to him and to his work, if he entered more deeply into his nearest system: the film industry. After all, he was only one man.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Netflix's Strip Law argues its case loudly and unconvincingly","https://www.avclub.com/strip-law-review-netflix-tv-adult-animation","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 08:05:17 GMT","

Strip Law saunters into a moment when adult animation still seems determined to prove its own uselessness. That's a shame, because the form is truly capable of more than giving us a gorilla eating spaghetti, amusing as that absolutely is when one appears here. It's just one of countless non-sequiturs you can expect from this series by Cullen Crawford (Star Trek: Lower Decks, the functionally similar cop cartoon Paradise PD), a mile-a-minute joke machine that seems designed to fear dead air. Its cadence is not dissimilar to one of those talk-radio shows from Grand Theft Auto, where characters disgorge profane inanities and scarcely let them land before the dial jerks violently to the next bit. (One lawyer calls for a “dia-recess” in court, for example.)  

This is the latest slickly produced, low-calorie Netflix cartoon confection, boasting a roster of aggressively unlikeable characters—appropriate, given most are lawyers in a Rockstar-flavored version of Las Vegas—voiced by a stacked-deck cast. It's too busy cracking wise to delve into Crawford's law-and-order-in-no-man's-land setup and even busier cramming in dusty pop-culture references (Austin Powers and “Cornholio” get several nods) to land a sharp satirical point or establish a distinctive personality. It does, if nothing else, bring millennial humor screaming into middle age, and the results are sometimes more depressing than hilarious. 

The premise is very solid, though. Attorney Lincoln Gumb (Adam Scott), shit-canned from respectable Steve Nichols (Keith David) & Associates, opens a scrappy practice of his own called Gumblegal with his muscle-bound niece Irene (Aimee Garcia) and hapless, frequently license-less lawyer Glem Blorchman (Stephen Root). Set professionally and financially adrift in Las Vegas, Lincoln is temperamentally unsuited to practice law in the city. But with Gumblegal hemorrhaging cash, he's forced to spice up his act. Salvation arrives in Sheila Flambé (Janelle James), a street magician and self-proclaimed “three-year all-county sex champion” who possesses the showmanship that Vegas courtrooms tend to favor over, say, law and precedent. 

Lincoln's issues go deeper than his lack of stage presence. He's chronically depressed and cowers behind a superiority complex toward the very city that sustains him. It's an intriguingly sour foundation for a comedy and opens up all sorts of character-rich possibilities, although Strip Law rarely takes the time to mine Lincoln's problems beyond quick digs at his desperate mommy issues. (That said, “We Need To Talk About Heaven,” easily the best episode, flirts with his spiritual doubt and gives the series some desperately needed story oomph late in the season.) More often, Lincoln and his team force through jokes with relentless hyper-confidence to the point that some viewers may eventually grow numb to what's really being said underneath the snark. Take the B-plot of the fourth episode, “Glemtastrophe: Anatomy Of A Glemsaster,” where a judge, nearing retirement, wants to set the world record for most cases presided over, compelling Lincoln and Sheila to power through twenty hearings in a matter of days. They hurtle over endless setups and punchlines with such agitation that most of their storyline is ultimately reduced to noise.  

 

The four leads are usually sequestered to their own micro-arcs. Irene, ashamed of her sustained belief in Santa Claus, tries her hand at millennial adulting, complete with a Yeti sippy cup, floppy fashion hat, and deep vocal fry. Glem faces a life-questioning slot machine that turns out to be a dismissible super-criminal ruse. Lincoln gets a big episode coaching a junior basketball team only to find that, unlike The Mighty Ducks and The Bad News Bears, his crew of homeschooled kids isn't composed of underdog heroes but something more socially hostile, so he embraces their inner rage. Amid all this belligerent anti-introspection, the show introduces Kevin (Matt Apodaca) midseason as its straight-man paralegal, a decision that tacitly acknowledges what the show rarely admits outright: that its main characters are caustic assholes and hard to appreciate on their own.

The series hosts an impressive lineup of comedic talent—Lower Decks' Lauren McGuire, Swan Boy's Branson Reese (who wrote “Heaven”), Colbert scribe Daniel Kibblesmith—and there's the sense that being in the writers' room was probably a hoot. What ends up on the screen, however, smacks of creative overexertion, that every gag has to land harder than the last, even as the world being sketched around them remains empty and satirically inert. Strip Law tries to spike a similar vein of cultural nihilism as BoJack Horseman, hinting at the ambivalence of the American legal system and the social apathy that it engenders while ignoring the pathos that made that show effective. It also attempts some of the surreal, sinful textures found in scuzzier adult animation like Ralph Bakshi's Felix The Cat or Heavy Traffic, but Strip Law‘s animation is too clean and precise.

There are more promising examples of experimentation further into the season, like in “The People Vs. Magicians Vs. Animals: Dawn Of Justice: Whoever Wins… TA-DA!,” where Lincoln and Sheila scrounge up dirt on their latest case by going private investigator. This genre playfulness is a great use of the series' detail-heavy background design. It employs the stuff you'd hope to see from a noir playground: deep shadows, neon hues, and foreboding locales like a dingy office where light filters through venetian blinds or a desert at dusk that expresses national desolation in a way the show is usually too cool to acknowledge. If the series advances a thesis, it's that the law is a farce, so why not make it fun? Fair enough. But satire, even manic stuff like this, needs perspective just as much as joke velocity. Strip Law stands accused of biffing a solid concept, though its enthusiasm in doing so is hardly a crime.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Whitest Kids U' Know's animated film Mars finally has a trailer","https://www.avclub.com/whitest-kids-u-know-mars-full-trailer","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 02:40:23 GMT","

Few movies of recent vintage have had a longer or bumpier road to getting made than Mars, the first (and reportedly last) full feature-length movie from cult sketch comedy group The Whitest Kids U' Know. Originally conceived back in 2012—shortly after the group's IFC sketch series went off the air—the film has faced numerous hardships to getting made, none more obvious, or seemingly insurmountable, than the death of the group's co-founder, Trevor Moore, in 2021. Now, though, the animated movie is finally gearing up to get a limited run in theaters and a wide release on physical media and VOD, complete with a trailer that starts with a close-up of a character very clearly modeled on, and played by, Moore. (Who completed his voice work for the film several years ago.)

﻿

Mars had a debut at the Tribeca Film Festival back in 2024, although reviews for the film seemed fairly mixed. (If more positive than the response to the previous film that Moore made with fellow WKUK Zach Cregger, 2009's widely excoriated Miss March.) Featuring voice performancess from Moore, Cregger, Sam Brown, Timmy Williams, and Darren Trumeter—with the group having crowdfunded the film personally—the movie was directed by Sevan Najarian, and focuses on a guy who wins a trip to Mars from an eccentric Richard Branson-esque billionaire (Moore). 

The group is currently gearing up to tour Mars with Q&As at Alamo Drafthouses in locations across the country. (Would the film be getting quite this treatment if Cregger hadn't become one of the biggest names in horror over the last several years, courtesy of Barbarian and Weapons? Hard to say, although the Whitest Kids U' Know fanbase has remained both faithful and extremely vocal in the decade-plus since the show went off the air.) Mars is slated to release on BluRay on March 10.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Pitt's latest hour stresses the importance of communication","https://www.avclub.com/the-pitt-recap-season-2-episode-7-100-p-m","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 03:05:21 GMT","

We think of the ER as a place where actions matter most, where the fastest surgical hands or the right intubation is the difference between life and death. But the truth is, it's also a place where words are just as important. Logistically, communication matters: Each trauma case begins with a verbal report from the paramedics and an exam where the doctors and nurses shout out stats in order to get on the same page. But words also matter emotionally too. When Robby tells Mel he's been training residents for years and she's one of the best, she practically blossoms before his eyes. When he tells Langdon that he's not sure he wants him working in his ER anymore, you can almost literally see the confidence drain from Langdon's body. 

Like most episodes of The Pitt, “1:00 P.M.” is filled with gruesome injuries and ongoing medical mysteries. But—building off the staff's lovely eulogy for Louie—it's the power of communication that truly takes center stage this week. In the most literal sense, our deaf patient is dealing with the logistical nightmare of not being able to properly communicate with her doctors when the hospital's video relay interpreter system glitches. But there are tons of other nuances of communication at play too.  

Legally, Dana's role as a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) is about knowing how to collect a complete, uncontaminated rape kit. But it's even more so about knowing how to speak to her patient Alana in a way that puts her agency and humanity first. As medical shows like Grey's Anatomy have also highlighted over the years, the process of collecting a rape kit feels unfairly invasive to assault survivors. The only thing that can help with that burden is the calm, empathetic, but also professional way the examiner conducts it. Here Dana continually emphasizes that Alana is in control, that she only has to file a police report if she wants to, and that she can take all the time and space she needs throughout the process—which she does as she starts to panic about the fallout of accusing a drunken member of her friend group of rape. 

The SANE storyline is by far the most compelling part of an episode that otherwise returns this season to its slightly all-over-the-place baseline. While the idea of the hospital shutting down all its tech to prevent an impending cyberattack is a great hook to send us into the back half of the season, we get a somewhat scattered transitional episode to bring us there first. That starts with reintroducing Robby's bestie/night shift attending Dr. Abbot in perhaps the most confusing way possible—strolling into the ER in a SWAT uniform while treating his gunshot wound victim co-worker. 

We eventually learn that Abbot has taken up a side job as a SWAT physician, after his therapist suggested he needs a “hobby.” But while that sort of tracks with his history as a war vet, I could have used way more communication about what actually happened with the SWAT team. I guess “something went wrong in an armed robbery at a goods warehouse” is enough, but I couldn't quite get a grasp on what had actually unfolded there. (Did the robbers barricade themselves inside until SWAT was called? Were they killed after they shot an officer?) Or maybe I just don't love the vibe of Abbot randomly becoming a hero cop for no discernible reason. 

Regardless, his return to the show is most interesting for another moment of communication: his first meeting with Al-Hashimi. It turns out she also spent time in the Middle East, specifically in Kabul with Médecins Sans Frontières (a.k.a. French Doctors Without Borders) and at the maternity hospital in Dashte Barchi in 2020, which Abbott notes was “a tragedy.” As I only discovered while researching for this recap, a suicide attack targeting the maternity ward killed 16 mothers and 8 children on May 12, 2020.

Though the show hasn't yet delved into the details for those who don't know about the real-life attack, it's a crucial reveal in the slow parsing of who Al-Hashimi is. Her time in Dashte Barchi presumably explains her odd reaction to Baby Jane Doe in the season premiere. And for the first time since that moment, we see another crack in her composed exterior. Talking with Jackson's parents about their son's mental-health issues sends her to the bathroom in a slight panic, where she calls her therapist to try to get an appointment with him as soon as possible. 

Whatever is specifically going on with her, at least her impulse is to try to talk it out rather than bury it down as so many of our doctors and their patients do. Samira's diabetes patient Orlando Diaz can't bear to tell his family that he's already $100,000 in medical debt. Instead, he just ditches the hospital to try to avoid any more bills. Similarly, the sister of our troubled college student Jackson is shocked and frustrated to only just now learn that her uncle committed suicide rather than drank himself to death like her parents told her. As Javadi reminds her, “Some families just have a difficult time talking about mental health.” 

Of course, The Pitt doesn't suggest that communication is the be-all, end-all solution to every problem. Though cancer patient Roxie has a clear sense that she wants to stay in the hospital rather than return to at-home hospice care, she's struggling to get her husband and kids to understand her perspective. And Langdon's attempts to make amends with Robby obviously don't go so well either. But starting those hard conversations at least provides a sense of forward momentum that awkward elevator rides and repressed feelings never will.  

Maybe the healthiest conversation in the whole episode is actually the sweet, unexpected one between Samira and Abbot, who she finds stitching himself up in Orlando Diaz's empty room. She gets to unburden herself about her stress over her patient, which Abbot solves by offering to pay for an Uber to drop off the necessary home care supplies at his house. And he finds someone who will help stitch up his wound without going through the rigmarole of official paperwork.  

Supriya Ganesh and Shawn Hatosy have great quiet chemistry together. And—much like the scene where Santos fills Robby in on everything Whitaker is juggling at the moment—it's a lovely reminder that The Pitt still has so many character combos it has yet to fully explore across these two madcap shifts. Of course, we've still got our central pairings in the mix too. Robby seems notably upset that Al-Hashimi is the one who got called up to have the convo about the hospital shutting down its computers. But as the ER goes analog next week, who knows what kinds of new conversations that crisis will bring out.

Longtime Hallmark actress and director Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe underwent a double (or bilateral) mastectomy on February 19, 2026 — the second major step in her treatment plan for stage 3 breast cancer. 

An update on Lowe's condition had not been made public by the evening of her operation, but a double mastectomy can take many hours and may require several nights in the hospital, per the Cleveland Clinic. 

On the morning of Lowe's surgery, her Hallmark bestie, “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” co-star Kristin Booth, posted a black-and-white sketch of a woman's torso in her Instagram Stories and wrote, “My dearest friend @officialcrystallowe is currently undergoing a double mastectomy. All positive energy and prayers are welcome. Thank you.” 

Lowe, 45, first revealed her cancer diagnosis to fans in October 2025 as she was beginning four months of chemotherapy treatments. She's documented her journey on social media and insisted on working throughout her infusions, from directing a movie remotely from her cancer center to filming a new project in between the end of chemo and her surgery. 

Lowe has leaned on her family for support, including husband Miko Tomasevich and their two young kids. But she has also shared repeatedly how grateful she's been for the love from her Hallmark family, from friends bringing food or driving her to chemo to the Hallmark Media team purchasing a new victory bell for her cancer center. Lowe got choked up while becoming the first one to ring it after her final chemo infusion in January. 

On the day before her surgery, Lowe posted a video from her car and admitted, “There are so many emotions, I can't even wrap my brain around it.” In the caption of her post, she wrote that “every time I'm onto the next adventure it feels so scary.” 

The “Shifting Gears” director previously shared that she'd undergo a double mastectomy on February 19 to remove the tumor and all surrounding tissue in her right breast. Her left breast will also be removed to decrease the chance of recurrence and to help her eventual reconstruction with implants look symmetrical.

In a video post on February 10, Lowe told her Instagram followers, “I'm not gonna lie, I am, like, so sad to lose my boobs and also so happy to get rid of this cancer and actually get a pathology report so I actually know what's going on.”

After a mastectomy, pathologists closely examine a tumor and the tissue around it to determine if all of the cancer was removed with “clear margins,” according to the Mayo Clinic. It can take up to a week for results and for next steps to be determined, but Lowe has already said her team anticipates her needing radiation post-surgery.

Eric Dane delivered one of the most moving performances of his career in what became his final television appearance, earning a rare 10-minute standing ovation from cast and crew on NBC's “Brilliant Minds,” according to Variety.

The actor, who passed at 53 on Feb. 19, 2026, appeared in a November 2025 episode of the freshman medical drama, portraying a firefighter living with ALS. The role carried deep personal meaning. Earlier in 2025, Dane publicly shared his own ALS diagnosis and expressed his intention to continue working. His commitment to storytelling remained central to his identity.

Variety reported that after filming an emotional scene, the cast and crew stood and applauded Dane for nearly 10 minutes. Series creator Michael Grassi told the outlet that the moment reflected the authenticity and heart that Dane brought to the role.

Dane played Matthew, a first responder navigating the realities of a life-altering diagnosis. According to Variety, Grassi said Dane infused the episode with lived experience and emotional truth. The storyline focused on resilience, family, and strength, themes that resonated both on and off screen.

People reported that colleagues praised Dane's professionalism and openness throughout production. Co-star Mädchen Amick told the publication she felt honored to work alongside him and described his presence as inspiring.

Dane also spoke publicly about continuing his career. Page Six reported that during a December 2025 panel hosted by I Am ALS, he reaffirmed his desire to keep acting. He told the audience that he remained grateful for the ability to perform and share meaningful stories.

His performance on “Brilliant Minds” quickly became one of the season's most talked-about episodes. Viewers responded to the sincerity he brought to the role, and industry peers noted the depth and dignity of his portrayal.

Dane first rose to prominence as Dr. Mark Sloan on “Grey's Anatomy,” where his charismatic performance helped make the long-running series a cultural touchstone. His character became a fan favorite and solidified his status as a leading television star.

He later expanded his range with complex roles, including Cal Jacobs on HBO's “Euphoria.” Critics praised his layered performances and willingness to explore emotionally challenging material.

According to People, friends and collaborators remembered Dane as dedicated, collaborative, and deeply passionate about his craft. Even as he navigated personal challenges, he focused on meaningful work and advocacy.

Just two months before actor Eric Dane died on February 19, 2026, the “Grey's Anatomy” and “Euphoria” alum announced he was writing his memoir, titled “Book of Days: A Memoir in Moments.”

Dane, who was 53 at the time of his death, chose to work on his memoir with journalist Maria Shriver's publishing imprint at Penguin Random House, The Open Field. 

According to the book announcement on December 8, Dane wanted to write about the moments in his life that “have meant the most,” including his daughters' births, his first day on the “Grey's Anatomy” set, the day he decided to get sober, how and when he was diagnosed with ALS, “and that hopeful day in the future when ALS is finally cured.”

It's not clear how far along Dane was with his writing, but in a beautiful tribute hours after his death, Shriver said that she is still committed to telling his story. 

It's not clear how far along Dane was with his writing, but in a beautiful tribute hours after his death, Shriver said that she is still committed to telling his story. Hours after his death on February 19, Shriver posted a photo of him on social media and wrote that his death would not keep her imprint from publishing his book. 

“I'm heartbroken by this devastating news about Eric Dane,” she wrote. “What a tragedy. He was so heroic the way he handled his diagnosis. He used his voice to let the world know what it was like living with ALS.”

Shriver continued, “I was honored he chose my publishing imprint to publish his memoir. He told me he wanted his family to know how much he loved them, and he wanted to leave them a story they could be proud of. My love goes out to his family, and to all those battling this cruel disease, as well as all those caring for somone battling it.”

She then confirmed the memoir will not die with him, writing, “Godspeed, Eric. It was an honor to know you, and we will honor your story. ♥️”

When Dane and Shriver announced their publishing partnership in December, she posted on social media how grateful she was that Dane chose to work on his 2026 book with her and her team, writing, “It is indeed an honor to publish @realericdane's new memoir about his account of being diagnosed with ALS and how he is dealing with it.” 

“I'm so humbled and honored that he chose @openfieldbooks to publish his important story,” Shriver continued, calling it “an imprint known for publishing bestselling books that rise above the noise and move humanity forward.”

“I cannot wait for the world to read his story and learn more about his intention and his goals,” she wrote before adding, “Thank you for entrusting me with your story, Eric!”

In a statement about the book to People when it was first announced, Dane said, “I wake up every morning, and I'm immediately reminded that this is real — this illness, this challenge and that's exactly why I'm writing this book.”

Dane added, “I want to capture the moments that shaped me — the beautiful days, the hard ones, the ones I never took for granted — so that if nothing else, people who read it will remember what it means to live with heart. If sharing this helps someone find meaning in their own days, then my story is worth telling.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Eric Dane's Final Post Before His Passing Proves He Fought ALS Head On","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/eric-dane-final-post-before-passing-als/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 02:54:20 GMT","

Eric Dane fought a brave battle against ALS until his passing at age 53. Before he passed, the “Grey's Anatomy” star joined the Target ALS Board of Directors.

In December 2025, Target ALS shared in a joint Instagram post with Dane that the beloved actor had joined their Board of Directors. 

“We're proud to share an important announcement: Eric Dane (@realericdane) has joined the Target ALS Board of Directors, deepening his commitment to accelerating ALS research and driving meaningful change for the ALS community,” the non-profit announced on December 18.

The statement continued, “Diagnosed in 2024, Eric has become a powerful advocate for progress, lending his voice to our ‘Ending ALS Starts With You' campaign and even portraying a character living with ALS on NBC's ‘Brilliant Minds' to raise awareness. His decision to join our Board reflects the same relentless spirit he brings to his personal journey.”

“Eric's voice and leadership will add a vital new perspective to this diverse and dedicated group,” Target ALS continued. “We're honored to welcome Eric to the Board as we work together to accelerate discovery and change what it means to receive an ALS diagnosis.”

At the time, the “Euphoria” star released a statement saying, “This disease takes something from me every day. But I won't let it take my spirit. Target ALS embodies that spirit, and that's why I'm joinging the Board…This community deserves effective treatments, and I want to do my part to deliver them.”

Dane passed away on Thursday, February 19, his family confirmed in a statement to People.

“With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS,” the statement read. “He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world. Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time.”

Dane—who first announced his ALS diagnosis in April 2025—leaves behind a wife, actress Rebecca Gayheart, and two daughters, Billie and Georgia.

“Strip Law,” like the ideal Las Vegas experience, flies by in a blur. I mean that mostly as a compliment, considering creator Cullen Crawford's animated series — about a stodgy attorney who, to better serve his debased Sin City clientele, reinvents himself as a courtroom showman — aspires to be little more than a pleasing distraction. 

Sure, given the state of things, it could function as an allegory for America: The same outrageous, all-consuming ruckus that once made The Strip a no-brains-allowed vacation destination has spread beyond the desert oasis to sports bars and living rooms across the country. Now that citizens can stare dumbfounded into the same distracting bright lights (and gambling gateways) via ever-present screens, the whole of the United States has essentially transformed into the hellscape once confined to Nevada's southern tip.

But Netflix‘s original comedy (produced by Underground and Titmouse Inc.) isn't interested in allegories. Not really. It's interested in spectacle, absurdity, and laughs, and it's invested in holding your attention, despite ample temptations elsewhere. Over the course of its 10-episode first season, it does just enough to earn all four, making it an odd little success for anyone in need of an escape.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






To its credit, “Strip Law” wastes no time setting expectations. Clocking in under 40 seconds, the opening title sequence tells you everything you need to know as it races through an introduction to the show's (slightly) heightened setting. A night out in Vegas. Glowing sign after glowing sign. There's the Canadian nightclub, “Calgary Calgary,” a hot dog stand in Old Vegas named “Ye Olde Hotte Dogue,” and a local grocer called “SeXXXual Grocery Store” (complete with a picture of suggestive plums and a sign with just the words, “Big Melons”). Ads are everywhere, whether it's a billboard for Circumcisions by Elvis (“Let the King do his thing”) or Carrot Bottom Live (a topless carrot — there's no torso — with two orange sticks for legs and a disturbing butt primed for the juicer).

Even the cast is introduced via marketing posters. Lincoln Gumb (voiced by Adam Scott) and Sheila Flambe (Janelle James) share a banner looming over a seedy streetcorner, a fitting overture for an odd couple whose unique attributes complement each other perfectly. Gumb, the son of a heralded local attorney, knows the ins and outs of the law well, but his monotone presentation flat-lines in front of a judge and jury. He needs a little pizzazz, a little style, a little showmanship to connect with a city that's grown accustomed to 24/7 entertainment.

 










Enter Sheila, a street magician blackballed by the local boys club who wows Lincoln with her tips-only act. “I've got my mom's lawyer smarts,” Lincoln says. “You've got her razzle-matazzle.” Together, they can book clients and win cases within the… unique environs of a Vegas courtroom. (One judge doles out damages with a Dr. Evil impression. Another gets beheaded with a guillotine.) It's a crazy gambit for a crazy world, and it just might work!

OK, not always, but the premise and setting form a sturdy-enough foundation for the madness to come. With more than a wink toward its TV genre — the pilot is titled “Finally, a Show About Lawyers” and the finale is deranged “Franklin & Bash” fan-fiction (or anti-fan fiction?) — “Strip Law” knows it's the ridiculous cousin to “Night Court” and “Ally McBeal.” But rather than let meta references guide the plot, the half-hour sitcom takes off on wild tangents that are easy to get lost in, even when that's not the main intention.

Everything contributes to the show's unrelenting pace, which is overwhelming no matter how closely you track the shenanigans. A little more time and attention toward character development could help viewers form a connection with the cast (who, led by voice-acting MVPs James and Stephen Root, do a bang-up job elevating the farce and landing their punchlines). Plus, seeding stories with personal growth needn't get in the way of “Strip Law's” modus operandi of nonstop chaos — in an ungrounded animated sitcom, they don't even have to age, let alone change. We just need something substantial to hold onto amid all the swirling sands.

 










Still, an unchecked imagination has its own charms. When the “Strip Law” title brightens the top of a taxi cab to close its credits sequence, the ad's tagline states, “Proudly made by real, non-computer human beings.” As much is clear in the vivid animation, layered jokes, and peculiar fixations — an endearing combination that heightens what could've been a forgettable series.

While I'm sure artificial intelligence can churn out something as eerily repulsive as Episode 6's haunting spoof of The California Raisins — Nevada Grown Dates, whose hyper-sexualized artistic rendering and regular presence on local TV is credited for Vegas residents' “near-constant state of aggressive horniness” — it wouldn't know to go there in the first place, and it definitely wouldn't find the humor Crawford & Co. lace into the freakishly indelible parody. 

Just like the city it satirizes, “Strip Law” works just fine, so long as you're ready for the trip.

“Strip Law” premieres Friday, February 20 on Netflix. All 10 episodes will be released at once.

In 2026, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the daily deluge of stupidity. There's the White House and its malicious megaphone of mindlessness; the generative AI advocates and their pushy, pathetic ploys; the Major League Baseball owners and their dedication to self-destruction. So much of it would be laughable if it wasn't also ruinous, which makes the whole endeavor that much more exhausting. 

The luckiest among us endure these quotidian absurdities indirectly, via news stories and social media feeds, their consequences delayed until sometime in the future. But for the good folks cruelly targeted by ICE and the skilled workers inexcusably pushed out by bots, I can only imagine it feels like being trapped in a vice of vacuity, where an unbearable pressure of preposterous origins grows tighter with every lie accepted as truth, every known fraudster anointed as a power broker, and every imagined reality treated as if it exists within the bounds of reason.

Related Stories Tributes Pour in for Eric Dane: Sam Levinson, ‘Grey's Anatomy' Alumni, I AM ALS, and Many More Mourn Loss of Star ‘Strip Law' Review: Adam Scott's Chaotic Animated Netflix Series Is as Deliriously Distracting as Sin City 

HBO's “Portobello” elicits the same feeling. Marco Bellocchio‘s six-episode Italian-language drama is a living nightmare of the past that doubles as an agonizing manifestation of the present — a potent reminder that widespread stupidity isn't confined to a single time or place.

 










In telling the true story of Enzo Tortura — a beloved Italian TV host (played here by Fabrizio Gifuni) who, in 1985, was baselessly convicted of peddling cocaine for the mafia — “Portobello” plays out chronologically, starting with an hour-plus appreciation of Enzo's biggest success: the Italian variety program of the same name. Airing on Rai 2 (Radio Television Italy), “Portobello” features segments with inventors, musicians, and a pet parrot. Auditions include a woman who can cry on cue, clowns looking to start a circus for the elderly, and an illusionist specializing in building a house of cards (the latter of which “Portobello” returns to as a blunt, insufficient metaphor for Enzo's precarious court case). 

“What's wrong with feel-good stories?” Enzo poses to a reporter. “I'm not asking you, [but] I'd like to ask all these snobs, all these people who judge my show as provincial tear-jerking fluff.” The fluff, after all, is selling: Ratings are sky-high, and the network wants to renew “Portobello” for an extended run. 

But outside the comforting confines of a TV set, the government is cracking down on crime — or they're trying to. The Camorra criminal organization is responsible for hundreds of murders across Italy, and the citizens are fed up. Just as they want to escape into a feel-good show every night, they want arrests, convictions, and security every day — the perfect conditions for paranoia to run rampant. 

 










Giovanni Pandico (played by Lino Musella, who HBO subscribers may recognize from “Gomorrah” and “My Brilliant Friend”) sees the dominos start to fall first-hand. Sentenced to multiple life sentences for multiple murders, the low-level Camorra member fancies himself as someone well above his station. He wants nothing more than to be taken seriously, to be respected, to be valued. But he isn't a serious person, he's too cruel to respect, and he contributes nothing of value. His claim to fame is serving as a typist for a Camorra boss nicknamed “The Professor,” but facts don't matter to Giovanni. Not when he can feel like a big man by making up his own stories, his own history, his own reality.

Despite his character's transparency, Musella's performance is mesmerizing. He so firmly believes his own lies — and so clearly enjoys telling them — that you can't wait to see what he'll come up with next. For the first hour, it's unclear why “Portobello” is bouncing between Giovanni the prisoner and Enzo the TV star (played by Fabrizio Gifuni). Their stories have zero overlap. How could they? One is a serial killer, the other an Italian Mr. Rogers. 

But Giovanni watches “Portobello,” too, and he builds a grudge against Enzo for insults and slights that exist solely in his head. Watching his resentment build is hilarious up until the moment it's taken seriously. By the time Giovanni gets the chance to sour Enzo's good name, there's no question that he'll seize it. The only question is why anyone would listen, especially when his lies extend to the absurd. “Yes, he's involved, too,” the man known as “The Lunatic” tells the cops. “Even the parrot's involved?” they reply. “Affirmative,” he says. 

 










And they believe him. From there, the series largely lives in Enzo's head, stretching his increasingly infuriated perspective to a nearly intolerable degree. At first, Enzo is merely annoyed. He knows the charges against him aren't true and believes the lack of evidence will clear his name. But even without proof, the only truth the authorities recognize stems from unfounded accusations, and Enzo is soon embroiled in a scandal where the burden of proof is reversed. 

The convicted criminals accusing him of dealing drugs aren't expected to prove their claims. Instead, Enzo is expected to prove that their claims can't be true. It would be like if you walked into a police station and said, “This man killed my brother,” and they threw the man in jail without even asking if you had a brother to begin with. 

Understandably, Enzo's irritation morphs into disbelief, his disbelief curdles into anger, and his anger nearly consumes him. Whether it does (or did, given the series is based on Tortura's memoir) is a question “Portobello” wisely leaves hanging. Just as there's no obvious escape for Enzo — no mistake he could've avoided or opportunity he failed to grasp — there's no obvious fix for us, either. The only answer to stupidity is enlightenment, and when enlightenment is ignored, someone is bound to suffer.

 










At times in “Portobello,” it feels like that “someone” is us. The series' middle stretch contains plenty of redundancies, especially in the courtroom scenes, and witnessing so much needless torment is tough to endure when it exists off-screen, too. Whereas the original variety show was a delightful escape during a difficult time, HBO's “Portobello” doubles down on that difficulty. Warnings about considering con-men and their bad-faith contentions are important, of course, they're just also all too familiar. 

“Portobello” premieres Friday, February 20 on HBO Max.

If the philosophy of Guillermo del Toro‘s take on “Frankenstein” can be summed up in one line, it comes at the point in del Toro‘s film where Jacob Elordi's creature says to his creator, Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac), “I'm not something, I'm someone.” Long before the line was enshrined as a tag line on Netflix billboards and posters promoting “Frankenstein,” the film's makers looked to it as a guiding principle for their work.

That's particularly true of the Academy Award-nominated sound team that was tasked with bringing Frankenstein's creature — not monster in del Toro's empathetic vision — to life. “We plotted a path dramatically through the movie, where he would go from being the something that we meet at the beginning and turn into someone at the end,” supervising sound editor Nathan Robitaille told IndieWire.

That meant blending Elordi's voice (both from production sound and extensive ADR work) with various animal noises and other sounds in a carefully calibrated balance that shifted throughout the film to subtly chart the creature's developing humanity. Working out of Sound Dogs in Toronto, Robitaille collaborated with Company 3 re-recording mixer Christian Cooke to create layer upon layer of tracks that used sound as a storytelling and character-building tool

When we first meet the creature, he's presented essentially as Victor Frankenstein sees him, as an animalistic being. Appropriately, the “Frankenstein” sound team was at their most aggressive in these early moments. “In the beginning, we don't know who this is or where it came from,” Cooke said. “That gave us more leeway to add sound effects layers to his exertions. But as we realize who he is, we dial those sounds down because we want his own persona to come through, as opposed to embellishing it.”

 










The creature's journey from animal to man is more subtle than a straightforward erasure of the animal sounds, as Robitaille wanted the shift to feel natural and subliminal. “Chris had everything under a fader so he could creep the creature sounds in when he wanted to without it becoming really noticeable,” Robitaille said. “It would have been inelegant if he were just a normal man all the time and then the monster came out every time he roared.”

Indeed, even though Elordi sounds more human as the film progresses, del Toro told the sound department he wanted the actor's voice to have a low growl in his chest for the duration of the movie. To achieve that, supervising sound editor Nelson Ferreira recorded Elordi's ADR at a high resolution of 96K to enable Robitaille to push and distort the voice without adding artifacts. “We were hesitant to alter Jacob's voice too much because it's really rich and full,” Robitaille said. “He had a lot to offer before we did anything, so we wanted to stay hands-off for as much of the movie as possible.”

Using the high-res ADR and production sound mixer Greg Chapman's recordings of Elordi's performance, Robitaille gave Cooke and re-recording mixer Brad Zoern two different subsonic booster tracks to utilize. “ One was just a straight octave down pitch of Jacob's voice that was then run through a low-end plug-in, just to give it that subsonic synthesis,” Robitaille said, noting that he also created a booster track consisting of a number of animal roars tailored to Elordi's performance. “That way Chris always had two options for where he was going to reach for those subsonic frequencies, just to add a bit of warmth where he felt like it was necessary.”

 










Many of the animal sounds that blended together to form the creature's sound were chosen because of how they came across as extensions of Elordi's natural speaking voice. “Surprisingly, horses worked really well,” Robitaille said. “There was a lot of horse vocalization in the supplementary layers. There was also a rack of animal sweeteners: snarls at the end of a rolled ‘r,' or a whimper we'd put in under a flinch.” Although the animals were selected for their complementary qualities in relation to Elordi's voice, the range of species utilized was broad enough to include everything from raccoons to a rhinoceros.

“We threw the whole zoo at him,” Robitaille said, reiterating that at the end of the day, preserving and showcasing Elordi's performance was the primary goal. “Chris did a brilliant job of tapering it back and tucking the sounds in to make sure that Jacob was there more than anything else, because his performance was breathtaking. And Jacob was an absolute soldier through the whole process. He traveled the world carrying his prosthetic teeth with him for all the last-minute ADR sessions he had with Nelson. The raw ingredients they created were incredible, and we just hung a lot of embellishment on it.”

Hindsight? Hell of a drug. That's the lesson former CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Michael Lynton learned the very hard way more than a decade ago, and seems to only be coming fully to grips with now. The impetus: a Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy. 

Let's backtrack a bit. Lynton has a new memoir, “From Mistakes to Meaning: Owning Your Past So It Doesn't Own You” co-written with Joshua L. Steiner” hitting shelves next week, and a generous (and revelatory) chunk of it was excerpted in the Wall St. Journal on Thursday (via Variety). The excerpt, published on the WSJ website with the very intriguing headline “I Wanted to Fit In With Hollywood's Cool Kids. So I Made the Biggest Mistake of My Career,” details the thinking behind Lynton's choice to greenlight “The Interview” and the absolutely bonkers fallout that followed.

More than a decade on, the details still astonish. The 2014 comedy, directed by Rogen and Evan Goldberg from a script by Dan Sterling, follows a pair of journalists (Rogen and Franco) who book an interview with (very real!) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (played by Randall Park) and are soon recruited by the CIA to assassinate him during their visit. So far, so good.

But once the North Korean government caught wind of the picture, they threatened action against the United States if Sony released the film. Sony responded by delaying the film's theatrical release from October 10 to December 25, and reportedly re-edited the film to make it more palatable to North Korea. No dice.

In November of that year, Sony's computer systems were hacked by the so-called “Guardians of Peace” (a cybercrime group allegedly connected to the North Korean government). The now-infamous Sony Hack exposed scads of embarrassing internal communications, from producer Scott Rudin referring to Angelina Jolie as “a minimally talented spoiled brat” to emails in which then-Sony co-chairperson Amy Pascal and Rudin wrote about President Barack Obama in racist terms (Pascal ultimately resigned).

The group also threatened terrorist attacks on theaters showing the film, which led to major theater chains opting not to screen the film. Sony released it for online digital rental and purchase on December 24, 2014, followed by a limited theatrical release at selected theaters the following day. The film made $40 million in digital rentals, plus an additional $12.3 million worldwide in box office ticket sales, but the true cost of it was incalculable. 

In 2024, Rogen also reflected on the fallout. “At the time, it was really bad and really catastrophic,” Rogen recalled while appearing on the Hawk vs. Wolf podcast. “People we knew were getting fired from it. The head of the studio [Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal] was essentially fired from it. It really caused seismic shifts in Hollywood at the time and I think how business was done in some ways.”

 










In his book, Lynton writes, “I considered myself a coolheaded executive until I made a choice that severely damaged my company and colleagues — all because I wanted to fit into Hollywood's creative community — unleashing one of the worst cyberattacks in corporate history. It exposed the confidential emails of insiders and put my own family at risk.”

Lynton's excerpt then takes readers through the basic outline of the scandal, noting that “almost immediately the FBI opened an investigation, and evidence suggested that the North Korean government likely led this attack as retribution and to quash the release of a film called ‘The Interview.' … Eight months later, after it became clear that the North Koreans had hacked Sony, and after the studio had lost its relationships with many of its most important stars — including Will Smith, Adam Sandler and Angelina Jolie — I spoke to President Obama about the whole incident. Unsurprisingly, he asked the right question: ‘What were you thinking when you made killing the leader of a hostile foreign nation a plot point? Of course that was a mistake.' The mistake? My decision to greenlight a project on the fly.”

Lynton then writes about his background and what sounds a bit like a serious case of imposter syndrome once he reached the upper echelons of Hollywood, adding that he “once went to the home of Bryan Lourd, a powerful CAA agent, for his annual Oscar party. Daniel Craig, Leonardo DiCaprio and Sandra Bullock were all having a great time — drinking, laughing, singing. George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon stood in a tight circle, talking. I had seen Clooney at the studio that week and went up to join the conversation. While polite, they made clear that I simply did not belong. I was at the top of the heap in the movie business and still felt that I was watching from a folding chair in [his small hometown]. Perhaps that's what left me so vulnerable and explains why, when I found myself deciding on a Seth Rogen project, I made the biggest mistake of my career.”

 










For Lynton, the choice to greenlight the project was born of both his need to feel cool in the industry and beat back Universal Studios, which had an existing relationship with Rogen. Of the film's first Sony table-read, he wrote, “Walking into the room, I immediately felt energized and simultaneously completely out of place. Although middle-aged, I had not lost the observational skills I'd learned in middle school: I could quickly identify the cool kids and the ones eager for their approval.”

The read was a hit, however, and Lynton adds, “When the reading was over, Amy jumped up and said, ‘Let's make this!' I threw out all of our normal, careful approval processes and found myself agreeing. We rushed into the decision giddy about the project, thrilled to have outflanked our competition at Universal Studios and, alas, oblivious to the potential ramifications.”

The excerpt goes on to cover the ensuing weeks and months of Lynton's life as the scandal and hack unfolded, both professionally and personally, and details Lynton's own emotional takeaways from the whole ordeal. “Now I have come to believe that the whole affair neither began with that ill-fated table read nor ended with my buried feelings. It ultimately came down to a basic human truth: our desire to belong leads us all to weigh heavily the opinions of others,” he wrote. 

 










Hollywood? Probably not the best place for those feelings.

Mumford & Sons have achieved massive success, but they're still desperate for respect. They've drawn from classic literature, sung with Bob Dylan, and reinvented their sound multiple times, and none of it seems to matter; as an old viral video once revealed, they will always be the band that sang the word “heart” 65 times in two albums. But on their third, 2015's rock pivot Wilder Mind, they somehow wound up ahead of their time: They worked with producer James Ford years before Geese and gave Aaron Dessner his biggest credit up to that point as their associate producer. Critics and audiences alike were baffled, but it offered a new prototype for getting brooding, atmospheric songs onto rock radio, even if Ford recently admitted he regrets the gig.

After 2018's messy Delta, the departure of banjoist-turned-alt-right-commentator Winston Marshall, and 2022's surprisingly raw solo album from Marcus Mumford, the now-trio went tail between their legs to their old sound on last year's Dave Cobb-helmed Rushmere. In the meantime, the genre Mumford & Sons helped popularize found a new life: Offspring with names like the Oh Hellos and the Crane Wives tour to rabid fanbases, millions of listeners, and little critical attention. Whatever the band's reception at the time, zillennials look nostalgically on Sigh No More the way their older siblings did the early Coldplay albums; maybe Sigh led listeners to more sophisticated folk and bluegrass, or at least a cursory viewing of O Brother, Where Art Thou. With the mainstream reemergence of stomp-clap-heys from acts like Noah Kahan, they're now elder statesmen. A reunion with Dessner was inevitable, so off they went to his Long Pond Studio for 10 days. There's no better time for an album that shows why they've outlasted most of their contemporaries.

That album is not Prizefighter. The opening run of tracks is everything that critics have thrown at them from the beginning. Co-writes from Brandi Carlile and vocals from Chris Stapleton can't save it; the choruses can't muster up the old dopamine hits; even the trademark Dessner doohickeys seem absent, just uninspired arrangements with heavily Melodyned vocals. You might read the title of “The Banjo Song” and wonder how they don't already have a song called that, except they actually do have one called “The Banjolin Song,” from their days opening for Johnny Flynn and Laura Marling. Mumford, in an attempt at humility, metaphorically doxxes himself on opener “Here”: “Here's my credit card and keys/And the reasons I won't find peace,” then “Here's my address and the ones I blame.” It's shocking when he doesn't go, “Here's the church, here's the steeple...”

On “Alleycat,” Mumford looks down and asks, “Is this all there is?” At that exact moment, the album shifts gears, exchanging feigned authenticity for an honest search for meaning. They've struggled with faith on songs like Babel's “Below My Feet” and Rushmere's “Carry On,” and Mumford is particularly thoughtful about this subject in interviews. This album's “Begin Again” stands out for its direct allusions to Mumford's father, who led the UK branch of evangelical association Vineyard Churches: “Don't carry your father's sins more than you can take/I swear there's another way,” he belts atop an unusually muscular version of a bog-standard Mumford song; the formula works when there are actual stakes!

Mumford told Track Star that the “prizefighter” is a character he invented, and it feels like an excuse to go places he normally doesn't. On the title track, he cautiously reunites with a former flame, ultimately revealing his true motive in the chorus: “I'll stay put/'Til you're good/Just say he's really not me now is he?” It's the same arrogant humility that characterized “I really fucked it up this time, didn't I my dear?” but this time, he's deliberately unsympathetic. The song doesn't end in a triumphant singalong or a moment of closure, either, just refreshingly unadorned Justin Vernon harmonies. The guest stars on the second half help expand the band's palette: Gracie Abrams effectively contrasts Mumford's rasp on the obligatory 5/4 Dessner ballad “Badlands”; Gigi Perez, most famous for her sapphic folk smash “Sailor Song,” literally plays the straight woman on “Icarus” before wailing circles around the main star in her solo verse.

It's a shame this album suffers from the same bloat that befell other recent Dessner projects: The last eight tracks on their own would be the band's most rewarding record. The late-album “Shadow of a Man” uses the same chord progression as Kyle Gordon's recent parody of their genre, yet it may be the most revealing song Mumford has written for his main band. Every time the music is about to explode, it retracts, mirroring Mumford's internal crisis: After years of performing and touring, chasing fame and respectability, he turns his back to the crowd, admitting that once he's “seen over the edge…sometimes I thank God/I'm just a shadow of a man.” He sounds like someone who's made peace with his limitations.

I've known that there would be another Hilary Duff album since that Halloween when Kendall and Kylie Jenner dressed up as characters from The Lizzie McGuire Movie. Actually, I knew the year before, when I was at a wedding and the dancefloor was mobbed the second “What Dreams Are Made Of” came on. Last year they made a Freaky Friday sequel and Jesse McCartney toured with the Jonas Brothers and I said, “What about Hilary?” Nostalgia is a barrelling train overrun with Zillennials weaned on the Disney Channel. We're starved for comfort. Duff was bound to get on board.

It's nice to like something so wholesome. Duff is among the purest surviving cultural relics of the McBling era, with a quarter-century career unblemished by any of the public stumbles that we've come to expect from the child stars we ruthlessly break into adulthood. Since her early days as the beloved middle school misfit Lizzie McGuire, up through her recent role as a searching thirtysomething on a short-lived How I Met Your Mother spin-off, she's been the ultimate girl next door. In the real world, Duff is a 38-year-old mom of four who's lived more than a decade of life since her last studio album. But on her new record, luck…or something, she's as familiar as ever. That's largely because this is music you've heard before: fizzy, centrist pop, precisely positioned at the crossroads of autobiography and universality.

The girl-next-door actress' close cousin, the relatable pop star, is a common character these days. She's hapless and horny and acting a fool over some loser who won't pay attention to her. The most prominent models of this type are women in their 20s, but her struggles are enduring, as evidenced by Duff's preoccupations on luck…: anxiety, jealousy, unfulfilled desire. “I want the part where you say goddamn,” she sings breathlessly on “Roommates,” a pining single about trying to stoke the embers of a long-term relationship, then details a fantasy (memory?) of giving the guy head in the back of a bar (Hilary!!). In the song's unvarnished lust and endearing self-consciousness, I hear echoes of the singer-songwriter-comic Audrey Hobert, of whom Duff is a fan. I definitely hear Taylor Swift, matriarch of the relatable pop stars—and not just because the song sounds like “Anti-Hero.”

luck… was co-written and produced by Matthew Koma, Duff's husband, whose best-known work is with Zedd (he co-wrote “Clarity”). He also collaborated with Duff on her last album, 2015's Breathe In. Breathe Out., which leaned into the ultra-processed dance music of the day. That record featured contributions from the Swedish pop heavyweights Tove Lo and Bloodshy, and was “a little clunky,” per Duff's own description. “It was a case of the label being like, ‘Go to Sweden and write with this person, everything's coming out of Sweden right now,'” she recalled.

Thankfully, both Duff and Koma have moved on from the thumping theatrics of the mid-2010s. luck… is less Zedd and more Carly Rae Jepsen, another former Koma collaborator, whose bright, princess-y vocal tone resembles Duff's. The album's base notes are chirpy synths and strummy acoustic pop, embellished with gated drum fills and swoopy strings—softer, pliable sounds that offer a more natural foundation for Duff. Still, her voice is a limiting factor here: She lacks fluidity and range, often seeming to sing individual notes rather than full phrases. This is especially detrimental when her lyrics already feel forced, like on “You From the Honeymoon,” where she parrots Tinashe while looking back on young love: “Your kinda freak matched my kinda freak.” The words sound like magnetic fridge poetry—jumbled and foreign in her mouth.

This is the first of her albums on which Duff is a credited co-writer on every song, and she seems to still be finding her footing as a lyricist. She auditions different voices: At times she's a painstaking wordsmith (the album's opening lines rhyme “apologist” with “psychologist”); at others she's a gal pal tossing off a bitchy text about her husband (“Future Tripping”) or fretting over an apparent rift with her sister (“We Don't Talk”). There are clunkers (“You calling me batshit's the fastest antibiotic/For thinking you're different this time”). There are inscrutable metaphors (I'm still not sure what the holey T-shirt in “Adult Size Medium” is all about). There is even, inexplicably, an entire chorus cribbed from a blink-182 song.

But there are also moments of bracing clarity—little reminders of how relatable pop stars got to be so popular in the first place. Despite its sparkly guitar and triumphant tone, “Tell Me That Won't Happen” is streaked with existential dread; its hook, “I'm worried that I've felt everything I'll ever feel,” is about as pithy an expression of the terror of getting older as I've heard. On “Roommates,” Duff pre-empts possible humiliation with humor: “We would laugh,” she sings to her partner, emphasis on we, if she tried to light a spark by “walking in in something sexy.” It's a joke, except it's not. There's something vital and deeply human in this vignette. Who hasn't felt unwanted? Who hasn't feared rejection? The rub, of course, is that Duff is beautiful, charming, successful, and desirable by any measure. This is the relatable pop star's trick: showing us ourselves in a rose-colored mirror.

Things get most interesting when the mirrors multiply. We see ourselves in Duff; Duff sees herself in another woman on “Mature,” luck…'s high mark. It's about recognizing yourself not as an individual but as a demographic—in this case, the sort of young, blonde woman that an older man habitually dates. Those familiar with Duff's biography may plot some of the coordinates here: Beginning when she was 16, Duff was in a long-term relationship with a musician nearly a decade her senior. She has demurred on the specifics, but the contours of the story are familiar all the same, given the post-#MeToo reckoning that's prompted many women to reassess their age-gap relationships. “If you can still be considered ‘mature for your age,' you are not an older person's equal,” Tavi Gevinson wrote in a poignant 2021 essay on the subject. “This observation can easily go from an act of respect to license for harm.”

Nostalgia can be a balm, but it can also be a smoke machine, obscuring that which is difficult to revisit. To her credit, Duff doesn't let it overtake the narrative. While album closer “Adult Size Medium” has the hallmarks of a triumphant retrospective—it's cavernous, sweeping in scope and sound, with callbacks to the golden days of youth and the blur of years gone by—it's mostly just raw material. The bridge is a literal checklist: “Try-hards, icons, Sunday mornings, Super Bowls, turn ons, tampons, edibles, and booty calls.” Duff doesn't try to mold it into a legacy. She actually sounds pretty ambivalent: “I remember it all/And I remember nothing.” Life has highs and lows, but mostly it has middles that we mostly forget. At what should be her curtain call, Duff admits that she's still trying to remember her lines. Who can relate?

Ginger Scott and Farheen Khan, the pair behind New York electroclash duo MGNA Crrrta, first met on a Hunger Games roleplay Minecraft server when they were 11. Every Saturday, the young Scott and Khan would log on and spend hours sucked into this saga of teen bloodbath. There were rituals. There were beefs. There were deaths (virtual, Minecraft-mediated).

For a pair that specialize in giddy, girly EDM and brainrot electroclash—think Crystal Castles and 100 gecs by way of Nicki Minaj's “Starships” and Bangerz-era Miley Cyrus—meeting on Minecraft is perhaps the only logical origin story. And the best tracks on Beautiful Disaster, the duo's new mixtape, evoke the same feeling as the online realm where they first found each other: neuron-frying yet ecstatic and all-consuming. On “Armageddon / Seventh Heaven,” Khan and Scott's voices are so distorted that they're near incomprehensible, like postverbal fuzz melting into the surrounding electronic soup. “4me?” crunches up Khan's voice until it hisses like a teakettle over a plastic waterfall of synth.

Like peer and past collaborator Ninajirachi, MGNA Crrrta are deep-fried diarists of the online girl experience. “BFF” is a high-octane ode to internet friendships (“We're twin sisters for real/In my Sims 4 world”) that captures the sugar-rush mania of staying up late and FaceTiming until your eyes cross with cascading metallic synths and stuttering dubstep. “Infinite Pleasure” appears to chronicle the duo's Minecraft days, with references to anxiously awaiting the weekend and rising up against rivals. It's also an earnest love song: Khan's voice glides over a maw-like bass as she promises, “I'm holding this save forever/You my glitch to infinite pleasure.” It's like reciting wedding vows before a Creeper priest.

Other songs are less terminally online and more reminiscent of finagling fake IDs and getting blitzed on the LES. “I'm that lifestyle/Your fresh meat/Motherfucker, I just dance,” Scott drawls on “Heels broke = died.” The lyrics are mostly nonsensical club chatter, but when Scott delivers them with Kesha-worthy sleaze, the attitude is stiletto-sharp. Crystalline jackhammer EDM complements the duo's appeals to boundless ecstasy and endless highs; the modus operandi seems to be that good girls go to heaven, but bad girls go wherever they want.

Beautiful Disaster's first half alternates the pleasures of chronically online brainrot and good ol' fashioned blackouts, but its second half falls short. “I'm on a Saucer II” is fine, but it's missing that extra oomph—the puckish attitude or the weirdly earnest gamer girl digispeak—that make a MGNA Crrrta cut unique. And the relatively sleepier final tracks, “Gimme it all” and “if u dare 2,” feel near interchangeable, both repeating a title phrase ad nauseam in glassy, washed-out vocals. Perhaps they recall the moment when, bleary-eyed from doomscrolling, you notice the sunlight creeping through your blinds; or when, upon returning from a night out, you're suddenly morose and full of gnawing, unexplainable desires. But Beautiful Disaster is just here for a good time.

A lot can change during the fraught time between when a musician finishes recording an album and when it's released, often months later, per a label's schedule. For Mirah, everything changed. In the summer of 2018, two weeks before her sixth album, Understanding, came out, the indie rock songwriter lost her beloved father. Four months after that, she gave birth to a son. A year after that, she attempted to resume life as a touring musician, only for the pandemic to nix her plans and intensify her postpartum anxiety.

All this heavy stuff—death, birth, grief, joy, “the whole turn of the earth,” as she sings on “The Beginning of Time”—beats inside the impossibly tender heart of Dedication, Mirah's first album in seven years, a lifetime of change. It's a wistful, deeply middle-aged album about deeply middle-aged concerns: motherhood, marital troubles, losing a parent, being grateful for what you have. But its unabashed earnestness is its greatest asset.

A quarter century ago, Mirah cut her teeth singing lo-fi, bedroom-pop bangers full of melodic ingenuity and kinky fantasies. Now, rooted in earthy folk-rock tones and a hint of twang, she writes love songs of a more grown-up, long-haul variety: “Life is already hard enough/And I don't want to throw away all of the good stuff we have,” she sings on the new wave-tinted “Catch My Breath,” one of several tunes about fighting to keep a strained marriage intact. Another, “The Ballad of the Bride of Frankenstein,” is not a score for the new Maggie Gyllenhaal flick but a stormy love song that uses horror iconography as a metaphor for marital discord. “We are monsters,” Mirah croons, “a perfect pair.” (Thankfully, its ending is more hopeful than the actual Bride of Frankenstein's.)

She sounds worlds away from the mischievous K Records signee who wrote playfully twisted gems like “100 Knives,” but her candid vulnerability remains constant. It ripples in the bittersweet sorrow of “New Jersey Turnpike,” an aching elegy for Mirah's father. In spare vignettes—crying on the titular highway, small talk with a guy at the funeral home—she captures the immense disorientation of losing a parent while growing a baby.

Mirah wrote most of these songs in 2024, during a homespun writing residency at a friend's house in California; she had put writing on pause for years, and now songs seemed to pour out of her. Maybe the time away gave her the distance she needed to write about home. She assesses that distance but redoubles her commitment on “After the Rain,” a warm hug of a song about cherishing family and finding gratitude after loss: “My whole life, I've dedicated/To being true to love unfaded,” goes the refrain. It looks like a corny sentiment on the page, but Mirah, accompanied by a backing band that includes Jenn Wasner (Wye Oak) and Meg Duffy (Hand Habits), renders it a moving campfire singalong; swathed in lush harmonies and a pedal steel whine, she strikes the right mix of sorrowful and sweet.

Dedication sifts through the turmoil and joy of Mirah's life with an intimacy rarely obscured by obliquity or metaphor. Sometimes, though, this immediacy leads to songwriting that's literal-minded to the point of banality. That's true of the overstuffed bridge of “Catch My Breath,” when Mirah seems determined to cram a whole voice note's worth of messages into ungainly couplets like “Now I'm not saying I didn't contribute/To this shitty, stupid, fucking mess we've gotten into.” And “Mama Me,” a gooey-eyed love song to the artist's baby, is saccharine enough to give you a cavity.

Though Dedication traverses some hard shit, gratitude is the overarching sentiment: gratitude for motherhood, for love, for community, for sheer survival. Even Mirah's wry pandemic flashback, “Stumbling,” sounds a note of happy relief: “But I'm alive, I didn't die/And you're alive, you didn't diiiie!” On the closing track, her mourning is tempered with the wisdom that grief is, invariably, the flipside of love. Waves of funereal horns linger after the last verse has ended, symbolizing, perhaps, the love that lasts “when life leaves.” That love lasts forever. The song feels like it could, too.

Cousins, hillbillies, and range brothers Baby Keem and Kendrick Lamar have teamed up for another song. “Good Flirts” appears on Keem's new album, Ca$ino, which is out now. Check out the track, and the rest of the record, below.

“Good Flirts” plays out like a playful and flirtatious message to a supposed ex Keem just can't quit, set over a downtempo beat. Lamar's verse finds him hanging on the couch watching Sinners, worshipping his girl's booty, and wondering if God might be a woman. “Good Flirts” features vocals from the singer Momo Boyd, of the New York-based soft-rock outfit Infinity Song.

The song is the latest of Keem and Lamar's joint releases, which include “The Hillbillies,” “Vent,” “Range Brothers,” and the Grammy-winning “Family Ties.” Lamar also co-produced a series of documentary shorts Keem released during Ca$ino's rollout and appeared on-camera for interviews, where he spoke about watching Keem grow into his talent.

“When he started first sending me beats and shit, I was like, ‘OK, I can see you do this,' and he was really good,” Lamar shared. “What I was surprised at was when he started rapping…I was like, ‘Damn, you actually good at this, too.' That threw me for a loop, because he understood melodies and patterns more than any young cat that I've heard.”

Ca$ino is Keem's second studio album, and follows 2021's The Melodic Blue. The largest tracklist features Too $hort and Che Ecru. Keem will support the album later this year on an extensive tour, which will bring him across the States, Canada, Europe, and the UK between April and September.

	The Supreme Court struck down large swaths of President Donald Trump's international tariff agenda on Friday, severely curtailing one of the president's signature second-term policy projects. 


	In a 6-3 ruling, the court determined that Trump and his administration had exceeded their tariff powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA,) a 1977 law that allows the president to regulate certain aspects of international trade during a declared national emergency. The court did not prescribe any requirements or methods through which the administration would be forced to roll back the hundreds of punitive tariffs it has imposed on trade partners around the globe, but made abundantly clear that Trump was operating outside of the law in doing so. 


	“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion released by the court. “In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”

	











	“The Government reads IEEPA to give the President power to unilaterally impose unbounded tariffs and change them at will. That view would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy,” Roberts added. “It is also telling that in IEEPA's half century of existence, no President has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.” 


	Roberts pointed to Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, which bestows the power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,” directly in the hands of Congress. 


	“We claim no special competence in matters of economics or foreign affairs,” Roberts added. “We claim only, as we must, the limited role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution. Fulfilling that role, we hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.”

	Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed during his first term, agreed that Congress needed to authorize Trump's tariffs. “Most major decisions affecting the rights and responsibilities of the American people (including the duty to pay taxes and tariffs) are funneled through the legislative process for a reason,” he wrote in his concurring opinion. “The deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the Nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people's elected representatives, not just that of one faction or man. There, deliberation tempers impulse, and compromise hammers disagreements into workable solutions.”

	











	Trump was reportedly told of the decision while meeting with governors at the White House, and called it a “disgrace.”


	Trump announced a sweeping tariff package at a White House event last April, imposing a series of steep import taxes on nations around the world. The president has continued to use tariffs or the threat of tariffs to bully other nations into complying with his demands. Economists have widely bashed Trump's tariff policy, which effectively amounts to a tax on American consumers. “This is a win for the wallets of every American consumer,” Senate Minority Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in response to the ruling.

	Trump has continued to defend the tariffs, however, and seemed confident on Thursday that the Supreme Court would rule in his favor. “Without tariffs, what would you do? You know what? Everybody would be bankrupt, the whole country would be bankrupt,” he said at an event in Georgia. “I've been waiting [for this decision] forever. The language is clear that I have the right to do it as president.”


	The Supreme Court disagrees.

	In the not too distant future, somewhere in time and space, Mike Nelson and his robot pals Tom Servo and Crow T Robot will return to the Satellite of Love and once again riff on cheesy movies. If this reads like gibberish, you are not familiar with Mystery Science Theater 3000, which originated on a Minneapolis UHF channel in 1988, and ran for seven seasons on Comedy Central, and three on the Sci Fi channel before vanishing for 18 years and re-emerging on Netflix in 2017.


	The cast and crew changed a lot over the years, but the premise remained the same: A man and two robots are trapped in space and forced to watch bad movies by evil overloads. Their silhouettes are seen in the corner of the screen, but they occasionally leave the theater for brief comedy routines. 


Mystery Science Theater 3000 creator Joel Hodgson was the original host, but he left in season 5 and was replaced by Mike Nelson, the show's head writer. When the show came back in 2017, Hodgson was onboard as producer, but he assembled an entirely new crew, led by comedian Jonah Ray. 

	











	The revival fizzled out after three seasons, and the show truly seemed dead, until earlier this month when word hit that Hodgson had sold MST3K to Radial Entertainment, and they were reviving it with Mike Nelson as host, Kevin Murphy (Tom Servo seasons 2-10), and Bill Corbett (Crow T. Robot seasons 8-10). That trio has spent the past 20 years working at RiffTrax, an audio-only riffing enterprise that has taken on over 550 movies. (You simply start the audio file when the movie begins, and they provide the commentary.) 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The new season of MST3K is called Mystery Science Theater 3000: The RiffTrax Experiments. As of now, only four movies are slated, including the 1978 Roger Corman/David Carradine film Deathsport. And in one episode, OG MST3K cast members Frank Conniff and Trace Beaulieu — who have their own riffing company The Mads — will make guest appearances. A Kickstarter was set up to raise funds for the productions, and so far it's raised nearly $2 million.

	All of this news is a lot for longtime MST3K fans (or Misties, if you will) to process. We hopped on a Zoom with Nelson to hear how it all came together, and what we can expect going forward. 


You last hosted the show in 1999. That's a long time ago. Did you think it was over forever when the show went off the air back then?Pretty much. I remember at the time being really naive and just going like, “Well, these things happen. We had a good run. What are you going to do?” And everyone else was really sad. So, I didn't really think of it. That's how dumb I was. I just didn't think of it that much.


I'm sure your 20 years at RiffTrax has been very satisfying because you made something that no one can cancel. You own it.It is true. I was in Minnesota [when MST3K went off the air] and I was doing freelance writing, and all of a sudden I realized, “Hey, there's not a lot of freelance writing out there. I better own something.” I thought about doing this RiffTrax thing and I teamed up with David G. Martin, who's still our CEO and is shepherding this. We just did it on a “let's try it and see what happens” basis, and obviously it worked out and it's been a gratifying 20 years.


It's brilliant in its simplicity. No one can stop you riffing, say, Star Wars or Titanic. There are no rights issues.That is pretty nice. I mean, I've done a lot of stuff with executives. My gag about it is that an executive will come in and go, “Pretty good. I like a lot about it. Why don't you throw a monkey in there.” Then they just leave the room and you got to go, “What does that mean?” And then the next executive goes in, “I like everything except the monkey. So get a monkey in there, but take the monkey out.” And you're like, “How do you do that?” “You'll figure it out. You're the talent.” So to have 20 years of not having any of that, we're spoiled.

They first brought back MST3K in 2017. Kevin and Bill both made guest appearances. Did they ask you at any point?As I recall, they did. I'm sure they did. My standard answer back then was like, “I really got to do this RiffTrax thing right now.” I also remember, even with live shows I would have to demur and just go, “I can't.” Also, when you're raising children, now my children are full-grown, but back then you're like, “I don't know, man, I got a kid hanging on my ankle.”

	











As a fan of the show, I had mixed feelings about the first revival. I was happy it was back, but a whole new cast all at once was tough to swallow.Yeah, I wondered about that for people. I remember at the time when Joel was the host and then I took over, I got some really, really personal hate mail. I hadn't really thought of it. I was always there. I was on set all the time, so it didn't really mean anything to me. And then all of a sudden, now I'm in their living room, and they don't like me.


The changes were very gradual back then. You were the new host, but it was same Tom Servo, the same Crow, same Gypsy. This was an entirely new cast all at once.Sure. Yeah.


They were on Netflix for two seasons but i was never a long-term home. Netflix rarely lets a show go for very long.I've never been part of the Netflix universe, but from what I hear, and this is hearsay, take it or leave it, is that they're very closed about that. You just walk in one day, and we're all fired. That is a phenomenon even on networks too, where it's kind of like working at a restaurant. You walk in one day and the doors are chained.


They did one more season that was entirely supported by fans. But that wasn't a long-term plan either. You need some sort of production company backing you.Yeah. I'm sure that's part of it. How many times as a fan can you open your wallet? I don't know.


This new era was a pretty big surprise to the fans. How did you first hear about the possibility of Joel selling the show and you guys being called back in?It was really gradual. It was like, “Would you, in any universe, be interested?” And then it's like, “Well, yes, would I like to own a unicorn? I mean. I guess so. Let me think about it.” And then you're going about your day a couple months later and it's, “Well, there's a possibility. What do you think about this?” And I was like, “I don't know. In a theoretical world, maybe, I guess.” So it was sort of gradual.


Did you feel any hesitation? You've been doing your own thing for 20 years. It's pretty established at this point.Probably a little. I think all three of us felt a little bit like you're saying, “We've got our lane, and it's been a while.” And then I think we gradually started to remember, “Man, we had so much fun doing this. Wouldn't it be fun to be a grown person holding a puppet, Kevin?” 


How did it get to the place where it's at now where it's going to be shot again in Minneapolis with the old sets and everything?Kevin Murphy had produced for us before. It was him doing a lot of legwork with people we knew from the past. Most people we're still in touch with. It's like, “We're thinking we're going to do this, would you be interested?” And it's gratifying to get a yes from people. 

	











	I thought it was a really joyful thing to be able to live your life in a way that when you contact people from the past, they don't go, “Yeah, no, I don't want to do that.” Everyone was pretty happy about it. And we shot that little video for the Kickstarter, and a lot of the old crew came back.


When does production start? What's the timeline?We have to wait to see what happens with the Kickstarter, but production will follow pretty much on the heels of it and we'll try to get going on it and get them in the can, as they say.


How is it going to be broadcast?I think we'll deliver them all on our RiffTrax platform, being the RiffTrax experiments. People are kind of used to that, and I think they'll just get them there. There's talk of doing one of them as a live show with Fathom, which would be fun.


I'm sure it's going to be surreal to put the jumpsuit back on, have the puppets next to you again, and be back in this universe you've been out of for 27 years.When we did the shoot, the puppets came out of these cases. It was this weird thing of like, “I've been to the moon and now here's the moon rock that you picked up.” It was a surreal feeling, but it was also very joyful to see people scrambling around again. 


At the end of the series, Mike had escaped the Satellite of Love and was back on earth, watching a movie on a couch with Tom and Crow. Are you going to be back up in space for the new series?The fiction is sort of TBD. We don't really know. For most of us involved in it, we don't have a lot of preciousness about the actual fiction. It's space. You can do whatever you want.


Will Gypsy be back?Again, TBD. It's hard to say. I think we said goodbye to Gypsy in our final episode. Someone reminded me of that. I was like, “I don't remember what we did.” She went to work somewhere.


You announced Deathsport as one of the first movies. What drew you to that one?There was a lot of talk about the movies that we were going to do. And we're still deciding that. Luckily, Deathsport is one of them that we're able to get the rights to. But over the years at RiffTrax, a real attachment to David Carradine has formed for whatever reason. This is the one where he has a loincloth.


How did Frank Conniff and Trace Beaulieu get involved?Trace is in our general area, and we've kept in touch with him and always been friendly with him. We are always aware that they were doing the Mads, and have been sort of, as they say, friends of RiffTrax. So that was an easy lift. And Frank, I saw him a couple months back. He had moved back to Minnesota from New York. It was like Old Home Week. It was good to see him again. So it's a little bit easier to do rather than to say, “Hey Frank, can we send a car to pick you up in your Manhattan apartment and bring you to Minneapolis?”

	











Why just four episodes?I think everyone thought that was a good starting place production-wise. Because one of the things about MST that's far different from RiffTrax is that RiffTrax is much easier to produce since it's just audio. MST is like spinning plates. When you start putting puppets under the lights and things like that, they tend to catch fire. It is harder and it's unknown in a way that we're not used to. Four was just like, “What do we feel comfortable committing to and what do we feel comfortable actually producing?”


It's a crazy echo of history that you're again replacing Joel 30 years later.It is odd, and then oddly comfortable. When I first stepped aboard as host, people would say, “Why you?” I'd go, “Well, I was the head writer and I was always there on set. If they just left the camera on, you'd see me there anyway all the time. So it seemed natural.” So in the same way, this seems natural.


Are you in touch with Joel? Might he guest at some point?I haven't been in touch with him. I don't think so. I don't think there's any plans for it because I think he's out of the game, at least that's our understanding.


If the four go well, might you make a lot more?We're leaving that open. If we were so lucky, we probably would. We're going to be at a rental studio. If we don't ruin it, and if people want us to do it, I think everyone is open to it. But we have our old cameraman and art director. They were like, “I'm retired, man, I don't want to do this.” They're chopping wood in their cabin and we're like, “Come on, man, one more job.”


I want to briefly ask about some of the old movies. Manos: The Hands of Fate fascinates so many people. What is it about that movie that makes it stand out above all the others?That is a hard one for me to understand. That was very polarizing even at the time. Frank Conniff and I used to sit in the room and screen together. He was like, “Oh, this one's great.” And I'm like, “I hate that one so much. There's no way we're going to do it.” And then we showed it to everyone else and it was half-and-half, people just going, “I just don't ever want to see that again.” And the other half going, “This is so good.”


	There's just something about it. It's like that Tommy Wiseau and The Room. You can't explain why some people are like, “I cannot believe you would sit and watch this once, let alone 300 times.”


I find Manos captivating. It's like this weird form of outsider art, people making a movie that don't know anything about the craft of filmmaking.Yeah, I think it has that same feeling of, “Where did this get made? Who did this? Why?” You want to know everything about it. With almost every movie we do, we speculate about them. And then we do research and find out we're right. With Manos, we were like, “This seems like it was made by a fertilizer salesman from San Antonio.” And then it's like, “This was made by a fertilizer salesman in San Antonio. Okay. All right.”

	











Who is a worse director: Ed Wood or Coleman Francis?Oh, I think Coleman Francis is worse than Ed Wood. In terms of just technical things, I feel like Ed Wood at least tried to capture the stuff on film. And Coleman Francis is like, “We got it. Who cares?”

We hear so often about the movies you dislike. What are your favorite movies?People always say, “When you're by yourself, do you watch bad movies?” No, I tend to watch good movies. I like Casablanca. I like The Elephant Man. My wife and I like old movies, so we watch a lot of black-and-whites, which I know some people go, “I can't even watch a black-and-white movie.” You're cutting yourself off from a lot of movies.


You must be surprised that you raised $2 million so quickly.I've always been about, “Let's make this the most joyful experience, the most fun for the most people that we can.” When you get a reaction like this, you're like, “We're on the right track.” There's always going to be people who hate you. You can't do anything about that, but for the most part, we try to make everyone included in the comedy. And so it's gratifying.

	Following the news of Eric Dane‘s death, fans, costars, and Hollywood peers of the veteran actor have shared tributes in remembrance of his work and fight against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Sam Levinson, Alyssa Milano, Maria Shriver, Ashton Kutcher, and more honored Dane in heartfelt messages.


	Dane died at the age of 53, just 10 months after he shared his diagnosis with the public. “Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight,” his family said in a statement. “He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always.” 


	In a statement to Variety, Euphoria creator Sam Levinson, wrote, “I'm heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend Eric. Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric's family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing.” Dane starred in the HBO drama, delivering one of the most menacing portrayals as the father of Nate Jacobs (played by Jacob Elordi).

	











	Milano, who worked with Dane on the WB series Charmed, shared an Instagram photo of the actor alongside his wife, Rebecca Gayheart, and their two daughters. “I can't stop seeing that spark in Eric's eye right before he'd say something that would either make you spit out your drink or rethink your entire perspective,” she wrote in the caption. “And when it came to his daughters and Rebecca, everything in him softened. He carried them with him even in rooms where they weren't present. You could see it in the way his voice changed when he said their names. A breathtakingly beautiful family. The spark. The mischief. The tenderness he kept guarded but never totally hidden.” Milano added, “My heart is with the people who were lucky enough to be his home.”

	Maria Shriver, whose publishing imprint, The Open Field, is set to publish a memoir written by Dane, titled Book of Days: A Memoir in Moments, said that she was “heartbroken by this devastating news.” She continued, “He was so heroic the way he handled his diagnosis. He used his voice to let the world know what it was like living with ALS.” Shriver said the actor told her he wanted his family to “know how much he loved them, and he wanted to leave them a story they could be proud of.” She added, “Godspeed, Eric. It was an honor to know you, and we will honor your story.”

	In his own post, Ashton Kutcher, wrote on X: “The Franklin strip fanatics fantasy football league will miss Mr. Eric Dane. We know you'll be watching from the booth. Miss you, buddy. Let's keep fighting the fight to solve ALS.”


	Paul Walter Hauser, who featured alongside Dane in the 2023 crime thriller Americana, shared a photo of the two together and said, “We tried to book gigs, we tried to laugh at the pain and we tried to stay sober. I'm glad we got to play together in Americana. I love you, man. I wish we had more time. Enjoy the arms of Father God. I'll see you again”


	John Stamos wrote in a tribute, “RIP, Buddy. Me and @realericdane played brothers years ago in a beautiful movie called, Wedding Wars. Good guy. Too soon.”

During filming he'd get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you! You will be missed.”

	More details have come to light regarding Shia LaBeouf‘s recent arrest in New Orleans, in which he was charged with two counts of simple battery after hitting two people.


	The actor was celebrating Mardi Gras at a bar in the French Quarter earlier this week, when a fight broke out after police say he was accused of “causing a disturbance.”


	According to a New Orleans police report obtained by The Associated Press, LaBeouf also shouted homophobic slurs at the people he was fighting with, yelling, “These f–––––s put me in jail,” and said he's a Catholic. A representative for the actor did not immediately return a request for comment. 


	The report stated that LaBeouf, 39, “became irate and aggressive throughout the night” and hit multiple people with a closed fist at the Royal Street Inn & R Bar, near the historic French Quarter.

	Jeffrey Damnit, who police identified as Jeffrey Klein in the incident report, said he was one of the people struck by LaBeouf. “He hit me, he connected a few times with punches, he pushed me a few times,” Damnit claimed. He said he was wearing eye makeup and lipstick at the time and that he believes his appearance motivated LaBeouf's attack.

	











	“That's just somehow something that set him off, angered him and gave him a direction for his anger,” said Damnit. “This guy wants me to be dead because I wear makeup. It's a screwed up thing.” He alleged the actor had pushed him from behind earlier in the night, yelling homophobic slurs and threatening his life.

	











	According to AP, a video shows a shirtless LaBeouf shoving one person to the ground and striking another individual in the face, which a police report states caused his “nose to possibly dislocate.” 


	In another video recorded by Damnit, LaBeouf reportedly faces the camera and appears to mouth a homophobic slur while police detain him. The police report stated he continued to repeat the slur throughout the arrest.

	Following his arrest, police took LaBeouf to the hospital, where he was treated for unknown injuries. He was arrested and charged upon his release. Hours after being released from jail, LaBeouf was back out on the streets of New Orleans. At night, he was seen dancing on the street with what appeared to be his arrest papers hanging from his mouth. 


	Prior to the various reports citing LaBeouf's behavior in New Orleans, three production sources told Rolling Stone that the actor's increasingly erratic behavior sparked concern on the set of his upcoming film, The Rooster Prince, last fall. “He was completely wild,” one production member said. “I don't think he's stable. I don't know that he's been stable for a while.”

US President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to ""begin the process of identifying and releasing"" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. 

Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said ""aliens are real"" on a podcast last week. 

""He's not supposed to be doing that,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: ""He made a big mistake.""

Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: ""Well, I don't know if they're real or not.""

Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. 

""They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,"" Obama said. 

""There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.""

After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. 

In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: ""I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!"" 

Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire ""lightning"" round of questions on the podcast.

There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.

For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and ""doesn't have an opinion on it"". 

Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that ""based on the tremendous interest shown"" he will seek the release of files ""related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters"".

The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a secret Pentagon programme to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.

In 2022, Congress held the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter - setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.

The following year, a US House of Representatives panel on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was ""no evidence"" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects. 

A second US aircraft carrier appears to be heading towards the Middle East as Washington increases its pressure on Iran.

President Trump on Thursday directed his administration to release files on UFOs and any ""alien and extraterrestrial life,"" an issue that has drawn decades of public fascination — and spawned more than a few wild theories.   

In a Truth Social post, the president told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agency heads ""to begin the process of identifying and releasing"" any relevant files. 

Mr. Trump also called for the release of ""any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters."" 

It's not clear what files on UFOs might be released — or what information they might contain. The Pentagon has tracked reports of what it calls unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, for decades. But the military said in a 2024 report there's no evidence that any government investigation into UAPs has confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life.

Mr. Trump's announcement came just days after one of his predecessors, former President Barack Obama, made waves by telling a podcaster that aliens are real. He later clarified that he never saw evidence of contact between humans and extraterrestrial life during his time in the White House, and he primarily believes that extraterrestrial life is real because ""statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there.""  

Asked Thursday about Obama's comments, Mr. Trump told reporters he isn't sure whether or not aliens exist, but added that the former president ""made a big mistake"" and ""gave classified information."" 

""I may get him out of trouble by declassifying,"" Mr. Trump said.

Public interest in UAPs has grown in recent years. Pilots and military service members have reported spotting hundreds of unexplained objects in the sky, leading some lawmakers to press the Pentagon to investigate the phenomena and determine whether they pose a threat to safety or national security.  

Last year, one House Republican released a whistleblower video of a U.S. missile striking an unidentified glowing orb in the sky and bouncing off it. And in another case, a former Navy pilot told ""60 Minutes"" about frequent sightings of strange, fast-moving objects in restricted airspace.

A large number of UAP reports can be explained by birds, balloons, drones, satellites and other everyday phenomena, according to the military's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. But many cases remain unresolved. 

""It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,"" the office said in a 2024 report. The office also noted that it has ""no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries.""

TEHRAN – U.S President Donald Trump on Thursday night issued a directive to federal agencies to identify and release government records concerning unidentified anomalous/aerial phenomena (UAP) and “alien and extraterrestrial life.”

In a statement posted to Truth Social, he cited “tremendous interest” as the primary catalyst for the order.

“I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.”

The announcement follows a sharp exchange regarding former President Barack Obama.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump accused his predecessor of improperly disclosing classified information during a podcast appearance where Obama remarked that “aliens are real.”

Trump asserted that Obama “made a big mistake” but suggested the new declassification order would “get him out of trouble” by retroactively authorizing the disclosure.

While Obama later clarified that he saw no “evidence of contact” during his presidency, the exchange has reignited intense debate over the limits of executive secrecy.

This push for disclosure arrives after years of legislative tension.

The UAP Disclosure Act, originally introduced by Senators Schumer and Rounds, was significantly weakened in Congress, with leadership stripping “eminent domain” provisions that would have allowed the government to seize recovered craft from private contractors.

This legislative gridlock follows landmark testimonies from whistleblowers such as David Grusch, who alleged the possession of “non-human” biologics, and former Pentagon official Luis Elizondo, who described an ongoing, secretive arms race involving advanced technologies monitoring military installations.

Reactions have been starkly divided. Representative Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) hailed the move as a victory against a “cover-up,” while Representative Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) noted that briefings have hinted at multiple “alien species.”

Representative Anna Paulina Luna also thanked the president, expressing a desire for public transparency.

However, Representative Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) dismissed the timing, stating, “They've deployed the ultimate weapon of mass distraction, but the Epstein files aren't going away… even for aliens.”

On X, some users celebrated a historic breakthrough, yet many skeptics characterized the order as a tactical diversion from domestic controversies, the Epstein coverup, or even the U.S. military waging war un the Middle East.

President Donald Trump said Thursday that he was directing agencies to release files pertaining to “alien and extraterrestrial life.”

Trump wrote on Truth Social that “based on the tremendous interest shown,” he would be directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and officials at other relevant agencies “to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.”

Trump's announcement comes after former President Barack Obama said in a podcast interview that aliens were real, later clarifying that he meant “the odds are good there's life out there.” Obama added in his clarification that he had seen “no evidence” of alien existence during his time in office. 

Obama was answering a series of questions during a ""lightning round"" of the podcast interview, when he was asked whether aliens were real.

""They're real,"" Obama said, ""but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.""

The podcaster, Brian Tyler Cohen, then asked Obama what was the first question he had wanted answered when he took office.

""Where are the aliens?"" Obama responded.

Trump, asked by a reporter about Obama's remarks Thursday, said Obama had given classified information.

“He's not supposed to be doing that,” Trump added.

Following a 2024 hearing, the Pentagon said it received hundreds of reports on UAPs and 21 that merited “further analysis” because of “anomalous characteristics and/or behaviors” — but found no evidence of extraterrestrial activity. 

Responding to Trump's directive Thursday night, Hegseth posted a screenshot of Trump's post with an alien emoji and a saluting emoji.

Some lawmakers reacted to Trump's announcement Thursday. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said in an interview on Fox News, ""If he's going to release all of the X-Files, I think that could be a bipartisan thing,"" referring to the 1990s television show about FBI agents investigating — among other things — government conspiracies about aliens, which Fetterman said he ""grew up watching.""

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., thanked Trump, writing: ""Looks like we are about to have a ton of hearings on this :)!""

                                        President Donald Trump on Thursday night announced that he is ordering the Pentagon and other US departments and agencies to identify and release government files related to extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Hours earlier, Trump accused former US president Barack Obama of revealing classified information on the issue.

US President Donald Trump said Thursday he is ordering federal agencies to begin ""identifying and releasing"" government files related to UFOs and aliens, a move sought for decades by some Americans.

""Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs),"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

While he did not specify whether classified documents would be released to the public, Trump added that the files should include ""any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters"".

Earlier in the day the Republican president claimed that one of his Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama, had revealed ""classified"" information in his recent viral podcast remarks about the existence of extraterrestrial life.

""They're real, but I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in... Area 51,"" Obama told host Brian Tyler Cohen, referring to the top-secret US military facility in Nevada at the heart of many UFO conspiracy theories.

""There's no underground facility. Unless, there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.""

Asked on Thursday about the comments, Trump told reporters that Obama ""gave classified information, he is not supposed to be doing that"".

The president did not specify what part of Obama's remarks were classified, but claimed ""he made a big mistake"".

For his own beliefs about aliens, Trump, 79, said ""I don't know if they are real or not.""

No evidence has been produced of intelligent life beyond Earth.

Interest in UFOs and UAP has been renewed in recent years as the US government probed numerous reports of seemingly supernatural aircraft, amid worries that adversaries could be testing highly advanced technologies.

In March 2024, the Pentagon released a report saying it had no proof that UAP were alien technology, with many suspicious sightings turning out to be merely weather balloons, spy planes, satellites and other normal activity.

""It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,"" the office said in a 2024 report. The office also noted that it has ""no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries.""

													By Jonathan Klotz
						 | Published 12 seconds ago 

Supernatural is among the very few shows to reach 15 seasons, and among genre shows, it's outlasted everyone. As the Winchester brothers, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles were at the forefront of almost every episode, but they weren't alone. With them all the way from the humble beginnings, trying to find the demon who killed their mother, to the very end, when they battle God, is the 1967 Chevy Impala: Baby.  

Through thick and thin, possessions, ghosts, wendigos, angels, and the Devil himself, Dean's Impala was right there, which is why, when it took center stage in 2011's “Baby.” When fans heard an entire episode would be shot inside the Impala, they didn't know quite what to expect, but the crew of Supernatural turned the old “bottle episode” gimmick into one of the best of the show's entire run. 

From the moment “Baby” starts, you know it's going to be a different type of episode. The usual recap begins in 1967 with footage of a Chevy plant assembling Impalas. It quickly jumps forward to the present, as Dean and Sam give it a good wash before a road trip to investigate another case, and that's when you notice every single camera shot is from the perspective of Baby. This leads to some unique angles over the dash and into the side mirrors, and then later on, an overhead shot from the roof of the car as the boys settle in for the night. 

Every single inch of the Impala helps ground the Supernatural episode right when the series was starting to go off the rails. Granted, “grounded” is a bit of a stretch for an episode in which the term “were-pire” is used. The real monster of the episode, a Nachzeher, feels like a throwback to the early seasons, and how it's finally defeated, through a series of small payoffs to the various passengers in Baby during the episode, is classic Supernatural. 

The meat of the episode, Sam and Dean going on a road trip together, also gives the brothers time to reconnect and establish their relationship. For years, it was the bedrock of the series, but over 10 seasons, a lot went unsaid, and a gulf began to form between the two as fans had to endure more and more episodes that split them up, or worse, put them at odds. In “Baby,” the two get a chance to sit, talk, and reconnect. It's a quiet scene with the camera going from one close-up to the other, but it's what helps make the episode so good, especially for longtime fans who relish every moment with the pair. 

As much as the dramatic side of their relationship helps drive Supernatural forward, there's also the complete goofball side to each of the brothers, and to the actors behind the roles. Goofs and bloopers from the series get more views than the dramatic moments on social media. Dean popping in Bob Seger's “Night Moves” and then singing along is one of those moments that makes fans wonder if Jensen did it between takes and they wrote it in, because it's exactly the type of offbeat, corny humor and brotherly chemistry the stars showed on screen for over a decade. 

“Baby” was an immediate hit when it aired, nailing the sweet spot of “monster of the week,” classic Supernatural chemistry, and a few nods to the final major story arc of the series. Bottle episodes are usually done as a cost-cutting measure, such as on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. or Stargate SG-1, but the unique hook of filming entirely in and around a car makes “Baby” look and feel different from every other episode. The talented production crew turned a budget-saving gimmick into a wildly inventive new way to frame, shoot, and present a show that had been airing for over a decade. 

Supernatural may have outlasted the story it was trying to tell, but for any show to run for 15 seasons and develop a fervent fan base that, years after its conclusion, is still going strong. “Baby” is a perfect example of why the show became a hit and how self-imposed restrictions can lead to new levels of creative genius.

The three films in Farah Al Qasimi's latest show at the SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, Psychic Repair, are the length of songs. The photographer and musician, who's known for interrogating the hierarchies of information and emotion inherent in the internet, wrote them herself. “They're almost like music videos,” she says. “Like a teenage girl writing lyrics in a notebook.” The videos transform jump-rope rhymes, spoken poetry and punk rock songs into prophetic mantras. In one, Qasimi even replicated her teenage bedroom and performed as the monster that lives under the bed.

In Psychic Repair, which runs until June 7, Qasimi faces the monsters under the bed and the ghosts in her closet head-on. Throughout the exhibition, highly saturated images that explore rituals of self-presentation are layered in a style reminiscent of early internet pop-up ads and department store displays. Informed by both her girlhood in the United Arab Emirates and adulthood in the US, Qasimi uses the supernatural to gain an understanding of how the people around her see the world. It operates as a metaphor for the unseen forces at play in daily life. Patterns, shadows and materials serve their purpose as conduits for fantasy and phantasm. It all comes down to this question: what do you believe in that you have no conclusive evidence for? 

I spoke to Qasimi early this month, while she was in Bushwick. It was a few days before her 35th birthday, and she was waiting for the black ice to melt. Below, she shares her supernatural experiences from childhood, why she wants to explore the “slippery idea of truth”, and what constitutes a modern-day haunting. 

Tell me about the name, Psychic Repair. Why did you want to explore the supernatural?

Farah Al Qasimi: I've always been interested in the supernatural. It's fascinating because it really shows you how different people's belief systems are. There are parts of my family who are like, ‘Of course ghosts aren't real, that's silly'. Other members are like, ‘Yes, they are real, and I survived an attempted possession.' We're all Muslim, so we all practice the same faith fairly similarly. As a child, when you are starting to form beliefs about the world, the supernatural is one of the first avenues where you notice these completely differing beliefs and convictions from adults. That central question of what is true and what is someone's imagining carried into adulthood for me. The more I think about the supernatural, the more I feel like it's not just this ghostly realm. It's some form of power that we cannot physically see. As a child of the internet, that felt like the first manifestation of some sort of invisible presence that we all felt. 

The exhibition was informed by your own experiences of girlhood. How supernatural were you as a child, and how has it evolved over time?

Farah Al Qasimi: I had a healthy fear of the supernatural as a child. In school, and before the internet, our vernacular experience of the supernatural was through myths like Bloody Mary. I think every culture, every school, every group of kids had their own version of that. I remember trying an Ouija board with two friends of mine when I was in the fourth grade, and we were convinced that something was happening. But you don't really know – it's an unnamed source of energy that comes from us all together, believing in something so resolutely that it is happening. It's similar to astrology. Some people think it's absolute garbage, but I want to understand where people put themselves on the spectrum when there's a perceived lack of empirical evidence for something.

Do you think knowing people's relationship to the supernatural helps you understand them a little better? 

Farah Al Qasimi: A little bit. For a lot of people, some form of spiritualism or belief in something outside of themselves is a north star. For others, humanity is that. This idea of evidence is why I am so interested in the supernatural. As a photographer, it's something I could never react to photographically. You can't photograph a ghost. So, how do you bring into focus the failure of the camera to be an agent of proof and truth-telling? It's become an important analogy for me as somebody who has roots in street photography and documentary-style storytelling to challenge what the medium does with this kind of slippery idea of truth.

The show notes in Psychic Repair mention how the supernatural operates as a metaphor for the unseen, transient forces of contemporary beauty and fashion culture. Could you tell me more about the link there?

Farah Al Qasimi: I was thinking more broadly about consumerism. The show is named after one of the videos in it, about a plastic doll who gets discarded quickly and ends up in a landfill, but can't disintegrate. She comes back to haunt her previous owners. The idea behind the film comes from thinking about metaphysicality and the porousness of different materials. When we think about haunted dolls, we usually think about Victorian dolls. But those were made from organic fabrics that come from the earth without any intervention. Now, you have plastic that can only exist after all of this mediation that takes it so far away from its original form. Everybody knows that the world is being completely overtaken by plastic garbage. So how do these newer materials relate to the concept of haunting? 

I want to know more about the doll. Who is she?

Farah Al Qasimi: I found her at the Emirati equivalent of a Dollar Store. Abu Dhabi is turning into more of a pedestrian city than it was when I grew up there. I go on these really long evening walks, and sometimes I'll see something in a window, and I'll go into a shop. I also collect mechanical toys. Part of what's freaky about them is that they look haunted because they move on their own. There are so many famous haunted doll movies because they are often such poor simulations and caricatures of human likeness. That uncanny shivery feeling is already there. So I let her wander around the kitchen in the dark. I had already written the song in the film, but she seemed like the perfect agent.

How are the photos in conversation with the films?

Farah Al Qasimi: When I make photographs, which is really kind of the central process to all of my different ways of working in my practice, there are a set of things that I always want to return to. The simplest version is that I like to make photographs of my friends. I work between New York and the Emirates; I'm from both places. So it's natural that my work so far has mostly been in those places. With a lot of interior portraits or domestic portraits, there is this sense that the person is hiding from something. The photographs engage that anxiety of being seen and wanting to turn away. 

Why do you think people are craving the supernatural right now?

Farah Al Qasimi: Part of the reason why people are looking for this additional kind of comfort that they might not be able to find in a church or a mosque is that there is a justified complete loss of faith for humanity and what it's meant to stand for. Multiple genocides are unfolding on the internet in front of our very eyes. In the US, we're seeing complete brutality by ICE, who are agents of chaos. It's natural to want some affirmation that somehow, somewhere in all of this, there is still something to be preserved. That there is something worth pulling from the rubble. For me, in moments where I feel that way, I turn to people who are older, who lived through the Cold War or just have seen the different cycles of violence. 

We spoke earlier about girlhood. What parts of the exhibition pull from your experience of womanhood in the US specifically?

Farah Al Qasimi: Now, as someone who is in my mid-thirties, I look back at the rage that I felt when I was in my early mid-teens and how it was this really potent combination of internal narcissistic rage that any young person feels, combined with a deep sense of concern about the state of the world. I mean, 9/11 happened when I was 10. I was surrounded by the genesis of all of the language, all of the scaffolding of language that enabled the US to carry out so many egregious acts of terror against Iraq and the Arab world. In seeing that, and being suddenly aware of the fact that everything I learned about justice was not reflected in the world at large, there was a lot of anger. I grew up in a place that doesn't have the history of external public protest in the way that the US does, so seeing young people go outside of themselves and protest ICE or organise school walkouts is so brave and punk rock. That's where hope lives.

Farah Al Qasimi's Psychic Repair is running at SCAD until 7 June 2026.

US President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to ""begin the process of identifying and releasing"" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. 

Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said ""aliens are real"" on a podcast last week. 

""He's not supposed to be doing that,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: ""He made a big mistake.""

Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: ""Well, I don't know if they're real or not.""

Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. 

""They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,"" Obama said. 

""There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.""

After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. 

In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: ""I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!"" 

Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire ""lightning"" round of questions on the podcast.

There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.

For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and ""doesn't have an opinion on it"". 

Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that ""based on the tremendous interest shown"" he will seek the release of files ""related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters"".

The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a secret Pentagon programme to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.

In 2022, Congress held the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter - setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.

The following year, a US House of Representatives panel on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was ""no evidence"" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects. 

A second US aircraft carrier appears to be heading towards the Middle East as Washington increases its pressure on Iran.

President Trump says he is ordering government agencies to come clean about UFOs and the possibility of alien encounters. That followed some curious comments from President Obama. 

President Donald Trump is directing the Pentagon and other government agencies to identify and release files related to extraterrestrials and unidentified flying objects (UFOs). 

Trump shared the news on social media Thursday night after he accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing ""classified information"" when Obama recently suggested in a podcast interview that aliens were real.

But Obama later clarified his comments, explaining that he had not seen evidence that aliens ""have made contact with us,"" but said, ""statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there.""

The president told reporters aboard Air Force One, ""I don't know if they're real or not,"" and said of Obama, ""I may get him out of trouble by declassifying.""

What they're saying:

Trump talked about a release of the files Thursday night in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters. GOD BLESS AMERICA!""

There's been a renewed public interest in UFOs and the potential of the government concealing secrets of aliens after a group of former Pentagon and government officials leaked Navy videos of unknown objects to The New York Times and Politico in 2017.

And this resulted in Congress holding their first hearings in 2022 on UFOs in 50 years, though officials said that the objects, which appeared to be green triangles floating above a Navy ship, were possibly drones.

The Associated Press reported that the Pentagon also created the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, in 2022, which was meant to be a hub to gather reports of all military UFO encounters.

Furthermore, information released to the public shows that a majority of UFO reports made by the military go unsolved but the ones that are identified are harmless.

This age is already marked by a departure from the rational. Systemic failures to protect innocents and hold people accountable are adding even more fuel to the fire

Not so long ago, if you said there was a shadowy cabal of elites who were involved in the sex trafficking of young women and girls and that some of the most famous people in the world were allegedly involved, then you would have been dismissed as a conspiracy theorist.

On a certain level, it feels psychologically safe to “other” people who have conspiracy theories – Jon Ronson even wrote a book called Them about extremists and conspiracy theorists.

Conspiracies were for people who needed a coherent story in order to make sense of all the bad things in the world. They were for people who could not handle chaos and desired a neat narrative, the way children like a bedtime story.

Having worked in the media and politics – two areas often accused of being in on the conspiracy – what I saw instead were people just trying to get through each day and get the basics of their job done, rather than being players in some shadowy network that operated according to hidden rules. People who worked in newsrooms were too disorganised to be part of a global plot! They were too busy trying to get a paper out.

There are many unsettling and vile elements to the Epstein story, which has now seen former Prince Andrew arrested in the UK on suspicion of misconduct in public office, but one of the most unnerving is that conspiracy theorists may be on to something with this one.

For years, the broad outlines of what Epstein was doing were available to anyone who cared to look. Journalists had reported on it. Survivors had spoken. And yet the story kept not quite landing, kept being filed away in the part of the brain marked too strange, too vast, too much like something a paranoid person would believe.

The powerful men in his orbit, the politicians, the financiers, the scientists, the royals, remained largely in their positions, collecting their awards. We let them, in part because the alternative required believing something that felt, to reasonable people, unreasonable.

This is the epistemological trap the Epstein case springs on the rationalist.

We tend to think of conspiratorial thinking as a failure of critical intelligence, the category error of people who see patterns where there are none, who mistake coincidence for coordination, who are drawn to the narrative satisfaction of a hidden hand pulling strings. And mostly conspiracy theories are wrong. The moon landing happened. Covid is real.

But here, the systems designed to hold people accountable and protect the vulnerable failed. Big media organisations had the story and didn't run it. Prosecutors initially gave Epstein a sweetheart deal. And a team of lawyers enforcing strict NDAs meant those in his orbit could not speak out.

Epstein himself “threatened harm to victims and helped release damaging stories about them to damage their credibility when they tried to go public with their stories of being trafficked and sexually abused”, according to a report in the files. Epstein also instructed that evidence be destroyed.

Even now, the powerful are protected through the US Department of Justice's extensive redactions of the Epstein files, which according to members of US Congress who have seen the files, include the name of six powerful men.

These are not the far-fetched claims on a QAnon message board. They are institutions that rationalists, implicitly, trust.

What is emerging from the Epstein files does look like a conspiracy.

When we accept the existence of a conspiracy like this, it opens the possibility for more conspiracies just like it, hiding in plain sight - just like the Epstein case, and before that in the UK, the Jimmy Savile case.

This will further weaken trust in institutions, the media and government.

Already this age is marked by a departure from the rational. Astrology is huge among young people, trust in science is waning and old diseases like measles are coming back due to a decline in people getting vaccinated.

Conspiracy theories feed on distrust and extend it into a worldview where official explanations are automatically suspect.

With the Epstein files proving conspiracy correct, expect conspiracy theorists to become emboldened and their numbers increase. It's a time-honoured way of trying to find order in the chaos.

 Barack Obama is not alone in hoping there might be life beyond the stars.

So, former US president Barack Obama thinks that aliens are real. Although, as he told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen last week, he hasn't personally seen them and they're not being kept in Area 51 – a highly classified US air-force base. ‘There's no underground facility', he insisted, ‘unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president'.

While Donald Trump has expressed no view on the question of aliens – ‘I don't know if they're real or not' – he has apparently been angered by Obama revealing this ‘classified information'. And so, seemingly to head off the conspiracy theorists, he has now announced that the State Department will ‘begin the process of identifying and releasing' government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life.

There is something unavoidably quaint about the UFO conspiracy theory. The discovery of supposed alien space-craft debris near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, is closer to the time of Jack the Ripper than it is to the present moment. The idea that materials discovered there belong to some advanced interstellar craft that the United States Army Airforces (USAAF) have been reverse-engineering ever since should by all rights have decayed and perished as much as the rubber components implausibly found among them. The Greys – those top-heavy, affectless, ocular beings that influenced the wise visitors featured in Close Encounters of the Third Kind – would be lucky only to be grey by now. 

Why has it lasted? It may be because, as conspiracy theories go, this one is unusually optimistic. When the truth comes out, it will make things better, more exciting. This is very different from the usual tin-foil-hat fare, which is either to suspect that something incredible – such as the Moon landings – were a psy-op, or to assign malign intent behind some genuine catastrophe – 9/11, the assassination of JFK, Covid-19 – to some agency not officially to blame. The secret UFOs, meanwhile, point to something wonderful. The possibility that the universe, and maybe the future, are still stranger than we can imagine. 

On this reckoning, I too would love it to be true. Compared with the century preceding the publication in 1980 of The Roswell Incident, which initiated the ongoing speculation, the 40 years since have been short on thrills, especially of a cosmic nature. What have we had to compare with progressing from manned flight, through jet engines to the Apollo programme, all within a perfectly normal human lifetime? Largely just a series of increasingly sophisticated entertainment platforms to simulate it all.

I remember seeing a quote in a Reader's Digest in the 1990s that turned out to be from a pastor, Ralph Sockman: ‘The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder.' I loved it then and still do now, though perhaps not exactly for the reasons intended by the reverend. It suggests that learning does not extract magic from the world, does not disenchant it, but rather enhances our capacity to ask ever more awe-struck questions. Who could not be buoyed up by such hopes?

Sadly, the fact is that the intervening decades have introduced relatively little in the way of promising shoreline. It is still possible to gaze up at the night sky and let the silent majesty reset your soul. But whereas my father's generation grew up excited by technological advances that allowed us to cross land, sea and sky at ever faster speeds, or scientific advances like cracking the code of DNA, too many of the innovations of the past 30 years have a distinctly dismal subtext. Warnings on tobacco, alcohol and anything that tastes nice. Fat jabs that eliminate the need to exercise and resist junk food from the dieting process. Anti-depressants that take the edge off the anxiety created by all this, by making it harder to feel anything at all. 

Not to mention, there's all the apps that quietly replace the hippocampus and pick your pocket every month, years after you forget ever subscribing to them, let alone why. We have communications platforms that replace the need to leave your burrow to see a working approximation of your colleagues' face. And Netflix.

Compared to all this, flying saucers are as steam punk to the present moment, as Jules Verne's Nautilus and HG Wells' Time Machine were in 1947.

Apart from anything else, where are UFOs supposed to have come from? The chances of anything coming from Mars have lengthened… to zero. And not only are interstellar distances simply implausible, our own shift in the past few years from fighter jets to drones suggests that if any super-beings from Proxima Centauri were to get terra-curious, they would not be sending their best.

The physical presence of interstellar craft in our airspace is a minor concern to those seriously interested in extraterrestrial intelligence. They just want to hear a single squeak. In the century since Edwin Hubble demonstrated that Andromeda was not merely another star but a Galaxy entirely unto itself, little of our new knowledge has enhanced our capacity to wonder if we are not alone. Statistically, as Obama himself admitted, ‘the odds look good'. But none of the two hundred billion stars in our own galaxy has yet to so much as send us a LinkedIn invitation, so adding a further two trillion galaxies is just making the silence all the more pointed.

There is plenty of inorganic cosmic gee-whizzery available. Learning that supernovae can burn 100million times brighter than the Sun is blunt-force trauma to the imagination, but it remains a fundamentally numerical nugget, as is the insane density of a black hole. It brings us no closer to linking hands across the skies. Where is the life?

Sadly, I feel that Roswell is to our postmodern, jaded imaginations as inadequate a remedy to our want of wonderment as Conan Doyle's dinosaurs in The Lost World of the Amazon Basin, or indeed the fairies at the end of his garden. But if you know otherwise, Barack, I'm begging you – do tell.

President Donald Trump says he is directing federal agencies to declassify UFO files. For traders betting on aliens, that could mean a very earthly payday.

""Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday night.

Earlier on Thursday, Trump took aim at former President Barack Obama, accusing him of improperly discussing classified material when speaking about extraterrestrial life on a recent podcast.

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Obama ""gave classified information"" and wasn't ""supposed to be doing that,"" adding that he could get him ""out of trouble"" by declassifying the relevant files.

Obama said in a tongue-in-cheek exchange with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen last week that aliens are ""real"" and that they're not ""being kept"" at Area 51. He later clarified in an Instagram post that there was no evidence during his presidency that aliens ""have made contact with us.""

Aliens have always had a niche following. In prediction markets, aliens are tradable assets.

On the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, guessing about aliens has become a high-volume betting category. Traders have poured millions of dollars into whether the US will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life.

One of the platform's largest markets asks whether the US will confirm that aliens exist before 2027. The market has drawn more than $4 million in trading volume as of Thursday.

Betting activity has also centered on whether a Trump administration would declassify UFO files before 2027, with odds climbing above 80% in December.

Polymarket users also placed bets on other extraterrestrial theories, including whether mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey were aliens.

If the files are released and contain anything definitive, longtime alien bettors may finally cash in.

In November 2024, unidentified drones were seen flying at night over New Jersey and other East Coast states.

The mysterious sightings unsettled residents and drew questions from local officials, fueling a wave of speculation about what — or who — was in the sky. Alien theories quickly gained traction.

At that time, Trump said the government ""knows what is happening"" but wasn't sharing it.

""For some reason, they don't want to comment. I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows, and our president knows, and for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense,"" he said at Mar-a-Lago.

""Something strange is going on,"" he added.

A Facebook group titled ""New Jersey Mystery Drones — let's solve it"" has grown to more than 81,000 members as of writing. Users in the group continue to float the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement, alongside speculation about commercial or military craft.

Demonstrators were outside hotel in Washington demanding the release of political prisoners in Azerbaijan

Bodyguards traveling with the Azerbaijani president, who was visiting Washington for the inaugural meeting of Donald Trump's Board of Peace, punched, kicked and chased protesters outside a Washington hotel on Thursday, video footage shows.

Demonstrators calling for the release of political prisoners were driven from the street near the motorcade of Ilham Aliyev, the Azerbaijani leader.

The clashes broke out outside the Waldorf Astoria on Pennsylvania Avenue, blocks from the White House, where Aliyev was staying during an official visit.

Aliyev has spent more than two decades crushing political opposition and dissent in Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan's embassy defended its security personnel in a statement, alleging protesters had “violently attempted to enter the protected area and took offensive actions against the Presidential vehicle” as Aliyev's motorcade approached the hotel.

“The Presidential Security Service had no choice but to immediately intervene,” the statement said, arguing that any attempt to obstruct a protected vehicle carrying a head of state “constitutes a serious security concern”.

The embassy also said its personnel “always operate in strict coordination with the host country”.

Protesters told a sharply different story. Rahim Yagublu, 27, an Uber driver whose father is a politician imprisoned in Azerbaijan, told the Washington Post he was struck in the jaw and kicked in the stomach. Adil Amrakhly, 35, said he injured his leg fleeing from the guards and that at least four others were hurt.

“We intended to hold a peaceful protest to demand freedom for political prisoners in Azerbaijan,” Amrakhly, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, told the outlet.

Asked for comment, DC Metropolitan police and the US Secret Service referred questions to the state department, which referred questions back to the US Secret Service and the DC Metropolitan police.

Earlier on Thursday, the US Secret Service told the Washington Post the hotel was “part of the event security perimeter” because that was where the Azerbaijani delegation was staying, with its role limited to establishing security infrastructure for visiting heads of state.

The incident drew immediate comparisons to a 2017 confrontation in Washington in which bodyguards for Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, attacked protesters outside the Turkish ambassador's residence, injuring 11 people including a police officer. A similar altercation involving Erdoğan's security detail had occurred the previous year outside the Brookings Institution.

Aliyev was in Washington for the first meeting of Trump's Board of Peace, a new body the US president announced at Davos last month. Trump has described it as having “unlimited potential” to become “the most consequential international body in history”.

The gathering, focused primarily on the fragile Gaza ceasefire and colonial-envisioned reconstruction efforts for the devastated coastal strip, drew more than two dozen world leaders – though some US allies including France, Germany and Italy chose only to attend as observers.

Azerbaijan was among the countries Trump named as having contributed to a $7bn relief package tied to the initiative. On Wednesday, Aliyev posted on social media that he met with the chief executive of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), Elliot Brandt.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The White House cites Iran's nuclear capabilities — while maintaining their nuclear facilities were “obliterated.”

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

The Trump administration is reportedly on the verge of attacking Iran in order to force Islamic Republic officials to agree to President Donald Trump's demands for a nuclear deal, and to potentially push for regime change, which could spark a disastrous, protracted war.

U.S. officials have provided no evidence for an imminent threat — the only legal justification for the use of military force under international law — from Iran.

In the past few weeks, the U.S. has built up a military force likened to that of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The Pentagon has sent two aircraft carriers – including the world's largest warship, the USS Gerald R. Ford – to the Mediterranean in preparation for the attack, alongside an arsenal of more than 120 aircraft, drones, and combat ships.

Trump told reporters on Friday that he is considering a supposedly limited strike to coerce Iranian officials into agreeing to a nuclear deal. “I guess I can say I am considering that,” he said. 

Reports citing those familiar with the administration's talks have found that the U.S. is prepared to carry out a strike as early as this weekend, and that the limited strike scenario would come within the next few days. 

Trump said this week that he's giving Iran 10 to 15 days to strike a deal. However, Trump had given Iran a two-week deadline to strike a deal last June, just days before the administration struck nuclear facilities in Iran and killed over 1,000 people, including hundreds of civilians.

The rationale for striking Iran this time is even less clear. The White House is following a similar script as it did before the attack last year, banging the drum about Iran's nuclear capabilities. But the current escalation comes as the Trump administration continues to insist that it has, in fact, already obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities — contradicting their own stated rationale for the war.

This contradiction was clearest on Wednesday, when Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “There's many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran. The president had a very successful operation as commander in chief with Operation Midnight Hammer … [which] totally obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities.”

The White House still hosts a live webpage published following the strike last year that reads, “Iran's Nuclear Facilities Have Been Obliterated — and Suggestions Otherwise are Fake News.” 

A quote from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on that page says: “Based on everything we have seen — and I've seen it all — our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons.”

The idea that the nuclear facilities were “obliterated” is untrue. Numerous experts have said that the nuclear program was likely set back by a few years, if not just a few months. 

But, regardless of the facts, the Trump administration is seemingly claiming that the strikes are necessary to prevent Iran from making progress toward a nuclear weapon, while also saying that the military already completely destroyed their ability last year to make a nuclear weapon.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday in an interview with MS NOW that the U.S.'s negotiators, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have actually not demanded zero uranium enrichment at all. 

“We have not offered any suspension and the U.S. side has not asked for zero enrichment,” said Araqchi. “What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran's nuclear program, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever.”

And yet, the White House has repeatedly said that Trump seeks to end all of Iran's uranium enrichment activities, with Trump saying that “bad things will happen” if the country doesn't.

It is illegal under the UN charter to threaten the use of force to achieve diplomatic goals.

”The president has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them, and that they cannot enrich uranium,” the White House said in response to Araqchi's comments.

Trump said last weekend that regime change is “the best thing that could happen” in Iran, but the negotiations between the two countries have seemingly not included talks regarding the recent protests.

Reuters reported Friday that the U.S. has planned for options including an operation for regime change, with the military “preparing for a sustained, weeks-long operation against Iran that could include striking Iranian security facilities as well as nuclear infrastructure.”

Despite the similarities in the buildup of military force, the current circumstances stand in sharp contrast to the lead up to the Iraq War. 

Before the invasion, the Bush administration made up fantastical lies about Iraq's “weapons of mass destruction,” flooding media outlets with claims that Iraq had the capability to unleash terror on the U.S. at any moment. 

“The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons, for over a decade,” President George W. Bush said in his 2002 State of the Union address. According to Pew, following that address, 77 percent of Americans said that the U.S. should use military force if Iraq was shown to be developing such a weapon. 

Perhaps as a result of the contradictory messaging from the Trump administration and the public's memory of the disastrous consequences of the 2003 Iraq invasion, by comparison, the prospect of war with Iran is extremely unpopular. Last month, Quinnipiac found that only 18 percent of registered U.S. voters say the U.S. should take military action against Iran for its brutal repression of protesters, while 70 percent were opposed.

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

            US Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas is denying that he had an affair with a staffer who died by suicide last year, allegations that have gained new traction in the final days before a March 3 primary election.
    


            Attorney Bobby Barrera, who represents Adrian Aviles, said his client's spouse, Regina Ann Santos-Aviles, had confessed that she had been having an affair with Gonzales in June   2024.
    


            Gonzales denies having had the affair and says he's being blackmailed.
    


            Santos-Aviles, a former staffer in Gonzales' district office in Uvalde, Texas, died in September, according to CNN affiliate KENS. The county medical examiner ruled that she died of self-immolation and listed her manner of death as suicide.
    


            Barrera added that Santos-Aviles in 2024, showed text messages to her husband that revealed the extent of the affair. While Barrera described the messages as “substantial,” “graphic” and “detailed about the sexual relationship” that allegedly occurred between Santos-Aviles and Gonzales, he said it was up to Aviles to release the messages because of their sensitive nature.
    


            Gonzales is in the midst of a tough GOP primary fight against Brandon Herrera, a YouTube personality who ran against him in 2024. Gonzales, who beat Herrera in a runoff two years ago by 354 votes, insists that Herrera is behind the reports of an affair.
    


            In November, the lawmaker dismissed rumors of an affair in an interview with Punchbowl News and said the “rumors are completely untruthful.”
    


            He told CNN in a statement Thursday: “Ms. Santos-Aviles was a kind soul who devoted her life to making the community a better place. Her efforts led to improvements in school safety, healthcare, and rural water like never before. It's shameful that Brandon Herrera is using a disgruntled former staffer to smear her memory and score political points, conveniently pushing this out the very day early voting started. I am not going to engage in these personal smears and instead will remain focused on helping President Trump secure the border and improve the lives of all Texans.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Herrera for comment. In a post on X this week, Herrera wrote: “You blame me? Are you kidding me?”
    


            “Tony Gonzales is an irredeemable coward, who dodges accountability and lies to the people,” Herrera added. “This started with my problems with your votes in Congress, but now I understand you are a horrifically wicked man who must be removed.”
    


            The allegations from the attorney for Santos-Aviles' husband follow a report in the San Antonio Express-News that said Santos-Aviles told a former employee of Gonzales' district office, whom she worked closely with, about the affair. The San Antonio Express-News spoke with the unnamed former employee and cited a text message from Santos-Aviles in which she said she was having an “affair with our boss.”
    


            Barrera told CNN that Adrian Aviles did not originally want to go public with his allegations but did so following the report, because he did not like that Gonzales had denied the   alleged affair.
    


            “Tony is out there in the public domain telling people that never happened, that it's a false, politically hacked campaign against him, which Adrian knew was not true. That's why Adrian spoke out when he did finally,” he said.
    


            Gonzales, in a Thursday post on X, also accused Barrera of blackmailing him. “I WILL NOT BE BLACKMAILED. Disgusting to see people profit politically and financially off a tragic death,” he wrote. The congressman included a screenshot of an email from Barrera offering to engage in settlement talks with a non-disclosure agreement – saying it is not his intention to damage the congressman's career by filing a claim.
    


            Barrera called Gonzales' post  “a desperate act by a desperate man.”
    


            “The assertion of extortion is ridiculous,” he said.

Experts say new labeling could deceive consumers as dangerous substances still allowed under new rules

In a further retreat from its pledge to ban artificial dyes from food, Donald Trump's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would loosen labeling requirements to allow companies to state “no artificial colors”, even though products may contain some dangerous substances such as titanium dioxide.

The FDA in early February announced it would allow food makers to claim “no artificial colors” as long as the dyes are not petroleum-based, but health experts say even some naturally based additives present health risks, and the labeling would deceive consumers.

The move comes after the agency in 2025 began pressuring companies to phase out petroleum-based dyes, but stopped short of putting in place a ban. Removing toxins from food is a cornerstone of the Robert F Kennedy-led Maha movement. Kennedy is the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, which holds the FDA, and he quickly zeroed in on dye upon taking office last year.

The FDA agreed to what critics label a “handshake” with big food to stop using the dyes, though Kennedy framed it as “an understanding”. Some candy makers still are refusing to fully stop using artificial dyes.

The latest decision around labeling “is going to cause confusion and allow some companies to mislead folks about the colors that are present in their foods”, said Thomas Galligan, principal scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which researches food dyes.

“It's frustrating, especially when the rhetoric suggests they are solving the problem, but in practice they're just letting industry do whatever they want,” Galligan continued, adding that the rules were already so loophole-ridden that there were other ways that companies could deceive consumers. The most effective measure to protect consumers is a ban, he said.

Kennedy defended the move in a statement: “This is real progress. We are making it easier for companies to move away from petroleum-based synthetic colors and adopt safer, naturally derived alternatives. This momentum advances our broader effort to help Americans eat real food and Make America Healthy Again.”

Consumer Brands, a trade group for packaged foods, applauded the move, stating that it “is a positive example of the FDA taking the lead on ingredient safety and transparency”.

Kelly Ryerson, Maha advocate and author, praised the FDA for taking the first step to pressure industry to move away from dyes, calling it “enormous”. But she told the Guardian she was concerned about confusion over the labeling, and added: “I would like to see these things banned permanently.”

Synthetic dyes are linked to ADHD and hyperactivity in children, among other health harms. The FDA banned Red Dye 3 in January 2025, before Kennedy took over the agency, because studies found it probably caused cancer in lab rats.

West Virginia has since banned some synthetic dyes, and Texas passed a law to require warning labels. More than 25 states are considering new bans on synthetic food dyes and other food chemical additives.

Among naturally derived dyes are beet juice, beet powder, algae and butterfly pea flower. While most naturally derived dyes are generally safer than petroleum-based, some can be dangerous.

“As a foundational concept, natural doesn't mean safe,” Galligan said, which contradicts the average consumers' assumptions.

He noted that lead and arsenic, two of the planet's most toxic substances, are naturally occurring, though they are not used in food dyes.

Among natural dyes used in foods that advocates find most concerning is titanium dioxide nanoparticles added to brighten whites, or effectively serve as a primer for other colors. The toxic substance is banned in the European Union for use in food because regulators could not conclude that it is safe, and raised concern that it damages genes.

It is a potential carcinogen that accumulates in organs and is linked to neurotoxicity, intestinal inflammation, reproductive damage, birth defects and other health impacts.

Titanium dioxide is widely used across the US food system. The Environmental Working Group non-profit has found nearly 2,000 products in which the chemical may be used, though some estimates are as high as 11,000. The largest subgroups included candy, cakes, cookies and desserts or dessert toppings.

The FDA so far has ignored a petition filed in 2023 by five major US public health advocacy groups that asks it to withdraw its approval of titanium dioxide for use in food.

Meanwhile, naturally derived caramel color can contain 4-MEI, an impurity linked to cancer that is produced during processing. Food companies will be able to state that products that contain these ingredients have “no artificial flavors”.

The EWG co-founder Ken Cook said the shift ultimately represented “another broken promise” from Kennedy and Trump.

“They pledged outright bans on dangerous food chemical additives to their Make America Healthy Again base,” Cook said.

“Instead, states are doing the hard work to protect families, while Kennedy settles for handshake deals with big food and chemical companies – agreements with no real accountability and no guarantee they'll be honored.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Completion of glass cross brings Antoni Gaudí's church to maximum final height of 172.5m, 144 years after work began

The final piece of the central tower of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia has been laid in place, bringing the church to its maximum final height 144 years after work began.

After several days when it has been too windy to work, the upper section of the 17 metre-high four-sided steel and glass cross was winched into position at 11am on Friday, completing the tower dedicated to Jesus Christ. At 172.5 metres, the Sagrada Familia, to which the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí devoted the later part of his life, is Barcelona's tallest building and the world's tallest church.

As the Catalan and Vatican flags were raised, Jordi Faulí, the chief architect for the project, said: “It's been a joyful day, wonderful for all the people who have made it possible.”

A ceremony to mark the completion of the tower – the tallest of 18 conceived by Gaudí – is due to take place on the centenary of Gaudí's death in 1926 on 10 June, 16 years after the church was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI.

The end to the building at the church is expected in about a decade with the construction of a striking south-facing facade.

It was nevertheless a day full of emotion for a city that has lived with Gaudí's unfinished work for generations and, although there remains much work to do, the temple now defines the Barcelona skyline as much as the Eiffel tower in Paris or the Empire State building in New York.

For decades it was a building site open to the skies, where generations of stone masons and carpenters worked around the tourists who have ultimately funded the construction. It's only in the past 15 years, since work began on the breathtakingly beautiful interior, that it has felt more like a church than a building site.

Here Gaudí's geometrical designs have created an oasis of light, with delicate, tree-like columns tapering off to the roof, the white stone of the interior picked out in colours from the stained glass windows.

The basilica is loved and loathed equally by those who live in Barcelona. George Orwell described it as “one of the most hideous buildings in the world” and regretted the anarchists did not blow it up when they had the chance.

The anarchists did, however, destroy Gaudí's drawings and the plaster model, which years later was painstakingly reconstructed. In the late 1970s, Mark Burry, a New Zealand architect, adapted rocket design software to realise Gaudí's design.

To those who claim the basilica is nothing like what was originally envisaged, Burry's retort was that Gaudí's geometry is so precise that should there be any deviation from his plan, the building would collapse.

It is, however, now the work of many hands. There are elements that jar, in particular the Passion façade, popularly known as Darth Vader façade, the work of the sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs, and yet overall it is unmistakably Gaudí's work.

Aside from finishing the details of the main tower, three artists – Miquel Barceló , Cristina Iglesias and Javier Marín – have been commissioned to present designs for the Glory façade, which is expected to take a further 10 years to complete.

The Sagrada Familia is the city's top tourist attraction, with about 5 million visitors a year and an annual income of roughly €150m (£131m), about half of which has so far been spent on construction.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Crypto evangelists have run out of stories to tell","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-speculation-investing/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 10:00:00 GMT","

A Bitcoin ATM at a California mall on Feb. 5.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

After more than 15 years of bitcoin, we're no closer to knowing what its point is.

It's much easier to say what it is not. Bitcoin is not digital gold or a hedge against inflation, contrary to how crypto assets have been pitched to investors. 

Nor is bitcoin a currency, an effective risk asset, a store of value, a safe haven, an alternative to traditional banking or a productive asset, since it has no cash flow, earnings, dividends or yield. 

At least, it doesn't do any of those things well. None of the use cases hold up any longer.

There is no story behind bitcoin any more. It's not even clear why it has had such a calamitous few months at the precise moment the Trump administration was supposed to be ushering in a golden age of crypto.

Opinion: Stablecoins, the new kid on the crypto block, may be killing Bitcoin

Bitcoin has become a vessel of pure speculation. Why did it skyrocket in the first place? More buyers than sellers. Why did it crash? More sellers than buyers. 

In very short order, bitcoin has lost close to 50 per cent of its value, and crypto haters smell blood. The idea that bitcoin is destined to eventually be worthless is gaining traction once again.

Michael Burry, the investor who famously anticipated the 2008 market crash, warned of a potential bitcoin “death spiral” in a recent newsletter. “Sickening scenarios have now come within reach.”

New York University economist Nouriel Roubini said a “crypto apocalypse” is approaching in a column for Project Syndicate a couple of weeks ago. Should this “pseudo asset-class” be given the latitude the crypto industry is lobbying for, it could “undermine the foundations of the banking system,” Mr. Roubini wrote.

Meanwhile, U.S. research firm Pivotus Partners said it had a target of “zero” on bitcoin. “That's not just for shock factor. It's where the math takes us,” chief market strategist Richard Farr posted on X earlier this month.

For most of the past year or so, crypto evangelists had a powerful story on their side. Donald Trump's return to power promised to be a breakthrough for the crypto space. In the three weeks after the U.S. presidential election, bitcoin rose by nearly 50 per cent.

Indeed, regulations were quickly cut and crypto-friendly regulators installed. In the days before his inauguration, Mr. Trump launched a pair of meme coins. Though they are now down by 95 per cent, the Trump family pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars.

Bitcoin's honeymoon was short-lived. And it soon became obvious bitcoin wasn't the thing its faithful thought it was.

The idea that bitcoin could serve as a modern alternative to gold, for example, has been dealt a fatal blow. At the same time as investors have flocked to gold as a hedge against geopolitical risks, bitcoin has been eviscerated.

Similarly, if bitcoin functioned as a hedge against inflation, now would be its time to shine, when consumer prices continue to rise stubbornly above target.

Instead, bitcoin has performed more like a risky asset, similar to stocks. But even then it seems to do poorly, and with much higher risk. Over the past five years, bitcoin has underperformed the S&P 500 index.

So what's left? It would appear as though bitcoin has no compelling story left to tell investors.

“Bitcoin is a narrative sponge that has, for now, run out of narratives,” Brent Donnelly, president of New York-based research firm Spectra Markets, wrote in a recent newsletter.

“If you buy bitcoin today, what are you cheering for? Bigger deficits? Lower Fed Funds? Strong growth? Weak growth? Higher stocks? Higher gold? Tokenization of assets? More ETF flows? U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? Hard to say! Each story bitcoin tries on seems to fit for a while, then fall off.”

The Trump narrative hasn't stuck either, with bitcoin now slightly down since election day 15 months ago. And while there are lots of theories for the latest nosedive, there is no clear catalyst to explain what's gone wrong.

This isn't the first crypto winter to descend on the industry. Bitcoin declined by as much as 80 per cent in 2018 after a retail bubble burst and regulators cracked down. Another crash in 2022 was sparked by a series of industry failures, the biggest of which being the US$30-billion collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange.

Each time, a new bullish thesis emerged from the wreckage. The question is whether investors will be won over anew whenever the industry figures out the next story to tell.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Trump tariffs struck down: What's his backup plan?","https://www.dw.com/en/trump-sweeping-tariffs-struck-down-what-happens-next/a-76060070","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 15:54:05 GMT","

The US Supreme Court has ruled that most of the president's tariffs are unconstitutional because of how he implemented them. But the administration is prepared to reinstate them, starting with a 10% temporary tariff.

In a political setback for President Donald Trump, the US Supreme Court has struck down most of his tariffs put in place over the last 13 months, ruling that they are unconstitutional.

Specifically, the court decided in a 6-3 vote that the president exceeded his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 to implement many of his tariffs on US trading partners.

In anticipation of the ruling, the US administration had made it clear it had been doing its homework for months and that it was prepared to quickly implement new tariffs under other laws that allow the president to impose them.

In response to the court ruling on Friday, Trump said he would impose a 10% global tariff for 150 days to replace some of his sweeping duties that were struck down.

The new tariffs would be implemented under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to ​impose ‌duties of up to 15% for up to 150 days on countries related to ""large and serious"" ‌balance of payments issues. Unlike some of the other options at the president's disposal, this statute does not require investigations ‌or ​impose other procedural limits.

However, if they were to continue after 150 days, tariffs under Section 122 would need approval from the Congress.

""We have alternatives, great alternatives,"" Trump told reporters at a press conference. ""Could be more money. We'll take ⁠in ​more money, and we'll be a lot ​stronger for it,"" Trump said, referring to options available to the administration.

Legal experts agree that there are a number of additional statutes the president could use to impose tariffs on certain products or trading partners without congressional backing.

 

But they would require either investigations or hard rationale, and are slower to implement.

Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 lets the president implement tariffs on countries that are violating international trade agreements that harm US businesses. There is no limit on the tariff amount or duration, but they must be justified and supported by lengthy investigations lasting months.

Trump said his ​administration was ‌also initiating several unfair trade practices investigations under Section 301 ""to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other
countries ​and companies.""

Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 lets the president implement tariffs on national security grounds. These target specific sectors like steel, aluminum or lumber and need the support of an investigation by the US Department of Commerce. The president has successfully used these before.

Besides creating more uncertainty and new tariff workarounds, the Supreme Court ruling could also mean big refunds for the affected US importers.

When the court heard oral arguments at the start of November 2025, they were particularly interested to know if tariffs are really just hidden taxes for US consumers.

For 2025, US Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, collected $287 billion (€243 billion) in customs duties, taxes and fees. This is an increase of 192% compared to the previous year, according to calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

This money includes customs duties, taxes and fees for tariffs already in place when Trump took power, in addition to the major ""reciprocal"" tariffs added since he took office.

Importers who paid these tariffs will be wondering how to get at least some of that money refunded. For those businesses, it will be a welcome reprieve. But with more tariffs likely on the way, it will not add much to their bottom line or planning security.

For individuals, reimbursement will be more complicated since refunds would go to the importers — usually businesses — that paid the duties in the first place, not to consumers.

For the government, it would be a double blow: Having to process all the returns will be a challenge, and the treasury will lose out on billions in revenue.

Trump said Friday it may take years to resolve the legal issue of whether the billions taken in from his tariffs must be refunded. He said the issue was ""not discussed"" in the US Supreme Court's ruling.

""We'll end up being in court for the next five years,"" he said.

Since the Trump administration started implementing its tariffs, hundreds of lawsuits have been filed trying to stop them. The case heard by the Supreme Court was brought by a group of businesses.

Over the past 13 months, Trump has imposed tariffs by decree on many countries only to pause them or negotiate lower rates. Among other things, he has pointed to trade imbalances and drug smuggling as reasons to justify his actions.

US-based businesses have complained about the extra costs of tariffs. Other critics have pointed out that many of the them have little to do with trade deficits and more to do with making countries bend to the United States' will.

“I will continue to work for the freedom of the Palestinian people,” says Mohsen Mahdawi.

An immigration judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University graduate and green card holder who was detained last April at what he thought was a citizenship interview. Mahdawi grew up in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank and was an outspoken critic of Israel's genocide in Gaza while attending Columbia. He spent two weeks in ICE custody before a federal judge ordered his release. Mahdawi's case is part of a broader pattern of the Trump administration targeting international students for expressing solidarity with Palestinians and demanding divestment from the Israeli government.

Mahdawi says even though immigration judges are part of the executive branch, the Trump administration clearly “violated the rules of law” in targeting him. “The harder they come on me, the more energy and power I will have, and I will continue to work for the freedom of the Palestinian people and the right of return and equal rights and human rights for Palestinians.”

AMY GOODMAN: “People Have the Power” by Patti Smith joined by Michael Stipe performing at Democracy Now!'s 20th anniversary. On Monday night we will be streaming our 30th anniversary celebration with Michael Stipe and Angela Davis, with Wynton Marsalis and Maria Ressa, also with the Palestinian Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Mosab Abu Toha and many others. Go to Democracynow.org for that livestream.

This is Democracy Now!, Democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman. An immigration judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting Mohsen Mahdawi, a graduate student at Columbia University who was detained last April for his outspoken support for Palestinian rights. Mohsen is a green card holder who grew up in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. At Columbia, he served as co-president of the Palestinian Students Union and served as president of the Buddhist Association.

Last April, masked and hooded ICE agents detained him when he appeared for what he believed would be a naturalization interview in Vermont. He spent two weeks in ICE custody before federal Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered his release. At the time, Judge Crawford wrote, “Our nation has seen times like this before, especially during the Red Scare and Palmer Raids of 1919-1920 and during the McCarthy period in the 1950's.”

Mohsen is just one of many international students targeted by the Trump administration solely for expressing solidarity with Palestinians and opposing the Israeli war on Gaza. Mohsen Mahdawi joins us now. Mohsen, welcome back to Democracy Now! We spoke to you right after you were released from jail. It was right before graduation at Columbia, at the reception in front of SIPA, the School of International Affairs where you are now a graduate student. Can you talk about the significance of this immigration judge's ruling?

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: Thank you for having me, Amy. This is very significant and actually it's unprecedented considering all of the cases that were brought forward against students for deportation, student activists. What Judge Nina Froes has done, she has actually taken a very brave and courageous step towards justice by holding the rule of the law.

Even though this immigration court is under the executive branch, still the judge has found that the document which was used, which was the memo by Marco Rubio, was unauthenticated. And the hope that this same finding will apply on other students and based on this determination of the case was done without prejudice.

Now, I have to share with you, Amy, that we also have to consider the many different circumstances. The first step that allowed me to get here was to not be deported, to not be transferred from Vermont to Louisiana, which allowed me to be freed on bail by Judge Geoffrey Crawford. And then to be able to be heard in this immigration court which is in Massachusetts rather than one that is in Louisiana. So that gives you hope that there are judges who still hold integrity and refuse to sell their souls to Trump's administration.

AMY GOODMAN: For people who don't understand how the system works, explain the difference between an immigration judge and a federal judge. You have cases in both courts.

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: Correct. And I hope my lawyers would not be angry at me, because I am not a lawyer, but my understanding that technically—and actually it's part of the vision of this country to have checks and balances, and federal courts are part of the checks and balances. This actually has been designed and envisioned by Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers. And the idea is to separate the executive branch from the judicial branch.

AMY GOODMAN: It's interesting that this is an immigration judge who is under the executive branch.

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: That's exactly right. So even though the immigration judge is bounded by the executive branch, the immigration judge has to go through the rules and the rules of law, and based on those rules of law, what the Trump administration has done, in fact, they have violated the rules of law. And that's why the case was terminated.

AMY GOODMAN: This was your message to Trump after you were released from an ICE jail in Vermont last year following more than two weeks in custody.

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: And I am saying it clear and loud to President Trump and his cabinet—I am not afraid of you.

AMY GOODMAN: Talk about that moment as you say you are “not afraid of you” and what it meant to be released and what it meant after you had gone for your naturalization hearing, for these federal immigration agents to move in on you when you had been told to come for the hearing.

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: By this time, I would imagine that it's becoming very clear to the American people and to the rest of the world that this administration's mentality, the Trump administration, is to intimidate people, to scare people, and to make an example of people like me so others would not actually dare to raise their voice and to share their truth. And what I meant to say, actually, why I wanted to say that I am not afraid—because if I am afraid, I would lose sight. And I would lose not only sight; vision and imagination.

AMY GOODMAN: Mohsen, we just have a minute. You were raised in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. You are a permanent U.S. resident. You enrolled in Colombia University to study philosophy where you are also president of the Columbia University Buddhist Association. How has your faith and upbringing in the occupied West Bank guided your activism and your stance today?

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: Amy, I have to share—because of one minute—I have to share with you that I was attacked and other students were attacked not merely for protesting. The media has missed the point. They started saying the pro-Palestine protests or the Palestinian movement. The movement had an actual goal, an objective, and that is divestment—divestment, boycott, and sanctions—because this is the only way that we can bring peace and justice in a nonviolent and peaceful way. And we do it with love, compassion, and empathy.

That is why the Trump Administration gets so scared of people like me who organize, and are still organizing, because I will not be deterred and I will not actually give up to their exhaustion tactics. The harder they come on me, the more energy and power I will have, and I will continue to work for the freedom of the Palestinian people and the right of return and equal rights and human rights for Palestinians.

AMY GOODMAN: Mohsen Mahdawi, graduate student at Columbia University, thank you so much for being with us. I'm Amy Goodman.

Live Updates

Read updates and analysis on the decision, which dealt a blow to an issue central to the president's agenda.


• Trump slams tariffs ruling: President Donald Trump said some Supreme Court justices are a “disgrace to our nation” after the high court ruled that his sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch joined with Chief Justice John Roberts and the three liberal justices in the 6-3 ruling.
    


            • Additional tariff: Trump also announced that he will impose a 10% global tariff on top of tariffs already in place. While these new levies can only take effect for a maximum of 150 days, barring congressional approval for an extension, Trump claimed, “We have a right to do pretty much what we want to do.”
    


• Iran negotiations: Meanwhile, Trump says he is considering a limited military strike to pressure Tehran into a nuclear deal. The president said yesterday he was giving Iran 10 to 15 days before deciding on potential military action.
    


            President Donald Trump began his address by calling the Supreme Court's decision, which ruled that his sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal, “deeply disappointing.”
    


CNN's Kit Maher, Elisabeth Buchwald, Adam Cancryn and Kevin Liptak contributed to this reporting.



            It's not just the tens of billions of dollars in tariff revenue that have been riding on the Supreme Court's verdict, but also the many trade agreements President Donald Trump inked.
    


            Trump said many of those will stand but “some of them won't, and they'll be replaced with the other tariffs.”
    


            The emergency economic powers Trump cited to impose his sweeping tariffs — which the Supreme Court struck down Friday — were also what backed trade agreements with major partners, including China and the European Union.
    


            Those agreements granted partners lower tariff rates compared to what the president had threatened in exchange for promises to purchase more American goods and increase investments in the US.
    


            President Donald Trump said he “couldn't care less” if the Supreme Court justices who ruled that his tariffs are illegal attend his State of the Union address next week.
    


            “They are invited barely, barely,” the president said, referring to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch.
    


            “Honestly I couldn't care less if they come,” he added.
    


            He added that the three justices who dissented are “happily invited.”
    


            The speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader are in charge of inviting the justices to the address. Both positions are held by Republicans.
    


            Pressed by another reporter if he regrets appointing Gorsuch and Barrett to the bench, the president deflected but called the justices an “embarrassment to their families.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Supreme Court about Trump's comments.
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday he expects the Supreme Court's decision invalidating his tariffs to prompt an extensive legal fight over whether his administration now has to pay companies billions of dollars in refunds.
    


            The 6-3 ruling did not address whether and how the government should handle the tariff money it's already collected, which corporations are now expected to sue to get back.
    


            “Wouldn't you think they would have put one sentence in there saying, keep the money or don't keep the money, right?” Trump said during a press briefing. “It's not discussed. We'll end up being in court for the next five years.”
    


            The president has touted the revenue generated by his tariffs as evidence of the success of his trade policy, insisting that it's made the nation richer and benefited Americans as a result.
    


            But his critics have responded that consumers are footing the bill for those tariffs, pointing to the anticipated sprint by companies to secure refunds of the money they have paid the government over the past year.
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday he's immediately going to enact a 10% global tariff under a trade law known as Section 122 following the Supreme Court's landmark ruling earlier in the day.
    


            In a 6-3 decision, the justices found Trump lacked the authority to impose sweeping tariffs citing emergency economic authority.
    


            But unlike the prior tariffs Trump imposed, the new levies can only be in place for a maximum of 150 days, barring congressional approval for an extension. Asked by a reporter whether Trump intends to keep that in effect indefinitely, he said, “We have a right to do pretty much what we want to do, but we're going to charge it starting, effectively I think, it's three days from now.”
    


            Trump also told reporters he will be initiating several new investigations that are necessary precursors to imposing tariffs under a separate trade law known as Section 301.
    


            President Donald Trump says there are alternative methods to apply tariffs that could potentially generate more revenue than the emergency powers now off limits.
    


“Other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected. We have alternatives,” he told reporters at the White House.
    


            He said the new avenues had been “approved by the decision” the court handed down today.
    


                    “Now I'm going to go in a different direction, probably the direction I should have gone the first time,” he said, calling it “even stronger than our original choice.”
                





            He cited various laws and sections that he would use, including the 1974 Trade Act and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, but said it would make for a longer process. A number of those avenues require investigations before tariffs can be applied.
    


            Trump argued the decision “made a president's ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear.”
    


            President Donald Trump called the Supreme Court's decision “deeply disappointing” and said he's ashamed of the Supreme Court justices — some of whom he appointed — who ruled against his tariffs.
    


            “The Supreme Court's ruling on tariffs is deeply disappointing, and I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,” Trump said from podium in the White House briefing room on Friday.
    


            During his first term, Trump appointed conservative justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who joined with Chief Justice John Roberts and the three liberal justices in the majority.
    


            “They're against anything that makes America strong, healthy and great again. They also are a frankly disgrace to our nation those justices,” Trump said.
    


            “I'd like to thank and congratulate justices Thomas Alito and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country,” Trump said. “When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them.”
    


            President Donald Trump is holding a news conference following the Supreme Court ruling that Trump's sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal.
    


            At a time when the United States is short millions of homes, new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have pushed building costs even higher.
    


            But many tariffs on the raw materials used to build new homes — such as those on lumber, steel and aluminum — will stay in place, despite the Supreme Court's decision today.
    


Why?: That's because they were imposed under separate laws allowing tariffs on national security threats or unfairly dumped imports.
    


            The National Association of Home Builders recently estimated that tariffs could add an average of $10,900 to the cost of building each new home.
    


                    “With the nation facing a housing affordability crisis, NAHB urges the president to exempt building materials as part of his tariff strategy because they raise construction costs, impede supply chains and result in market and business uncertainty that make it difficult for builders to price their homes,” NAHB chairman Bill Owens said in a statement after the Supreme Court's decision. 
                





            The biggest question on the mind of business owners today? Refunds.
    


            “Is that going to be a thing? No one knows,” said Michael Wieder, co-founder of the baby and toddler product company Lalo.
    


            Wieder told CNN's “One Thing” podcast last spring that Trump's massive tariffs on China were hurting his bottom line and had to raise prices on some of their products as a result.
    


            Today's decision, he told CNN, could provide some relief for families but he hopes it presents an opening for lawmakers to push for a permanent tariff exemption for baby products.
    


Listen to the ‘One Thing' podcast here.



            Now that the Supreme Court has taken away the bulk of President Donald Trump's tariff-wielding authority, what does that mean for your prices?
    


            “Nothing,” said Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research.
    


            That's because Trump has other tariff levers to pull. The Supreme Court noted other authorities remain available to Trump, including the laws that permitted the administration to raise significant tariffs on steel, aluminum and other imports – all of which remain in place.
    


            And even if the administration is ultimately required to refund companies that paid the overturned tariffs (a question that remains unsettled), that doesn't mean you'll get a refund for the higher prices you paid for sneakers, furniture or other items that grew more expensive because of Trump's policies.
    


            “Companies are highly unlikely to start trimming their prices as a result,” Roth said. “Walmart is not going to give you a check for the 15% tariff on sneakers you bought from them four months ago.”
    


            Trump's tariffs added $1,000 in tax expenses for the average US household in 2025, according to the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation.
    


            Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said the tariffs that remain in place will still amount to a $400 tax hike per household in 2026.
    


            But she noted that many companies paid the tariffs and did not pass the bulk of the tariff costs on to consumers. So prices aren't likely to fall because of the ruling Friday.
    


            “There won't be a dramatic overnight change in prices,” she said.
    


            No recent president has used national emergency declarations like President Donald Trump has. He declared eight of them in his first 100 days — about as many as other recent presidents had declared in entire four-year terms.
    


            And the reason is clear: They unlock emergency powers that Trump likes because he can exercise them on his own.
    


            But the justices seemed to have a warning for him, saying in no uncertain terms that emergency powers shouldn't be treated as some kind of cheat code.
    


            “'Emergency powers,' after all, ‘tend to kindle emergencies,'” they wrote.
    


            “And as the Framers understood, emergencies can ‘afford a ready pretext for usurpation' of congressional power,” they added.
    


            At another point, they summarized the Trump administration's argument as: “All it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a Presidential declaration of emergency, which the Government asserts is unreviewable.”
    


            Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch in his concurrence noted that the administration's argument would allow presidents to impose tariffs “on virtually any imports for any emergency any President might perceive.”
    


            The language is pretty strong. And it's inauspicious for Trump, given how much of his agenda is built on claiming emergency powers and how many of those claims could go before these same justices.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson did not reveal what his next steps will be after the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump violated federal law when he unilaterally imposed sweeping tariffs across the globe, only saying that “Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks.”
    


            “No one can deny that the President's use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America's trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades. Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks,” Johnson said in a statement posted to X.
    


            Senate GOP Leader John Thune said that tariffs “can be an important and effective tool,” but did not criticize the Supreme Court's ruling.
    


            Thune has previously acknowledged on numerous occasions that he personally has hesitations around tariff policy, though he has voted against blocking the administration's tariffs.
    


            “Tariffs can be an important and effective tool to address unfair trade practices and help level the playing field with foreign competitors. Senate Republicans will continue working with the administration and our colleagues in the House to advance our shared goal to strengthen rural America, including South Dakota's farm and ranch communities, and the broader U.S. economy,” Thune said in a statement posted on X.



            The White House announced after the Supreme Court's tariffs ruling that President Donald Trump will hold a news briefing this afternoon.
    


            Trump became enraged Friday morning when he learned about the decision, which declared his tariffs illegal, according to sources familiar with the matter.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the briefing will begin at 12:45 p.m. ET.



            Justice Neil Gorsuch's concurring opinion concludes with a pretty remarkable flourish — what sounds a lot like a plea for the federal government to return to the business of actually legislating.
    


            “For those who think it important for the Nation to impose more tariffs, I understand that today's decision will be disappointing,” he begins.
    


            He then writes that the Constitution gave Congress the power over taxes and tariffs for a reason.
    


                    “Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises,” Gorsuch says. “But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the Nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people's elected representatives, not just that of one faction or man.”
                





            He then suggests that Trump's tariffs, which often shifted by the day or even by the hour, are a good example of why legislation is preferable. Laws passed by Congress tend to “endure,” allowing “ordinary people to plan their lives in ways they cannot when the rules shift from day to day.”
    


            He concludes that “if history is any guide, the tables will turn and the day will come when those disappointed by today's result will appreciate the legislative process for the bulwark of liberty it is.”
    


            American industry groups applauded the Supreme Court ruling Friday that struck down President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs.
    


            The National Retail Federation, which represents retailers including Walmart, Kroger and Costco, said the decision provided “much-needed certainty for US businesses and manufacturers.”
    


            “Clear and consistent trade policy is essential for economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for American families,” said David French, NRFs executive vice president of government relations.
    


            The US footwear industry said this decision “provides relief at a time when cost pressures have been significant.”
    


            Ninety-nine percent of all shoes sold in the US are imported, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.
    


                    “By removing these widespread tariffs, the footwear industry can redirect billions of dollars toward innovation, job creation, and affordability for families across the country,” said Matt Priest, president and CEO of FDRA.
                





            The court did not rule on the fate of the $130 billion in tariffs that has already been collected, but the NRF urged the lower courts to “ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to U.S. importers.”
    


            The US Chamber of Commerce, which called the ruling welcome news for businesses and consumers, also urged refunds.
    


            “Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year,” said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce.
    


            Following today's SCOTUS ruling that President Donald Trump's sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal, California Gov. Gavin Newsom called on the administration to “immediately” issue refund checks “with interest.”
    


                    “Time to pay the piper, Donald,” Newsom wrote. “ These tariffs were nothing more than an illegal cash grab that drove up prices and hurt working families, so you could wreck longstanding alliances and extort them. Every dollar unlawfully taken must be refunded immediately — with interest. Cough up!”
                





            The governor also noted that his state had been the first to challenge Trump's tariffs, filing suit in April 2025 to stop the tariffs imposed without congressional approval.
    


            The USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group has entered the Mediterranean Sea heading towards the Middle East to join a significant number of other US military assets in the region as President Donald Trump weighs his options for military actions against Iran.
    


            Trump said a week ago he was sending the Ford to the region; up until then, the strike group had been in the Caribbean Sea for several months amid the administration's campaign against Venezuela. The Ford group entered the Mediterranean, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar on Friday, according to open source ship tracking data and pictures posted to social media reviewed by CNN.
    


            CNN reported Thursday that Trump is still weighing his options for strikes if he goes ahead with military action, ranging from more limited, target strikes to sustained operations that could last weeks. US forces have not yet been given a target list, a source familiar with the planning said.
    


            The US has been engaged in a massive buildup of military assets in the Middle East, deploying fighter jets and refueling tankers, as well as flowing in dozens of cargo planes worth of equipment including additional air defense systems. The Ford also joins nearly a dozen US Navy ships, including the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group.
    


            The Ford aircraft carrier is the world's largest carrier. The strike group includes destroyers USS Winston Churchill, USS Bainbridge, and USS Mahan, as well as Carrier Air Wing 8 which is composed of four fighter squadrons, an electronic attack squadron, and more.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision to restrict some of President Donald Trump's tariff powers could end up being a gift to US consumers and businesses caught in the crossfire of higher import prices and skyrocketing uncertainty, economists said Friday.
    


            “It will force a reset in tariff policy that is likely to lead to lower overall tariff rates and a more orderly imposition of future tariffs,” Heather Long, Navy Federal Credit Union's chief economist, wrote Friday. “This will boost economic growth and provide some relief for American consumers. Smaller firms will be especially helped by this ruling.”
    


            However, while Friday's decision could force a more straightforward approach to enacting tariffs, it might only end up stoking already high uncertainty, cautioned Olu Sonola, head of US economics at Fitch Ratings.
    


            Sonola estimated that the decision rolls back about 60% of the 2025 tariffs, totaling upward of $200 billion, and cutting the effective tariff rate by more than half, to 6%.
    


            “However, the bigger macro takeaway is not just ‘lower tariffs,' but ‘higher tariff-regime uncertainty,'” he wrote Friday.
    


            “The odds that tariffs reappear in a revised form remain meaningful. Layer on potential tariff refunds, and you introduce a messy operational and legal overhang that amplifies economic uncertainty.”
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hailed the Supreme Court's ruling on the president's ability to impose tariffs as a victory.
    


                    “The Supreme Court decision striking down the harmful Trump Tariffs is a big victory for the American people,” Jeffries said. “And another crushing defeat for the wannabe King.”
                





            Schumer called the decision a “win for the wallets of every American consumer.”
    


                    “Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly,” Schumer said. “We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.”

▶ Follow the latest updates on the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's tariffs

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump still has options to keep taxing imports aggressively even after the Supreme Court struck down the tariffs he imposed last year on nearly every country on earth.

The Justices didn't buy the president's sweeping claims of authority to impose tariffs as he sees fit. But Trump can re-use tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression.

“It's hard to see any pathway here where tariffs end,” said Georgetown trade law professor Kathleen Claussen. “I am pretty convinced he could rebuild the tariff landscape he has now using other authorities.”

Trump had claimed nearly boundless authority to impose tariffs under 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). But opponents argued before the Supreme Court that that power wasn't necessary because Congress delegated tariff power to the White House in several other statutes — though it carefully limited the ways the president could use the authority. 

Tariffs have been a cornerstone of Trump's foreign and economic policy in his second term, with double-digit “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on most countries, which he has justified by declaring America's longstanding trade deficits a national emergency. 

The average U.S. tariff has gone from 2.5% when Trump returned to the White House in January to nearly 17% a year later, the highest since 1934, according to calculations by Yale University's Budget Lab.

The president acted alone even though the U.S. Constitution specifically gives the power to tax – and impose tariffs – to Congress.




The United States has long had a handy cudgel to wallop countries it accuses of engaging in “unjustifiable,” “unreasonable” or “discriminatory” trade practices. That is Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.

And Trump has made aggressive use of it himself — especially against China. In his first term, he cited Section 301 to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports in a dispute over the sharp-elbowed tactics that Beijing was using to challenge America's technological dominance. The U.S. is also using 301 powers to counter what it calls unfair Chinese practices in the shipbuilding industry.

There are no limits on the size of Section 301 tariffs. They expire after four years but can be extended.

But the administration's trade representative must conduct an investigation and typically hold a public hearing before imposing 301 tariffs.

Experts have said Section 301 is useful in taking on China. But it has drawbacks when it comes to dealing with the smaller countries that Trump has hammered with reciprocal tariffs. 

“Undertaking dozens and dozens of 301 investigations of all of those countries is a laborious process,” Veroneau said.

In striking down Trump's reciprocal tariffs in May, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that the president couldn't use emergency powers to combat trade deficits.

That is partly because Congress had specifically given the White House limited authority to address the problem in another statute: Section 122, also of the Trade Act of 1974. That allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days in response to unbalanced trade. The administration doesn't even have to conduct an investigation beforehand.

But Section 122 authority has never been used to apply tariffs, and there is some uncertainty about how it would work.

In both of his terms, Trump has made aggressive use of his power — under Section 232 of Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — to impose tariffs on imports that he deems a threat to national security.

In 2018, he slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, levies he's expanded since returning to the White House. He also plastered Section 232 tariffs on autos, auto parts, copper, lumber. 

In September, the president even levied Section 232 tariffs on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture. 

Section 232 tariffs are not limited by law but do require an investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department. It's the administration itself that does the investigating – also true for Section 301 cases — “so they have a lot of control over the outcome,” Veroneau said.

Nearly a century ago, with the U.S. and world economies in collapse, Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930, imposing hefty taxes on imports. Known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs (for their congressional sponsors), these levies have been widely condemned by economists and historians for limiting world commerce and making the Great Depression worse. They also got a memorable pop culture shoutout in the 1986 movie “Ferris Bueller's Day Off.”

Section 338 of the law authorizes the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that have discriminated against U.S. businesses. No investigation is required, and there's no limit on how long the tariffs can stay in place.

Those tariffs have never been imposed — U.S. trade negotiators traditionally have favored Section 301 sanctions instead — though the United States used the threat of them as a bargaining chip in trade talks in the 1930s.

In September, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that the administration was considering Section 338 as a Plan B if the Supreme Court ruled against Trump's use of emergency powers tariffs.

NEW YORK (AP) — The nation's highest court struck down some of U.S. President Donald Trump's most sweeping tariffs on Friday, in a 6-3 decision ruling that he overstepped his authority when using an emergency powers law to justify new taxes on goods from nearly every country in the world.

Trump has launched a barrage of new tariffs over the last year. Despite Friday's ruling, many sectoral levies remain in place — and the president has already said that he'll turn to other options for more import taxes. But the Supreme Court decision upends a core set of tariffs that Trump imposed using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.

IEEPA authorizes the president to broadly regulate commerce after declaring a national emergency. Over the years, presidents have turned to this law dozens of times, often to impose sanctions on other countries. But Trump was the first to use it to implement tariffs.

Here's a look at the now-overturned tariffs Trump imposed using IEEPA — and other levies that still stand today.

Trump used IEEPA to slap import taxes on nearly every country in the world last spring. On April 2, which Trump called Liberation Day, he imposed “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 50% on goods from dozens of countries — and a baseline 10% tariff on just about everyone else.

The 10% tax kicked in early April. But the bulk of Liberation Day's higher levies got delayed by several months, and many rates were revised over time (in some cases after new “framework” agreements). Most went into effect on Aug. 7.

The national emergency underlying these tariffs, Trump argued at the time, was the long-running gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from the rest of the world. Still, goods from countries with which the U.S. runs a trade surplus also faced taxes.

Major trading partners impacted by Liberation Day tariffs include South Korea, Japan and the European Union — which combined export a range of products to the U.S., like electronics, cars and car parts and pharmaceuticals. Following trade talks, Trump's rates on most goods stood at 15% for the EU, Japan and South Korea ahead of Friday. But just last month, Trump threatened to hike levies on certain South Korean products to 25% — and countries worldwide still face sector-specific, non-IEEPA tariffs.




At the start of his second term, Trump used IEEPA to impose new tariffs on America's three biggest trading partners: Mexico, Canada and China.

To justify these tariffs, Trump declared a national emergency ostensibly over undocumented immigration and the trafficking of drugs like fentanyl and the chemicals made to use it. The levies were first announced at the start of February 2025, but went into effect over time — and were at times delayed, reduced or heightened through further retaliation.

Ahead of Friday's decision, “trafficking tariffs” on Canadian and Mexican imports were 35% and 25%, respectively, for goods that don't comply with the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. China, meanwhile, faced a 10% fentanyl-related tariff. That's down from 20% imposed by Trump earlier last year. Chinese goods also once saw sky-high levies after Liberation Day, but rates have since come down during trade talks.

Top U.S. imports from China include mobile phones and other electronics, as well as clothing, toys and household appliances. Meanwhile, Canada and Mexico are both major sources of cars and auto parts. Canada is also the U.S.'s largest supplier of crude oil. And Mexico is a key exporter of fresh produce, beverages and more.

Trump also used IEEPA to slap steep import taxes on Brazilian imports over the summer, citing the country's policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro.

Brazil already faced Trump's 10% baseline Liberation Day rate. The Bolsonaro-related duties added another 40%, bringing total levies to 50% on many products ahead of Friday.

The U.S. has actually run a consistent trade surplus with Brazil over the years. But top exports from the country include manufactured products, crude oil and agricultural products like soybeans and sugar.

India has faced additional IEEPA tariffs, too. After Liberation Day, Trump slapped a 25% levy on Indian imports — and later added another 25% for the country's purchases of Russian oil, while also citing the emergency powers law, bringing the total to 50%.

But earlier this month, the U.S. and India reached a trade framework deal. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and that he planned to lower U.S. tariffs on its ally to 18%. Meanwhile, India said it would “eliminate or reduce tariffs” on all U.S. industrial goods and a range of agricultural products.

Indian's top exports to the U.S. include pharmaceuticals, precious stones, clothing and textiles.

Despite the Supreme Court knocking down sweeping import taxes Trump imposed with IEEPA, most countries still face steep tariffs from the U.S. on specific sectors.

Citing national security threats, Trump has used another law — Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act — to slap levies on steel, aluminum, cars, copper and lumber worldwide. He began to roll out even more Section 232 tariffs in September, on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture.

Amid pressure to lower rising prices, Trump has rolled back some of his tariffs recently. Beyond trade frameworks, that's included adding exemptions to specific levies and scrapping import taxes for goods like coffee, tropical fruit and beef.

Still, Trump has threatened more sectoral levies are on the way. And following Friday's decision, he said that he would sign executive order to enact 10% global tariff — using another federal law, known as Section 122. Those tariffs would be limited to just 150 days, unless they are extended legislatively.

LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — American freeskier Hunter Hess got to the end of his successful run in Olympic halfpipe qualifying, then leaned into the camera. He bent his left thumb and forefinger into the shape of an “L,” lifted it to his forehead and pointed at it with the other hand. 

“Apparently,” he explained, “I'm a loser.”

The 27-year-old who received that label from U.S. President Donald Trump at the start of the Olympics — leading to threats to his family and setting off the first major political imbroglio of the Games — finally got in the starting gate Friday. Fired up after nailing his first run, he flashed the “L” sign, then explained he has used the entire episode as motivation.

“I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this happen,” Hess said. “I'm not going to let controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough. My original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn't take it that way. I'm so happy to be here, so happy to represent Team USA.”

Hess was one of four Americans to qualify for the 12-man final, all of whom have a chance to give the U.S. team its first gold medal over nearly two weeks of skiing and snowboarding at the Livigno Snow Park. 

During a news conference at the start of the Games, skiers were asked how they felt representing the country during the Trump administration's heightened immigration enforcement actions back home. 




Hess' response: “If it aligns with my moral values, I feel like I'm representing it. Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the U.S.”

That caught Trump's attention.

“Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn't represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics. If that's the case, he shouldn't have tried out for the Team, and it's too bad he's on it,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social account.

After a few days, that died down. The freeskiers, placed on the back end of the Olympic schedule, retreated to Laax, Switzerland, for a week of training. Hess conceded it wasn't the easiest time. 

“I had a week that was pretty challenging,” he said. “Luckily, my family was there to support me and help me get through it. There was a lot of noise and I've never been subject to that kind of criticism. Skiing has saved my life time and time again and it seems to have done so again.”

He said, “There's been a lot of hate out there. All those people are super entitled to their opinion, and I respect it.”

Ultimately, though, he said he had no second thoughts about what he said in that fateful Feb. 6 news conference. The message, he insisted, was really a message of support.

“I stand with what I said. I love the United States of America. I cannot reiterate that enough. It means the absolute world to me to be able to represent Team USA here. I worked so, so hard to get here. I stick with what I said.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia could have some form of uranium enrichment within the kingdom under a proposed nuclear deal with the United States, congressional documents and an arms control group suggest, raising proliferation concerns as an atomic standoff between Iran and America continues. 

U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden both tried to reach a nuclear deal with the kingdom to share American technology. Nonproliferation experts warn any spinning centrifuges within Saudi Arabia could open the door to a possible weapons program for the kingdom, something its assertive crown prince has suggested he could pursue if Tehran obtains an atomic bomb. 

Already, Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan signed a mutual defense pact last year after Israel launched an attack on Qatar targeting Hamas officials. Pakistan's defense minister then said his nation's nuclear program “will be made available” to Saudi Arabia if needed, something seen as a warning for Israel, long believed to be the Middle East's only nuclear-armed state. 

“Nuclear cooperation can be a positive mechanism for upholding nonproliferation norms and increasing transparency, but the devil is in the details,” wrote Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. 

The documents raise “concerns that the Trump administration has not carefully considered the proliferation risks posed by its proposed nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia or the precedent this agreement may set.” 

Saudi Arabia did not respond to questions Friday from The Associated Press.




The congressional document, also seen by the AP, shows the Trump administration aims to reach 20 nuclear business deals with nations around the world, including Saudi Arabia. The deal with Saudi Arabia could be worth billions of dollars, it adds. 

The document contends that reaching a deal with the kingdom “will advance the national security interests of the United States, breaking with the failed policies of inaction and indecision that our competitors have capitalized on to disadvantage American industry and diminish the United States standing globally in this critical sector.” China, France, Russia and South Korea are among the leading nations that sell nuclear power plant technology abroad. 

The draft deal would see America and Saudi Arabia enter safeguard agreements with the United Nations' nuclear watchdog — the International Atomic Energy Agency or IAEA. That would include oversight of the “most proliferation-sensitive areas of potential nuclear cooperation,” it added. It listed enrichment, fuel fabrication and reprocessing as potential areas. 

“This suggests that once the bilateral safeguards agreement is in place, it will open the door for Saudi Arabia to acquire uranium enrichment technology or capabilities — possibly even from the United States,” Davenport wrote. “Even with restrictions and limits, it seems likely that Saudi Arabia will have a path to some type of uranium enrichment or access to knowledge about enrichment.”

Saudi Arabia is a member state of the IAEA, a Vienna-based agency which promotes peaceful nuclear work but also inspects nations to ensure they don't have clandestine atomic weapons programs. 

The IAEA told the AP in a statement on Friday that it “maintains regular contact with both parties and is able to apply verification measures in connection with bilateral cooperation agreements.” 

“If the parties will request the agency to apply verification measures in connection with their bilateral cooperation agreements, the agency will continue to consult with the parties concerned and address the request in accordance with its established procedures,” the IAEA added.

Enrichment isn't an automatic path to a nuclear weapon — a nation also must master other steps including the use of synchronized high explosives, for instance. But it does open the door to weaponization, which has fueled the concerns of the West over Iran's program. 

The United Arab Emirates, a neighbor to Saudi Arabia, signed what is referred to as a “123 agreement” with the U.S. to build its Barakah nuclear power plant with South Korean assistance. But the UAE did so without seeking enrichment, something nonproliferation experts have held up as the “gold standard” for nations wanting atomic power.

The push for a Saudi-U.S. deal comes as Trump threatens military action against Iran if it doesn't reach a deal over its nuclear program. The Trump military push follows nationwide protests in Iran that saw its theocratic government launch a bloody crackdown on dissent that killed thousands and saw tens of thousands more reportedly detained. 

In Iran's case, it long has insisted its nuclear enrichment program is peaceful. However, the West and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. Tehran also had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90% — making it the only country in the world to do so without a weapons program. 

Iranian diplomats long have pointed to 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's comments as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran won't build an atomic bomb. However, Iranian officials increasingly have made the threat they could seek the bomb as tensions have risen with the U.S. 

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's day-to-day ruler, has said if Iran obtains the bomb, “we will have to get one.”

VIENNA (AP) — An Austrian court has convicted a man of manslaughter caused by gross negligence after his girlfriend froze to death as the couple attempted to climb the country's highest peak last year.

The 37-year-old defendant was given a five-month suspended sentence and a 9,600-euro ($11,300) fine in a verdict handed down by the Innsbruck state court Thursday night after a one-day trial, the Austria Press Agency reported. The court did not identify him, in keeping with local privacy rules.

The man and his 33-year-old girlfriend set out to climb the Grossglockner in western Austria in January 2025. Prosecutors said that she died about 50 meters (164 feet) below the 3,798-meter (12,460-foot) peak after he left her behind. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Judge Norbert Hofer said that the defendant had misjudged the situation on the mountain but had not wilfully left behind his girlfriend — whose knowledge of mountaineering, he said, was “galaxies” short of the man's own. The sentence was well short of the maximum three years in prison. 

“I don't see you as a murderer, I don't see you as a cold-hearted man,” he said, alluding to social media posts about the case. “I see you as the one who ultimately tried to call help and stand by his girlfriend.”

However, the judge said that the defendant had failed to take his “leadership responsibility.” He said the woman would almost certainly have survived “if the appropriate measures had been taken,” for example making an emergency call earlier or turning back.




The defendant told the court he was “endlessly sorry,” APA reported. He said that the couple had made all their decisions together and planned their climbs together, including the Grossglockner climb. 

He argued that he himself had no formal Alpine training and that his girlfriend's knowledge wasn't far short of his own. He said she had been in good condition when a police helicopter flew over the couple earlier in the climb and he couldn't explain her rapid deterioration. He said he had descended to seek help after consulting with her.

The verdict can be appealed.

'Home Team' actor and co-producer Kevin James reflects on his latest role.

Actor and comedian Kevin James recently opened up about the harsh realities of life on the road.

During an appearance on Theo Von's podcast, ""This Past Weekend,"" James recalled an early-career comedy trip that took an unexpected turn.

He said he'd driven eight hours for a one-night stand-up gig that paid very little — especially after factoring in travel costs.

Exhausted from the trip, James checked into what he described as a ""crappy motel-type thing."" 

His plan was to take a quick nap before the show.

""I pull the bed back because I'm tired. Just drove eight hours,"" he said. 

And, he went on — ""there's a roach in the blanket.""

James said he didn't ask for a new room.

""I literally just put the blanket back,"" he said. ""I went to the show. I just sat in my car in the parking lot 'til the thing was ready.""

After finishing the set, he made another decision.

""Did the show. Drove home eight hours,"" he said. ""Man, I'm not staying with a roach. Couldn't do it.""

""There're some miserable places,"" James said.

While he decided to leave the room immediately in the circumstances he described, pest experts say travelers who encounter a roach should take specific precautions.

First, ""to help reduce pest risks when checking in, keep your belongings elevated and away from soft surfaces — the bathroom is a smart place to store luggage, especially in the bathtub — while you inspect the room for signs of pest activity,"" Shannon Sked, national technical director at Orkin, told Fox News Digital.

The pest control company is headquartered in Atlanta. 

""Hotels can't address what they don't know about.""

Sked added that common hotel pests such as roaches and bedbugs are ""excellent hitchhikers"" — and inspecting a room before settling in can help prevent them from spreading through luggage.

An illegal immigrant is behind bars after police say he ambushed a woman on a popular Florida beach and attempted to drown her before leaving her for dead in a late-night attack. 

Said Alexander Hernandez Gonzalez, a 26-year-old Venezuelan national, was arrested on Sunday for his alleged role in the ""unprovoked"" attack at Tiger Shores Beach in Stuart, according to the Martin County Sheriff's Office. 

""This is an extremely alarming case,"" Martin County Sheriff John Budensiek told WEPC. ""Random acts of violence like this are some of the most difficult crimes to solve — and that's exactly what this was.""

Police say the victim was walking along the shoreline while on her phone at around 11 p.m. when Hernandez Gonzalez approached her from behind, ""struck her, pushed her into the water and attempted to drown her.""

""About five minutes after passing him, she was brutally attacked,"" Budensiek reportedly said. ""She was grabbed around the throat, dragged into the ocean, and held down as she struggled to break free.""

The victim eventually lost consciousness in the struggle, causing Hernandez Gonzalez to believe she was dead and throw her cell phone into the ocean, according to authorities. 

""The next thing she recalled was waking up half in and half out of the water,"" Budensiek told the outlet.

When she gained consciousness, the victim walked over a mile to nearby Stuart beach, where she was able to locate a sheriff's deputy. 

Following a days-long search, Hernandez Gonzalez was taken into custody after an individual reported a suicidal male claiming to have killed someone on a local beach. 

Upon being interviewed by police, he reportedly showed no remorse when told the victim survived the alleged attack.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Our Olympians Are Being Put in an Impossible Position","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/winter-olympics-politics-trump-speech-protest/686046/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 14:00:00 GMT","

American athletes have been asked to account for Trump—then attacked for doing so.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) pushes the myth that the Olympics are meant to be a safe, apolitical space. Tell that to the American athletes at this year's Winter Olympics who are being asked tough questions about the political and social turmoil in their home country.

Since the Games began earlier this month in Italy, journalists have asked a number of athletes how they feel about representing America, putting them in the tricky position of balancing national pride against their unhappiness with the actions of the current administration.

In response to a question about what it's like to wear the American flag right now, Hunter Hess, a freestyle skier, said, “There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren't.” He added that he didn't see himself as representing “everything that's going on” in America—only “all the things that I believe are good about the U.S.”

President Trump lashed out at Hess on Truth Social, calling him “a real Loser” and saying that “he shouldn't have tried out for the Team” if he felt that way about the country. Other conservatives piled on, including Representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee, who wrote that Hess should “shut up and go play in the snow.” Vice President Vance—who had just been booed by crowds while attending the opening ceremony in Milan—said that athletes “should expect some pushback” for speaking out: “You're not there to pop off about politics.”

From the March 2026 issue: The man who broke physics

Hess wasn't alone in expressing discomfort when asked about the political climate in the United States. His teammate, the gold medalist Chris Lillis, said that he was “heartbroken” over ICE's recent actions in Minnesota. At a separate press conference, the figure skater Amber Glenn, who is pansexual, acknowledged, when asked about the issue, that the LGBTQ community has been having a “hard time” since Trump returned to power: “It's not just affecting the queer community, but many other communities.” Glenn then wrote on Instagram that she was receiving such “a scary amount of hate/threats” for her comments that she was going to take a break from social media as she prepared to compete. To the delight of Glenn's critics, a mistake during her short program on Tuesday caused the three-time national champion to finish the segment in 13th place. “Maybe she should focus less on her sexuality, and trying to dunk on conservatives, and focus on skating,” one conservative posted on X.

Trump and other Republicans may not like that some American athletes are expressing their unease about representing the country, but it's the administration's actions that have made the country so hard to defend and represent.

U.S. athletes are only acknowledging what anyone can see: America's international reputation has taken a nosedive. Many people around the world are horrified by the Trump administration's threats to invade Greenland, the controversial capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and the aggressive behavior of U.S. immigration agents, including the fatal shootings of two American citizens. Before the Games began, hundreds of people in Italy protested the news that the U.S. would be sending an ICE unit to the Olympics to assist with security. (Although the Department of Homeland Security routinely sends its agents overseas to help with major events, the demonstrations spoke to how poorly the agency is viewed outside of the United States.) Vance received a similarly frosty reception in Milan.

Jemele Hill: The return of athlete outrage

Despite Vance's assertion that politics have no place at the Games, the Olympics have long been fertile ground for athletes to generate awareness about political tensions and social injustice. The most famous example comes from the 1968 Mexico City Summer Olympics. Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two Black sprinters, raised their fists in the air while on the podium accepting their gold and bronze medals. The moment was seen as a gesture of solidarity with the Black Power movement. It also highlighted America's hypocrisy: They were world-class athletes competing for a country that treated them, and anyone who looked like them, as second-class citizens.

Smith and Carlos were vilified, suspended from the U.S. team, and sent home; it would be years before they were recognized as heroes. In 1975, the IOC revised its charter to forbid “every kind of demonstration or propaganda, whether political, religious or racial” at Olympic venues.

The IOC's rules about demonstrations remained largely unchanged for decades, despite fierce debate. Then, in 2021, it issued new guidelines to allow athletes slightly more room to express their beliefs. Athletes can now broadcast their views in press conferences and on social media, but not in the Olympic Village, during competitions or in official ceremonies. With these changes, the IOC was admitting on some level that trying to separate sports from politics, especially on the international stage, is impossible.

None of the American athletes speaking up right now is violating the rules. But nevertheless, they're being asked to account for what's happening in this country. It's not their fault that they can't explain or defend it.

Don't expect a war to end as quickly this time.

The US military is in the midst of its largest build-up of forces in the Middle East in decades, in preparation for some sort of military action in Iran. Military officials say strikes could come as early as this weekend and some US personnel are being evacuated from the region.

Diplomacy isn't officially over yet. Talks were held in Geneva, Switzerland, this week between the Trump administration's representatives — all-purpose foreign envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner — and senior Iranian officials in hopes of striking a deal that will address US concerns about the country's nuclear program, among other issues, and provide Iran with sanctions relief.

Early this week, there seemed to be some diplomatic progress, when Iran and the United States said they had agreed on “guiding principles” for ongoing nuclear talks, and the Iranians are reportedly preparing a response to US demands by the end of the month, but some US officials, talking to Axios's Barak Ravid, have dismissed the talks as a “nothingburger” and have put the chance of war at 90 percent. (There's an ongoing debate on next steps within the administration, so these comments can also be read as strategic messaging by the hawks in Trump's orbit.)

Trump does not appear to have made a final decision about whether to take military action and what form it would take, suggesting on Thursday that he would make up his mind in the next 10 days. As is often the case with this administration, the range of possible actions is wide, but for the moment, the military build-up is moving much faster than the diplomatic track and an attack of some kind seems likely. (Trump's 10-day deadline should also be taken with a grain of salt: Last June, Trump said he would give Iranian nuclear talks two weeks, then ordered airstrikes on the country four days later.)

If war does come again, we don't know exactly what it will look like, but all indications are it will be a larger and more extensive campaign than what we saw last summer, or than most Americans are probably prepared for. And at the moment, both sides seem dangerously confident they would prevail.

Here are a few key questions to keep in mind for the days ahead:

Trump first threatened new military action against Iran in January, promising “help is on the way” when protests over economic conditions broke out throughout the country and were brutally repressed by Iran's theocratic regime. Trump ultimately held off at the time at the urging of regional allies, as well as some of his own advisers, when it became clear that the US military — at the time engaged in major operations around Venezuela — didn't have sufficient assets in the region to deter Iranian counterattacks.

Analysts suggest this is enough firepower for an engagement lasting multiple weeks, not just a few hours or days.

That is no longer the case. The United States has deployed two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region, each with three destroyer escorts, as well as half a dozen other surface ships and — almost certainly — nuclear submarines whose locations are not disclosed. Dozens of aircraft, including F-22 and F-16 fighters jets and surveillance planes, have been deployed around the Middle East as well — the greatest concentration of airpower in the region since the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It has also worked to replenish air defense batteries that were depleted by Iranian missile and drone strikes during June's “12-day war.”

In short, analysts suggest this is enough firepower for an engagement lasting multiple weeks, not just a few hours or days.

This is something of a moving target. Trump's threat to Iran in January was in response to the massacre of protesters. But the protests have now largely subsided, and it's too late to rescue the thousands who were massacred.

The main discussions concern Iran's nuclear program. Though this program was severely degraded by US airstrikes in June, (Trump proclaimed it “obliterated”) the Trump administration is calling for Iran to abandon nuclear enrichment entirely, the process that can be used to create material for weapons. Iran, which maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, is insisting on its right to enrich, though it has indicated a willingness to make some concessions, such as diluting its stock of near-weapons grade enriched uranium.

The United States has also sought to expand the talks to encompass issues including Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for regional proxy groups like Hezbollah and the Houthis. Iran has been extremely resistant to this. For all the focus on nuclear weapons, Iran's ballistic missiles may end up being the crux of this crisis: They're a particular concern for Israel, which is in range of them. But Iran also views them as a core component of its ability to defend itself.

Some of the impasse between the two sides is due to core disagreements, but some is political style. Observers say the Iranians seem to be seeking a painstakingly negotiated, highly technical agreement along the lines of the 2015 JCPOA it reached with the Obama administration, which Trump later pulled out of. Whereas Trump is looking for a quick and declarative political win.

Then, of course, there's the question of whether the United States seeks not to make a deal with the Islamic Republic, but to eliminate it. Trump said last week that regime change in Iran is “the best thing that could happen.” Many Iranians would surely agree, though the president did not elaborate on what he envisioned replacing the regime.

Americans may assume that war, if it comes, would look something like June's “Operation Midnight Hammer,” a relatively brief series of strikes that was resolved quickly. That will probably not be the case.

The June war was a primarily Israeli operation, with the US joining in to attack three Iranian nuclear facilities a week in, when it was already clear that the Israelis were having military success and Iran's retaliation was limited.

This time around, the United States would be in the driver's seat from the start, though Israel would almost certainly be involved. And reporting suggests the administration has a more extensive operation in mind.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the options Trump has been presented with by military briefers include a “campaign to kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government…as well as an air attack that would be limited to striking targets including nuclear and ballistic-missile facilities.” Both types of campaigns could potentially last for weeks. Of course, the reality could well turn out quite different: Ahead of the US intervention in Venezuela, few predicted that the United States would simply capture the country's president while leaving most of its regime in place.

In June, Iranian retaliation against US forces in the Middle East was limited and telegraphed in advance. That may not be the case this time, as Iran's leaders may feel they're in an existential fight for survival that requires a stronger response.

Though its nuclear program may be in shambles, the regime has worked diligently since last summer to reconstitute its ballistic missile deterrent, meaning retaliatory strikes against US bases, as well as Israel and US allies in the Gulf are likely. How much damage it is really capable of inflicting is an open question, though Israel was reportedly running dangerously low on interceptors by the end of the 12-day war and may have sustained more casualties if the conflict had lasted longer. Iran also last week conducted exercises that temporarily shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil chokepoint through which 31 percent of the world's sea-born crude flows.

Trump has clearly grown more confident about using military force, but Iran's calculation may be that he has little tolerance for a long, drawn-out, messy conflict. In Trump's more than five years as president, one thing we have not yet seen is how he would respond to a conflict with a significant number of US casualties.

Though the Israeli government was reportedly concerned in January about the state of their air defenses, they now appear to fully support military action and are highly skeptical that a satisfactory diplomatic deal can be reached. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, deeply unpopular heading into elections later this year, would no doubt much rather keep the public focused on the destruction of Iran's nuclear and missile programs than the swirling questions about his handling of the October 7 attacks.

As for other regional countries, the picture is more mixed. During the Obama administration and Trump's first term, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and other Gulf states pushed for a maximally hawkish position on Iran. Today, while they would no doubt prefer an end to the Islamic Republic, they're less enthusiastic about war, due to concerns about Iranian retaliation as well as the regional destabilization that could result from a collapse of the Iranian regime. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have said they will not allow the United States to use their airspace for an attack on Iran, though that may not spare them from Iranian retaliation.

The UK is also reportedly preventing the US from using its airbases for an attack on Iran, including the strategically located base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, prompting an angry outburst from Trump early this week.

As for Iran's few allies, it conducted joint naval drills with Russia's military this week, but it's hard to imagine Moscow doing much to come to Tehran's aid if war begins.

The administration is very unlikely to ask Congress for an authorization to use military force against Iran, or to present a detailed legal rationale for doing so. Given that Iran's nuclear program is, according to the administration's own assessments, nowhere close to producing a weapon, and given that the United States is not in range of Iranian missiles, it would be hard to make the case that it constitutes the type of imminent threat that would allow the president to order military action without congressional authorization.

Past administrations, including Trump's after Midnight Hammer, have argued that military operations that are limited in scope and duration don't constitute “war” in the constitutional sense and don't require authorization. Many legal scholars don't buy that, but even if you do, it would get harder to justify it if the war turns out to be the kind of expansive operation reportedly under discussion.

In Congress, Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) are planning to move next week to force a vote on a resolution that would require the administration to seek congressional authorization, but previous efforts to do this under the Trump administration have not been successful. In all likelihood, congressional oversight of the president's ability to wage war is about to be further watered down.

In fairness to Trump, in each of his previous military engagements, dating back to the strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in his first term, he has been able to defy critics who warned he was risking a dangerous quagmire. But if he is really contemplating an operation as extensive as what has been reported in recent days, or pursuing the overthrow of the Iranian state itself, this suggests he may be growing confident to the point he's considering just the sort of war he has lambasted previous presidents for getting involved with.

Both sides now appear dangerously confident about their prospects heading into a conflict: The United States in its ability to inflict damage on Iran at will without significant blowback; Iran in its ability to make the conflict so painful for the United States that it can inflict a strategic defeat rather than hastening its own demise after a year that has left it severely weakened, economically, politically, and militarily

The confidence on both sides may end up getting a lot of people killed.

Trump loses, and the Democratic justices didn't need to concede anything.

The Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited decision in Learning Resources v. Trump on Friday, with a total of six justices concluding that a wide range of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican, wrote the opinion. At least some of his opinion was joined by five other justices, including Republican Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, along with the Court's three Democrats.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

But the Democratic justices withheld their support from seven key pages of Roberts's opinion, which discuss a recently created legal doctrine that consolidates power within the judiciary, thus denying a broader doctrinal victory to the Court's right flank.

Learning Resources, in other words, ends in the best possible outcome for Democrats. Trump's tariffs are gone, at least for now. And none of the Democratic justices needed to compromise on anything.

Roberts's opinion lays out two separate rationales for striking down the tariffs. One, which the three Democrats sign onto, is a fairly straightforward interpretation of a federal law. Trump claimed the power to impose tariffs under the federal International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which permits the president to “regulate … importation or exportation.”

In the part of Roberts's opinion that five other justices joined, he explains that the word “regulate” means “to ‘fix, establish, or control; to adjust by rule, method, or established mode; to direct by rule or restriction; to subject to governing principles or laws.'” But it does not mean the power to tax.

As Roberts writes, federal law is “replete with statutes granting the Executive the authority to ‘regulate' someone or something,” but Trump's lawyers were unable to “identify any statute in which the power to regulate includes the power to tax.”

And thus Trump cannot use IEEPA to impose a tax on imports. Simple as that.

It is likely that Trump will attempt to reinstate at least some of his tariffs by relying on other statutes. But, as Roberts points out, the federal laws that give the president more explicit authority to impose tariffs also limit his power to do so. One statute, for example, permits Trump to impose import taxes of no more than 15 percent, and for no longer than 150 days.

Before Roberts lays out the statutory argument against the tariffs, however, he also claims they violate a controversial new legal doctrine known as “major questions,” which the Court first mentioned in a 2014 opinion. Prior to Learning Resources, the major questions doctrine had only previously applied to one president: Joe Biden.

That 2014 decision stated that, when a presidential administration claims the power to do something very ambitious, courts should view that claim with skepticism. In the Supreme Court's words, “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.'”

Because the major questions doctrine is so new, and because it's only ever been used against a Democratic president, many legal observers – including myself – had criticized it as an unprincipled effort to choke off the authority of Democratic administrations.

The Court's three Democrats dissented in the Biden-era cases using this doctrine to strike down Democratic policies, and they did not join the parts of the Learning Resources opinion that apply it to Trump's tariffs either.

In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Elena Kagan explains that she and her fellow Democrats believed it was unnecessary to invoke the major questions doctrine in Learning Resources because “the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today's result.”

But three justices — Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett — all signed onto the seven pages of Roberts's opinion which argue that the tariffs violate this major questions doctrine. So that shows that half of the Court's Republicans are willing to use this doctrine against presidents of their own party.

Though the Court's Republican majority has often behaved sycophantically toward Trump — this is, after all, the same Court which held that Trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes — it's not particularly surprising that Learning Resources divided the Republican justices, because tariffs are also an issue that divides the Republican Party.

At a Federalist Society conference on executive power last spring, several speakers hosted by the powerful conservative legal group spoke out against the tariffs and questioned their legality. One of the lead lawyers challenging the tariffs was Michael McConnell, a former George W. Bush appointee to a federal appeals court.

What's more, several prominent Republicans joined briefs opposing the tariffs.

The broader political lesson that emerges from Learning Resources is that Democrats can win in this Supreme Court, but typically only when a case involves an issue that divides Republicans.

Learning Resources pitted Paul Ryan-style economic libertarians against MAGA-style Republicans who seek a more interventionist approach. And it pitted Republicans who have principled views in favor of free trade against Republicans who either had a shockingly rapid change of opinion about tariffs or believe that being a good partisan means following the leader.

In the end, these divides cleaved the Supreme Court's Republican majority straight down the middle. That doesn't just mean that Trump's tariffs were struck down, it also means that the Republicans were unable to assemble five votes to bolster their major questions doctrine. Learning Resources is the cleanest victory Democrats on the Court could have reasonably expected.

The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority.

The 6-3 decision centered on the tariffs Trump justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.

Those IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. They include Trump's so-called ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.

In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Trump administration's use of the law to impose taxes on imports, which is normally the purview of Congress, went too far. Trump would need a distinct law from Congress ""to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,"" he wrote.

""What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms,"" he wrote. ""When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.""

The majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the ""major questions doctrine"" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance.

The Supreme Court's decision comes as the United States trade deficit ticked down over the last year, largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. It shrank to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest figure since 2009, before ticking back up in the last two months of the year, Commerce Department data published Thursday showed.

Trump on Friday called the ruling ""deeply disappointing."" At a White House press conference, he said ""foreign companies that have been ripping us off for years"" were ""ecstatic"" about the rulings. He blasted the justices who ruled against him as ""fools"" and ""lapdogs"" for opposing political interests. 

Two groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. The Supreme Court combined the cases and put them on the fast track, holding oral arguments at the beginning of its November term.

IEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to ""regulate"" importation in times of emergency. The Trump administration claimed that it included the ability to impose tariffs — a position no other president has taken.

Lawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president.

During oral arguments, most justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, said taxes were ""part of the spark of the American Revolution"" and should get careful treatment.

""The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different,"" Gorsuch said. ""And it's been different since the founding.""

Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs.

""Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,"" he wrote. ""The plaintiffs and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or even total embargoes on all imports from a given country. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty.""

The Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion.

But his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.

If you want to know one of the biggest rivalries in AI, just ask for a show of hands.

On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei provided what is sure to become an iconic image of their feud. The pair went viral for refusing to join hands as the rest of the world's tech leaders gathered for a moment of unity, sparked by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Here's a timeline of how Altman and Amodei went from colleagues to becoming the face of AI's Cold War.

In July 2015, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Altman, and a group of elite AI researchers all gathered at the swanky Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, California.

According to The New York Times, Musk had a falling out with then-Google CEO Larry Page. Weeks later, Musk, Altman, Amodei, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, and others discussed the formation of a new AI lab to ensure Google had a worthy competitor in the AI space. Musk invited Amodei, per tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz.

Their vision became OpenAI, though Amodei initially elected not to join the startup research lab. Roughly a year later, he changed his mind and joined OpenAI as ""Team Lead for AI Safety.""

Amodei quickly moved up the ranks at OpenAI. In September 2018, the startup named him its research director.

Altman, who cofounded OpenAI while still serving as president of Y Combinator, began to devote more time to the startup.

In March 2019, Altman stepped down as YC's leader. He then became CEO of OpenAI and led the startup's pivot to a capped for-profit structure.

In November 2019, OpenAI released GPT-2, which Amodei played a major role in developing. A month later, OpenAI named Amodei as its Vice President of Research.

In June 2020, OpenAI began to show just how far the technology had come with the release of GPT-3, considered to be the first highly capable Large Language Model (LLM).

Amodei told The New York Times that the model had ""this emergent quality."" Independent researchers told the publication that GPT-3's capabilities surprised them, even as the model still showed signs of struggle.

To address safety concerns, OpenAI initially controlled access through a private beta.

The release of GPT-3 solidified OpenAI's standing, but behind the scenes, tensions were rising.

The rifts began when Amodei successfully lobbied to keep Greg Brockman, an OpenAI cofounder, off the team that developed GPT-3, according to Keach Hagey's biography of Altman, ""The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future.""

Hagey wrote that Amodei's stunning power within OpenAI had started to ruffle feathers. Differences continued to escalate over Amodei's long-held views on safety, Hagey wrote, especially regarding slowing the pace of updates to prevent malicious uses of the AI models.

Amodei told friends that he ""felt psychologically abused by Altman,"" Hagey wrote. Altman, in turn, was telling colleagues that the tension ""was making him hate his job.""

On December 29, 2020, OpenAI made it official. Amodei was leaving, and a ""handful"" of other colleagues were leaving.

Amodei has since suggested that his vision became incompatible with OpenAI's direction.

""It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision,"" Amodei told podcaster Lex Friedman in 2024, when asked why he left OpenAI.

With seven other former OpenAI employees, Amodei founded Anthropic in early 2021. The group was extremely close and included Daniela Amodei, Dario's sister. Daniela Amodei later said the name was chosen to emphasize their company's focus on humans.

Only one of Anthropic's initial employees hadn't worked at OpenAI, according to AI Business.

Despite starting from scratch, Amodei said that by the Summer of 2022, the company's chatbot, Claude, had finished training. Amodei said he was worried about what the release of a powerful AI could mean. Anthropic held off on a release.

""I suspect it was the right thing to do,"" Amodei told Time Magazine in 2024. ""But it's not totally clear-cut.""

Months later, OpenAI released ChatGPT, kicking off the AI race and making Amodei's former employer a household name.

As Anthropic began to establish itself in its own right, Amodei began to use his public appearances to take what were widely viewed as implicit shots at OpenAI.

During an appearance at a Bloomberg event, Amodei noted how Anthropic had kept its leadership intact.

""We have 7 cofounders,"" he said, Gizmodo reported. ""Three and a half years later, we're all still at the company.""

While never calling out by name, OpenAI was experiencing upheaval at the time. Months earlier, Andrej Karpathy, an OpenAI cofounder, had left the company. And in November 2023, Altman was briefly pushed out of OpenAI, an effort fellow cofounder Ilya Sutskever assisted. (Sutskever later expressed regret over his role. He formally left OpenAI just days after Amodei's jab, though there had been months of speculation surrounding Sutskever's standing.)

By the end of 2025, OpenAI's lead in the AI race was slipping. When presented with the opportunity, Amodei seized the moment to troll his rival.

Journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Amodei about OpenAI's decision to declare a ""code red"" to marshal resources for ChatGPT amid Google's rising strength.

We have a little bit of a privileged position where we can just keep growing and just keep developing our models, and we don't have to do any code reds,"" Amodei told Sorkin during an appearance at The New York Times' DealBook summit.

Earlier in their conversation, Amodei appeared to take another swipe at Altman when he talked about some players ""who are YOLOing"" by making too risky bets on future demand based on their current revenue.

""Who is YOLOing?"" Sorkin asked. 

""I'm not going to answer that,"" Amodei replied.

Anthropic used the biggest stage available to take its most direct shot yet at OpenAI.

Ahead of the Super Bowl, Anthropic revealed it was spending millions on an advertising campaign to denounce AI chatbot ads. While OpenAI was not named directly, it was clear who the intended target was, given that just months earlier, OpenAI had said it would begin testing ads on ChatGPT.

The ads featured real human actors mimicking the voice of product-pushing AI chatbots when asked questions like how to get a six-pack quickly or how to better connect with your mom.

""First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed,"" Altman wrote in a lengthy post on X."" But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest.""

Altman wasn't done.

""Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,"" he continued. ""We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions.""

Days later, the companies went head-to-head again. This time, with the release of major updates to their coding-focused model within minutes of each other.

A who's who of AI and tech elite gathered in India for a major summit on artificial intelligence.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the opportunity to orchestrate a classic image of unity: competing CEOs with their hands raised together. (It's something Modi has done before with other world leaders, and politicians have been doing forever.)

Modi almost got his moment. While Altman held the prime minister's hand, the OpenAI CEO didn't grasp Amodei's hand, who was positioned to his other side. Amodei grasped the hand of the other person next to him, but not Altman's.

The internet, predictably, had a field day. And the world got a perfect encapsulation of one of AI's bitter rivalries.

Her life has changed, but I'm surprised how little mine has.","https://www.businessinsider.com/moved-to-france-for-wife-career-life-stayed-same-2026-2","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 16:45:00 GMT","

We're a 10-minute walk from the Palace of Versailles. My wife attends ISIPCA, one of the most prestigious graduate perfumery programs in the world, and I'm an American writer living right outside Paris.

It may sound glamorous, but my daily routine hasn't really changed. Before our move in October, I sat in front of a computer all day. After our move, my life has looked pretty much the same.

I must admit, there was a wide-eyed part of me that thought the lifestyle of an American expat living outside Paris would all but confirm my Great American Novel, but the reality was much more boring.

Although there are major differences in etiquette, architecture, food, and language, as a work-from-home writer, I was surprised to find myself mostly insulated from them.

I arrived here knowing nobody but my wife. Most of the time, I'm alone all day.

Sometimes I FaceTime friends and family back home, but the six-hour time difference forms a barrier. By the time they're getting off work, it's midnight in Versailles.

I can go days without speaking French, unless you count Babbel.

When I do, it's in 60-second batches, ordering a baguette at the nearby boulangerie or picking up a cheap bottle of Beaujolais at the local épicerie for a carb-heavy dinner.

Then, I return to the apartment to write in English for hours on end, which is the same way I spent my time in New York.

Granted, there are reminders even in my apartment that I'm in a different place: The hot water doesn't last long, the kitchen tile is a dark terra-cotta with darker grout, and the labels of the spices and sauces left behind in the kitchen are, naturally, all in French.

When I look out of the window, I see the slate-colored mansard roofs that match the persistent gray of wintry Versailles.

After a while, though, even these charming distinctions recede into the furniture of daily life.

As an expat working remotely, I soon realized I would have to be proactive if I wanted to meet new people.

The halcyon days of friends falling into my lap — as in college or in my early career, when my coworkers functioned as my adoptive New York family — were long gone. No, I would have to take initiative.

I made an effort to tap into the community of expat writers in Paris. I connected with a couple of Paris-based writers online, and then met up with them for coffee.

One of them, a poet and a scholar, told me about an Anglophone writers' salon in Paris. I went to the event, read some of my work, and met fellow English-speaking writers, mostly American and British.

Another invited me to a literary journal launch event in Le Marais. At the launch party, I ran into a few people I'd met at the salon a couple of days earlier, including a friendly English guy who invited me to a reading at his apartment in the 19th arrondissement.

Earlier that week, I didn't know anyone in Paris. Suddenly, I was bumping into people I knew at a party, then getting invited to another one.

Parties always come to an end. Daily routine reasserts itself. My wife leaves first thing and doesn't return until dark.

During the day, all I hear is the clacking of the keys and the groaning of the floorboards whenever I walk to the kitchen for another cup of coffee. I welcome chores and errands, which break up the lonely monotony.

When my wife comes home and asks me how my day was, I don't know how to respond. ""Same,"" I think. ""Always the same.""

That's not entirely true, though. Some days are punctuated by heartwarming messages or small wins, like a friend reaching out or an editor accepting one of my stories.

The bulk of my daily activities, however, remains unchanged. Admittedly, this malaise may be more a function of remote work than being alone in a strange place; I felt a similar isolation working remotely in New York, after all.

It took my wife and me years to start to find a sense of community in our neighborhood. That didn't just happen. We had to work for it. Around the time we were figuring that out, my wife got her acceptance letter.

I suppose the repetitiveness of daily life is hardly unique, but I was surprised to find how similar it was here. Routine notwithstanding, I'm lucky. I live in a beautiful place, and I get to do the thing I love, as does my wife.

Living in Versailles has put into focus something that was starting to come into view back in the US: The life you want doesn't come knocking on your door, regardless of where you are. You have to go out and find it.

The AI boom isn't just lifting chipmakers and Big Tech. In Japan, it's flushing gains into a toilet manufacturer and a seasoning giant.

As demand for AI chips surges, investors are piling into companies that sit inside the semiconductor supply chain — even if they're better known for bathrooms and soup stock.

Toilet maker Toto, famous for its high-tech bidets and heated seats, has drawn investor attention. The company makes electrostatic chucks, which are critical components used in the production of NAND memory chips.

Memory prices have climbed sharply in recent months, driven by AI-related demand.

Last week, UK-based activist fund Palliser Capital called Toto ""the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary,"" according to reports by Bloomberg and the Financial Times.

After news broke on Tuesday that Palliser Capital had taken a stake and was pushing Toto to promote its chip-parts business, the toilet maker's stock jumped more than 5%. Its shares are up more than 54% over the past year.

It's not just Toto. Japanese food giant Ajinomoto, better known for its umami seasonings and soup bases, has become an unlikely AI infrastructure play. The company produces an insulating material used in advanced semiconductor packaging.

Ajinomoto's latest financials point to strength beyond its core food business. For the nine months ended December, the company reported an 8.9% rise in net profit, while operating profit increased 5.6% year-on-year. The gains were partly driven by its ""Healthcare and Others"" segment which includes electronic materials used in semiconductors, the company said in a February earnings statement.

After Ajinomoto posted its earnings on February 5, the company's stock rose 13%. Its shares are up more than 56% over the past year.

Not all non-tech companies are benefiting equally from the AI boom. Daikin, best known globally for its air conditioners, supplies high-purity chemical materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. It recently trimmed its outlook, citing uncertainty over US tariffs as a drag on demand.

The Japanese air conditioning maker reduced its operating profit forecast by about 5% to 413 billion Japanese yen, or $2.6 billion, for the fiscal year ending in March.

""Operating profit was significantly affected by the decline in semiconductor demand, decreasing by 44.6% year over year to ¥18,102 million,"" the company said in its financial report in February.

""Net sales of fluoropolymers fell year over year, despite focused Group efforts to capture strong new demand in the data center field, and was due to the stagnation in the construction markets of the United States and China and the significant overall impact of delays in the recovery of semiconductor demand,"" it added.

The company said it plans to cushion the blow through price increases and cost reductions.

Daikin's stock dropped as much as 8.4% in Tokyo following its financial results.

U.S. trading partners offered a cautious welcome to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to strike down large parts of President Donald Trump's flagship trade policy on global tariffs — but global trade bodies warned of lingering uncertainty surrounding import levies.

The law that undergirds the import duties ""does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,"" the majority ruled six to three in the long-awaited Supreme Court decision.

Trump's tariff regime impacted a swathe of countries from the U.K. to India and the European Union. Some governments, like Vietnam and Brazil are still in negotiation.

A U.K. government spokesperson said the country would continue to work with the White House administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the U.K. and the rest of the world

""This is a matter for the U.S. to determine but we will continue to support U.K. businesses as further details are announced,"" the spokesperson said.

""The U.K. enjoys the lowest reciprocal tariffs globally, and under any scenario we expect our privileged trading position with the U.S. to continue."" The U.K. agreed a wide-ranging trade deal with the U.S. in May last year, which imposed a broad 10% levy on many goods, but also included certain carve-outs on steel, aluminium, cars and pharmaceuticals.

The Supreme Court case focused mainly on reciprocal tariffs, and the ruling leaves much of the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. — including preferential sectoral tariffs on steel, pharmaceuticals and autos — unaffected.

However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) trade body said the U.S. Supreme Court decision adds to the ongoing uncertainty around levies.

William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the move ""does little to clear the murky waters"" for British businesses, warning that the President still has ""other options at his disposal"" to retain his current regime on steel and aluminium tariffs.  

""The court's decision also raises questions on how U.S. importers can reclaim levies already paid and whether U.K. exporters can also receive a share of any rebate depending on commercial trading terms,"" Bain said in a statement. ""For the U.K., the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible.""

Olof Gill, European Commission spokesperson for trade and economic security, said businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on ""stability and predictability."" 

""We remain in close contact with the U.S. Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling,"" Gill said. ""We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.""

Meanwhile, Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for U.S.-Canadian trade relations, said the decision ""reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.""

Elsewhere, Swissmem, Switzerland's technology industry association, welcomed the ruling — but warned that the Trump administration could invoke other laws to ""legitimize tariffs,"" and called on Swiss policymakers to strengthen the competitiveness of the country with new free trade agreements.

""From the perspective of the Swiss export industry, this is a good decision. The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry. However, today's ruling doesn't win anything yet,"" Swissmem said.

""The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,"" Swissmem wrote on X. ""The crucial thing now is to quickly secure relations with the U.S. through a binding trade agreement.""

The International Chamber of Commerce noted that many businesses will welcome the ruling given the ""significant strain"" that has been placed on balance sheets in recent months.

""But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of U.S. import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex. Today's ruling is worrying silent on this issue and clear guidance from the Court of International Trade and the relevant U.S. authorities will be essential to minimise avoidable costs and prevent litigation risks,"" the ICC said.

In this article

A federal judge in Miami denied Tesla's bid to toss out a $243 million verdict in a lawsuit that requires the automaker to compensate the family of a 2019 fatal Autopilot crash victim as well as a survivor.

The collision, which occurred in Key Largo, Florida, killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides and severely injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. Tesla owner George McGee was driving his Model S sedan while using the company's Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system. During the trial, McGee said that when he dropped his phone while driving and scrambled to pick it up, he thought the system would brake if an obstacle was in the way. 

McGee's car instead accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 mph, hitting a nearby empty parked car as well as Angulo and Benavides, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle. 

A jury determined last year that Tesla should be held partially responsible for the fatal crash. Tesla filed to appeal the suit, seeking to have the verdict tossed or to proceed with a new trial. 

In her order out Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom wrote that ""evidence admitted at trial more than supports the jury verdict,"" and there was no error previously, or additional argument introduced justifying a new trial or change to the earlier verdict.

""We are of course pleased, but also completely unsurprised that the honorable Judge Bloom upheld the jury's verdict finding Tesla liable for the integral role Autopilot and the company's misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed Naibel and permanently injured Dillon,"" Brett Schreiber, lead trial counsel for the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement. 

Attorneys for Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The ruling marks the latest setback for Elon Musk's automaker as the company tries to play catch-up in the nascent robotaxi market. Tesla is way behind Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China, as both companies offer commercial ride-hailing services. Musk said last month that Tesla will have a ""widespread"" network of driverless robotaxis in the U.S. by the end of 2026, but the company doesn't yet offer driverless ride-hailing services widely and only operates a handful of robotaxis in Austin, Texas.

Gibson Dunn, which represented Tesla, had argued that compensatory damages in the Florida case should be steeply reduced from $129 million to no more than $69 million, which would have resulted in Tesla having to pay a $23 million award. The firm also said punitive damages should be eliminated or reduced to, at most, three times compensatory damages due to a statutory cap in the state of Florida.

U.S. importers will be facing many hurdles trying to recover billions in tariff costs now that the Supreme Court has ruled President Donald Trump's International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, tariffs are illegal.

Companies large and small may be eligible for refund payments that in total could reach hundreds of billions of dollars, but trade attorneys have warned that tariff refunds could be denied or delayed, depending on how U.S. courts rule and how the legal system and U.S. Customs and Border Protection go about issuing any eligible payments.

Record tariff revenue has been recorded by the U.S. government, with tariff collections surging in January to $30 billion and reaching a year-to-date total of $124 billion. That is up 304% from the same period in 2025.

The Supreme Court decision could mean as much as $175 billion sought in refunds, according to estimates, but the ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded.

In his dissent from the majority Supreme Court decision on Friday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote: ""the Court's decision is not likely to greatly restrict Presidential tariff authority going forward. But the Court's decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term. One issue will be refunds. Refunds of billions of dollars would have significant consequences for the U. S. Treasury. The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.""

Trump wrote in a social media post back on Jan. 12 that ""it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay."" He added, ""It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay.""

At a White House press conference on Friday afternoon, Trump raged against the Supreme Court decision and said of paying the refunds, ""I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years. ... We'll end up being in court for the next five years."" 

Trump also said he would sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, ""over and above our normal tariffs already being charged. And we're also initiating several section 301, and other investigations to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies,"" Trump added, referring to another section of the 1974 act.

Lori Mullins, director of operations at Rogers & Brown Custom Brokers, says her initial view of the Supreme Court decision is that it does not grant or guarantee refunds. ""They have remanded this back down to the lower courts to decide if refunds will be issued. Without knowing for certain, many believe that the refunds will not be issued retrospectively,"" she said. For importers hoping for refunds, ""the answer is yes, we have a ruling but we do not have a ruling on if any refunds will be granted. That will be handled by a lower court at a future date/ time,"" she said.

""Keep in mind also that several countries have also already signed written agreements with specific tariff rates such as the signed agreement with the UK for a flat 15% tariff. This does not impact those already signed agreements so we are not sure, right now, how those country specific agreements will be impacted if at all,"" Mullins added.

In the lead-up to the decision, importers and customs experts have been pushing back on claims about refunds being a ""messy"" process, saying that because the tariffs being paid are itemized, the process for refunding the money should be straightforward.

The Court of International Trade is typically in charge of refund processes. Trade attorneys do expect the case to be sent back to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which would presumably then remand the case to the CIT to decide on how to handle refunds.

Timothy Keeler, partner and co-head of international trade practice at Mayer Brown and former chief of staff for U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, believes refunds will ultimately be due to companies. ""There will be refunds,"" he said. ""It's just not clear what the process will be to get refunds. It's not clear if companies will have to file in court and become a plaintiff to get refunds, or whether it'll end up being an administrative process,"" handled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, he said.

For starters, the Court of International Trade and litigants who file cases against the tariffs, in coordination with the U.S. government, would need some time to figure out how to manage any refund process. The Department of Justice and the litigants in the tariff cases previously asked the CIT to appoint a steering committee to manage the more than 1,000 refund-related cases filed to date. It's common for a steering committee to be established to manage the tariff repaying process.

Even if courts ultimately rule refunds are required, importers betting on a cash infusion from tariff refunds should be aware there's no set timeline and any rush for refunds could overwhelm the system and likely lead to long delays. 

Joyce Adetutu, international trade lawyer at Vinson & Elkins, said her firm is telling clients it is going to be difficult to issue a broad-scale refund with the ""push of a button.""

""I don't think that is going to be the scenario here,"" Adetutu said. ""I think what's more likely is that the CIT and the government, Customs, are going to work together to try to allow those who have preserved their claim for a refund to seek that refund ... and those who don't protest will forfeit any refund,"" she added.

""We believe it may take months, if not years, to be decided by the CIT,"" said Greg Tompsett, vice president of customs brokerage USA at logistics company Kuehne + Nagel. ""The extended period of time may also result in additional subsequent lawsuits, which may drive that back to the Supreme Court. So the good news is we do have some finality on the decision. The bad news is there is no immediate action to be taken by any importer to request refunds or to go back after that money,"" he said.

Companies will not only be seeking billions in tariff refunds, but billions that are tied up in customs bonds and collateral. Tariffs not only lead to additional import taxes, but by inflating the cost of the products, result in the need for importers to increase the value of customs bonds the government requires them to hold. 

International trade experts told CNBC that with some tariffs increasing from 10%-25% or more for certain products, importers are facing customs bond amounts that now range from the minimum bond amount by regulation of $50,000 to as high as $450 million. The increase in bond values have left some companies forced to put up additional money in the form of collateral to ensure they could pay the tariffs. 

The rise in tariffs and related need for bonds and collateral has led to a historic number of ""bond insufficiencies."" CBP told CNBC it identified more than 24,000 customs bond ""insufficiencies"" valued at nearly $3.6 billion. That's double the 2019 level when insufficiencies first soared due to Trump's first-term tariffs under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.

Importers have told CNBC because tariffs are itemized, as are their customs bonds and collateral documentation, in theory they should be able to receive their refunds quickly. However, trade attorneys also say it may be difficult for companies to get any refunds on bond overpayment or collateral quickly because the insurers will want to make sure they are not exposed to any tariff payments.

Vincent Moy, international surety leader for Marsh Risk, recently told CNBC that companies should expect some lag time in receiving these customs bond funds due to insurance paperwork requirements. The insurance company will need to verify and audit the paper trail before it releases any collateral.

Some sureties have collateral return review procedures that can take 30 to 60 days for them to go back to underwriting to review. Many small and medium-sized businesses were expected to be reaching out to their insurers ahead of the Supreme Court decision to get the process of review started. ""If you are hoping that the collateral will just be returned in due course, the squeaky wheel may make this happen a little bit faster,"" Jennifer Diaz, board-certified international attorney at Diaz Trade Law, recently told CNBC.

Democrats on Capitol Hill weren't waiting to press for action from the administration after the court loss. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asking for details on administration plans to refund businesses that paid the illegal tariffs.

""Many American businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses, have struggled to pay these illegal tariffs and, for some, the financial strain has placed them on the brink of bankruptcy,"" wrote Cantwell. ""It is essential Treasury implement an expeditious and transparent process to remediate the financial harm that resulted from these illegal tariffs.""

Happy Friday. I've spent the last 24 hours going back and forth on whether I need to hop on the ""dad shoe"" trend.

Stock futures are little changed this morning. The major indexes are coming off a down day.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Wall Street returned to its hunt for artificial intelligence losers yesterday, once again zeroing in on software names. The three major averages all closed Thursday's session in the red.

Here's what to know:

Economic data nerds, rejoice: We're getting December's personal consumption expenditures price index report, also known as the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge, at 8:30 a.m. ET. Gross domestic product, consumer spending and income data are also on the docket for this morning.

These reports follow yesterday's data on the U.S. trade deficit, which came in at $901.5 billion for the full 2025 year. As CNBC's Jeff Cox notes, that's a 0.2% decrease from the prior year, despite Trump's broad and steep tariffs.

Speaking of tariffs: There's a chance the Supreme Court will rule on the legality of many of Trump's levies this morning. Regardless of when the ruling comes and which way it sides, the court's decision could have big implications for consumers and companies.

There's a new king of the retail jungle by one measure. Amazon dethroned Walmart in annual revenue for the first time ever.

Walmart said yesterday that it saw $713.2 billion in revenue for its latest fiscal year, below the $716.9 billion figure that Amazon reported. About a year ago, Amazon beat Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time.

Meanwhile, Bath & Body Works announced this morning that it launched an authorized storefront on Amazon. It's the home goods retailer's latest push to hawk products outside of its namesake storefronts.

In California, skyrocketing rents and a housing shortage are pushing an increasing number of people to live in RVs. As CNBC's Kate Rogers and Jeff Kopp report, that's created a shadow rental market led by what some are calling the ""vanlords.""

It's a particularly acute problem in Silicon Valley's Santa Clara County, despite being home to Apple and Google, as well as some of the costliest zip codes in the country. Government data for the county shows the share of individuals sleeping in cars has jumped from 18% in 2019 to 37% last year.

Advocates say RVs are a popular option because they provide more autonomy than a shelter or streets. But there's a network of people looking to cash in on others' misfortunes by renting out aging RVs to those searching for housing without a lease or tenant protections.

Remember when job hopping was the key to big wage gains? That's increasingly in the rearview mirror, data shows.

The gap between pay increases for workers staying and leaving jobs fell below 2 percentage points last month, according to the ADP. That's down from a peak of 8.4 points in April 2022, when the ""great resignation"" was economists' hot term.

To be sure, the pay outlook varies by industry. There's still notable compensatory incentives for employees in sectors like construction or natural resources to switch jobs, while you're better off staying for pay bumps in hospitality and leisure. 

Here are some articles we'd recommend making time for over the weekend:

President Donald Trump on Friday speaking at the White House after the Supreme Court struck down his signature tariff policy.

Trump will lead a press briefing at the White House on the seismic ruling, according to his press secretary Karoline Leavitt. 

The briefing was announced two hours after the high court ruled, six to three, that the statute used to justify Trump's biggest tariffs does not actually authorize those import duties.

The ruling is a significant loss for the president, whose economic agenda and foreign policy leaned heavily on his asserted power to unilaterally slap tariffs on any country without Congress.

The student loan delinquency rate is surging, new research finds. 

Nearly 25% of student loan borrowers with a payment due are now behind, compared with around 9% in 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term, according to a report published Friday by The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.

Around 7.9 million student loan borrowers entered delinquency in the first three quarters of 2025 alone, the authors of the study wrote. The foundation used data from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel, a 2% nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with credit records, for its analysis.

The researchers said the Trump administration's policies during the president's second term are to blame for the spike in delinquencies. 

""By blocking access to the very programs designed to help struggling borrowers, Donald Trump is trapping millions in a spiral of debt that is destroying their credit scores and locking them out of homeownership, buying a car and other life milestones,"" said Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and lead author of the study.

Ellen Keast, press secretary for higher education at the Education Department, said the Biden administration had masked delinquency rates with its relief measures for student loan borrowers. 

""The idea of a sudden increase in delinquencies in student loans is a misnomer,"" Keast said. ""The Trump Administration is once again reporting full and accurate data on student loan repayment instead of extending so-called flexibilities related to a pandemic that ended five years ago.""

More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Student loan borrowers are facing a recent barrage of changes to the lending system, including the end of the Biden administration's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That plan was designed to be the most affordable repayment plan to date, but faced Republican-led legal challenges and was ultimately blocked in court. 

For roughly five years, starting with the Covid pandemic, student loan borrowers who missed their payments were also shielded from collection activity and negative credit reporting. That relief is now expired. 

Around 2 million student loan borrowers with delinquent loans have seen their credit scores fall, with an average drop in score to 580 from 680, the Foundation estimates. Credit scores, which impact people's ability and costs to borrow, typically range from 300 to 850, with around 670 and higher considered good.

The Education Department announced last year that it would begin collection activity against defaulted borrowers, but has repeatedly paused those enforcement efforts.

The Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce have likely also exacerbated student loan borrowers' repayment struggles, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. 

In March, Trump officials terminated thousands of the Education Department's staffers, including many who helped borrowers. The administration has also rolled back the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's enforcement activity and sought to reduce the agency's staff and funding, although many of those actions have been challenged in court. The CFPB oversees student loan servicers and combats abusive practices in the lending space.

""When you get rid of people who help borrowers face financial challenges, is it any surprise that these borrowers encounter problems dealing with debt?"" Kantrowitz said. 

More than 600,000 federal student loan holders remain in a backlog of applications for an affordable repayment plan, the Education Department disclosed in a recent court filing. More than 86,000 borrowers are waiting for a decision from the department on their student loan forgiveness.

Student loan delinquency rates are especially high in several Southern states, according to the Century Foundation's analysis.  

In Louisiana and Mississippi, the analysis found, nearly 40% of federal student loan borrowers with payments due are delinquent, the largest shares nationwide. 

Black borrowers are struggling most, the researchers found.

Around 20% of white student loan borrowers were past-due in the third quarter of 2025, compared with more than 48% of Black student loan borrowers and around 30% of Hispanic borrowers. 

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act's overhaul to the student loan system is likely to make it harder for people to afford their payments, consumer advocates say. The law phases out several affordable repayment plans and lengthens terms for others. 

The median U.S. household, with a family of four and an income of $81,000, could see its monthly bill surge to $440 from $36, due to the legislative changes, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit organization that promotes college affordability.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","When Bitcoin prices turned against Michael Saylor, he quietly pivoted to a risky financial gambit at Strategy","https://fortune.com/2026/02/20/michael-saylor-bitcoin-prices-preferred-shares-dilution-strategy/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 09:30:00 GMT","

Few business topics are garnering more coverage than Michael Saylor's unconventional strategy at Strategy, the software purveyor turned Bitcoin treasury outfit he still controls as top shareholder and executive chairman (the firm was formerly known as MicroStrategy). But one big shift has gone almost entirely unnoticed: As Bitcoin prices plunged, Saylor has attempted to remediate the situation by unleashing a torrent of new shares, at a scale never before witnessed at a big market-cap U.S. company. This immense dilution is keeping his Bitcoin stash growing as a point of pride—but dragging shareholders into dangerous territory.

Let's examine the specifics. At the close of Q2 2020, shortly before Saylor started buying Bitcoin, Strategy had 76 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding (it also has Class B shares harboring extra voting rights that are mostly owned by Saylor; I'll focus on Class A shares since they account for all the issuance over the past six years). As of Feb. 12, the number stood at 314 million. That's an increase of 4.13x or 313%. For all of the several hundred U.S. companies that today are valued at over $10 billion, the one ranking closest to Strategy over the same span was home furnishings and decor seller Wayfair at a 30% dilution, one-tenth the Saylor number. In third place is software provider Twilio at 27%.

Strategy pioneered a model based on constantly increasing the amount of Bitcoin its investors own per share, or its key metric of BPS (Bitcoin per share). Until this year, when it also moved into preferred stock in a big way, Strategy relied mostly on raising funds from equity offerings to amass the signature virtual currency. The process amounted to a kind of magical arbitrage: Strategy's stock price kept increasing much faster than the price of Bitcoin. So by selling shares at what now look like highly inflated prices and buying ever more coins, Saylor could keep hiking the count every shareholder effectively “owned.”

Here's an example. From the end of 2023 until mid-July of last year, Strategy shares jumped more than sevenfold, three times the Bitcoin climb of 2.8 times. At the start of the period, Saylor could buy about 1.5 Bitcoin by selling 1,000 shares. But by the time Strategy's market cap reached its summit just after Independence Day last year, it could purchase 3.8 tokens, or 150% more, selling the same amount of stock. For a while, Saylor ran what was essentially an “accretion” machine. It bore some resemblance to a scenario in which a financial engineer deploys a highly overvalued stock to keep issuing shares as a “currency” for making multiple acquisitions that raise its earnings per share.

And for a long time, it worked. When Strategy's shares peaked in the summer of 2025, the accretion-via-dilution approach had raised the coins held for each 1,000 shares from that 1.5 at the end of 2023, to 2.12, a rise of 41%. Well past midyear, Saylor kept cranking on stock sales despite the worsening math. The investor presentation for Q4 boasts that Strategy towered as the “biggest raiser of common equity” in the U.S. for 2025, selling shares worth $16.5 billion to capture 6% of the total.

Then the wheels came off. Since the apex, Strategy shares have fallen 72% from $457 to $130, far faster than Bitcoin's 51% tumble from $129 to $68 (as of Feb. 17). As a result, the accretion game no longer worked. Every time Saylor sells stock to buy Bitcoin now, instead of sweetening the mix, he's watering it down. The vaunted BPS ratio funded by equity keeps dropping.

Still, Saylor's not abandoning his holy grail. The investor presentation trumpeted: “Our business objective is increasing Bitcoin per share.” Why didn't all the shares Saylor kept selling as his stock price tanked lead to a big dilution in BPS? He offset that drag by reverting to a different and dangerous scheme: issuing tons of preferred stock. The investor presentation boasts that Strategy also reigned as America's largest issuer of preferreds last year, collecting an additional $7 billion from the offerings or one-third of every dollar Wall Street raised. The huge influx of cash from preferreds has enabled Saylor to keep BPS more or less constant. Were he to keep selling stock as his prime funding method instead, he'd be transforming Strategy into a dilution machine, just the opposite of what he wants. Hence the lurching shift in financing.

The problem Saylor faces: He can no longer count on a soaring stock to keep the train rolling. Even before Strategy went big on preferreds, it had accumulated a large pile of debt that now stands at $8.2 billion. The preferred stock is paying junk rates at an average of over 10%, costing the company $888 million a year in dividends. Plus, Strategy will need to refinance $6 billion in debt in 2028, and guess how Saylor plans to do it? By issuing more shares in a campaign to “equitize” the borrowings.

But unless the stock soars again, the “equitizing” formula will keep undermining Saylor's cherished, and heavily touted, goal. Plus, the heavy debt load and the big payments for the preferred stock have rendered Strategy an extremely risky company. It's already proved a lousy investment in the past two years, dropping by 30%.

Big dilution's got a bad name. The major tech players from Apple to Microsoft consider it a matter of pride to keep shrinking their share counts. Michael Saylor took the opposite tack on steroids. Now, Saylor's stuck. He can only pursue his vaunted game plan by taking on huge dividend payments that he's paying from shrinking reserves since Strategy generates no cash. The more Bitcoin's price drops, the more it looks like Saylor divided those holdings among too many shares. His investors are lately paying the price for financing that Saylor claimed was supercheap and now looks extremely expensive.

Oops, something went wrong

Today, Strategy is one of the most important institutions in cryptocurrency, but it didn't start out that way. Originally called MicroStrategy, the company co-founded by Michael Saylor—one of the most influential figures in the world of Bitcoin—first made its mark in software.

Now, however, it's best known for its aggressive strategy of acquiring Bitcoin for its corporate reserves, with Saylor becoming a key figurehead for the institutional adoption of the asset.

Here's everything else you need to know about Strategy and its relationship with Bitcoin.

Before it added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, Strategy was best known for its business intelligence software solutions, which were designed to help businesses more easily analyze data for improved decision making.

Founded in 1989 by Michael Saylor, Strategy quickly became successful, going public and trading on the NASDAQ in 1998 as MSTR. But just two years later, Saylor and two other top executives at Strategy had to settle a case with the SEC, which alleged that the company had “materially overstated revenues and earnings from the sales of software and information services.”

After a brief spike in its share price in 2000, MSTR traded in a tight range for the next two decades, only beginning to make a major move upwards at the end of 2020—the same year it announced its first Bitcoin purchase.

Bitcoin Giant MicroStrategy Rebrands to 'Strategy' and Everyone in Crypto Made the Same Joke

Until early 2025, Saylor's company operated as MicroStrategy—but dropped the “Micro” in February, opting for a more powerful and positive tone with just Strategy. The rebrand became synonymous with the popular The Social Network film reference in which Mark Zuckerberg is advised to the drop “The” from “The Facebook.”

In 2020, Strategy made a groundbreaking move: the company adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Concerned about the devaluation of the United States dollar and fiat currency due to inflation, Saylor spearheaded the company's first purchase of $250 million in Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty.

“This investment reflects our belief that Bitcoin, as the world's most widely-adopted cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash,” he said at the time.

What is a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury? The Strategy Behind Companies Holding Crypto

The company's Bitcoin buying strategy has evolved over time and shifted to primarily using the sale of convertible notes to raise funds to buy more Bitcoin. In other words, Strategy utilizes short-term debt raises via convertible notes that allow investors to eventually cash in for Strategy stock. It then uses the funds raised from the sale of the notes to buy Bitcoin.

This strategy has ultimately been adopted by other publicly traded companies like MARA, Metaplanet and Riot Platforms. In December 2024, Saylor likened this strategy to the development of Manhattan real estate, telling CNBC that, “Every time Manhattan real estate goes up in value, they issue more debt to develop more real estate.”

The firm signaled in October 2024 that it has no plans on slowing down in the future. At that time, Strategy announced plans to raise up to $42 billion in order to add more of the leading cryptocurrency asset to its balance sheet.

Seeking more though, the firm passed a vote in January 2025 to implement a 30x increase of its Class A common shares, allowing it to add even more Bitcoin than initially planned.

Days later, the company announced the offering of a new stock, Strike (STRK)–as a new way for it to raise money to buy Bitcoin. Selling shares for $80 a piece, the firm aimed to grab another $584 million for Bitcoin purchases to build out its treasury. The firm announced another $2 billion convertible senior notes sale in February 2025.

MicroStrategy Is Raising $584 Million to Stack Even More Bitcoin

Throughout the year, the firm would launch additional preferred stock offerings to help fund its Bitcoin purchases, granting different types of investors access to different risk-adjusted products like Stretch (STRC), Stride (STRD), Strife (STRF), and Stream (STRE) in addition to Strike.

The strategy of raising debt to buy Bitcoin has ultimately been adopted by other publicly traded companies like MARA and Riot Platforms. In December, Saylor likened this strategy to the development of Manhattan real estate, telling CNBC that, “Every time Manhattan real estate goes up in value, they issue more debt to develop more real estate.”

As Strategy has become ever more closely intertwined with Bitcoin, the company now refers to itself as the “World's First and Largest Bitcoin Treasury Company” via its investor relations page.

Though Michael Saylor is now one of the loudest voices advocating for Bitcoin, he wasn't always a Bitcoin bull.

Just seven years before his company adopted the crypto as its main reserve asset, Saylor tweeted that “#Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.”

Since then, Saylor has done a complete 180°, claiming Bitcoin is the best long-term asset to hold while committing to “buying the top forever,” referring to consistently purchasing the asset at its peak prices—which Strategy continues to do.

In Saylor's view, that means he might be buying Bitcoin at $13 million, the price target he's established for the asset over the next 21 years as he expects it to take up a larger percentage of total global capital.

How MicroStrategy CEO Went From Bitcoin Basher to $425m Buy

Strategy's persistent Bitcoin acquisitions via the sale of debt has faced scrutiny by analysts and media in the space. In November 2024, Robinhood-backed Sherwood Media outlined the “math problem,” with MSTR being worth 3x the amount of BTC that it holds and the potential of forced liquidations in a drawdown.

This premium, known as the firm's mNAV or its multiple to its net asset value, has historically traded at a strong premium for Strategy. However, as Bitcoin fell in 2026, Strategy's mNAV—which had reached as high as 3.89x in November 2024—dropped below 1, meaning the company's market cap is now valued below the value of its Bitcoin holdings.

The falling mNAV corresponded with around a 70% drop in the MSTR share price over the six-month period from August 2025 to February 2026, with the company reporting a loss of $12.4 billion in Q4 2025.

Skeptics have often noted that if the MSTR share price falls enough, Strategy could be forced to sell Bitcoin to repay billions in convertible notes, “effectively reversing its ‘perpetual motion machine'...which would further decrease Bitcoin's price,” according to Sherwood Media.

But as shares fell, alongside BTC in February 2026, Saylor called concerns about the firm's ability to pay its debts and dividends “unfounded,” noting that his firm would just “refinance the debt” should the price of BTC fall far enough.

To help avoid situations where the firm may be forced into selling BTC, it established a cash reserve in December 2025, kickstarting it with $1.44 billion in funds. It later added to that pile, ultimately securing more than 2.5 years worth of debt and dividends as of February 2026, according to Saylor—who claims that the company can cover its $6 billion debt if BTC falls as low as $8,000.

Bitcoin Giant Strategy Establishes $1.44 Billion USD Reserve—But Still Might Sell BTC

Strategy has continued its consistent Bitcoin purchases.

As of February 2026, it holds 717,131 Bitcoin, worth nearly $48 billion—making it the largest Bitcoin treasury among publicly traded companies. According to data from SaylorTracker, Strategy is down more than $6.5 billion on its purchases lifetime.

Saylor's ambitions for Strategy are even grander than adding major Bitcoin reserves to the company's balance sheet. In October 2024, he outlined his vision for Strategy to evolve into a “Bitcoin bank” with a trillion-dollar valuation, creating capital market instruments tied to Bitcoin that can be offered to investors.

In addition to adding to its own holdings, Saylor has pitched Strategy's Bitcoin playbook to other major publicly traded companies. In December 2024, he told the Microsoft board they could stand to create $5 trillion in value by adopting Bitcoin. They voted against adding it to their balance sheet.

Core Scientific operates in one of crypto's most capital-intensive segments, where energy costs and production efficiency shape long-term returns. Paloma's latest filing highlights how institutional investors are positioning around those mining fundamentals.

According to an SEC filing dated February 17, 2026, Paloma Partners Management Co reduced its holdings in Core Scientific by 2,547,000 shares. The estimated transaction value, based on the average closing price for the fourth quarter of 2025, was $44.41 million. The fund's position value fell by $46.32 million over the quarter, reflecting both trading activity and share price movement. Paloma Partners now holds 185,000 shares, valued at $2.69 million at year-end.

Following the sale, Core Scientific now accounts for 0.49% of Paloma Partners Management Co's reportable U.S. equity assets.

Top five holdings after the filing:

As of February 17, 2026, Core Scientific shares were priced at $17.23, up 39.1% over the past year. The stock outperformed the S&P 500 by 25.81 percentage points over the same period.

Core Scientific is a leading provider of digital asset mining and blockchain infrastructure services in North America, leveraging proprietary software and large-scale datacenter operations. The company's integrated approach combines self-mining with colocation hosting, enabling flexibility and operational scale. With a focus on advanced infrastructure and security, Core Scientific is positioned as a key enabler for institutional adoption of blockchain technologies.

Core Scientific provides digital asset mining, blockchain infrastructure, and colocation hosting services, with revenue streams from mining for its own account and equipment hosting for third parties.

The company operates a dual-segment model: direct mining of digital assets and offering large-scale datacenter colocation and equipment sales for blockchain participants.

Core Scientific's primary customers include institutional miners, blockchain enterprises, and organizations seeking secure, scalable infrastructure for distributed ledger technology.

Core Scientific sits at the intersection of Bitcoin price volatility and the high fixed costs of operating large-scale mining datacenters. After rising roughly 39% over the past year, the stock reflects improving crypto sentiment, but its underlying economics remain tied to production efficiency and power costs. 

Core Scientific generates revenue in two primary ways: mining Bitcoin for its own account and hosting equipment for institutional customers. The first depends not only on Bitcoin prices but also on mining difficulty and fleet efficiency, which determine how much Bitcoin can be produced per unit of energy. The second depends more on datacenter capacity, energy costs, and long-term hosting relationships. This mix provides upside potential when digital asset markets improve but also exposes the company to operational risk if prices or mining economics decline.

For investors, the key factors to look out for are Core's Bitcoin production efficiency, power cost management, and the stability of its hosting business. Metrics such as Bitcoin output per megawatt, cost per coin, energy contracts, and debt flexibility will determine whether the recent rally signals stronger fundamentals or is merely a favorable phase in the crypto cycle.

The Supreme Court on Friday struck down Trump's global tariffs, ruling 6-3 that he exceeded his emergency powers.

The Supreme Court of the United States on Friday struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariff regime, ruling 6-3 that he exceeded his authority by imposing broad import duties under a national emergency law.

The decision invalidates tariffs Trump levied in early 2025 under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a statute enacted in 1977 and historically used to sanction foreign adversaries during crises. Trump cited persistent trade deficits and national security concerns, including fentanyl trafficking, to justify duties ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from nearly every major trading partner.

Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said the Constitution leaves little ambiguity about who controls the taxing power.

“The Framers did not vest any part of the taxing power in the Executive Branch,” Roberts wrote, adding that no previous president had used the statute to impose tariffs “of this magnitude and scope.”

The ruling marks the first major test of Trump's second-term economic agenda before the high court, which includes three justices he appointed during his first term. Lower courts had already found that the administration overstepped, emphasizing that Article I of the Constitution assigns tariff authority to Congress.

President Trump said he has a backup plan to pursue tariffs following the court ruling, according to various sources.

In financial markets, the reaction was swift and unsettled. Bitcoin rose about 2% within minutes of the decision, briefly climbing above $68,000 before retreating toward $67,500. The move reflected a familiar pattern in digital asset markets, where headline-driven rallies have struggled to hold.

The mixed response underscored the ambiguity surrounding the ruling's economic impact. For some investors, the invalidation of tariffs removes a source of policy uncertainty that has weighed on global trade. 

For others, it introduces new questions about fiscal gaps, refund obligations and next steps from the White House.

Reuters has reported that more than $133 billion in tariff revenue collected under the emergency authority could be subject to refunds. Trump has said his broader tariff program generated roughly $600 billion, though that figure has been disputed. If significant sums must be repaid, Treasury financing needs could shift at a delicate moment for bond markets.

Earlier Friday, economic data painted a complicated picture. The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 1.4% annualized rate in the final quarter of 2025. 

Core personal consumption expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 3% year over year, above expectations. 

Annual growth for 2025 slowed to 2.2%, the weakest pace since 2020.

Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, described the data as sending a “messy message” of firmer inflation alongside cooling growth, according to CoinDesk. That backdrop has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will proceed with caution on rate cuts.

For Bitcoin traders, the tariff case has been less about trade flows than about liquidity and risk appetite. During prior episodes of trade escalation, digital assets tended to move in tandem with equities as investors reassessed growth and inflation risks. 

A court decision that removes tariffs could ease cost pressures over time, yet the near-term effect hinges on how Washington fills any fiscal hole.

Stephen Coltman, head of macro at 21Shares, said before the ruling that a negative outcome for the administration could pressure the dollar and Treasuries while favoring stocks and bitcoin. 

Others, including VanEck's Matthew Sigel, have argued that reduced tariff revenue could widen deficits, increasing the appeal of assets like bitcoin viewed as hedges against currency debasement.

Online prediction markets had assigned high odds to the court striking down the tariffs, suggesting traders were prepared for the headline. 

For now, the court's decision narrows presidential authority over tariffs and returns leverage to Congress. Whether lawmakers move to codify elements of Trump's trade agenda or chart a different course remains unclear.

The price on any asset always comes down to something simple: its supply and demand. But for something unique like Ethereum (ETH), which is designed to be a decentralized utility, you have to look beyond the simple charts to see what's really generating that demand and moving the Ethereum price. 

Of course, the general state of the economy and market sentiment matter, but typically, the price of ETH moves largely due to the actual work occurring on its blockchain. Real-world adoption, usage, and general utility, all tracked by on-chain data, affect the ebb and flow of ETH, showing it's not just a coin to trade but the essential fuel needed for a growing and decentralized digital world.

How to Measure Real Demand

A good way to check the health and usefulness of the Ethereum network is by looking at its daily transaction volume. Every single action that's taken, whether it's a simple transfer, a complicated interaction in decentralized finance (DeFi), or creating a new non-fungible token (NFT), requires a small amount of ETH to pay for the computing power, which is generally referred to as the “gas fees.”

Daily on-chain transactions are a direct measure of how much the network is being used. High transaction volumes mean a lot of people are actively taking advantage of what the network can do. Greater usage indicates stronger utility and oftentimes, demand for the network, which naturally makes ETH more valuable and useful. This increase in activity often pushes the ETH price higher, highlighting a link between network activity and market value.

How Many People Are Using It?

The number of unique active addresses is a good way to tell how widely the network is being used, not just how many transactions are happening. The count of different addresses making transactions on any given day reflects the engagement from individual people, large organizations, and the many smart contracts that power the decentralized web. 

“Ethereum is entering one of its most powerful phases yet, combining deep institutional interest with unprecedented levels of on-chain activity,” an article states. When the number of active addresses keeps going up, it's a strong sign of genuine network adoption. It means that more participants are entering the Ethereum world for whatever reason, be that to buy ETH to hold, use applications, mint NFTs, or build their own smart contracts. Since everyone needs ETH to pay for their activity, this growth can raise the ETH price because, as demand for the network's native currency increases, it becomes harder to distinguish organic growth from price movements driven by short-term speculation.

The Power of Smart Contracts

Probably Ethereum's greatest innovation is its ability to run self-executing programs called smart contracts, which you might think of as the engine for decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum's long-term value depends on how quickly new smart contracts are created and used, as well as how often people use the ones already there. 

Smart contracts are the building blocks for everything, from NFT marketplaces and DeFi platforms to tokenized asset projects. The rising number of new contracts and high interaction volume highlight Ethereum's usefulness as the world's leading smart contract platform. As its usefulness grows, so does demand for ETH, the asset needed to run and maintain these apps. This, in turn, drives up the price of ETH. 

DeFi and NFT Activity

Ethereum plays a significant role in the DeFi and NFT space. These activities greatly influence its price movement. Smart contracts create a constant need for ETH, both for collateral and transaction fees. The minting, trading, and selling of new NFTs also require ETH for each fee.

As DeFi protocols grow and NFT trading volumes rise, the demand for ETH goes up. This can lead to rapid increases in demand and long-term pressure on ETH's price. For market observers, monitoring DeFi usage and NFT transaction volumes can provide valuable insights into real-time market demand.

Building a Better Crystal Ball

Network activity metrics serve an important purpose. They show that the market is interested and that people are actually using them. This data can help make predictions more accurate. Price jumps in ETH that last only a short time often occur right before or at the same time as sudden increases in parts of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as daily transactions or smart contract usage. This connection shows that investors are becoming more confident and want to see the network in action while contributing value to it.

By looking at the bigger picture, the transaction volume, active addresses, smart contract deployment, and NFT trading all at the same time, analysts can get a clearer picture inside the crystal ball that is the greater Ethereum world. They can also better distinguish between price movements driven by speculation and those based on solid, real-world network adoption. This kind of data-driven approach is vitally important for investors looking to predict trends, analysts measuring the network's utility, and traders seeking short-term signals. Taken together, it confirms the foundational idea that network activity is the main determinant of Ethereum's market value.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","FedEx: Utilising Blockchain to Secure Global Supply Chains","https://cybermagazine.com/news/fedex-hedera-building-trust-layer-for-commerce","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 13:09:35 GMT","

Global logistics has long operated on a fundamental principle: efficiency drives profitability.

However, as 2026 progresses, the industry is grappling with a more complex challenge. Trust has become the critical asset, with secure data infrastructure serving as its foundation.

FedEx has announced it is joining the Hedera Governing Council, a move that could signal a shift beyond conventional corporate partnerships or tentative blockchain experiments.

The company's council membership positions it within a governance framework intended to advance trust, security and innovation through the Hedera network.

Through this involvement, FedEx intends to contribute to digital infrastructure development capable of supporting end-to-end global shipment lifecycles, with potential implications for supply chain security across the sector.

Vishal Talwar, EVP, Chief Digital and Information Officer of FedEx and President of FedEx Dataworks, says: “The digital transformation of global supply chains is inevitable. As supply chains become increasingly digital-native, trusted data must be shared and verified across many parties without increasing risk or centralising control.

“Hedera provides a neutral, enterprise-grade trust layer that enables verification at global scale, while allowing organisations like FedEx to continue building differentiated capabilities on top.”

The announcement arrives amid what analysts describe as the 'Great Rebuild', a fundamental restructuring of established logistics frameworks that have demonstrated critical vulnerabilities under geopolitical pressures and legacy system constraints.

Throughout the sector, organisations are accelerating adoption of AI and secure data sharing standards – initiatives that require verifiable, high-quality data rather than fragmented, paper-based records susceptible to tampering and fraud.

Reuters reported in 2026 that 40% of trade professionals are now actively exploring or implementing blockchain and AI technologies, representing a significant jump from just 6% in 2024. However, the security and effectiveness of AI agents could be undermined if underlying data remains trapped within isolated, unverifiable paper-based systems.

Hedera's Governing Council functions through a model involving up to 39 global organisations – including Google, IBM, Dell Technologies and LG Electronics – with each maintaining equal voting authority.

Rather than depending on probabilistic consensus mechanisms, Hedera's hashgraph consensus – alongside its governance and trademark policies – is engineered to prevent contentious network forks and deliver rapid transaction finality.

Council members typically operate a mainnet node; upon joining, FedEx would be expected to deploy the same infrastructure and participate directly in software governance and roadmap decisions affecting digital trade security.

Tom Sylvester, President of Hedera Council, says: “We are proud to welcome FedEx to the Council. FedEx brings deep operational insight into global logistics and commerce and their perspective will be valuable as the industry transitions toward digitally native supply chains.

“We look forward to working together to advance trusted, interoperable data verification that supports collaboration across industries and jurisdictions.”

Through Hedera, FedEx aims to enable continuous compliance verification, where shipping events and documentation can be cryptographically validated and immutably recorded.

While clearance outcomes and processing times ultimately depend on regulatory authorities and risk assessments, such infrastructure could potentially help streamline customs processes in jurisdictions that recognise and integrate these verifiable data exchanges.

A distributed trust layer can also allow intermediaries – banks, insurers and brokers – to access a common, cryptographically-verified view of relevant events without requiring organisations to expose proprietary operational data, potentially improving coordination while reducing reconciliation burdens and attack surfaces.

Supply chain leaders are reassessing their security strategies in response to evolving trade policies and regulatory frameworks.

In a threat landscape where organisations remain cautious about hosting sensitive data on competitor-controlled networks, Hedera's architecture could provide neutral, decentralised infrastructure with enhanced security guarantees.

As the sector moves beyond paper-based verification systems vulnerable to fraud and manipulation, FedEx's strategic positioning suggests an engagement with emerging frameworks for secure global commercial trust.

Ethereum (ETH) is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies today. Most people familiar with the crypto world know its name. Unlike Bitcoin, which is often seen as a store of value, Ethereum primarily acts as a platform for supporting DeFi and NFT systems. These systems come in different shapes and sizes, but many play a role in influencing the Ethereum price. This is because transactions, collateral, and smart contracts on the network require ETH.

By establishing a basic understanding of the relationship between DeFi/NFT adoption and Ethereum price, prospective users can approach decentralized markets with the knowledge needed to recognize how and why real network utility affects short-term price movements and long-term valuation.

Defining Terms: DeFi and NFTs

As a brief reminder, DeFi, short for decentralized finance, pertains to a financial system that operates via blockchain technology. An article notes that, unlike traditional finance, “DeFi is entirely decentralized. This means that it is not controlled by a central entity or government. Instead, it relies on open protocols and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.” 

Because DeFi applications are not tied to any one entity, they can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, by anyone, all without needing a standard bank account. Additionally, by using blockchain technology, DeFi programs are able to offer complete transparency and substantial security.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meanwhile, are assets like digital content, videos, or artworks that have been tokenized by way of a blockchain. These tokens can be traded and exchanged on platforms in networks like Ethereum for money, cryptocurrencies, or even other NFTs. Not every exchange platform accepts NFTs, but some DeFi applications do. This opens up new opportunities for financial transactions and investments on the Ethereum blockchain.

The Role of Ethereum Price in DeFi Protocols

ETH, the native token of Ethereum, is often used as collateral in decentralized lending, borrowing, and yield protocols. In these cases, this means that the value of your collateral goes up or down with the price of Ethereum. It is important to note that more DeFi activity often makes it harder to get liquid ETH. This puts upward pressure on the price of Ethereum because of demand.

Different DeFi protocols always react to these changes in different ways. For instance, decentralized exchange protocols like Uniswap let people trade ETH and ERC-20 tokens, while protocols like DAI make decentralized stablecoins that are worth the same as the US dollar. The protocol that interacts more directly with ETH will probably have a stronger connection to changes in price than protocols that are less connected to ETH.

Important Shifts in NFT Market Activity

With NFTs gradually gaining recurring popularity, possibly thanks to the increasing number of DeFi protocols and platforms on Ethereum, their value in relation to changes in ETH pricing has become more notable over time. This development is largely due to the fact that NFT minting, trading, and royalty-sharing are primarily executed in ETH. As a result, a surge in NFT adoption can coincide with short-term spikes in Ethereum price due to higher transactional demand.

As it so happens, these short-term spikes also provide traders with useful information that can be used to inform short-term price indicators. By monitoring NFT and DeFi market cycles, traders can sometimes gauge how current trends line up with past ones, thereby providing them with some means of predicting price changes for the near future.

How Real-World Utility Signals Adoption

Much of the trading done on crypto markets is speculative since cryptocurrencies (outside of stablecoins) may have little inherent value. This speculation plays a significant role in crypto's notorious volatility, necessitating stabilizing forces like real-world utility.

DeFi and NFT usage are good indicators of demand and future adoption because they show how useful the Ethereum network really is. So, when the ecosystem grows quickly, it usually means that people will want ETH for a long time. This keeps the price of Ethereum stable and helps it grow.

This idea is further supported by the fact that activity in DeFi and NFT markets typically indicates increased confidence in Ethereum's capabilities and long-term relevance. As a result, people who trade Ethereum may see more use as a good sign for its price. However, it is important to remember that these signals do not always mean growth or positive change, since there are so many factors that affect crypto prices at any given time.

What DeFi and NFT Usage Could Mean for Ethereum

Ethereum remains popular largely because it does so much more than provide a novel means of storing wealth. Through the network's growing number of DeFi protocols and NFT markets, users can participate in a variety of financial transactions without dealing with central figures like banks.

With ETH playing an instrumental role in supporting all of these functions on the Ethereum network, its price and the ways it fluctuates are worth noting and planning for in order to make transactions as favorable as possible. As a general rule, the more people use applications on crypto networks, the more valuable those networks tend to be for short- and long-term valuations alike.

France's gambling watchdog is now taking applications from companies that want to offer games with resellable digital content, moving a big legal experiment from law to everyday supervision.

The Autorité nationale des jeux (ANJ) said operators must now submit a prior declaration before making a JONUM game available in France. The JONUM category was created by the SREN law in May 2024 and is running as a three-year trial.

ANJ says declarations must be filed through an online process. Once a submission is complete, the regulator will issue a receipt.

However, ANJ has stressed that the receipt is not a stamp of approval on every detail of an offer. Instead, it confirms the filing has been made and allows the regulator to monitor the game as the experiment progresses.

ANJ also plans to publish a public list of declared JONUM offers, making it easier to see which companies are willing to operate under the new rules.

A JONUM title is an online game that combines a paid stake, an element of chance, and the award of monetisable digital objects that can later be resold, such as NFT-style items or blockchain-linked tokens.

The regime is designed to keep a clear separation from licensed gambling products. JONUM games can involve digital items that may hold value on resale, but they are not meant to operate like cash-prize gambling. The rules also keep minors out of these games.

With the process now live, ANJ has also begun direct engagement with the sector. The regulator held an exchange session for interested Web3 companies on 19 February, giving studios and publishers a first official chance to test their understanding of the requirements and what the regulator expects in a declaration.

Ethereum's value, or Ethereum price as can be seen on crypto exchanges like Binance, is influenced by network fundamentals, supply and demand, technological adoption, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, and macroeconomic factors. Its value is also changing as it migrates to Ethereum 2.0, undergoes network upgrades, and as more institutions express interest in it. 

Supply, Staking, and Ethereum 2.0

With Ethereum 2.0, called the Merge, Ethereum changed from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. This added staking, which effectively locks coins out of circulation, reduces the coin supply, and supports Ethereum's price. EIP-1559 and other network upgrades introduced fee-burning mechanisms that gradually reduce Ethereum's circulating supply, supporting long-term price appreciation.  

The Ethereum network now works differently, with a proof-of-stake mechanism in place. Following the Merge, validators are required to stake their ETH rather than rely on energy-intensive mining, which improved network performance and reduced the rate at which new tokens are released. Staking rewards motivate network participants to lock up their ETH, decreasing the circulating supply. This can create what some analysts refer to as a “supply shock,” which may support price stability or appreciation when demand remains steady or increases.

Demand from DeFi, NFTs, and Business Acceptance

Most DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces are built on Ethereum. When more people use them, it increases network demand, which can affect the price of Ethereum. As more institutional capital, treasury allocations, and ETFs begin to adopt ETH, it can exert upward pressure on the price over time, particularly as it becomes part of a broader range of investment portfolios.

The Ethereum DeFi ecosystem has grown significantly. Lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and yield-generating platforms all require ETH for transaction fees and collateral. This demand stems from actual use and economic activity, not speculation. NFT marketplaces also rely on Ethereum's infrastructure. Previously, when interest in digital collectibles was higher, the demand for ETH also rose.

Institutional participation has shifted from passive observation to active involvement. The introduction of Ethereum ETFs and the incorporation of ETH into corporate treasury strategies indicate a wider acceptance beyond retail investors. These institutional inflows may help stabilize prices over longer periods of time.

Metrics of Usage and Network Activity

Metrics such as the number of daily transactions, active addresses, and smart contract deployments indicate a network's usefulness and popularity. More activity on the network usually means a higher Ethereum price.

The amount of ETH staked or locked in DeFi also limits the amount available for trading, thereby indirectly affecting the price of Ethereum. Experts have said that “network usage and smart contract activity are key drivers for Ethereum's valuation, reflecting real demand beyond speculation.” 

Crypto Culture

There are many similarities between the crypto market and the stock market, which is best observed on Wall Street. When they first emerged, both were met with skepticism and disapproval from mainstream audiences. Over time, they became well known and part of popular culture. Both markets offer investment opportunities that involve varying levels of risk, but they attract investors with different financial goals. Most importantly, both the crypto and stock markets have built up very dedicated groups of participants and observers.

For a long time, Wall Street has been home to a community of people who make a living by buying and selling stocks. Today, there is a similar group of people around cryptocurrency, who are often referred to as “crypto bros.” Like Wall Street brokers, crypto bros spend their time watching the value of their investments change on crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken among others, and making financial decisions based on market movements. The main difference is that the entire cryptocurrency market is online, so there is no need for a physical central hub like Wall Street. Also, the value of cryptocurrencies changes much more quickly, so people need to respond more quickly.

However, one of the real problems with this kind of quick community of investors is that hype can sometimes obscure the truth about an investment. This was also true of Wall Street, and it still happens from time to time. But in the crypto age, when the digital world of crypto and the internet amplify all opinions, good or bad, these problems have become much worse. To be successful in the long term, you need to be able to tell the difference between real utility and hype in the crypto markets. Investors and readers can cut through the noise by using data and expert analysis to understand the basics.

Macro-Financial Conditions and Investor Sentiment

Like other cryptocurrencies, the value of Ethereum is influenced by global economic factors such as interest rates, inflation, and investors' willingness to take risks. The price of Ethereum also fluctuates in the short term due to factors like investor sentiment, media coverage, and new advancements in blockchain usage.

Central banks' policies and decisions about interest rates affect Ethereum by changing how much money is available in the market and how much risk people are willing to take. As Ethereum has become more popular, it has begun to behave more like traditional risk assets during market stress. Changes in regulations also affect investor confidence. For example, news about cryptocurrency regulation can cause big price changes as markets try to figure out what it means for institutional adoption.

The Future of the Ethereum Price and Network

One of the best things about crypto is that its financial system is always changing. Digital currency has gone from being ignored by many finance experts to being a big part of the world economy in just a few years. Ethereum has quickly risen to the top of the list of popular tokens. When people want to buy cryptocurrencies, it is more helpful to know how much Ethereum is worth in their own money than to look at global benchmarks. Traders and investors can better figure out how much risk, return, and market timing they can handle by keeping an eye on the price of Ethereum.

In the last few years, cryptocurrency's place in culture has changed a lot. What started as something that a lot of people did not believe in has become an important part of finance today. You can see how widely accepted this is in the fact that cryptocurrency prices, such as Ethereum's, are highly volatile right now.

These major cryptocurrencies are now an important part of many different businesses, so their value is affected by an even wider range of things. This makes them even more important to monitor. For market traders, it remains difficult to distinguish between short-term price changes driven by sentiment and longer-term trends based on fundamental adoption. As Ethereum improves through network upgrades and more people start using it, the factors that affect its value will likely become more complex.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Exclusive: Crypto seizure expert weighs in on the latest Nancy Guthrie Bitcoin developments","https://www.hellomagazine.com/us/885004/exclusive-crypto-seizure-expert-weighs-in-on-the-latest-nancy-guthrie-bitcoin-developments/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 01:19:19 GMT","

The kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie – the mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie – is the latest in a string of crimes in which ransoms have reportedly been demanded in Bitcoin.

The 84-year-old was taken from her home in Tucson, Arizona, in the middle of the night on January 31. A ransom of US$6 million (£4.4 million) has been demanded by the kidnappers.

Now, renewed movement in the Bitcoin wallet linked to the case has intensified scrutiny – and raised a critical question: although Bitcoin is not inherently untraceable, can perpetrators ultimately profit without being identified?

Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency often described as anonymous and private. That perception has made it attractive to criminals who believe it offers a convenient way to receive, transfer and store funds beyond the reach of authorities. But experts say that belief is dangerously outdated.

""When a wallet like this moves, it is never just a transaction. It is a signal,"" says Bezalel Eithan Raviv, CEO of Lionsgate Network, a crypto-forensics and recovery firm.

""In some cases, it is operational, testing access, moving funds, trying to stay ahead. In others, it is noise, designed to confuse investigators and the public. But here is the reality we see every day. Criminals move. The blockchain remembers.""

According to Bezalel, every transaction creates a permanent data point. ""Every movement creates a new data point, a new lead, a new opportunity to follow the money. In many cases, movement happens because pressure is building.""

But one of the most persistent myths surrounding Bitcoin is that it is anonymous. ""There is a dangerous misconception that Bitcoin is anonymous. It is not,"" Bezalel says. ""Bitcoin is one of the most transparent financial systems ever created. Every transaction is recorded permanently. No one can edit a transaction after the fact.""

He argues that in high-profile cases especially, criminals may be underestimating the scrutiny that follows public exposure.

""In many cases, yes,"" he says, when asked whether offenders misjudge blockchain transparency. ""Criminals still believe Bitcoin gives them protection. In reality, it often does the opposite, especially in high-profile cases.

""The moment a case becomes public, the ecosystem activates. Exchanges monitor, analysts track, investigators collaborate.""

Unlike physical cash, cryptocurrency must eventually be converted into usable money. ""Crypto is digital value. You cannot directly consume it,"" Bezalel explains. ""To use it in the real world, criminals need someone willing to convert it into fiat currency, usually through a centralized exchange. That is where intervention becomes possible.""

When funds reach regulated services, he says, ""blockchain transparency becomes a bridge to real world identity."" Modern investigations combine blockchain analysis with traditional detective work.

""We map transaction patterns, identify clusters of wallets, track interactions across chains, and correlate activity with services such as exchanges and payment processors,"" Bezalel says. ""But the real breakthrough happens at the intersection of blockchain data and human behavior.""

Speed varies. ""Sometimes attribution happens quickly when funds reach a known entity. In other cases, it takes time. But one thing remains constant. The data does not disappear. The trail remains, waiting to be connected.""

As for whether renewed wallet activity signals investigative progress or misdirection, Bezalel says it can be both. ""Movement creates exposure. Exposure creates opportunity. And often, it is in these moments that mistakes are made and cases move forward.""

For victims and families watching closely, the distinction matters. While Bitcoin's association with extortion and ransomware has fuelled fear that funds simply vanish into the digital ether, specialists insist that narrative is incomplete.

""Crypto is traceable. And it is recoverable,"" Bezalel says. In a case as high profile and emotionally charged as the alleged kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, every transaction will now be examined not just as a payment attempt – but as a potential clue.","{'href': 'https://www.hellomagazine.com', 'title': 'HELLO!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Beginner's guide to paying with stablecoins using crypto cards","https://cryptobriefing.com/stablecoins-crypto-cards-guide/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 13:52:56 GMT","


                Crypto cards enhance the practicality of stablecoins, bridging digital assets with traditional banking, and simplifying everyday transactions.            

Share

Today, a lot of people are starting to keep part of their savings in stablecoins. But there's still a simple question many people have: how do you actually spend this crypto on everyday things like groceries, subscriptions, or travel?

That's where crypto cards come in. They let you spend stablecoins almost the same way you would use a USDT debit card. In this short guide, we'll show you how crypto cards work and how you can start using them yourself.

Stablecoins are a type of digital currency whose value is tied to a stable asset — typically the US dollar. Thanks to their relatively steady price, they're widely used both for saving funds and for everyday spending. Many users prefer stablecoins for money transfers and online payments, as transactions are generally faster, come with lower fees, and avoid the usual banking bureaucracy.

A crypto card is a payment card that's linked to your crypto wallet or platform account and allows you to spend stablecoins just as easily as regular money. When you pay in a store or online, your stablecoins are automatically converted into fiat currency (such as USD or EUR), so the merchant receives the payment in the usual way.

This means you can use your digital assets for everyday spending — including shopping, subscriptions, and travel — and even pay through Apple Pay or Google Pay if the card supports it. For the user, the process looks just like a normal bank card payment, while all the technical conversion happens in the background.

Today, crypto cards make it possible to spend stablecoins as easily as regular money — in online stores, everyday services, and even offline via Apple Pay or Google Pay. If you're just getting started, the process usually looks like this:

Choose a platform that offers a crypto card that supports stablecoins such as USDT or USDC. This can be an exchange or a payment service. Some platforms issue virtual-only cards — for example, Cryptomus, where the card can be connected to Apple Pay / Google Pay and used for everyday purchases.

Register and complete KYC verification.In most cases, you'll need to verify your identity, as required by payment networks.

Issue your card (usually virtual at first).After issuance, you receive the card details just like with a regular bank card.

Top up the card with stablecoins — typically USDT or USDC.Funds are transferred from your crypto wallet or platform balance.

Add the card to Apple Pay or Google Pay (if supported).This allows you to pay using your phone or smartwatch.

Make purchases just like with a traditional bank card.Your stablecoins are automatically converted into fiat, and the merchant receives payment in their local currency.

Manage the card through the app.You can usually view your balance and transaction history, receive notifications, and freeze or unfreeze the card when needed.

If you're just starting to use a crypto card and pay with stablecoins, it's best to move gradually and pay attention to the details. This will help you avoid unnecessary fees and common mistakes, especially in the beginning.

Start with a small amount. Make one or two small purchases first to understand how conversion works and what fees apply.

Be aware of fees in advance. Some platforms charge for loading the card, others for spending — both are normal, as long as you understand the structure.

Keep most of your funds in your wallet, not on the card. Treat the card like a spending account rather than long-term storage.

Enable notifications. Push alerts help you track every transaction and react quickly if something looks suspicious.

Use 2FA and freeze/unfreeze options where available. This is an easy way to increase account security.

Keep an eye on limits. Many cards have daily or monthly caps — it's normal, just be aware of them.

Crypto cards that support stablecoins make using digital assets far more practical and closer to traditional banking tools. You can store your money in a stable currency while spending it just like regular cash — online, offline, and while traveling.

                        Crypto cards enhance the practicality of stablecoins, bridging digital assets with traditional banking, and simplifying everyday transactions.

Today, a lot of people are starting to keep part of their savings in stablecoins. But there's still a simple question many people have: how do you actually spend this crypto on everyday things like groceries, subscriptions, or travel?

That's where crypto cards come in. They let you spend stablecoins almost the same way you would use a USDT debit card. In this short guide, we'll show you how crypto cards work and how you can start using them yourself.

Stablecoins are a type of digital currency whose value is tied to a stable asset — typically the US dollar. Thanks to their relatively steady price, they're widely used both for saving funds and for everyday spending. Many users prefer stablecoins for money transfers and online payments, as transactions are generally faster, come with lower fees, and avoid the usual banking bureaucracy.

A crypto card is a payment card that's linked to your crypto wallet or platform account and allows you to spend stablecoins just as easily as regular money. When you pay in a store or online, your stablecoins are automatically converted into fiat currency (such as USD or EUR), so the merchant receives the payment in the usual way.

This means you can use your digital assets for everyday spending — including shopping, subscriptions, and travel — and even pay through Apple Pay or Google Pay if the card supports it. For the user, the process looks just like a normal bank card payment, while all the technical conversion happens in the background.

Today, crypto cards make it possible to spend stablecoins as easily as regular money — in online stores, everyday services, and even offline via Apple Pay or Google Pay. If you're just getting started, the process usually looks like this:

Choose a platform that offers a crypto card that supports stablecoins such as USDT or USDC. This can be an exchange or a payment service. Some platforms issue virtual-only cards — for example, Cryptomus, where the card can be connected to Apple Pay / Google Pay and used for everyday purchases.

Register and complete KYC verification.In most cases, you'll need to verify your identity, as required by payment networks.

Issue your card (usually virtual at first).After issuance, you receive the card details just like with a regular bank card.

Top up the card with stablecoins — typically USDT or USDC.Funds are transferred from your crypto wallet or platform balance.

Add the card to Apple Pay or Google Pay (if supported).This allows you to pay using your phone or smartwatch.

Make purchases just like with a traditional bank card.Your stablecoins are automatically converted into fiat, and the merchant receives payment in their local currency.

Manage the card through the app.You can usually view your balance and transaction history, receive notifications, and freeze or unfreeze the card when needed.

If you're just starting to use a crypto card and pay with stablecoins, it's best to move gradually and pay attention to the details. This will help you avoid unnecessary fees and common mistakes, especially in the beginning.

Start with a small amount. Make one or two small purchases first to understand how conversion works and what fees apply.

Be aware of fees in advance. Some platforms charge for loading the card, others for spending — both are normal, as long as you understand the structure.

Keep most of your funds in your wallet, not on the card. Treat the card like a spending account rather than long-term storage.

Enable notifications. Push alerts help you track every transaction and react quickly if something looks suspicious.

Use 2FA and freeze/unfreeze options where available. This is an easy way to increase account security.

Keep an eye on limits. Many cards have daily or monthly caps — it's normal, just be aware of them.

Crypto cards that support stablecoins make using digital assets far more practical and closer to traditional banking tools. You can store your money in a stable currency while spending it just like regular cash — online, offline, and while traveling. 

At the same time, each provider has its own terms, fees, and features, so it's important to understand how the card works and what role it plays in your everyday finances. When used thoughtfully, a crypto card can become a convenient and reliable way to manage everyday payments in a world where cryptocurrency is gradually becoming part of everyday life.

As the digital asset ecosystem continues to mature, large financial players are increasingly shaping market dynamics through specialised trading approaches. Many organisations entering this space begin by exploring services such as crypto otc trading, which are designed to support large-scale transactions with efficiency, discretion, and reliability. This shift marks a clear distinction between retail participation and the more structured world of institutional involvement.

At its core, institutional cryptocurrency trading refers to the buying and selling of digital assets by professional entities rather than individual investors. These entities include hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms, corporate treasuries, and even traditional financial institutions. Their participation brings higher volumes, advanced strategies, and stricter operational standards to the crypto markets.

Unlike retail traders, institutions operate with defined mandates, risk frameworks, and compliance requirements. Trades are often executed in large sizes and must align with broader portfolio strategies or business objectives. As a result, institutions require infrastructure that can handle complex execution needs, provide transparency, and integrate with existing financial systems.

One of the defining characteristics of institutional participation is its focus on reliable liquidity. Large orders must be executed without causing significant price disruption, which is not always possible on public order books. This need has driven the growth of alternative execution venues and professional trading services tailored to high-volume participants.

To address the limitations of traditional exchanges, many institutions rely on OTC markets. These over-the-counter venues allow buyers and sellers to negotiate trades directly, often with the support of a dedicated desk. By moving large transactions off public order books, institutions can avoid slippage, reduce market impact, and gain greater certainty around execution prices.

OTC trading is particularly useful during periods of volatility or when handling strategic reallocations. It also offers flexibility in terms of settlement timing and trade structuring, which is valuable for organisations coordinating trades with internal treasury or accounting processes.

Managing large digital asset positions requires more than execution capabilities. Secure storage and asset management are equally important. This is where custodial solutions play a critical role. Institutional-grade custody services are designed to safeguard assets through advanced security controls, access management, and operational oversight.

These solutions help institutions mitigate risks associated with private key exposure and internal misuse. By separating trading functions from asset storage, organisations can implement clearer governance structures and demonstrate accountability to regulators and stakeholders.

Institutions also differentiate themselves through the use of algorithmic strategies. Automated trading systems analyse market data in real time, execute orders based on predefined rules, and manage exposure across multiple venues simultaneously. This approach allows institutions to operate efficiently at scale while reducing reliance on manual intervention.

Algorithms are commonly used for tasks such as order slicing, price optimisation, and inventory management. When supported by robust infrastructure, these strategies can improve execution quality and consistency, even in fast-moving markets.

The growing presence of institutional traders has a stabilising effect on the crypto ecosystem. Higher volumes, professional risk management, and structured execution contribute to more orderly markets. This, in turn, attracts additional participants and supports the long-term development of digital assets as a legitimate asset class.

Platforms like WhiteBIT cater to this evolution by offering OTC trading services tailored to institutional needs. By combining personalised execution with secure settlement processes, such services enable professional participants to operate confidently in a complex and rapidly evolving market.

Institutional crypto trading represents a significant step in the maturation of digital asset markets. It brings discipline, scale, and professionalism to an industry once dominated by retail activity. As infrastructure continues to evolve, institutional participation is likely to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of crypto finance.

PALM BEACH, Fla. — Attending World Liberty Financial's forum at Mar-a-Lago felt less like a high-powered summit and more like an intimate gathering — if the guest list included people who control trillions in assets and the future of finance.

Tucked beneath chandeliers and gold-painted trim, the guest list read like a who's who of the industry's old guard and rising disruptors. There were no name tags needed. Everyone seemed to know everyone, or at least know someone who did.

Conversations floated from the future of finance to how it might fix what's been broken in the past — ambitious visions of tokenized assets, regulatory overhauls, and reimagined capital markets. But just as easily, the talk turned to the upcoming FIFA World Cup tournament and press-on nails, courtesy of a few unexpected names who probably had no business being there, and yet somehow made the whole thing feel even more surreal.

The event was not targeted toward an exclusively U.S. audience; attendees hailed from a number of countries. Several attendees flew from Consensus Hong Kong last week directly to Palm Beach to attend the World Liberty Forum. One attendee said they had flown in on Wednesday morning from ETHDenver, and several others said they would be flying to the Colorado conference following the forum.

In any other context, the event would seem to be a typical crypto conference; speakers from traditional financial backgrounds explaining how they're using blockchain or why they're discussing crypto to a dimly lit room. 

However, the backdrop loomed: This was a conference put on by World Liberty Financial, the crypto company launched and owned in part by the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, held at his golf club Mar-a-Lago, with several attendees tied to his business interests. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, in his first U.S. appearance since receiving a pardon from Trump, was spotted at the event. Goldman Sachs' David Solomon joked on stage that he was there because his client had requested his presence.

Many of the panels themselves were high-level; World Liberty Financial co-founder Alex Witkoff asked U.S. Senator Ashley Moody to walk the audience through her background, or Eric Trump and Donald Trump, Jr. reiterating their past grievances with the banks.

""It was forced and maybe opportunistic but we lived a life that opened our eyes to maybe how corrupt the system was … banks [canceled our accounts] for no reason other than my father was wearing a hat that said 'Make America Great Again,'"" Eric Trump claimed. ""We realized how antiquated finance was, how punitive finance was.""

Amid these sessions, some speakers walked through their arguments for the digital assets sector. Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson laid out the rationale for the U.S. dollar remaining the global reserve currency, saying the European Union was too uncoordinated for the euro to take the dollar's place and other currencies just didn't meet the moment.

""About 50% of trade today is done in dollars, another 30% is in the euros, [but] there's no single European debt market. They can't even coordinate around the euro … so that's not going to be the next reserve,"" she said.

China's renminbi and India's rupee are contenders, but neither is free-floating, and so that makes it unlikely either of those currencies can take on the role, she said.

""As long as people are still looking for their stablecoin to be backed by the most risk-free currency, it's going to be the dollar,"" she said.

Many of the panels nevertheless only had a passing focus on digital assets themselves. The audience reflected this, with crowds mingling outside the actual room to chat during several panels.

It wouldn't have been a Trump gathering without the biggest real estate moguls in the room — and that's when tokenization (putting assets on blockchain) became a topic. Hotel billionaire Barry Sternlicht, whose Starwood Capital manages over $125 million in assets under management, said the firm was ready to tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, but continues to be unable to do so given the regularity uncertainty.

Similarly, Kevin O'Leary told listeners that sovereign wealth funds, with whom he speaks regularly, won't touch crypto because they're afraid of the regulatory risk that comes with it in the U.S.

From O'Leary to Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to FIFA president Gianni Infantino, if the day's lineup were ranked by celebrity status, the organizers surely saved the best for last — and probably the least relevant.

Nicki Minaj closed out the event as the final panelist, but the first that caused half the room to take out their phones to snap a picture. Her presence may not make sense in the context of finance or crypto specifically — when moderator Alex Bruesewitz informed her that people gathered to talk about a new innovation in finance, she said she “can like it"" — but given her recently developed close relationship with President Donald Trump, it wasn't entirely surprising to see her support the family's event.

The World Liberty Forum wasn't just a conference, it was the kind of room where fortunes are steered, not pitched, and where the side chatter was just as telling as the main agenda.

Military budgets are growing, especially in larger economies. In 2024, global military spending totalled U$2.7 trillion1, a 9.4% increase in real terms over the previous year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a think tank specializing in conflict, peace and weapons. Just two countries, China and the United States, accounted for almost half of the total. 

At their two-day summit in June 2025, all but one of the 32 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries agreed to spend 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence and security by 2035, in response to “profound security threats and challenges” — chiefly perceived threats from Russia and from terrorism. If achieved, this would be an enormous escalation in spending. UK military expenditure of 5% of GDP would amount to half of what the country spends on its National Health Service2 (NHS). 

But nations have considerable leeway to decide what falls under this umbrella, which can include research and development (R&D) funding. Spain, for example, which opted out of the 5% target, has called for a broader view of defence spending, to encompass areas such as quantum computing.

What impact, if any, will defence-spending pledges have on research budgets? Some scholars who work on science funding, defence and peace, such as Lucy Suchman, a technology-focused sociologist at Lancaster University, UK, say that certain scientific fields could benefit (such as artificial intelligence) but others lose out (such as climate science) as funding priorities shift increasingly towards militarization. 

One study of 183 countries between 1989 and 2022 found that higher defence spending was associated with fewer trademark applications and fewer people working on R&D3. In many countries, increased government spending on defence exists alongside lowered spending on other research. In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, public R&D spending on health declined by 11.5% from 2020 to 2024, while spending on defence R&D rose by 17%4. Government spending in the OECD on ‘general advancement of knowledge' has also started to decline. 

Nature's careers team spoke to more than ten researchers working on science, peace and defence. They highlighted five interrelated themes that demonstrate changes to science — and to the careers researchers might expect to have — that could ensue in a more militarized world.

Evidence suggests that admitting more international graduate students leads to economic benefits, yet Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia are among those countries making it harder for international students to secure visas. China and the United States generate more influential research when they collaborate than when they do not, yet this collaboration is declining5. Overall, immigration controls, data-access restrictions and a focus on security are creating a more restricted environment for science.

On the basis of current trends, science is likely to become more constrained by ideas of national self-interest and scientific self-sufficiency, against a backdrop of increased military spending. “There's been a rise of nationalism, and scientific cooperation has been influenced by that,” says Caroline Wagner, a public-policy researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus. 

Nevia Vera, an international-relations researcher at the National University of the Center of Buenos Aires Province in Tandil, Argentina, dates this trend to 2018, when the United States launched its China Initiative to counter potential espionage in US laboratories and businesses. That year, China surpassed the United States as the largest source of peer-reviewed articles5, and publications authored jointly by Chinese and US authors started to decline from a peak of 16% of the total number from both countries. Sino–US co-authored papers in the main Web of Science databases dropped by more than 10% between 2018 and 2024, according to Li Tang, a science-policy researcher at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. 

But the collaborations haven't ended entirely, which echoes previous ups and downs in international research. In 1984, Bill Foster started working as a physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, Illinois. Even during the cold war, Foster says, there were Russian physicists working well alongside US ones — even though “you always knew that there was a KGB person”, he adds. “You could tell: he was the guy … who didn't really know the physics.”

Foster was elected to the US House of Representatives as a Democrat in 2013 and has co-sponsored a bipartisan bill in Congress that would allow some Russians working in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to gain permanent residence in the United States. He argues that this “will simultaneously kick the legs out from under Russian President Vladimir Putin's war effort — to lose some of the best and brightest” Russians — and “do something that will be of permanent value to the United States”.

The future of research collaborations involving Russia

The future of research collaborations involving Russia

Sylvia Schwaag Serger, an economic historian at Lund University in Sweden, thinks that it would take years, if not decades, to reverse the overall decline in international research collaborations. But she also speculates that international research career moves could lose some of their lustre in the longer term. “Whereas before, international experience often was generally considered positive,” she notices that in some countries, “researchers are reconsidering whether it's actually helping their career”, she says.

Although overall collaboration between scientists of different nations might decrease, some expect this to be more of a splintering effect, with researchers collaborating increasingly within regional blocs or geopolitical alliances. There is already growing collaboration in Europe, in Asia and among OECD countries, according to Schwaag Serger.

For instance, while their country's relationship with the United States has cooled in the past few years, Chinese researchers have increased their collaborations with colleagues in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

But overall, Tang emphasizes, “the decreasing collaboration between scientists in China and the US is not being compensated for by increased collaboration between China and other countries, such as India and Russia”. 

Most countries have limited scope to manoeuvre around the big military spenders (the biggest spenders among which are the United States, China, Russia, Germany and India1). Vera calls these countries' influence “the trends of great powers”. Although the geopolitical situation is more complex now than during the cold war, scientists in many nations could again feel pressed to align with one set of countries or another.

Also widening is the technology gap between countries. A report by United Nations secretary-general António Guterres details how the R&D benefits of military spending tend to pool in a few countries6, disadvantaging low-income nations where the military spends little on R&D. “Technology advances so quickly that countries cannot catch up” to scientific superpowers such as the United States, the European Union and China, Vera thinks. Some AI researchers have warned that this type of technological–military competition could spill over into conflict7.

Although the United States and China will remain interested in parts of Latin America and Africa for minerals crucial to technological transition and rearmament, Vera worries about these relationships being extractive rather than genuine partnerships. The United States has embraced a transactional approach to security assistance, for instance, by supporting peace and security efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in exchange for influence over mineral resources.

A judge has denied Tesla's request to overturn a $243 million jury verdict that held the automaker partially responsible for a fatal crash involving its Autopilot driver assistance system.

“The grounds for relief that Tesla relies upon are virtually the same as those Tesla put forth previously during the course of trial and in their briefings on summary judgment — arguments that were already considered and rejected,” Hon. Judge Beth Bloom's decision reads. “Furthermore, Tesla does not present additional arguments or controlling law that persuades this Court to alter its earlier decisions or the jury verdict.”

Last August, a jury awarded a $243 million verdict against Tesla over its culpability in a 2019 fatal crash in Florida that killed Naibel Benavides and critically injured Dillon Angulo. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame, and attributed one-third to Tesla. Notably, the jury assessed punitive damages only against Tesla.

Tesla's lawyers argued, in its request to reverse the ruling, that the blame rested on the driver, who helped cause the crash.

In the meantime, if you use bind as your authoritative nameserver, you can limit an hmac-secret to one TXT record, so each webserver that uses rfc2136 for certificate renewals is only capable of updating its specific record:  key ""bob.acme."" {
    algorithm hmac-sha512;
    secret ""blahblahblah"";
  };

While ""usernames"" are not generally protected to the same degree as credentials, they do matter and act as an important gate to even know about before a real attack can commence. This also provides the ability to associate random found credentials back to the sites you can now issue certificates for if they're using the same account. This is free scope expansion for any breach that occurs.I guarantee sites like Shodan will start indexing these IDs on all domains they look at to provide those reverse lookup services.

Of course, this has little applicability to anyone who is small enough not to have nation-state level actors in their threat model. But when I look behind the curtain of even Fortune 100 companies that really ought to have nation-state level actors in their threat model, too often you find people who are just not operating at that level or are swamped with unrelated work. So I'm starting to become of the opinion that guidance should change here and at the very least be documented recommendations - if it's not encouraged down the organizational size scale, too often it's not applied further up where it's needed.

(For example, an attacker with control of DNS could switch the A record to their server and use that to pass HTTP-01 or TLS-ALPN-01 validation, or update the _acme-challenge TXT record and use that to pass DNS-01.)

reply

Here, the record could for example contain a signature from the same key pair used to authenticate the account. The alternative is DNSSEC, but that's avoided by a lot of domains.

I'm looking forward to every admin UI out there being able to generate a string you can just paste into a DNS record to instantly get a Let's Encrypt cert.

Being able to distribute self-hostable software to users that can be deployed onto a VM and made operational literally within 5 minutes is a big selling point. Domain registration & DNS are a massive pain to deal with at the novice end of the spectrum. You can combine this with things like https://checkip.amazonaws.com to build properly turnkey solutions.

There are also a bunch of rate limit exemptions that automatically apply whenever you ""renew"" a cert: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/#non-ari-renewals. That means whenever you request a cert and there already is an issued certificate for the same set of identities.

reply

LE wouldn't see this as a legitimate reason to raise rate limits, and such a request takes weeks to handle anyway.Indeed, some rate limits don't apply for renewals but some still do.

I'm not disputing that there could be a world where you're correct, but, it's not this world, which is why I even made that comment. That doesn't make relying on the logs for this a brilliant idea, it's just an observation that in fact it could work.

While they do not have direct SLAs, they still have to comply with rules enforced by browser vendors, as they will remove you from CT checks and you'll be marked retired/untrusted (you can find some in the above list).This means a 99% uptime on a 90 day rolling average, a 1 minute update frequency for new entries (24 hours on an older RFC). No split views, strict append-only, sharding by year, etc.I think OP's original idea would work.

I think most users depend on automation that creates their accounts, so they never have to deal with it. But now, you need to propagate some credential to validate your account ownership to the ACME provider. I would have liked to see some conversation about that in this announcement.I'm not familiar with Let's Encrypt's authentication model. If they don't have token creation that can be limited by target domain, but I expect you'll need to create separate accounts for each of your target domains, or else anything with that secret can create a cert for any domain your account controls.

reply

Why? ACME accounts have credentials so that the ACME client can authenticate against the certificate issuer, and ACME providers require the placement of a DNS record or a .well-known HTTP endpoint to verify that the account is authorized to act upon the demands of whoever owns the domain.If either your ACME credentials leak out or, even worse, someone manages to place DNS records or hijack your .well-known endpoint, you got far bigger problems at hand than someone being able to mis-issue SSL certificates under your domain name.

reply

This is the previous models. In this case, DNS-Persist-01, the record is permanent and never changes. So to prove that your request is valid, they need to authenticate in some other manner. Otherwise, once you create that persistent record, anybody could request a cert for your domain.Edit: Spivak explains the flow differences better in their comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47065821

I suppose the same is true for DNS-01 but this would make it even easier because the attacker can just put up their LE account instead of mine into the DNS response and get a certificate.At this point why not just put my public cert into a DNS record and be done with it?

If someone can perform MITM attack between LetsEncrypt and a DNS server, we've got bigger problem than just certificate issuance.

They have a good reputation, lock down the domain technically at all levels, and have the connections and people/social skills to take care of any domain issues involving person-to-person contact.Which is not easy, I recall spending months like a decade ago on email/phone attempting (successfully) to get my personal domain out of expiry hell (made more complicated by wrong records).

DNSSEC prevents any modification of records, but isn't widely deployed.We query authoritative nameservers directly from at least four places, over a diverse set of network connections, from multiple parts of the world. This (called MPIC) makes interception more difficult.We are also working on DNS over secure transports to authoritative nameservers, for cases where DNSSEC isn't or won't be deployed.

I have a PowerDNS server running locally with a static IPv4 address via NAT and I have created a DNS domain and enabled dynamic DNS updates from certain IPv4 addresses with a pre-shared key.For each cert you need a DNS CNAME pointing to my DNS domain in a specific format.  Then we have to get to grips with software to do the deed.  acme.sh is superb for !Windows. simple-acme is fine for Windows.  I still setup each one by hand instead of ansible/Zenworks/whatever because I'm a sucker for punishment and still small enough for now.DNS-Persist-01 is not something I think I will ever need but clearly someone does.

Unfortunately with dns-persist-01 including account information in the DNS record itself, that's a bit of a show stopper for me. If/when account information changes, that means DNS records need changing and getting clients to update their DNS records (for any reason) has long been a pain.

reply

The only case that requires a DNS update is creating an entirely new account, and that's deliberate — the record binds a specific account to the domain so a stolen record can't be used by someone else.For your setup with CNAME delegation to a custom DNS server, this should actually be simpler than dns-01. You would point _validation-persist instead of _acme-challenge, and the target record is static. No per-issuance dynamic updates at all.

That should be TAI, right? Is that really correct or do they actually mean unix timestamps (those shift with leap seconds unlike TAI which is actually just the number of seconds that have passed since 1970001Z)?

You can read the RFC draft at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-acme-dns-pe...It says: CAs MUST properly parse and interpret the integer timestamp value as a UNIX timestamp (the number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z ignoring leap seconds) and apply the expiration correctly.

Basically when it was invented leap seconds seemed like a good idea because we assumed the inconvenience versus value was a good trade, but in practice we've discovered the value is negligible and the inconvenience more than we expected, so, bye bye leap seconds.The body responsible has formal treaty promises to make UTC track the Earth's spin and replacing those treaties is a huge pain, so, the ""hack"" proposed is to imagine into existence a leap minute or even a leap hour that could correct for the spin, and then in practice those will never be used either because it's even less convenient than a leap second - but by the time they're asked to set a date for these hypothetical changes likely the signatory countries won't exist and their successors can just sign a revised treaty, countries only tend to last a few hundred years, look at the poor US which is preparing 250th anniversary celebrations while also approaching civil war.

If humans cared the existing systems couldn't exist. For more than a century we've all lived with time ""zones"" which are thousands of seconds wide and we're not bothered by that. Many of us have civil time systems which shift twice per year by 3600 seconds for really no good reason, and while that's annoying it's barely worth a brief mention on TV news or in small talk. Leap seconds are 3600 times smaller and happen way less often, they're entirely negligible.They existed because we thought we cared, and we actually don't care, and we thought it was pretty easy to do, and it actually wasn't very easy after all.

unixtime is almost certainly what is meant by the standard, but it is not the count of UTC seconds since 1970; unix time is the number of seconds since 1970 as if all days had 86400 seconds. UTC, TAI, and GPS seconds are all the same length, and the same number have happened since 1970, but TAI appears 37 seconds ahead of UTC because TAI has days with 86400 seconds, while UTC has some days with 86401 seconds and was 10 seconds ahead of UTC in 1970. unixtime and UTC are in sync because unixtime allows some days to encompass 86401 UTC seconds while unixtime only counts 86400 seconds.

Why not using some public/private key auth where the dns contains a public key and the requesting server uses the private key to sign the cert request? This would decouple the authorization from the actual account. It would not reveal the account's identity. It could be used with multiple account (useful for a wildcard on the DNS plus several independent systems requesting certs for subdomains).

Prior to this accounts were nearly pointless as proof of control was checked every time so people (rightfully) just threw away the account key LE generated for them. Now if you use PERSIST you have to keep it around and deploy it to servers you want to be able to issue certs.

Here, certbot runs in Docker in the intranet, and on a VPS I have a custom-built nameserver to which all the _acme-challenge are redirected to via NS records.The system in the intranet starts certbot, makes it pass it the token-domain-pair from letsencrypt, it then sends those pairs to the nameserver which then attaches the token to a TXT record for that domain, so that the DNS reply can send this to letsencrypt when they request it.All that will be gone and I thank you for that! You add as much value to the internet as Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap.

Pasting a challenge string once and letting its continued presence prove continued ownership of a domain is a great step forward.  But I agree with others that there is absolutely no reason to expose account numbers; it should be a random ID associated with the account in Let's Encrypt's database.As a workaround, you should probably make a new account for each domain.

Years ago, I had a really fubar shell script for generating the DNS-01 records on my own (non-cloud) run authoritative nameserver. It ""worked,"" but its reliability was highly questionable.I like this DNS-PERSIST fixes that.But I don't understand why they chose to include the account as a plain-text string in the DNS record. Seems they could have just as easily used a randomly generated key that wouldn't mean anything to anyone outside Let's Encrypt, and without exposing my account to every privacy-invasive bot and hacker.

Isn't that pretty much what an accounturi is in the context of ACME? Who goes around manually creating Let's Encrypt accounts and re-using them on every server they manage?

If you're worried about correlating between domains, then yes just make multiple accounts.There is an email field in ACME account registration but we don't persist that since we dropped sending expiry emails.

1. It matches what the CAA accounturi field has2. Its consistent across an account, making it easier to set up new domains without needing to make any API calls3. It doesn't pin a users key, so they can rotate it without needing to update DNS records - which this method assumes is nontrivial, otherwise you'd use the classic DNS validation method

Sure, but is trusting your homebrewed CA on all your devices for essentially everything really a good idea?When your homebrewed CA somehow gets compromised, all your devices are effectively compromised and not only for local connections, but everything that uses PKIX.

The ACME account credentials are also accessible by the same renewal pipelines that has the DNS API credentials, so this does not provide any new isolation.~It's also not quite clear how to revoke this challenge, and how domain expiration deal with this. The DNS record contents should have been at least the HMAC of the account key, the FQDN, and something that will invalidate if the domain is transferred somewhere else. The leaf DNSSEC key would have been perfect, but DNSSEC key rotation is also quite broken, so it wouldn't play nice.~Is there a way to limit the challenge types with CAA records? You can limit it by an account number, and I believe that is the most tight control you have so far.---Edit: thanks to the replies to this comment, I learned that this would provide invalidation simply by removing the DNS record, and that the DNS records are checked at renewal time with a much shorter validation TTL.

And many providers don't.  (Even big ones that are supposedly competent like Cloudflare.)And basically everyone who uses granular API keys are storing a cleartext key, which is no better and possibly worse than storing a credential for an ACME account.

CAs can cache the record lookup for no longer than 10 days. After 10 days, they have to check it again. If the record is gone, which would be expected if the domain has expired or been transferred, then the authorization is no longer valid.(I would have preferred a much shorter limit, like 8 hours, but 10 days is a lot better than the current 398 day limit for the original ACME DNS validation method.)

To revoke the record, delete it from DNS. Let's Encrypt queries authoritative nameservers with caches capped at 1 minute.  Authorizations that have succeeded will soon be capped at 7 hours, though that's independent of this challenge.

reply

CAs were already doing something like this (CNAME to a dns server controlled by the CA), so there was interest from everyone involved to standardize and decide on what the rules should be.

Key condition keys for this purpose include:    route53:ChangeResourceRecordSetsActions: Limits actions to CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE.

    route53:ChangeResourceRecordSetsRecordValues: Limits actions based on the specific value of the DNS record.

Why account URI instead of a public key in the record? (micw, 9dev, csense)Three reasons:1. Key rotation without DNS changes. dns-persist-01 exists because DNS updates are expensive. Embedding a public key forces a DNS update on every key rotation — the exact problem this method solves. The account URI survives key rotation (RFC 8555 §7.3.5).2. CAA alignment. The accounturi parameter matches CAA record syntax (RFC 8657 §3). Domain owners use the same identifier in validation and policy records.3. Simplicity.

I think this is a good call. For the web, the CAB sets CA requirements and they could choose to require DNSSEC at a later date. It would be a breaking change, but the CAB can, and has, made breaking changes to the BR. The IETF draft seems flexible enough that we could end up with a DNSSEC MUST for the web, in practice, based on the CAB's discretion.

We then can just staple the Persist DNS key to the certificate itself.And then we just need to cut out the middleman and add a new IETF standard for browsers to directly validate the certificates, as long as they confirm the DNS response using DNSSEC.

The biggest problem is that DNS replies are often cached, so fixes for the mistakes can take a while to propagate. With Let's Encrypt you typically can fix stuff right away if something fails.

But let's not pretend that WebPKI is perfect. More than one large service failed at some point because of a forgotten TLS certificate renewal. And more than one service was pwned because a signing key leaked. Or a wildcard certificate turned out to be more wildcard than expected.I understand the failures of DNSSEC and DNS in general. And we need to do something about it because it's really showing signs of its age as we continue to pile on functionality onto it.I don't have an idea for a good solution for everything, but I just can't imagine us piling EVERYTHING onto WebPKI either.

You're commenting on a post about LetsEncrypt working with other entities in the industry to make improvements to WebPKI. It's safe to say that nobody's claiming it's perfect.But you can't go from ~""WebPKI isn't perfect"" and ~""DNSSEC/DANE exist"" and draw a magic path where using DNSSEC or DANE is actually a good thing for people to roll out. They'd need to be actually a good fit, and for DANE we have direct evidence that it isn't: a rollout was attempted and it was walked back due to multiple issues.

It's also more secure, compared to ACME. An on-path attacker can impersonate the site operator and get credentials. DNSSEC is immune to that.

If they can do that, they can just refuse to send the records at all (or mangle them such that they are ignored). DNSSEC makes the situation no worse.It does, however, increase Integrity.For the record, the 'A' in CIA refers to resilience against some party's purposeful attempt to make something unavailable. It does not stand for Areliability or Asimplicity.

CIA is about security. It's not about some kind of operational best practices.Supporting example: creating a system where someone failing to enter their password correctly one time locks them out for a day is problematic, because that system can be made unavailable by an attacker. This is not an Available system, and thus not as secure as one that has a more flexible lockout policy.Supporting example: creating a system where an application is only available from one IP address is problematic, because an attacker can take out one ISP and knock that IP address off the Internet. Making the system more Available by allowing users to access it from other IPs improves the overall security posture.

I think there are finely-tuned social algorithms that we innately follow. For example when meeting somebody we often perform the progressive self-disclosure algorithm in an attempt to find mutual talking points, so maybe yeah you say that you're into drinking IPAs or some other stereotypical thing, that's great.The reason such a protocol is highly effective is you want to establish somebody's feelings about you before disclosing a huge amount.

Not true. You have to engage in a way that signals very clearly you don't really give much of a shit about talking to her, and your social status is higher than hers.For example, if you're having a conversation with your bartender friend and you need a female perspective to settle a disagreement, and you ask for it without fully ""engaging"" with her, that'll work fine. Once she's been pulled in you will have to keep hooking her into the conversation with interesting tidbits, but eventually most women will just keep talking.

These means engaging in a level of provocative speech/behavior that sometimes makes people uncomfortable (not my problem of course; I have little interest in euphemism or politeness, my energy goes toward transparency and kindness)Progressive self-disclosure can have its uses but if I can't break the ice in two minutes with a stranger, it's not a good sign for our compatibility.Now, I did grow up in an environment where I was never really allowed to exist. I am an atheist raised by an hyper-abusive, hyper-religious, ex-boxer Catholic deacon in an extremely conservative part of the United States. The police were at my house every couple of weeks.

I can vouch that there are harsh urban environments which prevent, by design, even progressive disclosure from being a safe option. This effectively kills any chance at real unity in the community, and drives up crime statistics, further justifying the continued disunification tactics.It would be cool to catalog, categorize and analyze these kinds of social algorithms.

Doesn't mean you have to reveal every single interest, just have a little confidence towards the ones that do, whether or not you misread and how they land.

What the author is describing is called masking/social camouflage. It is usually a symptom of something deeper - be it low self-esteem, infant trauma, etc. I am not a mental health expert, but I do think that getting to the original cause and treating that will tend to give better results than concentrating on the symptoms.

Now, having gone to a pop punk concert and sharing some observation about the crowd or surprising opening act might be interesting. Noticing that a lot of induction puzzles are based on simple features like even/odd is less interesting but still might interest someone.Reading the room itself is generally considered interesting. If you go for a minute or two about the induction puzzles and your colleague/date/whoever shows no interest, you can turn mid-sentence and imputing ""so... no interest in induction puzzles, the last one you saw was in third grade and even then it wasn't your first choice."" It's just good conversation.It's like in writing. Show, don't tell.

that makes sense, since to be authentic, you need to be vulnerable.Maybe what the article means is not so much to bring up something deeply personal, but to show a unique part of yourself.I remember a guy came to work on my heating system and while he was wrapping up, somehow he told me he liked slot machines.  That led to a 15 minute discussion about them.
Next he told me his wife let him keep 6 of them in his living room and he showed me pictures.I think that was not revealing too much personal stuff, but an enthusiasm for something that added life to the conversation.So maybe carefully think of things you can reveal that make you who you are, without pulling back the curtain completely.

To consider an extreme obvious counter-example, think of a cross-cultural situation where social conventions vary widely and adjustment is needed, and then consider that we all hail from our own microcultures with their own customs and expectations.The real balance to achieve is being who we are in a way that doesn't alienate others. Fully accepting both self and other.

Honestly, I like it and agree that it makes a very good virtue.But at the same time, I don't think we have a good enough collective understanding of what it means for something to be interesting to use it this way. Complexity isn't noise or quantity. It's also not exactly measured by our emotional or cognitive response to something. It's kind of measured that way, but in a noisy and unreliable way if that makes sense?Anyways, go read Godel Escher Bach. Much more interesting than anything I've got to say on the matter.Also, chill out. It's not a competition.

More seriously though: the article is one person's opinion on what makes a boring person and their pet solution. It may work for them, but it won't work for everyone.It really boils down to the question: what is a boring person? The answer to that will be a subjective one. I would argue a boring people include those who are passionate about sports. A significant proportion of humanity will violently disagree with me. The minute that I open my mouth about my interests, they will migrate to someone who is talking about the latest game. It won't matter whether the interest comes naturally or is cultivated.I mostly disagree with the author's point about reading audiences. About the only point I do agree with is that we shouldn't let the audience define who we are. I will also concede that having a shallow knowledge of a topic, simply to fit in, will make for boring conversation. But a shallow knowledge to fit in isn't how I describe defining one's interests to fit in.

As an adult you learn that showing your true self can be dangerous in an environment where you don't know who can be trusted. We don't get the allowance of children to be weird or awkward. Others are gunning for us, and looking for any possible weakness. One wrong impression can drastically affect your life. So you curate yourself in a way that keeps your personality for those who can be trusted to accept and understand it, and others may see that as boring until they've been let in. It's just maturity; you have to earn the right to have me let my guard down around you.

I jest, but honestly, this article isn't that interesting. It seems to be a rehash of the entire individualizing 21c ethos of ""be authentic! Be yourself!"" (Just don't question why do all those authentic people all end up listening to punk music, drink IPAs, ride fixies and take photos on film cameras.) I find this view disturbingly narcissistic and, frankly, insulting to those of us who changed ourselves in the presence of others because we want to and like it. I would not be listening to country which I previously considered boring if I never dated a person who does. Am I a lesser person now because I have caved to social pressure or whatever?It is also rather amusing that the examples of ""polarizing"" figures are a cookbook author and one of the less remembered figures or new atheism. Try telling others you like Richard Dawkins (whose polarizing views are precisely why he is still a prominent public figure.) Try telling others you enjoy Kid Rock (who I consider, at best, a boring musician propped up purely by ideological reasons.)

I started a company, would learn programming(now I'm a pro programmer), I learned a few different arts (great for relating to a different set of people when you explain you draw, paint, sew, and crochet)...Whatever the case, I think there was economic benefits to 'not being boring'. However you really need to push yourself, its way easier to veg out on the couch to fiction. I think caffeine and weed helped me initially, now its just my normal lifestyle.

2. People often vacillate between conformity and contrarianism. This is what juvenile edgelords on the internet are about. Both conformists and contrarians are trapped inside the same silly paradigm. Both define themselves and behave not in terms of the truth, to which all intelligence and behavior must conform, but in relation to others and what they think. A conformist assumes a persona that agrees with others in their social setting, regardless of whether it is objectively good. A contrarian takes what agrees with others and negates it, regardless of whether it is objectively good. Both are mindless, reflexive, and boring. Both lack substance. Both are empty theater rooted in people-pleasing and approval-seeking. Both are dishonest, cowardly acts of deception.3. Reading a room isn't about people-pleasing. It's about empathy so that you can response in the way that is good and needed. If you enter a funeral parlor, you don't crack jokes or paint your toenails. You recognize there are people grieving there, that a dead person is being honored. In other words, you also consider, within reason, the good of others in the room, and you respond to the facts as they are, even when pursuing your own goals.4. One flaw in the ""I gotta be ME!"" schtick is that it idolizes the self. It makes a god of the self. It puts unmoored desires above the truth instead of rooting desires in the truth. There are plenty of desires that ought not to be indulged, at least not indulged in certain ways or at certain times. The point is that your behavior ought to occur within the scope of reason. What is evil and wrong is always outside of reason.5. Life can be messy. We can be messy. When that is the case, the goal isn't to keep messing it up or to run with our own mess toward the abyss. These messes, our mess, is a kind of cross we bear for the good. They're things we struggle with, not surrender to. If someone has a tendency to overeat, it might be difficult to resist, but it is good for him to practice fasting. If someone has a habit to reach for porn, it may be painful to resist, but it is good for him to resist and to avoid so that he can overcome the habit instead of wallowing in slavish submission to that awful vice. If someone has a tendency toward irascibility and wrath, it may feel satisfying to indulge it in the moment, but practicing meekness is the true reward. If someone has trouble with envy, tearing someone down may scratch that itch, but responding with selfless good will is freedom. Triumph over vice makes us interesting. Succumbing to its easiness makes us boring.

UK biomechanics professor Joanna Wakefield-Scurr is trying to design better bras by decoding the many mysteries of boobs.

Twenty years ago, Joanna Wakefield-Scurr was having persistent pain in her breasts. Her doctor couldn't diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she's still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.

Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn't much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr's lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.

Wearing a bra that's too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that's too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”

The lab's research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they're more willing to go for a run.

Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don't know whether it's more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts' motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?

Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she's tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She's working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares. 

As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows. Wakefield-Scurr says her lab can't keep up with demand. Their cups runneth over.

The post-apocalypse adds a new setting (the outside world!) and new intrigue (billionaires are always up to something) when Paradise, Hulu's dystopian thriller, returns. Season two brings back the show's flashes of melodrama and frequent pop culture references, emphasizing its complicated characters while also reminding the viewer that this is taking place in a version of our world that's gone very, very sideways.

Season one, which unfolded almost entirely in an underground city created to withstand a global environmental disaster, closed the case on its presidential assassination whodunit—but left plenty of bunker-bound intrigue in its wake.

The main timeline of season two picks up just a few weeks after season one, but once again Paradise—created by This Is Us' Dan Fogelman—relies on frequent flashbacks to bring fresh context and perspective to what we only think we know. A big reason Paradise is so entertaining is the way it constantly subverts expectations, springing surprise twists that in retrospect feel logical rather than random—and revealing over and over that first impressions aren't always what they seem.

It is very carefully plotted, with breadcrumbs of various significance sprinkled across the early episodes, then highlighted in the “previously on” segments that become essential parts of the Paradise viewing experience.

Paradise season two once again runs eight episodes, with the first three arriving together; it's a smart choice since each episode focuses on a different character and entry point into the drama. (io9 was provided with the first seven episodes for the purposes of this spoiler-free review.)

We don't have to wait very long to see how Secret Service agent Xavier Collins (Sterling K. Brown, who brings plenty of gravitas but also looks convincingly like a guy who could kill you with his hands) fared after escaping the bunker. In the course of discovering who killed President Cal Bradford (James Marsden), Xavier uncovered hidden truths about the bunker and its most powerful resident, billionaire Samantha “Sinatra” Redmond (Julianne Nicholson). He also found out his presumed-dead wife, Teri (Enuka Okuma), had survived the disaster and was still somewhere near Atlanta, her last known location—which is exactly where Xavier points the small plane he appropriates from the bunker's stash.

All three of those storylines—Xavier's journey to find Teri, Sinatra's desire to conceal just how deep her well of secrets goes, and Teri's survival struggles after what Paradise calls “the Day”—propel season two. After barely getting any time with Teri in season one, we finally get a chance to see why Xavier thinks she hung the moon, and the show is better for it.

Season two also digs into the turmoil left behind in Liberty Grove, the underground community that even Paradise itself has started calling “Paradise.” After season one's upheavals, the facade of normalcy is poised to crumble anew with every new confrontation.

This includes the tension between Sinatra, recovering from a bullet wound sustained in the season one finale, and her former confidante, Dr. Gabriela Torabi (Sarah Shahi). There's also the increasing distrust that Agent Nicole Robinson (Krys Marshall) feels about Agent Jane Driscoll (Nicole Brydon Bloom), who viewers well know is a vicious killer only pretending to be, as Robinson once pegged her, “Holly Hobbie with a gun.”

As Paradise switches between these separate—yet interlinked, all part of the show's precise design—plotlines, it also makes room for brand-new characters. While fans might be eager to see what happened to Xavier and Sinatra immediately, season two instead spends its entire premiere with a fresh face: Annie (Shailene Woodley), a med school dropout who's just starting to find happiness working as a tour guide at Graceland (another example of interlinking: as we know, Teri's such a big Elvis fan, her daughter with Xavier is named “Presley”) when disaster strikes.

Annie's experiences give us a whole new point of view on the Day as well as the first three years of its devastating aftermath. Since season one was so bunker-focused, the audience was shielded from witnessing the environmental nightmares, including the deep freeze caused by the supervolcano's giant ash cloud. There are also considerable challenges associated with living in a world where an EMP, set off by Bradford to prevent nuclear war, has knocked out all power sources beyond the most primitive.

We immediately care about Annie. She's all alone and would prefer to keep it that way, so we feel her terror when a group of rough-looking men suddenly appears at Graceland's gate. That said, like many of the characters on Paradise, they're not what they seem at first. It's in this way we meet another significant new character: Link, played by Thomas Doherty.

Paradise manages to successfully juggle all these threads because each character has a very clear destination, a very clear motivation, or often both. We don't always know what's driving them at first, but they do, and that helps the pieces of the narrative slot into place. Even the most slippery characters have an inner code—which is not always a moral code, mind you—that they remain loyal to above everything else.

That includes Jane, whose tendencies toward evil are further explored across season two—very necessary, after sort of materializing out of nowhere in season one—and the deeply complex Sinatra, who remains Paradise's most enigmatic character even as we learn more about her.

If you watched the trailer, you heard her say, “It was never just about the bunker,” and that tantalizing statement becomes the rabbit hole that season two plunges into. Strap in, and cringe at some of the music choices if you must—but know you're in for a hell of a ride, as Paradise spins another gripping story about how the end of the world can inspire some of the very best and very worst choices among what's left of humanity.

Paradise returns to Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ on February 23 with a three-episode drop and a weekly rollout thereafter.

When Wizards of the Coast started lifting the lid on its Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover set earlier this week, eagle-eyed fans of the heroes in a half-shell noticed that there was something a bit off with the weapon of choice for one of the brothers. Wherever Raphael was depicted in art for the set, his trademark sai were seemingly missing one of the side prongs. But it wasn't a mistake—it's actually a different weapon entirely, and the choice was made by Wizards of the Coast intentionally.

Throughout the TMNT set (and named in a few of the cards), Raph is depicted wielding a pair of jitte rather than sai—a blunt weapon popularized in feudal Japan with a singular hooked tine. But to clear the air, Wizards released a whole blog post explaining the potential confusion to TMNT fans who were unfamiliar with the weapon.

The short answer is twofold: first, the iteration of the Ninja Turtles that star in the Magic set are a unique iteration of the team in their own right, inspired by but distinct from the myriad incarnations of the TMNT universe that have existed over the years, and as well as having their own unique designs, it was decided that another way this new version of the Ninja Turtles could stand out is if some of the teens wielded different weapons. Second? Familial trauma.

Well, kind of. So explains the Wizards of the Coast blog, simply titled “Raphael's Jitte”:

At the core of it all, underneath the cool aliens, ninjutsu, and flying transdimensional bovines, you've got the story of this tight little family trying to bond, argue, and survive in extraordinary circumstances. When we designed the look for our Turtles, we asked, “How do these four American kids relate to each other and the culture their father comes from? What did they learn? What do they cling to? What do they reject?”

When it came to visuals, that relationship was front and center by giving the brothers very similar costuming that was still personalized to communicate little elements of their personality—that's why we very deliberately gave Mikey straps that resemble a backpack (to help make him feel younger than his brothers) and made Raph's mask distinct (to help him visually communicate how he sees himself as an outsider and different from his family).

In the end, we saw Splinter as very traditionally Japanese, following cues from the original Mirage comics and his various animated incarnations. In that light, it made a lot more sense that he would teach his sons how to use more traditional ninja weapons—Leonardo the ninjatō, Donatello the bō, Raphael the jitte, and Michelangelo the kusarigama—but teenagers are rebellious, and each one would express that through their experience growing up in NYC. Leo might internalize a little too much pop culture about Japan and imagine himself a samurai, for example.

In most incarnations of the TMNT, Raphael and Splinter arguably have the closest emotional relationships—they share a lot of anger. Splinter has mastered that rage and hopes to teach his son how to do the same, while Raph desperately wants his father to be proud of him, and his perceived failure of this is a big source of his sibling rivalry with the “golden boy,” Leonardo. You can't just throw that away, but we don't have hours of screentime to explore it, either. So, you think about how you can express these dynamics in visuals and designs.

It was decided, then, that the jitte felt more “traditionally Japanese,” according to Wizards, to match Splinter's heritage, and Raph's choice to continue using it instead of favoring another weapon (while the blog notes that the Magic Mikey was trained with a kusarigama, most cards he's depicted in show him with his usual nunchaku) is meant to convey his respect for his father figure, despite their clashes.

That's a lot of reasoning to explain a single (and, at the end of the day, relatively minor) art design choice in a whole Magic: The Gathering set filled with them. But it at the very least shows that Wizards has put a lot of thinking into its own stamp on the Ninja Turtles… even if it leads to some very silly moments in the set where classic comic art of Raph with his sai has been reused to flavor cards of his new weapon of choice:

It's the thought that counts. The Magic: The Gathering – Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set releases on March 6.

Fender has been a big name in the audio world for a long time, but even old dogs learn new tricks, and the guitar icon's newest trick is a pair of wireless headphones. For the first time, you can wear Fender on your head instead of slung over your shoulder, thanks to the Mix, a pair of Fender-branded wireless headphones that focus on modularity—the earcups, batteries, and headbands are all replaceable here.

If you notice, I wrote “Fender-branded” headphones, and your alarm bells are going off, let me elaborate: Fender isn't technically making the hardware (that would be a company called Riffsound Pte. Ltd.), though it does have a say in its design. And if your next thought is, “Do I really want a no-name pair of wireless headphones with some Fender branding on them?” I'm right there with you—or, I was before I tried them for myself.

Fender Mix

The modular Fender Mix are a strong start for the iconic guitar brand's first-ever pair of wireless headphones.

Pros

Cons

When I first saw the Fender Mix over a video call last summer, I was immediately intrigued. Fender's focus on modularity made its wireless headphones stand out, but there was one thing in particular that had me interested above the rest: a dongle. The Fender Mix come with a USB-C dongle that you can stick into your phone or another device to achieve lossless, low-latency audio. It's not a novel solution—competitors like Sennheiser's HDB 630 also employ that design—but it is somewhat rare, especially at the Mix's price point. Fender's wireless headphones cost $299 as opposed to the Sennheiser HDB 630's $499.

Why exactly was I so intrigued by a dongle, you ask? Well, because I'm not typically a wire guy, that's why. As much as I love how affordable and hi-fi wired headphones are, how a lot of them look, they're a pain to deal with on the train. Fumbling around with wires is easier at home than it is on the go, which is often when I'm using headphones. Dongles like the one included in the Fender Mix eliminate that pain point in theory and, as I've learned, in practice as well—all while providing a better-than-Bluetooth listening experience.

Trust me when I say that you're going to want to use the Fender Mix's dongle to listen to music. While the headphones sound solid with a standard Bluetooth connection, slotting the dongle into my phone and playing tunes that way moves the needle from solid to legitimately good. The second you're plugged in and the dongle is powered on, the soundstage widens, and things start to feel a lot roomier. I listened to Pavement's “Cut Your Hair” back-to-back, and the whole song had more presence. Snare hits were louder, vocals were more upfront, and the mix of guitars was more evenly spread out, making it easier to pick up on each track. As an added bonus, there's also a volume boost, which makes listening in loud environments easier. The bass profile is fairly pronounced, which isn't my preferred tuning, but if bass is your thing, you'll be pleased here.

It's nice that you don't have to use a dongle, but you're going to want to once you hear the difference.

Don't make the same mistake I did when I first started using the dongle, though. There are different modes that you have to activate in order to use all the features. To get to the lossless mode, you have to long-press the button on the dongle (about 3 seconds) until the light turns red. For low latency, you double-tap the button on the dongle. These wireless headphones also have Auracast, which lets you group audio products together for simultaneous listening, and to activate that feature, you tap the dongle button three times until the light turns purple.

I also tested the dongle's low-latency mode by playing some Fortnite on my laptop and was pleased with the speed. Having tried to use regular Bluetooth wireless earbuds in the past to play, the Fender Mix were leaps and bounds better for making sure I heard every gunshot and footfall on time. I wouldn't replace a gaming headset with the Mix anytime soon, but if you did want to use these headphones in a pinch when you're traveling, they're not a bad option. Yes, most headphones can be used wired in some capacity, but the Fender Mix gives you low-latency audio without wires.

One of the best parts of the dongle is that once you're done using it, you can easily take it out of your phone or another device and put it in the headphones, so you don't lose it. To store the tiny piece of important plastic and metal, just take off the magnetic earcup and place it into its rightful slot. Boom, you're done.

Powering the Fender Mix's sound are what the company is calling 40mm “hyper-efficient graphene drivers,” which definitely hold their own compared to other headphones at this price range, including Nothing's Headphone 1, which also debuted at $299. Ultimately, though, it's the USB-C dongle that provides the real strength here, and that's fine by me since the Fender Mix's sound quality is so good.

Outside of the dongle, the Fender Mix are also highly customizable and repairable. As I mentioned, the earcups are magnetic and can be popped off easily. Luckily, they still feel sturdy when they're attached, though. You can also replace the battery inside the Fender Mix, which is great since batteries are often the first thing to go in headphones. I didn't try to do this myself since I don't have an extra battery, but I did pop it out just to see how easy the whole thing was, and it felt pretty straightforward. Just pull the right earcup off, slide the plastic lid off the battery compartment, and then pull the whole thing out.

If you want to customize the Fender Mix, there are earcups that you can buy. My black unit came with additional tan earcups. Weirdly, Fender didn't share pricing for them. I've reached out to the company and will update this review with pricing info when I have it.

The earcups aren't premium-feeling in any way, but they are comfortable, and it's hard to speak to durability since that type of thing takes many months of use. I did notice some scuffing on the outside of the left earcup after keeping the headphones in my bag for a little over a week, so take that anecdote how you will. Headbands are also replaceable, and though I wasn't provided an additional headband, the process of taking off both earcups (speakers and all) was easy. Just pull them straight from the band with a little force, and you've got everything in neat little pieces.

I wouldn't describe the build quality as feeling premium, nor is the design particularly eye-catching—they're a bit bulky for my taste. The lack of imagination here is easy to forgive in my opinion, considering all of the other unique, thoughtful features that the Fender Mix have going for them.

Buttons are also on the conservative side, but they're responsible for controlling a lot. There are just two buttons on these headphones: a joystick-like button and a longer, flatter button. The joystick button (which can be moved left, right, up, or down) controls things like track skipping, on/off, and adjusting volume (and checking battery levels with a double-press), while the flatter button switches between EQ modes and also ANC modes. I highly recommend taking a look at the manual I've linked here (page 3) to see which button commands do what, because these two pieces of plastic/rubber are responsible for a lot. This is just how it goes when you don't have a companion app.

At the end of the day, the Fender Mix's defining feature is their modularity, and on that front these wireless headphones excel. If you're looking for style, you can always go with Nothing's Headphone 1—those are guaranteed to turn heads on your commute into work.

On top of good sound, the Fender Mix also perform well in two other key departments: active noise-cancellation (ANC) and battery life. I put the Mix through an obligatory subway test and was pleased at the amount of sound that these wireless headphones block out. Even if it was due mostly to the passive effect of the tight-fitting earcups or the ANC, I think most people will be happy with the Mix's sound-blocking acumen. These wireless headphones aren't going to unseat Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) as my favorite ANC headphones, but they're no slouch either.

There is an ambient mode (transparency to hear your surroundings), which is okay, but not mind-blowing. It lets some sound in, but my voice still sounds a little tinny—Apple's AirPods Max still have the best transparency in town. There's also a mode for having ANC and transparency off, which could be useful for extending battery life, but not much else.

While ANC is solid, battery life is actually impressive. Fender advertises up to 52 hours when ANC is activated and up to 100 hours when it's turned off. Having used the Fender Mix on and off for the majority of a 10-hour workday, it seems Fender isn't lying. With ANC mostly on, I started the day at 100% battery, and I finished at 89%. Unfortunately, you can't check the exact battery level on the wireless headphones (using the battery status command via the headphone button only gives you general levels in 25% increments), but I was able to monitor the exact level thanks to a feature in Apple's iOS.

For context, comparable competitors like Nothing's Headphone 1 get up to 35 hours of battery life with ANC on and about 80 hours with ANC off. On the battery front, the Fender Mix is a clear winner.

If there's one thing I can knock Fender for a little bit, it's not being the most feature-rich. While the Mix have ANC, there are no perks like a personalized hearing test or customizable EQ. Those aren't dealbreakers (I'm sure lots of people don't even know those features exist), but as someone who's taken advantage of them in the past, I can attest that they're nice to have.

Instead of adjustable EQ, there are different preset EQ modes: one for music, one for entertainment, and one for voice. I personally didn't notice a huge difference when switching between music and voice EQ modes while listening to a podcast, which is a bummer. I did notice a bit more difference when in the entertainment EQ while streaming Hulu, though—it sounds just a a tad more immersive. To cycle through those, you have to use the Mix's buttons, which is less than ideal, especially because the in-ear voice that tells you which setting you're on is hard to hear over music. I found myself having to turn the music off just to know which preset I was switching to.

Speaking of hard of hearing, calling with the Fender Mix was also less than ideal. While the voice quality is fine, I'm told that the Fender Mix tend to pick up quite a bit of ambient noise, which can be distracting for the person on the other end of the line. I was also calling from my office, which isn't a particularly noisy place. The ambient noise pickup is particularly surprising given the fact that Fender touts a dual-mic design with “ENC,” which is short for environmental noise-cancellation. I suppose if you're in a quiet spot, you may not notice any problems, but be wary of using these wireless headphones while out and about.

In the future, I'd love to see Fender include an app to expand the capabilities of the Mix and give a secondary input method outside of physical controls, but the start is at least solid. The Mix, as I mentioned, do have newer features like Auracast so clearly Fender has its eye on ways to enhance its headphones with software. If you're reading, Fender, take this as a formal invite to expand EQ options!

The Fender Mix are a strong start from a brand just dipping its toes into the wireless headphones game, and the best part is that Fender isn't phoning it in. It's taking modularity seriously with the Mix, which is great for consumers and theoretically better for the environment. On top of that, the included dongle makes what would otherwise be a pretty mid-sounding pair of wireless headphones into good-sounding ones. All of that for $299, coupled with the fact that these wireless headphones also have great battery life and solid ANC, makes the Mix worthy of consideration.

Turns out licensing your name can be more than a gimmick, and Fender is proof. You'll need to wait to order a pair, though; Fender says it plans to open pre-orders “in the next couple of days” when I asked them on Feb. 18.

Folks who follow hardware might recall that, right about a year ago, Thermal Grizzly started selling delidded Ryzen 7 9800X3D processors for a small markup. These CPUs are functionally identical to the chips sold by AMD — indeed, they were chips sold by AMD to begin with — except that they've had their Integrated Heatspreaders (IHS) removed. Well, if the Ryzen 7 9800X3D isn't good enough for you anymore, you can now pick up a Ryzen 7 9850X3D with the top popped for a bit extra.

 






It makes more sense than you think, even at the eye-watering prices the company is asking. You pay the cost up-front, and you get the best (or one of the best) gaming CPUs in the world, delidded by Thermal Grizzly's technicians and then verified for correct operation. Once that's verified, they put the whole thing in a box, including the delidded CPU, the removed IHS, and a USB flash drive that includes the testing protocol and a screenshot of the results. It also comes with a microscope image of the delidded processor and a small card describing the delidding results.

With the new addition, Thermal Grizzly is now offering four models of delidded CPUs. That's the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Ryzen 7 9850X3D, and Ryzen 9 9950X3D, and then Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K for those who bleed true blue. They don't come cheap; US pricing listed on the site right now comes out to $794.43 for a 9800X3D, $876.33 for a 9850X3D, and a whopping $1168.83 for the 16-core 9950X3D. Meanwhile, the Intel chip is a bit cheaper at $934.83.

 




Given that AMD and Intel are obviously not going to warranty your modified CPU, Thermal Grizzly itself is taking on the burden of warranty service for the delidded chips. The company warranties the chips for 24 months from the date of purchase, and for the first year, TG will take responsibility for nearly any chip failure that isn't caused by obvious user damage to the CPU. Quite generous, although it also doesn't cover ""overclocking beyond the manufacturer's specified values""; a bit peculiar given that we expect most people who delid their CPUs are chasing clocks, not improved thermals or better acoustics.

Thermal Grizzly notes on the product page that the chips are ""Optimal for TG Direct-Die cooling solutions,"" but also specifically remarks that the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is not compatible with its Direct Die frames. The company also notes that the stock heatspreader must ""never be used under any circumstances"" and that using the original heatspreader will void the warranty offered by Thermal Grizzly. Given that, it's a little odd that the part is included, but I suppose you could turn it into a keychain or something.

For folks who want to get into direct-die cooling, or who simply want the absolute best cooling efficiency, this saves a lot of hassle, but there are absolutely still challenges to be aware of. Oldheads like this nerd in particular will recall the bad old days of the original AMD Athlon, which came bare-die with no heatspreader; it was all too easy to crack those chips when installing a heatsink. That risk is no less salient today with delidded CPUs. Moreover, you've got to make sure that your cooling solution is properly spaced for the lid-less chip; both AMD and Intel use thick heatspreaders that will leave an air gap under their stock heatsinks. Head over to the Thermal Grizzly site if you'd like to ponder the idea of buying a scandalous naked CPU.

These findings underscore CKD severity as a risk factor for cognitive decline across the CKD spectrum,” the authors reported.

The study was led by Zhijie Huang, PhD, Department of Epidemiology, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana. It was published online in JAMA Network Open.

The study primarily used UPCR instead of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. It excluded individuals with end-stage kidney disease, potentially limiting generalizability to those with most advanced CKD. Annual or biennial cognitive tests may have been subject to practice effects and ceiling effects, potentially attenuating observed associations. Despite adjusting for numerous lifestyle and clinical risk factors, residual confounding may persist. 

The study was supported by grants from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and multiple institutional grants. Some authors reported receiving personal fees from industry and grants outside the submitted work; one served as an advisor to a research collaborative and as a journal editor.

Dr Sheena Meredith

People in the UK are spending fewer years in good health, with healthy life expectancy (HLE) now at its lowest level since records began in 2011-2013. 

For 2022-2024, HLE at birth was 60.7 years for males and 60.9 years for females, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Both figures have fallen sharply since 2019-2021.

The decline comes despite improvements in overall life expectancy since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Compared with 2019 to 2021, HLE has fallen by 1.8 years for males and 2.5 years for females. 

Greg Ceely, head of population health monitoring at the ONS, said: “Back in 2011, when the ONS first collected this data, men were expected to remain in good health until around the age of 63, and women 64. Today, they could both expect around 61 years of healthy life.”

HLE reflects the average number of years a person can expect to live in “very good” or “good” health, based on self-reported measures.

Marked regional disparities persist.

In England, the South East recorded the highest HLE at birth, at 63.0 years for males and 64.3 years for females. The North East had the lowest, at 57.0 and 56.9 years, respectively.

At local authority level, Richmond upon Thames had the highest HLE in England, at 69.3 years for males and 70.3 years for females. Blackpool had the lowest for males (50.9 years), while Hartlepool had the lowest for females (51.2 years).

In Scotland, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands had the highest HLE for males and females, but the ONS said the estimates are “very uncertain” due to small populations.

Merthyr Tydfil had the lowest HLE for males and females among all areas in Wales, at 51.7 years and 50.1 years, respectively.

Overall life expectancy has increased in more than three-quarters of UK local areas since 2019-2021.

However, gains in life expectancy have not translated into more years in good health.

During 2020-2022, male life expectancy was 78.8 years, while average HLE was 62.4 years. That equates to 16.4 years, or 21% of life, spent in poor health. For females, life expectancy was 82.8 years, with 20.1 years, or 24%, spent in poor health.

A 2024 report from the King's Fund said: “Not only has life expectancy stalled, but males and females spend more years in poor health.”

The think tank noted that although women live longer on average, they spend a higher proportion of their lives in poor health.

Stark regional differences were also evident for life expectancy, with the 10 local areas with the highest life expectancy at birth, for both males and females, all in the south of England.

The Royal Society for Public Health described the latest data as “a wake-up call for policymakers to address the drivers of ill health, not just the consequences.”

Dr Jamie O'Halloran, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the figures “show that where you live determines how many years you spend in good health – and that gap isn't closing.”

He added: “Reforming the NHS and bringing care closer to communities can help reduce health inequalities, but most of what shapes our physical and mental health lies outside the health system.

“Without tackling those root causes, we won't see the gains we need.”

The FDA has approved a supplemental new drug application for pitolisant (Wakix, Harmony Biosciences) for the treatment of cataplexy in children as young as 6 years with narcolepsy.

Pitolisant was first approved in August 2019 for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy. The indication was expanded in October 2020 to include cataplexy in adults. In June 2024, the FDA approved pitolisant for the treatment of EDS in pediatric patients aged 6 years or older with narcolepsy.

With this new indication, pitolisant is now the “first-and-only FDA-approved treatment option for both pediatric and adult narcolepsy patients with or without cataplexy that is not scheduled as a controlled substance, an important distinction that supports its clinical utility,” Jeffrey M. Dayno, MD, president and CEO of Harmony Biosciences, said in a statement.

Pitolisant is a selective histamine 3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist that works through a novel mechanism of action to increase the synthesis and release of histamine, a wake-promoting neurotransmitter in the brain. It is administered orally once daily in the morning upon waking.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of children aged 6-17 years with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy, pitolisant significantly reduced narcolepsy symptoms compared with placebo (P = .007).

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and greater than placebo) observed with pitolisant in children were headache (19%) and insomnia (7%). The overall adverse reaction profile of the drug in the pediatric clinical trial was similar to that seen in the adult clinical trial program.

Edited by Archita Rai

Among young adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 29.1% also reported having nonceliac gluten sensitivity. Those with both conditions more often had symptoms beyond the gut and were more likely to follow and report benefits from a gluten-free diet than those with IBS alone.

“Taken together, these findings suggest that, in a subset of IBS patients, exposure to specific wheat components may induce or exacerbate gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms via immune-mediated mechanisms and highlight the need for further studies to elucidate the impact of wheat ingestion, immune activation, and mucosal responses in the context of IBS,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Viviana Fara Brindicci, MD, and Fernanda Cristofori, MD, University of Bari “Aldo Moro,” Children's Hospital “Giovanni XXIII,” Bari, Italy. It was published online in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology.

The study relied on self-reported data, which may have led to inaccurate diagnoses and diet reporting. Researchers could not determine the true prevalence of IBS and nonceliac gluten sensitivity overlap. Not all contacted participants responded, raising the possibility of nonresponse bias.

No specific funding source was mentioned for the study. The authors declared having no disclosures.

Edited by Mamta Pawara

The integration of male sex, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and haemoglobin and glucose levels with the HEART (history, ECG, age, risk factors, and troponin levels) score enhanced its ability to predict significant coronary artery stenosis in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The enhanced model improved the diagnostic accuracy by 13.5% in patients with low- or moderate-risk HEART scores.

""This study demonstrated the potential of an enhanced HEART score model to improve the accuracy for predicting significant coronary artery stenosis in patients presenting to the ED [emergency department] with suspected ACS and considered to be at low-to-moderate risk,"" the authors wrote.

""By incorporating additional simple clinical and laboratory variables, the model offers a promising tool for risk stratification, addressing critical gaps in current diagnostic practices,"" they added.

This study was led by Michele Della Rocca, Centro Cardiologico Monzino IRCCS, Milan, Italy. It was published online on February 11, 2026, in the Journal of Clinical Medicine.

The retrospective single-centre design and specific cohort characteristics, including the low proportion of patients with prior revascularisation, might have introduced selection bias and limited causal inference and generalisability. Positive CCTA findings did not directly correspond to the clinical diagnosis of ACS or the immediate need for revascularisation. Advanced imaging markers such as coronary calcium burden and plaque phenotype were unavailable for the analysis.

This study did not receive any external funding. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

More cases of colorectal cancer are detected at an early stage with screening. This is according to new research based on data from over 278,000 60-year-olds, who were randomly selected to undergo one of two interventions or no screening at all (usual care). The study, which is a collaboration between Uppsala University and Karolinska Institutet, has been published in Nature Medicine.

Cancer of the colon and rectum, known as colorectal cancer, is one of the most common cancers. Prevention and early detection are crucial to reducing the risk that the patient will die from the disease. In a new study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Uppsala University investigated whether screening is a beneficial method for detecting cases of colorectal cancer at an early stage.

The study involved over 278,000 people who were randomly offered either a primary colonoscopy; two faecal immunochemical tests (FIT), where the patients provided a stool sample, which was followed by a colonoscopy if one of the samples was positive; or no intervention at all, termed usual care.

The results show that both types of screening lead to more cases of early-stage cancer being detected, especially in the first two years when most of the interventions were carried out. This is good news because, more often than not, cancer that is diagnosed early can be successfully treated. For many types of cancers, there is no preventive treatment option, but in this case, it is also possible to detect and remove adenoma – precursors that might otherwise have developed into cancer.""

Marcus Westerberg, docent at Uppsala University and the study's author for correspondence

The research is part of the Swedish study SCREESCO, which started in 2014 to investigate how effective two different screening methods are in reducing long-term mortality from colorectal cancer. The participants were 60 years old, identified via the population register, and then randomised into three different groups:

In patients where the precursors to cancer were found in a colonoscopy, they received treatment according to the current guidelines. The participants were then followed via the register until 2020.

At the end of the follow-up period, the researchers found that the number of cases of more advanced colorectal cancer had decreased in both of the intervention groups. The clearest results were seen in the group where the participants had done FITs. There, 0.61 per cent developed colorectal cancer, compared to 0.73 per cent in the control group. 

""We can show that cases of advanced cancer tend to decrease towards the end of the period in the group that was randomised to provide stool samples for FIT. This could be evidence of a preventive effect of the screening, through the removal of the precursors to cancer,"" says Anna Forsberg, docent at Karolinska Institutet, who is the last author and responsible for SCREESCO.

The study also investigated whether there were any negative effects associated with an increased number of colonoscopies. The researchers were able to see a slight increase in stomach and intestinal bleeding as well as blood clots in these patient groups, especially in the first year when most of the colonoscopies were performed. However, these events were unusual, and the all-cause mortality rate was the same in all groups.

The researchers now plan to follow the participants in the study until 2030 to see how effective the different screening methods are in reducing long-term mortality from colorectal cancer.

""This study gives us great hope that screening will also be shown to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in both groups when the study is finally evaluated in about five years,"" says Anna Forsberg.

The Swedish study SCREESCO started in 2014 to investigate how effective two different screening methods are in reducing long-term mortality from colorectal cancer. The study compares screening with once-only colonoscopy and screening with two rounds of two-stool FIT with a low cutoff for a positive FIT of 10 μg Hb/gr for both men and women. 

In Sweden, screening with a faecal immunochemical test (FIT) has been offered every two years in Region Stockholm and Region Gotland since 2015 to individuals aged 60–69 years, and since 2020 to individuals aged 60–74 years. The cutoff values for a positive FIT were then 40 μg Hb per gram of stool for women and 80 μg Hb/gr for men. Individuals with a positive FIT are offered colonoscopy. A national, FIT-based screening programme with the same cutoff values, testing frequency, and age range started being rolled out in 2021 with full implementation planned for 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","England to host Club World Cup? Chelsea impact assessed by expert, FIFA set £750m target again","https://www.thechelseachronicle.com/news/england-to-host-club-world-cup-chelsea-impact-assessed-by-expert-fifa-set-750m-target-again/","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 18:15:00 GMT","

Club World Cup champions Chelsea could see the second edition of the revamped FIFA tournament staged in their own backyard.

The Club World Cup was the second honour of the BlueCo era but was wildly more lucrative than the first, the Europa Conference League. In total, Chelsea banked around £85m in prize money.

FIFA expanded the tournament to 32 teams for the first quadrennial version in the United States last summer, and reports suggest that they are considering going even bigger in 2029.

World football's governing body is aiming to invite 16 extra teams to the next Club World Cup, as well as loosening the rules on the number of clubs allowed from single nations, potentially allowing more than two Premier League teams to participate.

Is this sustainable? What's Clearlake's masterplan to claw back these losses?

For Chelsea, whose success in the United States after thumping Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final has significantly helped amid anxieties around UEFA's financial rules, that would increase the odds of being at the competition again in 2029. 

Exactly how money-spinning that event will be for participating clubs depends on a number of factors.

For one, the £750m prize money pot for the competition in the summer was largely funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund via an investment in tournament broadcaster DAZN. That led some to accuse FIFA of artificially inflating the value of the deal in exchange for influence from Saudi Arabia, who will host the international World Cup in 2034 and have been mooted as a potential host for 2029 too.

“The 2025 edition was seen as a hustle,” says University of Liverpool football finance lecturer Kieran Maguire, speaking exclusively to the Chelsea Chronicle.

“FIFA are desperate for normalisation and legitimacy on the back of that.”

Could that normalisation and legitimacy from staging the tournament in an established footballing nation, like England? Spain and Morocco are the favourites to stage the Club World Cup in 2029 but, according to The Guardian, FIFA are also mulling the possibility of hosting the tournament in England.

“If it takes place in England, will it sell out with 48 teams? I suspect not,” says Maguire, “but the matches involving Chelsea and three or four teams, as well as those involving Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and so on certainly would. 

“But the issue is when you get Oceania's best team against the second or third best team in Africa, there might be a novelty value, but it won't be much more than that. 

“Would traditional fans turn their noses up? Yes, but I think we underestimate the appeal of England to tourist fans. It then comes down to pricing. As we have seen with FIFA's dynamic pricing, that can work for the organisation, if not for the fans.”

Scott McTominay's bicycle kick goal in Scotland's victory over Denmark — a win that saw the nation qualify for their first World Cup in 28 years — has been commemorated with a mural outside Hampden Park.

The 29-year-old scored the first goal of the 4-2 win on November 18, a brilliant overhead effort following a Ben Doak cross after just three minutes.

The victory also featured two more memorable goals with Kieran Tierney's 93rd-minute strike from the edge of the area and Kenny McLean's 98th-minute effort from his own half.

Commissioned by Adidas the mural paying tribute to “one of the greatest ever Scotland goals” was unveiled outside the national team's stadium in Glasgow on Friday.

McTominay's career has continued to soar since he left Manchester United and joined Napoli in the summer of 2024. The midfielder scored 13 goals and provided six assists to help Napoli win the Scudetto last season. He was also named the Serie A Player of the Year for 2025 and finished 18th in the rankings for the 2025 Ballon d'Or award.

The Scot has scored ten goals and provided four assists this campaign in 34 appearances.

Scotland are next in action when they host Japan (March 28) and the Ivory Coast (March 31) in international friendlies. The game against Japan is being played at Hampden Park, while the Ivory Coast fixture is at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium.

After qualifying for the 2026 Men's World Cup in Canada, Mexico, and the USA, their first appearance in the tournament since 1998, they were drawn into Group C alongside Brazil, Haiti, and Morocco. They begin against Haiti at the Boston Stadium on June 14.

MIAMI, Fla. (CBS12) — Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is set to take the podium at 1 p.m. Friday at Camillus House in Miami, joined by a heavy-hitting lineup of legal officials, victim advocates, and sports organizers.

The event features a prominent coalition of legal and community leaders, including Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez-Rundle, Statewide Prosecutor Brad McVay, and representatives from the FIFA World Cup Miami Host Committee.

The inclusion of Kristi's House CEO, Amanda Altman, and survivor mentor, Gloria Martinez, could highlight a collaborative effort between law enforcement and local advocacy groups to provide a safe environment for the upcoming event.

While the logistics are unclear, it's evident that safety protocols and the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup are the highlights of the conference.

Barcelona's search for Robert Lewandowski's successor has hit a massive roadblock after Atletico Madrid slapped a record-breaking valuation on Julian Alvarez. The Argentine forward has become the primary target for the Catalan giants, but the financial demands from the capital could make this one of the most expensive deals in football history.

Barcelona have been met with a firm ""no"" in the form of a €200 million (£167m) valuation for Alvarez, according to Cadena Ser. After making internal enquiries about the World Cup winner's availability, the Blaugrana were informed that any deal would require the second-highest transfer fee ever paid, trailing only the €222m Neymar move to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017.

The Catalan hierarchy views Alvarez as the ideal tactical fit to lead their line for the next decade. His high-pressing energy and technical versatility have made him the undisputed priority for sporting director Deco and his department. However, Atletico have no intention of losing their marquee signing so soon.

The situation is further complicated by the political landscape at Camp Nou. With presidential elections on the horizon, major sporting investments are currently on hold. While some reports out of Argentina suggest a preliminary understanding exists with the player, Joan Laporta must first secure his re-election and return the club to La Liga's 1:1 spending rule before a bid can even be considered.

Despite Barcelona's heavy interest, Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo publicly shut down the possibility of a sale during the January transfer window. The Rojiblancos are determined to keep their star man and are reportedly preparing a lucrative contract extension to ward off suitors. This strategy aims to reward the 26-year-old for his commitment while further inflating his market value.

While the Premier League's elite - including Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United - are keeping a close watch on the ""Spider,"" Alvarez is believed to prefer staying in Spain. Reports suggest that if he were to leave the Metropolitano, Barcelona would be his destination of choice. However, Atleti hold a strong hand with the striker currently under contract until 2030.

To bridge the gap, Barcelona would likely need to sanction several high-profile departures to balance their books. Without a significant shift in their economic standing, matching a €200m asking price remains an impossible task under La Liga's strict salary cap regulations. For now, the move remains a dream for the Blaugrana rather than a sporting reality.

""Julian is a player under contract with Atletico Madrid and he is happy,"" Enrique Cerezo told Egyptian broadcaster Win Win when asked about the links to Catalonia. ""No one from Barca has officially contacted us about signing him, and that's all there is to it.""

Diego Simeone has also been vocal in his support of the forward, especially following a recent dip in scoring form. ""Seriously? Are you seriously asking me that?"" Simeone fired back at reporters questioning the Argentine's output. ""The truth is that Julian Alvarez speaks for himself, because of the name he has, the authority he carries, and the career he's built, right?""

The admiration for Alvarez extends into the Barcelona dressing room, where potential future teammates have already begun praising his ability. ""He's a great player; for me, he's one of the best strikers in the world,"" Barca defender Ronald Araujo noted recently. ""You can see the quality he has.""

The high regard from his peers highlights why the Catalan club is so desperate to secure his signature. However, with Simeone maintaining total faith in his compatriot and Cerezo refusing to negotiate, the path to a transfer remains littered with obstacles that even a player of Alvarez's quality might struggle to bypass.

Alvarez will be looking to silence his critics and justify his astronomical transfer fee when Atleti returns to action. The focus remains on winning trophies under Simeone, with a series of crucial matches in La Liga and European competition coming up.

For Barcelona, the focus shifts to the club's management. The club must face upcoming elections and finalise several sponsorship deals to boost their financial leverage ahead of the summer transfer window. 

While Barca gear up for a home game against Levante on Sunday, Los Rojiblancos are scheduled to face Espanyol in La Liga the day before. They are then set to play the second leg of their Champions League knockout playoff against Club Brugge next week. In the first leg, Atleti had to settle for a 3-3 draw, with Alvarez scoring the opening goal.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Legendary Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has rubbished suggestions that Pep Guardiola's eventual departure could lead to the club suffering a similar decline to the one Manchester United experienced when Sir Alex Ferguson retired. According to reports, there is an expectation that Guardiola could step down from his role at the end of this season after 10 years as City coach.

Aguero won five Premier League titles in his decade at City, with three of those coming under Guardiola before the striker left for Barcelona in 2021 and soon after was forced to retire from the game due to a heart condition. Guardiola has led City to six league titles in his nine years as well as landing them their first ever Champions League crown in 2023 when they completed a treble. 

The Athletic has reported that there is a growing expectation that this could be Guardiola's final season in charge of City, which has led them to consider potential successors such as Enzo Maresca. Guardiola, however, has refused to comment on the speculation, insisting he does not know what the future holds for him.

Speaking via Stake, Aguero said: ""Pep has repeatedly stated in recent months that he has one more year on his contract, so there's no point in speculating now about whether or not he'll leave at the end of the season.""

Aguero scored the most important goal in City's history against Queens Park Rangers in 2012 which delivered City's first league title in 44 years. Roberto Mancini was manager then and Aguero collected his second Premier League crown two years later in Manuel Pellegrini's first season in charge, also lifting the League Cup. And the Argentine does not fear for City's future when the serial-winning boss eventually decides to walk away.

""It's always the case that when such a successful manager leaves, there's some kind of reshuffling,"" added Aguero, who is City's all-time top scorer with 260 goals in 390 games in all competitions. ""But I have a feeling that City will know how to replace him very well when the time comes. A club, an institution like City, a club that has established itself among the elite, is much more than just a great manager. And whoever arrives will have a solid foundation to continue growing.""

If this is to be Guardiola's final season with City, he will be determined to go out on a high by winning a seventh Premier League title. And City are edging closer to that goal after cutting the gap on leaders Arsenal to five points with a game in hand. Arsenal have dropped points in their last two games against Brentford and Wolves while City have won their last two league matches, against Liverpool and Fulham. 

Guardiola, however, has insisted he is not discussing the status of the title race with his players as there are still 12 matches left and so much can change from now until the end of the season. He said on Friday: ""Newcastle is all I am concerned with. I'm not concerned with the League Cup final with Arsenal until it comes. Now it's Newcastle, rest and after Leeds. I don't know what is going to happen these next 12 games. I didn't speak one second about that with my players.

""Yesterday and the day before it was Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle. I didn't talk about the position or the table. I could not care less. It's 12 games. Ask me this question with two or three games and I will answer but 12 games left is an eternity. That is the only truth I have.

""They were nine points [in front] because we had a game in hand. When everybody has the same fixtures, and after we have the differences. Many things are going to happen until the end of the season. 70 per cent of the players are new so they don't have that experience of these kind of situations. Experience is win tomorrow.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

F1 Bahrain Testing Week 2 2026: Day 3 Highlights

Komatsu 'really proud of everyone's effort'

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur has shared his assessment of how the Scuderia fared during the 2026 pre-season test in Bahrain.

Fred Vasseur reflected positively on how Ferrari's pre-season testing unfolded in Bahrain, with the team boss suggesting that the squad did “pretty well” in terms of meeting their target to gain a lot of mileage, though also cautioned that development will be key to “keeping momentum” during the season ahead.

Charles Leclerc ended the second and final test at the Bahrain International Circuit with the fastest time set throughout the three-day event, topping the timesheets via his effort of 1m 31.992s as well as amassing a lap count of 132 on Friday.

It marked the close of what looked to be a productive few days for the Scuderia and, when asked after Day 3 of the second test if he was happy with how everything had gone for the squad, Vasseur answered: “Happy, yes, but we have to keep in mind what was the target at the beginning.

“Our target was to do a lot of mileage and I think this went pretty well, to collect data, to try to improve session after session, and I think this went well.

“Now, performance is not relative – it's not performance relative and, at the end of the day, we don't know the level of fuel of the others, we don't know the engine mode, we don't know that we didn't have the same tyres.

“It means that, let's be focused on ourselves to try to do a better job in Melbourne and this weekend, and we'll see where we are.”

With pre-season testing now complete, the teams and drivers will next hit the track when the Australian Grand Prix kicks off the 24-round campaign on March 6-8.

In terms of his expectations for that first race, Vasseur suggested that the ability to develop quickly will perhaps be more crucial going forwards into the season than focusing too much on the outcome of the opening round.

“I had a clear idea before this session that I don't want to say it doesn't matter, the result of Melbourne, because I prefer to have a good result than a bad one,” the Ferrari Team Principal explained.

“But at the end of the day, I know that the development will be so huge during the season that the most important is the capacity of the team to develop, the capacity of the team to bring parts quickly, much more than the performance at race one.

“It means that we need to keep the momentum of the season and to be focused on development.”

Craig Erwich, who oversees Hulu and ABC programming, also discusses what's next for 'The Descendants' and 'Zombies,' and reveals a new series from the 'Bluey' creator.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Craig Erwich, the president of Disney Television Group, serves many platforms. Soon, he'll serve a new master in Josh D'Amaro, the latest board-selected CEO to succeed Bob Iger. Even during this period of great change at Disney, which also includes technology shifts toward vertical video and gen-AI, the ins and outs of running Hulu and ABC won't change much for Erwich.


	In a wide-ranging interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Erwich discussed those modern-day transformations within a company that celebrated its 100th birthday more than two years ago. There was also much to celebrate, and we talked about those things too. Hulu's Tell Me Lies just finished its massive breakout third and final season, reaching its largest-ever audience with its series finale. Mere days ago, the last-ever episode reached 3.5 million viewers in its first day on Disney+ and Hulu, according to internal Disney data, an increase of 70 percent from the season three premiere.

	With a surge like that, more Tell Me Lies would be a no-brainer. Erwich told THR that there have been some discussions of a spinoff series with creator Meaghan Oppenheimer, who has an overall deal at 20th Television, but first they're doing “a completely new series” together about “family dynamics.”


	“We're excited work with Meaghan again,” Erwich said. “I think she's incredibly talented at telling stories about complicated relationships.”

	











	There was more new business to announce as well, like Bluey creator Joe Brumm's first foray into adult animation with a Hulu adaptation of the TikTok and Instagram shorts Deano. A new Zombies movie is being readied for summer 2027, Erwich confirmed, and there will be no rest for the undead: Erwich told THR that a new “Worlds Collide” concert tour with The Descendants and Zombies casts is readying, and this time, the Camp Rock (3) rockers are hitting the road with the other franchises' stars.


	Read THR‘s wide-ranging Q&A with Erwich below.


	***


Let's start at the literal top, the CEO change. You know Dana Walden well, but what is your working relationship with Josh D'Amaro like? How do you expect your job to change under the new regime?


	I think we're just incredibly lucky to have two, I mean, truly exceptional leaders in Josh and Dana. Both of them are just massive supporters of the talent and the power of great storytelling and creativity. And I think they both know that that's what drives the entire company. So, I think everyone's in a really good place. We had a great town hall couple weeks ago where it just felt like the company was in really, really good shape. It was, it was quite an optimistic beat — and it's kind of continued forward.


Josh comes from Parks, so I don't know this answer: Is he more of a TV or a movie guy?


	I've seen him at the Oscars. [Both laugh] We'll invite him to the Emmys this year. I know that he's a fan of just great storytelling and creativity — it obviously shows up at the parks.

	











Tell Me Lies has been a real standout performer and the latest proof-of-concept of YA TV. What are your future plans for the genre?


	Well, coming-of-age stories, as we call them — or as we talk about them — is less of an age group of an audience and more of a time of people's lives that everybody remembers. So there's just endless fodder for storytelling, whether it's people going back to relive their youth or experience their lives in a different way. And it's always obviously a pivotal moment for people, and we're telling these stories in multiple different ways, with, I would say, honestly, multiple tones. So we have everything from Tell Me Lies, which is about toxic relationships in college, to a new show coming out called Phony, which is really almost Freaks and Geeks with a genre bend to it. You know, you don't just come of age in high school — you continue to come of age, specifically in that period after college. Then we kind of have the queen or the king as it was of the rom-com, Mindy Kaling, who's just completed a show for us called Not Suitable for Work, which is really about coming of age in the workplace and navigating that time of your life. 


	And then we have some really, I would say, classic takes on it. One of our big launches this summer for Disney+ will be Coven Academy, which is a bunch of young girls in a genre setting — but that one is also specifically geared for young audiences in 2026. We designed these episodes to be in 15-minute bursts because we know how people are watching. These things are meant not just on the [TV] screen, but on mobile. It's got a propulsive beat to it. It's not just the subject matter, but the form of storytelling, that feels really relevant.

	











	The form has to continue to evolve to be relevant. We just launched Locker Diaries, which is a vertical video series where meet characters of our franchises — The Descendants, Phineas and Ferb — as they roam the halls of high school. This one came to be great because we were talking about vertical video, and it was asked in a meeting, “What else is vertical?” And someone said, “A locker.” And so you have a show told through the point of view of the locker.


The lockers shorts are a really clever way for Disney to do vertical video. Do you see vertical video being a large part of Disney's streaming future? Or is it a passing fad to be used sparingly?


	What we're about is fandom — it's really the through line of everything we do. Dana talks about this all the time. A view is a single view, but fans come back multiple times for experiences. So I think vertical video can be a lever towards that, or one thing that can provide a more immersive experience and a deeper fan experience around the show that they love, but that will also complement with things we do, like video podcasts … or concert tours, which we just did around The Descendants and Zombies — that comes out [on Disney+ on) Friday. So we're really trying to enable the fans to go deep and champion these shows. You have to put a lot of assets towards that, and that's the strategy that drives — whether it's a vertical video or podcast or concert tours or social assets.

	











One of the reasons Josh got the big chair, I imagine, was not just his work with the parks, but the Disney experiences that come to you — concerts, Disney on Ice, cruises, the Dancing With the Stars tour — what a competitive advantage.


	I mean, we create really deep experiences beyond a first watch. Again, whether it's the tour or you go to Disneyland and you see, Spidey and Bluey and Mickey, which, you know, are three of the top five preschool shows that you're not just watching, but then you're interacting with it. It's something that we do, I think, better than anybody. Obviously, it's an honor to work at Disney. There's an incredible legacy here, but we really talk a lot about eventizing our legacy, So it was just, for instance, the 20th anniversary of High School Musical. So as appropriate, we really celebrated that with social and media and events for the fans. And you saw the uplift of High School Musical on Disney+ just really spike. It gave a relevancy and a recency to a movie that's now 20 years old. 


	It's the same thing for the Muppets, which we (re-launched) two weeks ago. It's one of the crown jewels of the Disney company. People have such deep memories and affection for the original franchise as part of their childhood, as something they want to share with their kids. And we really put up a classic version of it that created conversation. It has Sabrina Carpenter, who is among the most original contemporary artists. Suddenly that felt like a moment in 2026 that also was celebrating a moment from when the show first came out. 

	











	I think the one we're really excited about is we have this Hannah Montana special coming up, which is a beloved character and a beloved part of the Disney library that still performs really well on Disney+. We put that trailer out and within 24 hours it had like 127 million views. So you can continue to inject relevancy and recency and, most importantly, an event around these classic shows, because there's new viewers coming in all the time, or people just want to go back and experience it again.


I like when these stars return to whatever kids show first made them famous because they often spent so much time and energy trying to break away from that image. Is it hard to get “Disney stars” to return to the thing that made them a Disney star?


	I know for Hannah Montana, Miley has just such a deep connection to her fans. And I think this anniversary is really meaningful, not just to her, but to that generation. And you know else is a Hannah Montana fan is Alex Cooper, and so Alex Cooper is going to host it.


You have a number of ABC legacy shows in Malcolm in the Middle and Scrubs returning for more than a special, but a season or maybe more. It's a shortcut to awareness, but risky in terms of the legacy of the original series.


	Well, there has to be a reason to do it. It has to be done with a very contemporary nod that honors the original spirit of it.


	We went through a similar thing this past summer on King of the Hill, which is a beloved show. And you know when the show came out, I just think the fans were so excited and happy and maybe even relieved that we not just did an honor to what the show was, but we really did a very clever update of it that just felt as relevant as the original one. Greg (Daniels) and Mike (Judge) and Sal (Patterson) really threaded the needle on that. I mean, the reviews were just incredible. The old audience … kind of came back in droves because the show had something to say.

	











Not just a cash grab.


	Yes, yes. No cynicism around these things.


My older daughter would kick me if I didn't ask what's next for Zombies and The Descendants.


	Well, these what we call, internally, Disney Channel Original Movies around music are something that we do that no other company can do, and that's a key part of our strategy. The Descendants and Zombies are really kind of the the the true bar. That's really where the bar is on things. So we have a new Descendants coming out. There will be another Zombies this summer. We're going to do another tour that will also include Camp Rock, which we're really excited about because we have the next generation of Camp Rockers coming out this summer in our new Camp Rock. These movies that combine music, they're incredible way to discover new talent. And they are things the whole family can watch together, you know, is a very important part of our strategy.


Do you see a near-ish future where the number of scripted shows on ABC increases given how much viewing shows like Abbott Elementary and The Rookie drive on Hulu?


	One of the things that we're extraordinarily proud of at Disney is how we've been able to master the interplay between ABC and Hulu. We have these two places where people can access one show and we've proven over and over again that it aggregates a bigger audience, it doesn't cannibalize it. So there's a massive opportunity there that we continue to reap the success of. You take a look at High Potential, which is one of the top shows on television and streaming, and the phenomenon of that is borne out by the relationship between ABC and Hulu and that strategy.

	











	If you kind of look at the ratings between High Potential and a show like (CBS') Matlock — on linear, they're somewhat close. It depends on the week. But then when you add in the Hulu part of it — the robust streaming platform that our shows go to — it just laps the competition. And that's where you see the success of shows like High Potential, Will Trent, Abbott Elementary… Hulu allows us also to build those audiences who are catching up on the show later, and then they come in and can join it live. 


	What's happened with The Rookie I think has almost been under reported. This is a show that, in its ninth season is, on an hour's basis, one of the top rated shows on streaming week in and week out. It's become this massive phenomenon and fan favorite among teens who are kind of discovering it for themselves. So this ability to bring audiences up to speed on Hulu, it just provides a great opportunity. And ABC is a great launchpad. To the extent that we can do more, we will do more. I'm really excited about RJ Decker, that's coming out next month. We talked about Scrubs, which I think is the perfect example of a show that's built for broadcast and streaming, as is Abbott.


Everyone loves Bluey, everyone watches Bluey. It's a great title to have on Disney+, but it's not your show. Is it better to have the biggest show via license, or would you consider Spidey & His Amazing Friends, which you own, the greater success for Disney?


	I mean, they're both important. Bluey, which was the number one show on streaming, provides massive engagement for our streaming platform. It provides a show that people kind of check in on a daily basis. We're really proud to be in business with (Bluey creator) Joe Brumm. As matter of fact, we just greenlit a new show that Joe is executive producing called Deano, which is his take on what will ultimately be an adult animation show. And the circulation of Bluey then allows us to launch other shows, like our new Iron Man show, yeah, or the new preschool version of Avengers. Spidey is obviously the Grand Slam because it's a show that not only starts to rival Bluey in engagement, but it's also a show that we can then take people through that character's journey — everything from preschool to the parks to toys to consumer products. And that's when you can take a look at the case study of Spidey or Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. That's that Disney flywheel thing they talk about where that is truly what our competitive advantage is in this industry.

	











I want to go back to Tell Me Lies because it has been your most recent breakout hit. It's rare for a show to grow this much, this long into its existence. Did you see this success coming with season three?


	Well, let me start with— from day one, we loved the show and believed in it. The first episode of season one did not come out of the box gangbusters. It was a slow build. It required word of mouth. I think we understood who the audience was, and we built experiences for them. So we seeded TikTok clips, videos for people to share — that helps spread the word — and, you know, the podcast around the show. I do think one of the things that helped is we cast (Tell Me Lies star) Grace (Van Patten) in The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox, which introduced her to a wider audience. And that's very much, you know, a page from the Disney playbook. You know, (president of Disney Branded Television) Ayo Davis does this in our kids and family efforts. 


	Malachi Barton, who I'm sure your daughter knows who started in Zombies and is now in Camp Rock 3, he's been introduced into our tentpole releases and is now in Coven Academy. It's the same tactics that led Dancing With the Stars to be up year over year — getting (Hulu's) The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives women on Dancing with the Stars. 


	[Tell Me Lies] is up 150 percent (in viewers, season three vs. season one), which is pretty unheard of. But also it's so addictive, which is, I think— at the core of every great original that we do here, it's not that you just can't stop watching this show, you cannot stop talking about. And if you can empower the conversation and bring that community of fans together and give them the materials to kind of evangelize on your behalf, but just also to interact with it, it's pretty special.

	











One way Disney+ may soon allow fans to interact with their favorite IP is through UGC gen-AI — how do you see the use of AI on Disney+ actually playing out?


	Look, our jobs are to protect our creators and our IP. That said, AI, it is a tool that our productions are using and exploring. The key is that any use of it has to be human led. So if you look at Percy Jackson, for instance, Tyson, who was the new character we introduced this year— AI was utilized with Tyson, the cyclops character, but that was a creative decision used in the post production process.


It feels appropriate to end with one more Tell Me Lies question. Given the massive surge in popularity, have there been discussions about a spinoff?


	Yes, we've definitely discussed what another Tell Me Lies might look like with a new set of characters. Meaghan has some initial notions but she also has an original take on family dynamics that's a completely new series. We're excited work with Meaghan again. I think she's incredibly talented at telling stories about complicated relationships.

The legendary U.S. skier celebrated her third gold medal by nodding to a track from ""The Life of a Showgirl.""

	Gil Kaufman



	Mikaela Shiffrin's story of redemption is one of the greatest tales of Olympic glory at this year's Winter Games in Italy. The celebrated athlete with the most World Cup wins of any alpine skier in history, man or woman, locked down an elusive third gold medal this week when she won in the slalom, an emotional milestone she dedicated to her beloved dad, who passed away six years ago.

	In addition to some well-deserved champagne and her first ever espresso martini, the GOAT skier commemorated the moment by posting a pic from her winning run on Wednesday (Feb. 18) on Instagram along with a quote from Taylor Swift‘s The Life of a Showgirl track “Ruin the Friendship.” The song about regrets and risks not taken features the line “My advice is always ruin the friendship,” which Shiffrin included in the caption, catching the eye of fellow champion Swift.


	In the comments, Swift responded “HISTORIC,” along with three golden medal emoji. The quote was apt considering that after her win — her first medal since scoring a silver in the combined at the 2018 games in Pyeongchang following an 0-8 string of loses at the Winter Games — Shiffrin talked about pushing away the criticism and keeping her eyes on the prize. 


	“It's been so long that I've felt tired of questions that don't feel like they line up with the reality of our sport,” she said after scoring gold. “And in order to do this today, I kind of needed to accept the possibility that those questions would keep coming. It was like, just don't resist it. Just live in my own moment.”

	











	Later, Shiffrin reposted the image on her Story, along with a snippet of the song and, a few slides later, another repost of the original image with her shocked response to the Swift shoutout, which read, “Ummmm,” followed by a series of starstruck and welling eyes emoji. 


	It's not the first time Shiffrin has fangirled about Swift. She and her U.S. Ski teammates attended a Denver Eras Tour show in July 2023. Swift has also been busy from afar supporting the American athletes, narrating a promo video introducing the U.S. figure skaters — glorious gold medal winner Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito — and sending a message of support to all the athletes before last week's opening ceremony.


	She also got into the conversation after gold medal winning skier Breezy Johnson got engaged on the slopes at the games, where fiancé Connor Watkins was waiting at the finish line of the Super-G race with an engagement ring in a wooden box engraved with one of Johnson's favorite Swift lyrics. 


	The engraving from Swift's The Tortured Poets Department song “The Alchemy” read: “Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?” Swift, as she does, responded with a quote from another lyric from the song in the replies, writing, “Where's the trophy? He just comes running over to me,” along with “CONGRATULATIONS!” And now, it seems, according to Johnson, the singer is absolutely invited to the wedding, if she can make it. Gold all around.

You'll be sorely disappointed if you pick up Wuthering Heights after this. Emily Brontë's 1847 novel is a slow read with an out-of-time atmosphere, really one of the most virginal and repressed romance stories of all time. That's not something I picked up on myself as a child, but reading as an adult, you're like, All this drama—aren't they even going to make out?

Emerald Fennell's new film rendition—officially titled “Wuthering Heights” in scare quotes—drags, too, which is surprising, since her adaptation retells the story with fanfic gusto by making its emotional subtext as explicit and viscous as possible. The unconsummated love and undying obsession between Catherine Earnshaw (Margot Robbie) and her unruly adopted brother Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi)? Well, they're grown and fucking. The novel's heavy psychosexual undertones and implied intergenerational trauma? It's right out there in the open, wearing bondage gear. It's not a bad idea. Fennell's approach opens up an endless well of drama and symbolism, which she plumbs for an imaginative and overwrought movie with the sumptuous swag of high period drama and the garish flair of Melania Trump's Christmas.

In an era of instant gratification and few taboos, how to represent an antique story so entirely conditioned on denial and restraint? Fennell's screenplay strips out the story-within-a-story structure, sidelines major characters, and simplifies the multi-generational plot—all regular book adaptation stuff. These also happen to be the distinct formal characteristics of Wuthering Heights, qualities that make it a peculiar, multifaceted historical novel and not a more straightforward bodice ripper with shades of the step-siblings on PornHub. The first time Catherine and Heathcliff almost hook up on screen is legitimately crazy hot, and it sets a high bar for their would-be physical chemistry that nothing in the next hour-plus will ever touch. “Wuthering Heights” is tediously long, and the acting is not strong enough to carry this outright irrational love story, even if it does kind of make more sense now that they're finally getting some.

Thank God for Catherine's faithful servant Nelly (Hong Chau), who, even with a small role in the film's plot, is the only actor here with a meaningful grasp of emotional subtlety. These star-crossed romantic leads are tragically miscast: Robbie's authentically wholesome aspect suits the role of a grown-up little Catherine, but as Cathy, the bitter and unpredictable adult, she's missing the character's volatile psychic wrongness, what the critic Elizabeth Hardwick referred to as “the charm of a wayward schizophrenic girl.” Complaining she's too old for the part is a distraction from Elordi, the real problem here. Elordi is passable in his grungy younger iteration and ludicrous as the adult Heathcliff, back from his glow-up like a looksmaxxing skincare influencer wearing a cunty little earring. With the beard shaved, it's suddenly apparent he doesn't have enough facial expressions to carry enduring torment and eternal vengeance—he barely even looks mad.

And like Fennell's Saltburn, “Wuthering Heights” spends way too long being decorative, stranding us in the decadent scenery and blood-red walls at moments when another director would have sought stronger performances or more interesting camerawork. The drama is dull and unconvincing, and then you have to laugh: Past Wuthering Heights adaptations are rarely much fun (“Take care not to smile at any part of it,” after all), but in service of unsettling the vibe, Fennell gets very silly with it. We are aware that Cathy is aware that her jewelry is comically huge. To explain the plush sets, the neighboring Linton family becomes velvet manufacturing royalty. Heathcliff's chest is so manly that it's constantly filling the screen. And in one of Fennell's wildest edits, pure-hearted girl next door Isabella Linton (Alison Oliver) becomes a scary-horny savant à la Emma Stone in Poor Things, with a fabulous voodoo dollhouse and a questionably consensual taste for S&M. She's so annoying and she's my favorite part—the only stuff in the movie that feels as delightfully perverse as I imagine it would be to witness the Victorian mind behold any of this.

Fennell's grown-up fairy tale aspires to the frilly pop auteurism of Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette or Greta Gerwig's Barbie, and in “Chains of Love,” Charli XCX's soundtrack has already spawned a hit with cool-girl credentials. But Marie and Barbie are supposed to be shallow—that's their whole thing. Wuthering Heights has layers, and with so much visual titillation you're likely to miss the genuinely gothic details, like how Brontë's classic image of the ghost at the window is foreshadowed by young Heathcliff's view into Catherine's childhood bedroom. Later in life, it's Heathcliff who breaks a window to catch Cathy's attention; at home with her rich husband Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif), she shares a double bedroom suite like Norma Desmond's in Sunset Boulevard and thus is never seen to be truly at home with anyone. She's focused on Heathcliff, though, and other feelings barely register. Beginning from a text so discreet that the reader feels implicated in its conspiracy, “Wuthering Heights” works so hard to outperform it that even fatal attraction fails to hold interest.

I've known that there would be another Hilary Duff album since that Halloween when Kendall and Kylie Jenner dressed up as characters from The Lizzie McGuire Movie. Actually, I knew the year before, when I was at a wedding and the dancefloor was mobbed the second “What Dreams Are Made Of” came on. Last year they made a Freaky Friday sequel and Jesse McCartney toured with the Jonas Brothers and I said, “What about Hilary?” Nostalgia is a barrelling train overrun with Zillennials weaned on the Disney Channel. We're starved for comfort. Duff was bound to get on board.

It's nice to like something so wholesome. Duff is among the purest surviving cultural relics of the McBling era, with a quarter-century career unblemished by any of the public stumbles that we've come to expect from the child stars we ruthlessly break into adulthood. Since her early days as the beloved middle school misfit Lizzie McGuire, up through her recent role as a searching thirtysomething on a short-lived How I Met Your Mother spin-off, she's been the ultimate girl next door. In the real world, Duff is a 38-year-old mom of four who's lived more than a decade of life since her last studio album. But on her new record, luck…or something, she's as familiar as ever. That's largely because this is music you've heard before: fizzy, centrist pop, precisely positioned at the crossroads of autobiography and universality.

The girl-next-door actress' close cousin, the relatable pop star, is a common character these days. She's hapless and horny and acting a fool over some loser who won't pay attention to her. The most prominent models of this type are women in their 20s, but her struggles are enduring, as evidenced by Duff's preoccupations on luck…: anxiety, jealousy, unfulfilled desire. “I want the part where you say goddamn,” she sings breathlessly on “Roommates,” a pining single about trying to stoke the embers of a long-term relationship, then details a fantasy (memory?) of giving the guy head in the back of a bar (Hilary!!). In the song's unvarnished lust and endearing self-consciousness, I hear echoes of the singer-songwriter-comic Audrey Hobert, of whom Duff is a fan. I definitely hear Taylor Swift, matriarch of the relatable pop stars—and not just because the song sounds like “Anti-Hero.”

luck… was co-written and produced by Matthew Koma, Duff's husband, whose best-known work is with Zedd (he co-wrote “Clarity”). He also collaborated with Duff on her last album, 2015's Breathe In. Breathe Out., which leaned into the ultra-processed dance music of the day. That record featured contributions from the Swedish pop heavyweights Tove Lo and Bloodshy, and was “a little clunky,” per Duff's own description. “It was a case of the label being like, ‘Go to Sweden and write with this person, everything's coming out of Sweden right now,'” she recalled.

Thankfully, both Duff and Koma have moved on from the thumping theatrics of the mid-2010s. luck… is less Zedd and more Carly Rae Jepsen, another former Koma collaborator, whose bright, princess-y vocal tone resembles Duff's. The album's base notes are chirpy synths and strummy acoustic pop, embellished with gated drum fills and swoopy strings—softer, pliable sounds that offer a more natural foundation for Duff. Still, her voice is a limiting factor here: She lacks fluidity and range, often seeming to sing individual notes rather than full phrases. This is especially detrimental when her lyrics already feel forced, like on “You From the Honeymoon,” where she parrots Tinashe while looking back on young love: “Your kinda freak matched my kinda freak.” The words sound like magnetic fridge poetry—jumbled and foreign in her mouth.

This is the first of her albums on which Duff is a credited co-writer on every song, and she seems to still be finding her footing as a lyricist. She auditions different voices: At times she's a painstaking wordsmith (the album's opening lines rhyme “apologist” with “psychologist”); at others she's a gal pal tossing off a bitchy text about her husband (“Future Tripping”) or fretting over an apparent rift with her sister (“We Don't Talk”). There are clunkers (“You calling me batshit's the fastest antibiotic/For thinking you're different this time”). There are inscrutable metaphors (I'm still not sure what the holey T-shirt in “Adult Size Medium” is all about). There is even, inexplicably, an entire chorus cribbed from a blink-182 song.

But there are also moments of bracing clarity—little reminders of how relatable pop stars got to be so popular in the first place. Despite its sparkly guitar and rhapsodic tone, “Tell Me That Won't Happen” is streaked with existential dread; its hook, “I'm worried that I've felt everything I'll ever feel,” is about as pithy an expression of the terror of getting older as I've heard. On “Roommates,” Duff pre-empts possible humiliation with humor: “We would laugh,” she sings to her partner, emphasis on we, if she tried to light a spark by “walking in in something sexy.” It's a joke, except it's not. There's something vital and deeply human in this vignette. Who hasn't felt unwanted? Who hasn't feared rejection? The rub, of course, is that Duff is beautiful, charming, successful, and desirable by any measure. This is the relatable pop star's trick: showing us ourselves in a rose-colored mirror.

Things get most interesting when the mirrors multiply. We see ourselves in Duff; Duff sees herself in another woman on “Mature,” luck…'s high mark. It's about recognizing yourself not as an individual but as a demographic—in this case, the sort of young, blonde woman that an older man habitually dates. Those familiar with Duff's biography may plot some of the coordinates here: Beginning when she was 16, Duff was in a long-term relationship with a musician nearly a decade her senior. She has demurred on the specifics, but the contours of the story are familiar all the same, given the post-#MeToo reckoning that's prompted many women to reassess their age-gap relationships. “If you can still be considered ‘mature for your age,' you are not an older person's equal,” Tavi Gevinson wrote in a poignant 2021 essay on the subject. “This observation can easily go from an act of respect to license for harm.”

Nostalgia can be a balm, but it can also be a smoke machine, obscuring that which is difficult to revisit. To her credit, Duff doesn't let it overtake the narrative. While album closer “Adult Size Medium” has the hallmarks of a triumphant retrospective—it's cavernous, sweeping in scope and sound, with callbacks to the golden days of youth and the blur of years gone by—it's mostly just raw material. The bridge is a literal checklist: “Try-hards, icons, Sunday mornings, Super Bowls, turn ons, tampons, edibles, and booty calls.” Duff doesn't try to mold it into a legacy. She actually sounds pretty ambivalent: “I remember it all/And I remember nothing.” Life has highs and lows, but mostly it has middles that we mostly forget. At what should be her curtain call, Duff admits that she's still trying to remember her lines. Who can relate?

							By 

	Emily Zemler



Stephen Colbert opened The Late Show by celebrating the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, noting that “finally someone, anyone” was being held accountable for their actions. 


	“Let's hear it for British justice,” Colbert said to cheers from the late-night show audience. “Which is better than American justice because it comes with frilly wigs.”


	Mountbatten-Windsor, the British royal formerly known as Prince Andrew before being stripped of his titles by his brother King Charles, was arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The arrest is related to recent revelations in the Epstein files that suggest Mountbatten-Windsor sent trade reports to Jeffrey Epstein in 2010, not to ongoing allegations of sexual misconduct.


	“Technically this arrest isn't about any charges of pedophilia,” Colbert noted. “U.K. authorities busted Andrew for ‘misconduct in public office.' Which is defined as ‘seriously willful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities of the public office held.' Which is not only not illegal in the United States, it was Trump's campaign slogan.”

	Colbert then recounted how “back here in the colonies” Donald Trump held the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace. “Which is kind of like the UN except instead of passing binding resolutions, you pass a greasy bag of money to Donald Trump,” Colbert quipped. 


	He noted that a seat on the board costs $1 billion in cash. “So the board works kind of like a strip club,” Colbert added. “Cash only and Donald Trump will never leave.” 

	











	Later in his monologue, Colbert recounted Barack Obama's recent comments about how aliens are real. When asked about the comments, Trump replied, “I don't know if they're real or not.” Before showing a photo of Trump with Epstein, Colbert remarked, “While Trump never talks about meeting aliens, we do know he's had close encounters with predators.”


	Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his titles by King Charles III in October following revelations about his relationship with Epstein. Earlier this month, the British monarch forced his brother to vacate his longtime home at Royal Lodge near Windsor Castle.

	The former prince has continually denied any wrongdoing; however, he was mentioned and pictured several times in the 3 million-plus pages of documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice recently. One of the mentions of Mountbatten-Windsor is a photograph of him with a woman who appears to be Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with him as a teenager.


	Giuffre was one of Epstein's most prominent accusers and also filed a high-profile sexual-assault lawsuit against Andrew, which was settled in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide last April.

	Her family released a statement following Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest. “At last, today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” her siblings said in a statement. “On behalf of our sister, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, we extend our gratitude to the U.K.'s Thames Valley Police for their investigation, and the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you.”


	While other countries are taking the Epstein scandal seriously, the U.S. has been mostly unaffected. The latest tranche of Epstein files released by the Justice Department has sent shockwaves through the international community. Foreign governments, businesses, universities, and cultural institutions are investigating those with ties to the notorious sex criminal. Powerful figures around the world have been forced to step down from influential positions amid revelations that they were a part of Epstein's network. Meanwhile Trump — a longtime friend of Epstein's whose name allegedly appears in the files over a million times — and other figures working within or tied to his administration seem to not only hang above the fray, but enjoy the protection of the American justice system.

Today's guest is Michael Shermer, founding publisher of Skeptic magazine and author of the new book Truth: What It Is, How to Find It, and Why It Still Matters.

Shermer explains how the release of the Epstein files has fueled conspiracy thinking, particularly through guilt by association and pattern seeking. He explains why ambiguous evidence invites overinterpretation, how skepticism differs from cynicism, and why the demand for total certainty often leads people away from truth rather than toward it.

The conversation also explores the broader collapse of trust in institutions after COVID-19, the role of influencers in amplifying conspiratorial narratives, and why scientific and historical denialism have found new audiences online.

 

The Reason Interview With Nick Gillespie goes deep with the artists, entrepreneurs, and scholars who are making the world a more libertarian—or at least a more interesting—place by championing free minds and free markets.

It's up to you whether AI makes you sharper or slowly dulls your brain, says Demis Hassabis.

In a Thursday interview with entrepreneur Varun Mayya on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit, the Google DeepMind CEO said that AI is just like the internet. People can use it to learn all kinds of topics, or use it in ways that ""degrade"" their thinking.

""With AI, if you use it in a lazy way, it will make you worse at critical thinking and so on,"" he said. ""But that's down to you as the individual. No one can help you do that.""

He added that people need to be smart and use these technologies in ways that enhance their thinking rather than dull it.

Hassabis cofounded DeepMind in 2010, which Google acquired in 2014. It merged with Google Brain in 2023 to form Google DeepMind, the lab behind tools such as Gemini and Nano Banana. The CEO and a DeepMind coworker, John Jumper, were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their work on protein structure prediction.

As AI gets incorporated into daily life, debates about its risks and rewards have intensified, with several tech leaders warning about the dangers of an overreliance on AI tools.

Earlier this week, tech billionaire Mark Cuban said that there are two types of people who use AI.

""There are generally 2 types of LLM users, those that use it to learn everything, and those that use it so they don't have to learn anything,"" Cuban said of large language models in an X post on Tuesday.

Cuban has previously said that AI models can't provide all the answers and are ""stupid"" but like ""a savant that remembers everything.""

At a June conference, the CEO of French AI lab Mistral said that a risk of using AI for everything is that humans will stop trying.

""The biggest risk with AI is not that it will outsmart us or become uncontrollable, but that it will make us too comfortable, too dependent, and ultimately too lazy to think or act for ourselves,"" Arthur Mensch said.

Mark Cuban says there are two types of people who use AI. Which one are you?

""There are generally 2 types of LLM users, those that use it to learn everything , and those that use it so they don't have to learn anything,"" Cuban said of large language models in an X post on Tuesday.

The ""Shark Tank"" billionaire has been bullish about AI and said that companies need to embrace it.

Cuban has said there will be ""two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else,"" Business Insider's James Faris previously reported. He's also said that AI models can't provide all the answers and are ""stupid"" but like ""a savant that remembers everything.""

Bill Gurley, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capitalist firm Benchmark, agrees ""100%"" with Cuban that there are two types of AI users.

""If you are on a custom career path where you aim to differentiate yourself, AI is 'jet fuel' - you can learn and soar faster than ever before,"" Gurley said on X in response to Cuban.

Or, it could have the opposite effect.

Even some of AI's biggest proponents have warned that the technology could make people lazy.

Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral AI, said last year that the biggest risk to humans posed by AI was ""deskilling"" and employees becoming lazier as they rely too heavily on the AI tools.

""You want people to continue learning,"" he said in an interview with The Times of London. ""Being able to synthesize information and criticize information is a core component to learning.""

Business Insider reached out to Cuban for additional comment.

President Donald Trump said Friday he will sign an executive order imposing a new 10% ""global tariff,"" hours after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping ""reciprocal"" import duties in a major rebuke of his trade agenda.

The new ""Section 122"" tariffs will come on top of the existing levies that remain intact following the high court's decision, Trump said as he raged at the ""deeply disappointing"" ruling during a White House press briefing.

""I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,"" Trump said.

The court's ruling invalidated the legal underpinning of many of the tariffs that Trump insists are essential for the U.S. economy and for rebuilding America's shrinking manufacturing base. 

Trump was adamant that he will find other ways to impose tariffs without Congress.

""I don't have to,"" Trump said when asked why he did not want to work with the legislative branch. ""I have the right to do tariffs.""

Trump's remarks vacillated between defiant and scathing. He even went after Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he nominated, after they voted with the majority in the 6-3 tariff ruling.""I think their decision was terrible,"" Trump said. ""I think it's an embarrassment to their families, you want to know the truth. The two of them."" 

He said he will sign an order later Friday imposing the new 10% duties, which are being invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Tariffs conjured using that statute can only last for 150 days, with any extension requiring congressional approval.

Asked at the press briefing about that time limit and about getting congressional buy-in, Trump said, ""We have the right to do pretty much what we want to do.""

Trump also declared that all the tariffs active under statutes known as Section 232 and Section 301 will remain ""in full force and effect.""

The Trump administration is also wielding Section 301 to launch several investigations into potentially unfair trade practices, which could result in additional new tariffs, Trump said.

The court's ruling struck down the tariffs Trump had invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. Trump's reciprocal tariffs and his drug-trafficking-related duties both hinged on that law.

The high court majority ruled Friday that IEEPA ""does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.""

Most of the U.S. tariff revenue generated last year came from the IEEPA duties.

Trump said Friday, ""other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected.""

""We'll take in more money, and we'll be a lot stronger for it,"" he said.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking at the Economic Club of Dallas shortly after Trump, said that the administration will replace the rejected IEEPA tariffs by leveraging a number of other existing tariff laws.

Doing so ""will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026,"" Bessent said. ""No one should expect that the tariff revenue will go down.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","What next for bitcoin as BTC nears $68,000 on fresh U.S.-Iran tensions","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/20/bitcoin-nears-usd68-000-gold-jumps-as-us-iran-tensions-return","Fri, 20 Feb 2026 06:54:33 GMT","

Crypto prices firmed during Asia's Friday morning session, with bitcoin climbing toward $68,000 after a choppy week that tested nerves across risk markets. 

The bounce was broad. XRP, Solana's SOL, DOGE$0.1010 and Cardano's ADA added upto 2% while ether lagged with a small dip, hovering below $2,000 as traders treated the level as a line that needs defending rather than celebrating.

The move had the feel of a relief rally more than a clean turn. After weeks of sharp swings, the market has started reacting in waves. A quick push higher draws in dip buyers, then selling appears as soon as price reaches a level where trapped holders can exit with lesser losses.

The difference this week is that each rebound has looked a little less fragile, suggesting forced selling is easing even if conviction buying has not returned in size.

Macro and geopolitics are doing their part to keep traders cautious. Gold steadied near $5,000 an ounce after two sessions of gains as investors priced rising Middle East risk. 

US President Donald Trump said Thursday he would allow 10 to 15 days for talks on a nuclear deal with Iran, while American forces reportedly built up in the region. That mix has supported haven demand and made it harder for risk assets to build momentum.

Wenny Cai, COO at SynFutures, said traders are recalibrating after the latest Federal Reserve minutes landed with a more hawkish edge, even if rate hikes are not the main expectation.

“Markets are digesting a more hawkish read-through from the latest Federal Reserve minutes,"" Cai said. ""The key shift isn't that hikes are suddenly the base case but that policymakers explicitly put them back on the table if inflation doesn't keep cooling, which effectively raises the hurdle for near-term easing.""

""That repricing has supported the dollar and tightened financial conditions at the margin, and you can feel it in risk. Equities have softened and the bid has moved back toward cash-like instruments and short-duration treasuries,"" she added.

FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich remained bearish in his framing of the broader backdrop. He said that given the market's prior dynamics and the more cautious tone in US stocks, the odds increase of a retest of local lows, pointing to levels last seen in the second half of 2024. 

On ether, he said the token is sitting on a long running support line that traces back to 2020 and lines up with the $2,000 area, but added that a true breakdown would need confirmation through a drop below recent lows around $1,500.

Under the surface, some indicators hint that big holders may be positioning to sell into strength. CryptoQuant says bitcoin inflows from large holders to Binance have reached record levels, a pattern that can precede heavier spot supply. 

Research shop K33 has compared current conditions to the later stages of the 2022 bear market that gave way to a long, grinding consolidation.

The result is a market that can bounce, but struggles to turn rebounds into a trend until spot demand grows louder than the sellers waiting at the next round number.

We all know ice is slippery. The physics behind it is more complex than you'd think

The reason we slip and slide on ice—a phenomenon central to figure skating, curling and other Winter Olympic events—is a centuries-old physics mystery that may have finally been cracked

Kendra Pierre-Louis: So we're out here today in lower Manhattan ice-skating. There are lots of kids skating around, dudes in hockey skates, and I'm here getting my inner Michelle Kwan on.

Pierre-Louis: If you really think about it, ice skating is just controlled slipping on ice. And whenever I go skating I can't help but think about the Winter Olympics, like the ones that are happening right now in Italy.

[CLIP:NBC Olympics commentator Sloane Martin discusses a mixed doubles curling competition on February 6: “Welcome inside the Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium. The U.S. mixed curling duo of Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse faces Team Canada in a matchup of unbeaten teams.”]

Pierre-Louis: And watching the Olympics I started to realize that if you really think about it, so many of the Winter Olympic sports are just about controlled slipping on ice, like bobsledding, the luge, curling. And yet scientists still don't really know why ice is slippery.

Sure, they have theories, like the pressure that we put on the ice maybe melts the ice, creating a thin watery layer. But scientists mostly agree that those theories aren't the full picture. The slipperiness of ice is actually still a mystery.

Paulina Rowińska: It's such a simple question that should have been answered centuries ago. But turns out all the stuff we learned in school, it's not fully correct, like with many, many other things.

Pierre-Louis: So today we're going to try to get some answers.

[CLIP: Theme music]

Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

There are at least three long-standing scientific theories that try to explain what makes ice slippery.

One of the oldest potential explanations dates back to the mid-1800s. It comes from a Scottish engineer named James Thomson, the older brother of famous physicist Lord Kelvin. And it involves the pressure that an object exerts on ice.

Rowińska: We know that the melting temperature is generally zero degrees Celsius, or 32 [degrees] Fahrenheit. And above that we have water; below that we have ice. But then pressure changes this—changes the properties of water.

Pierre-Louis: That is Paulina Rowińska, who we also heard at the top of the episode. She's a science journalist at Quanta Magazine, and she wrote an article in December that dug into the competing theories about why ice is slippery.

One of the hypotheses is that when we step onto the ice we put pressure on it, possibly lowering the melting point.

Rowińska: It's freezing out there, but we are getting closer to the melting temperature, so we might be melting, like, the surface layer of ice. And then it would get kind of a layer of water, and we all—like, water is slippery because it's a liquid, not a solid.

Pierre-Louis: Thomson came to this idea—that pressure on the ice basically creates a liquid layer—by studying glaciers, says Martin Müser.

Martin is a theoretical physicist in the Department of Materials Science at Saarland University.

Martin Müser: Glaciers, there is a heavy, heavy load that sits on the points of contact, and we know that when we are a little below the freezing point and we squeeze on ice, it becomes liquid. So [Thomson] argued that ice liquefies because of the pressure.

Pierre-Louis: But there's a problem with the pressure hypothesis—a big one, according to Daniel Bonn, a professor of physics at the University of Amsterdam.

Daniel Bonn: You would need 10 elephants resting on a single skate in order to get a decent amount of melting due to the pressure.

Pierre-Louis: Given that humans do not weigh as much as 10 elephants and we still manage to slip on ice, pressure alone does not seem to be why ice is slippery. So another theory emerged—and this one is especially popular among tribologists, scientists who study friction, lubrication and wear between moving surfaces.

Here's Martin again.

Müser: When you talk to a tribologist, in particular in the field of ice friction, they would come up with an explanation that was proposed by Frank Bowden. And he made a very neat experiment in the Alps where he put two identical skis—they had the same weight, the same surface finish, the same everything—but one conducted the heat inside a little better than the other one. And the one that conducted the heat less well was noticeably faster. So he said, “Look, what happens is because you have friction, you get heat. When [there's] heat, it melts the water, and the more heat is retained in the contact, the better it is. What happens is melting by frictional heating.”

Pierre-Louis: The idea that Bowden laid out with another physical chemist, T. P. Hughes, is that as we walk or skate on ice the friction we create heats and melts the surface. The concept is called frictional heating.

Daniel's team did experiments where they measured the friction on ice over a very large temperature range, from -100 degrees C, or -148 degrees F, to the freezing point of water.

Bonn: And then all kinds of interesting things happen. At very low temperatures—you probably don't want to be ice-skating anyways at -100 [degrees C], but it's actually impossible to ice-skate because the friction's very high. But then increasing the temperature from those very low temperatures the friction decreases extremely rapidly.

Pierre-Louis: Daniel and his colleagues found that the friction decreased until a temperature of roughly -7 degrees C, which is about 20 degrees F. But when they went closer to the melting point of ice the friction went up again.

Bonn: And this is something that you've experienced if you do ice-skating: if the ice is too warm, it actually becomes mushy and you leave traces in the ice, which—this is what we call plowing friction. And so we were very happy because we found that there was an optimum temperature for ice-skating, which is -7 degrees C. And so we went to our ice-skating rink, and they said, “We've known this for many decades.”

Pierre-Louis: These experiments reinforced for Daniel that the answer to what makes ice slippery lies beyond friction.

Sure, frictional heating might be responsible for melting the ice in our wake—that is, melting the ice behind us—but as we all know ice is slippery before you've even stepped on it, before friction has even occurred.

Bonn: As you know it's difficult to remain standing on the ice, even at zero speed, yeah? And so we don't think that the sliding itself has something to do with it.

Pierre-Louis: So if it's not pressure or friction, could ice be slippery because there's already a pre-melted layer of water on top?

Paulina says that's what a third hypothesis suggests.

Rowińska: So this has to do with how ice is structured. So, you know, ice is just water. So we have water molecules, but they are structured in a very ordered way, so they form bonds, and they—it's kind of like a nice lattice. That's why ice is solid. In a liquid, like liquid water, the molecules are kind of moving freely, and the structure is much looser.

So the idea is that close to the surface of ice the bonds are much weaker, so it's kind of like a boundary between two different materials. So it's not that the surface of ice is melting, but there is, like, a pre-melted layer of water on top of ice because of these structural differences between water and ice.

Pierre-Louis: This theory, like the pressure hypothesis, dates back to the 1800s. It was first proposed by English chemist and physicist Michael Faraday, Martin explains.

Müser: He basically saw that from putting two ice cubes together, and when they were fresh they would slide, but if he would wait a bit longer time, they were stuck. So a single, basically, interface would form, and he said, “Well, they are slippery because there must be a very thin lubricating layer.” And in the last 30, 40 years there was a lot of experimental effort proving the existence of this layer.

Pierre-Louis: But this theory, too, has holes. Among them, Martin says ...

Müser: Is this layer is relatively thin. And a very thin layer, even if the viscosity of the liquid is as small as that of water, would still give quite noticeable friction. [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: So let's recap: the three long-standing, leading hypotheses as to why ice is slippery are, one, the pressure applied by an object melts the ice, causing us to slip. Two, friction heats the ice, causing us to slip. And three, ice has a thin layer of pre-melted water that, again, causes us to slip.

On the one hand all of these theories have flaws. On the other hand computer simulations run by a group of European scientists a few years ago suggest that it might not be any one of these theories but all of them together.

You might be asking yourself, “Why does any of this matter? We know that ice is slippery. Does it really matter if we know why?” For Daniel, who is Dutch, it's actually a matter of national pride.

[CLIP: “Het Wilhelmus”]

Bonn: So the most important application for the Dutch is getting gold medals at speed skating, yeah? So we are the best speed skaters in the world, and we wanna keep it that way, and so we also want to have the fastest ice-skating track.

Pierre-Louis: But it also matters if you're not Dutch, he says.

Bonn: It's extremely interesting to think about why things are slippery because if you can understand what's happening there, you might be able to transfer that knowledge to other systems. And so things that are extremely slippery are extremely interesting because friction is responsible for an estimated 25 percent of the world energy consumption, yeah? And so the friction on ice is roughly an order of magnitude lower than friction on all other materials. And so if you could transpose that to all the moving parts in the world, you would save almost 25 percent of the world energy consumption.

Pierre-Louis: In other words ice is slipperier than most other materials. If scientists could figure out why, they might be able to mimic its behavior for use in other applications, like train tracks or motorized energy. This would allow us to lose less energy to friction, cutting energy usage in the process.

But let's come back to the eternal question of why ice is slippery. Last year a new theory surfaced.

Here's Paulina again.

Rowińska: So a new hypothesis came out last year in a paper, and the idea is: it's not really about melting. It's about, almost, like, a mechanical moving of atoms and molecules on the surface. So you know how when we step on ice, we kind of destroy the structure because there are some almost, like, electrostatic attraction—it's not exactly electrostatic, but it's, like, an attraction between molecules of our shoe and of ice. But then we keep going—we keep skiing; we keep walking—and we kind of keep attaching and disattaching these molecules.

So there is—they call it, like, an amorphous layer, so it's a layer that's liquidlike, but it's not really liquid because it's very thin. So it's not really water. It's not really ice. It's something in between.

Pierre-Louis: And it was Martin's team that published this theory in the journal Physical Review Letters.

He said that to understand the idea imagine stacking a bunch of egg cartons.

Müser: You put them perfectly in parallel, of course they're going to stick. But ice crystals will never be oriented that well; they will be misoriented. And very much to my surprise did I see that if I put two misaligned ice crystals in contact, even if they go extremely, extremely close to absolute zero, would I see amorphization right away.

Pierre-Louis: In other words instead of the crystalline structure one might expect ice to have, the surface structure starts to fall apart a little bit and become more disordered. It's not quite a solid anymore.

Müser: So we saw this very fast amorphization at 10 kelvin, and then we said, “Hey, now let's look what happens at -10 degrees C,” or in Fahrenheit—I don't know, roughly, it's about 10 [degrees] F or 12 [degrees] F. And we did see that the water also liquefied.

Pierre-Louis: To understand what Martin is getting at it helps to understand the difference between an ordered and a disordered solid.

An ordered solid is when all of the atoms are arranged in a precise, repeating 3D structure—think about a phalanx of Roman soldiers all lined up. Those structures can handle a lot of stress. For example, most metals are ordered structures.

A disordered solid, though, is more chaotic. The structures can be more random, less repeating.

When water becomes ice the outer layers are disordered; their structure looks like an open honeycomb. When we step on that surface with, say, a sneaker or ice skate we break up that structure, introducing stress into the system. As the ice works to adjust to that stress it creates an amorphous layer—something that's not quite liquid and not quite solid—that causes us to slip. Or at least that's the latest theory.

Müser: Sometimes people ask me if people accept the answer and I always say, “I hope not,” because any [Laughs], any good, nontrivial, correct scientific answer is met by a lot of skepticism.

Pierre-Louis: So the next time you go ice skating or wipe out on an icy sidewalk you'll at least have a clearer idea of why it might have happened.

The US Supreme Court on Friday overturned most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which could lead to more than $175 billion in tariff refunds for American companies. In a 6-3 decision, the justices ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—the law that the Trump administration used to justify many of his sweeping global tariffs—does not grant the president the power of taxation, and tariffs are a form of tax on imports.

Since the start of his second term, Trump has enacted a variety of tariffs targeting almost every country in the world. Most of these tariffs, including the chaotic so-called “reciprocal tariffs” last April that sought to tax even islands with only penguin populations, were authorized under IEEPA according to the administration's executive orders.

From the beginning, legal scholars have questioned whether IEEPA was meant to cover tariffs at all. In his opinion striking down the tariffs, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, “It is also telling that in IEEPA's half century of existence, no President has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.” Instead, the president “must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,” he wrote.

The Friday decision marks a significant and rare pushback from the Supreme Court against the Trump administration's volatile policies. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.

During a White House breakfast with governors Friday morning, Trump reportedly called the ruling a “disgrace” and said that he had a backup plan, according to CNN's Kaitlan Collins.

The Supreme Court's ruling doesn't cover all the tariffs announced in the past two years. For example, the sector-specific ones on steel, aluminum, and copper aren't impacted, because they were imposed under different presidential authorities.

“Small businesses are rightfully worried that the administration will respond to this legal defeat by simply reimposing the same tariff policy through other means,” Dan Anthony, executive director of the small business coalition We Pay the Tariffs, said in a statement. “Tariffs reimposed under different statutory approaches would have the same destructive effect.”

It won't be easy for the administration to replace those tariffs immediately, though, since other relevant policies often come with their own procedures and lengthy trade investigations before the tariffs can be ordered.

The ruling also kickstarts the process to refund a massive amount of tariffs collected in the past year. Economists have estimated that more than $175 billion has been collected since February 2025 under the IEEPA tariff policies. In January, anticipating the Supreme Court decision, Trump posted on Truth Social that the refund process “would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our country to pay.”

Many major companies, including Costco, Prada, BYD, and Goodyear, have filed lawsuits against the federal government to demand tariff refunds. Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services company run by the sons of US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, has also created ways for its clients to bet that the tariffs would be overturned, WIRED first reported in July 2025.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

If there's one bet that will always hit on one of the various “prediction markets” that are now apparently undergirding our economy, it's that America will take the wrong lesson from a crisis. One of the starkest bits of evidence for this truism is what remains changed in our society post-COVID lockdown. Our all-too-brief tastes of government-funded healthcare and meaningful unemployment relief came and went in the blink of an eye. Even as many restaurants have had to begrudgingly relinquish the “al fresco” dining areas they colonized on sidewalks and parking spaces back to the cars and pedestrians, another innovation of the early pandemic is still going frustratingly strong.

During their initial 2020 boom, QR code menus were an annoyance collectively suffered for the sake of public health. But today, long after the mask mandates were lifted and our government stopped even acknowledging the existence of a virus that's still very much around (and, uh… surging again), the QR code menu soldiers on like a barnacle that demands “you WILL pull out your phone on this date.” Despite some landmark victories in the arena of pushing back this and other loathed forms of technology creeping onto our plates, some restaurateurs and the consulting firms they overpay doggedly insist that customers love QR code menus; they just don't know it. Well, new research out of Washington State University posits that consumers want even more screen time baked into their dining experience.

The study, led by Soobin Seo of WSU's Carson College of Business, seems to suggest that restaurants could boost customer interest in and willingness to tell others about their establishment by adding augmented reality (AR) elements to their digital menus. The researchers' findings were published in the January edition of the International Journal of Hospitality Management, an industry scientific journal that has (to its credit) previously published research on the prevalence of method variance bias in research published in the hospitality industry's leading journals, IJHM included.

That said, there's no reason to doubt Seo and her team's work is anything but scientifically rigorous. The paper even notes numerous qualifying limitations to its studies and suggests further research would be prudent before widespread adoption by businesses. In fact, digging into the specifics of the team's methodology reveals several key elements that make it seem we may not necessarily be destined for a future of AR at Arby's after all.

First, the research's focus was entirely on the disclosure of a restaurant's farm-to-table (FTT) supply chain via AR and how that gimmick hypothetically affects a customer's likelihood to visit the restaurant and tell others about it.

A sample size of 243 study participants were shown one of three menu formats—AR, QR, and classic printed—then asked to imagine ordering the menu's signature burger dish and digest information about its many FTT ingredients in their menu's respective format. The participants were then asked about what they gleaned and asked to rate things like their menu's interactivity, their intention to visit the restaurant, and their intention to share what they learned about their imaginary burger with others. While those with the AR menus did indeed score higher when it came to their willingness to visit, remember, and yap about a theoretical restaurant, their average self-selected response was roughly only .5 higher than those with the QR and paper menus.

Additionally, the researchers studied how that same group of participants responded to the introduction of AR info about the FTT ingredients for familiar brands: McDonald's and Panera Bread. The responses indicated that AR menus gave McDonald's more of a bump in “perceived healthiness” than they did for Panera, but the research also noted that this was most likely due to respondents already viewing Panera as the healthier of the two.

“Consumers increasingly want transparency about where their food comes from, but the way that information is presented really matters,” Seo told WSU Insider. “Augmented reality allows restaurants to share that information in a more vivid, interactive, and engaging way.”

That may very well be true, but does vivid, interactive, and engaging info about the farm your Big Mac's tomatoes came from translate to customers opening their wallets, let alone restaurant owners hiring web developers? The Polymarket odds are still leaning “no.”
