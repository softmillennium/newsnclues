                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural is among the very few shows to reach 15 seasons, and among genre shows, it's outlasted everyone. As the Winchester brothers, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles were at the forefront of almost every episode, but they weren't alone. Through thick and thin, possessions, ghosts, wendigos, angels, and the Devil himself, Dean's Impala was right there, which is why, when it took center stage in 2011's “Baby.” When fans heard an entire episode would be shot inside the Impala, they didn't know quite what to expect, but the crew of Supernatural turned the old “bottle episode” gimmick into one of the best of the show's entire run. From the moment “Baby” starts, you know it's going to be a different type of episode. The usual recap begins in 1967 with footage of a Chevy plant assembling Impalas. It quickly jumps forward to the present, as Dean and Sam give it a good wash before a road trip to investigate another case, and that's when you notice every single camera shot is from the perspective of Baby. Granted, “grounded” is a bit of a stretch for an episode in which the term “were-pire” is used. The meat of the episode, Sam and Dean going on a road trip together, also gives the brothers time to reconnect and establish their relationship. For years, it was the bedrock of the series, but over 10 seasons, a lot went unsaid, and a gulf began to form between the two as fans had to endure more and more episodes that split them up, or worse, put them at odds. In “Baby,” the two get a chance to sit, talk, and reconnect. Goofs and bloopers from the series get more views than the dramatic moments on social media. Dean popping in Bob Seger's “Night Moves” and then singing along is one of those moments that makes fans wonder if Jensen did it between takes and they wrote it in, because it's exactly the type of offbeat, corny humor and brotherly chemistry the stars showed on screen for over a decade. or Stargate SG-1, but the unique hook of filming entirely in and around a car makes “Baby” look and feel different from every other episode. Supernatural may have outlasted the story it was trying to tell, but for any show to run for 15 seasons and develop a fervent fan base that, years after its conclusion, is still going strong. “Baby” is a perfect example of why the show became a hit and how self-imposed restrictions can lead to new levels of creative genius.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hours earlier, Trump accused former US president Barack Obama of revealing classified information on the issue. US President Donald Trump said Thursday he is ordering federal agencies to begin "identifying and releasing" government files related to UFOs and aliens, a move sought for decades by some Americans. While he did not specify whether classified documents would be released to the public, Trump added that the files should include "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters". "They're real, but I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in... Area 51," Obama told host Brian Tyler Cohen, referring to the top-secret US military facility in Nevada at the heart of many UFO conspiracy theories. Asked on Thursday about the comments, Trump told reporters that Obama "gave classified information, he is not supposed to be doing that". The president did not specify what part of Obama's remarks were classified, but claimed "he made a big mistake". For his own beliefs about aliens, Trump, 79, said "I don't know if they are real or not." No evidence has been produced of intelligent life beyond Earth. Interest in UFOs and UAP has been renewed in recent years as the US government probed numerous reports of seemingly supernatural aircraft, amid worries that adversaries could be testing highly advanced technologies. In March 2024, the Pentagon released a report saying it had no proof that UAP were alien technology, with many suspicious sightings turning out to be merely weather balloons, spy planes, satellites and other normal activity. France 24 is not responsible for the content of external websites.</p>

Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said "aliens are real" on a podcast last week. "He's not supposed to be doing that," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: "He made a big mistake."

Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. "There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States." In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: "I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire "lightning" round of questions on the podcast. There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time Trump's announcement comes after former President Barack Obama said in a podcast interview that aliens were real, later clarifying that he meant “the odds are good there's life out there.” Obama added in his clarification that he had seen “no evidence” of alien existence during his time in office. Obama was answering a series of questions during a "lightning round" of the podcast interview, when he was asked whether aliens were real. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States." The podcaster, Brian Tyler Cohen, then asked Obama what was the first question he had wanted answered when he took office. “He's not supposed to be doing that,” Trump added. Responding to Trump's directive Thursday night, Hegseth posted a screenshot of Trump's post with an alien emoji and a saluting emoji. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said in an interview on Fox News, "If he's going to release all of the X-Files, I think that could be a bipartisan thing," referring to the 1990s television show about FBI agents investigating — among other things — government conspiracies about aliens, which Fetterman said he "grew up watching." Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., thanked Trump, writing: "Looks like we are about to have a ton of hearings on this :)!" Raquel Coronell Uribe is a breaking news reporter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a Truth Social post, the president told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agency heads "to begin the process of identifying and releasing" any relevant files. Mr. Trump also called for the release of "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters." The Pentagon has tracked reports of what it calls unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, for decades. But the military said in a 2024 report there's no evidence that any government investigation into UAPs has confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life. Mr. Trump's announcement came just days after one of his predecessors, former President Barack Obama, made waves by telling a podcaster that aliens are real. He later clarified that he never saw evidence of contact between humans and extraterrestrial life during his time in the White House, and he primarily believes that extraterrestrial life is real because "statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there." Asked Thursday about Obama's comments, Mr. Trump told reporters he isn't sure whether or not aliens exist, but added that the former president "made a big mistake" and "gave classified information." "I may get him out of trouble by declassifying," Mr. Trump said. Pilots and military service members have reported spotting hundreds of unexplained objects in the sky, leading some lawmakers to press the Pentagon to investigate the phenomena and determine whether they pose a threat to safety or national security. Last year, one House Republican released a whistleblower video of a U.S. missile striking an unidentified glowing orb in the sky and bouncing off it. A large number of UAP reports can be explained by birds, balloons, drones, satellites and other everyday phenomena, according to the military's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. "It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology," the office said in a 2024 report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a Truth Social post, the president told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agency heads "to begin the process of identifying and releasing" any relevant files. Mr. Trump also called for the release of "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters." The Pentagon has tracked reports of what it calls unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, for decades. But the military said in a 2024 report there's no evidence that any government investigation into UAPs has confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life. Mr. Trump's announcement came just days after one of his predecessors, former President Barack Obama, made waves by telling a podcaster that aliens are real. He later clarified that he never saw evidence of contact between humans and extraterrestrial life during his time in the White House, and he primarily believes that extraterrestrial life is real because "statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there." Asked Thursday about Obama's comments, Mr. Trump told reporters he isn't sure whether or not aliens exist, but added that the former president "made a big mistake" and "gave classified information."
