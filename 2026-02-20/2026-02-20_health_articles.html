                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New insights into spontaneous coronary artery dissection – a devastating cause of heart attacks in young, healthy patients – were presented today at the EAPCI Summit 2026. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an emergency condition in which an inner layer of a coronary artery tears away from the outer layer. Blood collects in the space between the layers, causing a haematoma that reduces blood flow and can lead to a heart attack (myocardial infarction [MI]). Most patients affected by SCAD are healthy women with few traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. SCAD was considered rare but awareness of the condition is growing. SCAD still remains under-diagnosed and under-studied with few, if any, randomised trials conducted to define the most appropriate treatment approach. The mechanisms responsible for MIs after SCAD are very different from MIs caused by atherosclerosis and yet they are often treated in the same way. We created a national prospective registry to understand more about SCAD, treatment practices and outcomes, and to fill a gap in knowledge about patients from Eastern European countries." Professor Svetlana Apostolović, study presenter, University Clinical Center Nis, Serbia Intracoronary imaging techniques were used to establish the SCAD diagnosis in 26.0% of patients. The most frequent risk factors were hypertension (49.6%) and dyslipidaemia (46.3%). Overall, more than half of patients received dual antiplatelet therapy (58.5%) and low-molecular weight heparin (56.9%). During hospitalization, 23.6% of patients experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE: recurrent MI, hemodynamic instability, malignant arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, unplanned revascularisation or a cerebrovascular event) and 8.1% of all patients died. In the 30 days after hospitalization, 18.1% of patients experienced MACE and 0.8% died. Professor Apostolović summed up the findings: "SCAD was most common in non-pregnant young women and menopausal women, with intracoronary imaging found to be particularly useful in enabling accurate diagnosis. SCAD often resolved fully and stent implantation was not beneficial in the majority of patients. Further insights regarding epidemiology, presentation, management and outcomes will be provided by the ESC's ongoing large, multinational SCAD registry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the University of Seville have analyzed alterations in the cerebral cortex in people suffering from psychosis. Their findings show that psychosis does not follow a single trajectory, but rather its evolution depends on a complex interaction between brain development, symptoms, cognition and treatment. The authors therefore emphasize the need to adopt more personalised approaches that take individual differences into account in order to better understand the disease and optimize long-term therapeutic strategies. Psychosis is a set of symptoms—such as hallucinations and delusions—that are common in schizophrenia and involve a loss of contact with reality. From their first manifestation, known as the first psychotic episode, these symptoms can appear and evolve in very different ways between individuals, thus making schizophrenia a particularly complex disorder. The data also suggest that both neurons and other brain cells involved in inflammatory and immunological processes may play an important role in the disease. These structural differences tend to diminish during treatment, thereby suggesting that the rate of brain deterioration is attenuated by clinical intervention. However, more marked differences persist in people who receive higher doses of antipsychotic medication over time. This does not necessarily imply that the medication causes volume loss, but rather that those patients with more severe symptoms often require higher doses. The study also confirms that these patients show cognitive impairments from very early stages. Throughout follow-up, many individuals experienced improvement in both symptoms and cognition, thus suggesting that clinical stabilisation may be accompanied by partial recovery of these functions. However, this improvement is less pronounced in those who require higher-dose treatments. One of the most relevant aspects of the study is that the participants were evaluated over a period of ten years, thereby allowing an analysis of how the brain changes in the long term and how these changes are related to clinical symptoms and cognitive performance, including possible difficulties in attention, memory, or processing speed. Just as percentiles are used in paediatrics to identify deviations in weight or height, they can now be used to detect whether certain brain regions have atypical volumes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instead, she joined her colleagues on the picket line. It's a decision that the registered nurse (RN) doesn't take lightly. “It's something that we try to avoid at all costs…we always hope that we can settle something before having to strike.” Nurses have been bargaining with West Anaheim Medical Center for a year with no resolution to their concerns about patient care, safe staffing, and retention and recruitment, leaving RNs feeling like a strike was their only option. “[Unsafe staffing levels] means that patients aren't always getting optimal care,” Rivera said. For example, the Future of Nurse Unions Report 2025 found that: Low wages and high turnover have been pervasive issues, leading to unsafe staffing levels and concerns about patient safety in the nurse's view. Within 5 months, she was promoted to charge nurse and started training other nurses — and she was still a recent nursing school graduate. “Having competitive wages and benefits would allow us to retain our nurses rather than have them come in, get minimal experience, and move on to hospitals with better options.” The impact of low wages, high turnover, and unsafe staffing levels are visible at the bedside and have been linked to poor patient outcomes, including higher risk for preventable infections, falls, and deaths, according to Linda H Aiken, PhD, RN, professor and founding director at the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. These issues are at the root of nursing strikes. “Nurses don't strike unless they believe their patients are unsafe,” said Aiken. Despite persistent concerns, only two states — California and Oregon — have enacted minimum nurse staffing requirements. Aiken noted that the lack of policy guardrails in other states allows unsafe staffing levels to persist and is among the reasons that nurses continue to strike. The nurses at West Anaheim Medical Center went on strike in August 2025. Hospital systems have called nursing strikes “unnecessary [and] disruptive” and referred to the RNs requests as “extreme economic demands” that put patients at risk. But RNs do think about how strikes affect their patients; awareness of care disruptions is among the reasons that nursing strikes tend to be time-limited, according to Aiken. “Nurses only strike when it's absolutely necessary, and they try to keep the time out to a minimum,” Aiken told Medscape Medical News. In New York, nurses at Montefiore, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Mount Sinai Morningside and West were on strike for four weeks before reaching a tentative agreement. Nurses at NewYork-Presbyterian rejected a proposal because the hospital did not agree to safe staffing protections and remain on the picket lines. New contract agreements might mean an end to a strike, but RNs could end up back on the picket lines in the future. “Nurses are striking because we don't really have any standards,” Aiken said. “What we've reverted to is relying on unions where they exist [and] unions are providing the only guardrail…through their periodic renegotiations of contracts that involve staffing.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Preliminary results from an Italian registry describe the risk profile of women experiencing acute coronary syndromes and provide insights to improve management. These findings were presented today at the EAPCI Summit 2026, a new event organized by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), an association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Ischaemic heart disease is a common condition in which the coronary arteries become narrowed due to the build-up of fatty material. ACS shows important differences between men and women. Evidence suggests that although fewer women develop ACS than men, women are at greater risk of dying than men in the same age group. As explained by Doctor Francesca Napoli from IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, more needs to be done to understand ACS and its effective treatment in women: "There is underrepresentation of women with ACS in clinical trials, despite cardiovascular disease being a leading cause of mortality." She continued: "The Gender, Diversity and Inclusion–Acute Coronary Syndromes (GEDI–ACS) registry is the first multicentre, prospective Italian registry dedicated to studying ACS in women. We aim to integrate clinical, sex-specific, socioeconomic, psychosocial, biochemical and molecular data to capture a multidimensional perspective and ultimately advance more accurate diagnosis, equitable management and improved outcomes for women with ACS." The study is enrolling 100 consecutive women presenting with ACS (ST-segment elevation MI [STEMI], non-ST-segment elevation MI [NSTEMI]) or unstable angina) across multiple centres in Northern and Southern Italy: IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan), AOU Federico II Naples (Naples), Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Milan) and Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico (Milan), ensuring the inclusion of patients from different geographic, socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Over one-third (38.2%) had MI with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), a condition that occurs when patients have a heart attack without evidence of major blockages to the coronary arteries. Outcomes were favourable – no deaths, strokes or reinfarctions occurred during the first 30 days. Recurrent chest pain was experienced by 11.3% of patients. The common coexistence of ACS with noncardiac comorbidities, miscarriage and premature menopause provide insights into how we may be able to tailor preventive approaches. MINOCA was also a frequent finding and yet the best way to treat it is still unknown. The high levels of anxiety/depression and poor health literacy we found are important considerations as we try to support women with ACS more effectively to enhance recovery." The registry will continue with additional enrolment and follow-up. We will also combine clinical findings with genetic and molecular data to deepen our understanding of disease mechanisms and contribute to more precise and inclusive approaches to ACS care in women."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 18 of Aging-US on February 8, 2026, titled "Single-cell transcriptomics reveal intrinsic and systemic T cell aging in COVID-19 and HIV." In this study, co-first authors Alan Tomusiak from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the University of Southern California, and Sierra Lore from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the University of Copenhagen, together with corresponding author Eric Verdin from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, developed a new single-cell transcriptomic clock called T immune cell transcriptomic clock (Tictock) to measure aging in specific immune cells. Immune aging increases susceptibility to infection, cancer, and chronic inflammatory disease. Most aging clocks, used to measure it, rely on bulk measurements from mixed cell populations. As a result, they cannot determine whether age-related signals reflect shifts in cell proportions or true molecular aging within defined immune cells. To address this limitation, the research team used single-cell RNA sequencing, a method that measures gene expression in individual cells. They analyzed nearly two million immune cells from the blood of healthy adults to develop Tictock. This tool integrates automated classification of six canonical T cell subsets with cell-type specific age prediction models. This design enables the separation of systemic aging, reflected by changes in cell proportions, from intrinsic aging, which occurs within individual cells. When the team applied Tictock to patients with acute COVID-19, they found two clear effects. In people living with HIV who were receiving long-term antiretroviral therapy, T cell proportions remained largely stable. However, naïve CD8 T cells still showed signs of accelerated aging. The study also uncovered shared biological pathways linked to immune aging. The researchers also observed that older immune cells often had shorter average transcript lengths, a feature previously linked to aging. "Gene Ontology enrichment of 209 genes shared across six clock models identified common pathways including the cytosolic small ribosomal subunit, TNF receptor binding, and cytosolic ribosome components." By distinguishing systemic from cell-intrinsic immune aging, it provides a clearer understanding of how viral infections such as COVID-19 and HIV reshape immune function. This approach enables the study of immune aging at single-cell resolution and may support improved immune risk assessment in clinical and research settings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The university extends its warmest congratulations to Dr. Or Shemesh and his team at the Hebrew University School of Pharmacy on receiving this prestigious award. Their two-year research project, titled "The Infectious Etiology of Brain Disease," will pioneer a cross-disciplinary approach to understanding how pathogens contribute to some of the world's most challenging neurological conditions. The Shemesh Lab will investigate the role of infectious agents in a broad spectrum of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, PANDAS & PANS, ALS, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. While these conditions are often studied in isolation, Dr. Shemesh's team aims to identify shared pathways and pathogens that may drive brain pathology across all of them. "We are thrilled to receive this support, which allows us to compare disease mechanisms across seemingly different conditions," said Dr. Or Shemesh. "By uncovering the 'common denominator' pathogens that trigger brain inflammation and degeneration, as well as identifying disease-specific pathogens that may define a unique cranio-biome for each neurological disorder, we are taking the first step toward developing innovative treatments that could halt disease progression." Dr. Shemesh and his team have been members of AlzPI for many years to accelerate our understanding of infectious drivers of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases through global, multidisciplinary collaboration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of researchers led by Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons has been awarded an up to two-year $8.7 million contract from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to create genetic tests to speed the diagnosis of patients born with defects in the lymphatic system. "Discovering genes that cause lymphatic anomalies and using this information to create new clinical tests will not only accelerate the diagnosis of patients, but will also lead to improved treatments and, most importantly, save lives," says Carrie Shawber, PhD, associate professor of reproductive sciences at VP&S and principal investigator of the CLARUM (Comprehensive Lymphatic Anomaly Revealing and Understanding Genomics) project. Most people have heard about their lymph nodes, which are often inflamed during infections, but are less familiar with the rest of their lymphatic system. Sometimes called the "forgotten circulation," the lymphatic system is a network of vessels, ducts, and nodes that moves fluid throughout the body, ensuring that tissues maintain normal fluid levels and that fats, hormones, and immune cells reach their destinations. Defects in the lymphatic system can disturb the flow of this liquid (called lymph) and cause a variety of serious health problems, from trouble breathing caused by swelling around the lungs to increased vulnerability to severe infections. Approximately one in every 3,500 babies is born with a lymphatic defect and often requires intensive care soon after birth. Many people with lymphatic anomalies die from sepsis because they cannot mount an immune response to infections. Lymphatic diseases are often confused with other conditions, and it can take years for some patients to receive the correct diagnosis. Diagnosis can be sped up by looking for genetic mutations that are known to cause lymphatic diseases. But many genetic causes are yet to be identified, and most cases cannot be attributed to a known genetic cause. The goal of CLARUM is to develop new genetic tests that can identify more cases of congenital lymphatic disease and can be requested by doctors' offices across the country. "A problem with genetic testing today is that patients in rural America don't have access to these tests, and so they're not diagnosed or treated appropriately," Shawber says. Shawber expects that the CLARUM team will find 15 or more new genetic mutations that cause lymphatic disease and increase the predictive value of genetic testing. "Since the first genes that cause lymphatic disease were identified about a decade ago, three therapies have been identified and those patients are responding very well to the treatments and seeing significant improvements in their quality of life," says Shawber. "Genetics research has changed the landscape of treatment for lymphatic anomalies, but it hasn't gone far enough yet to help the majority of patients. So there is a desperate need to identify more genes." Congenital lymphatic anomalies are rare, and no single medical center sees enough cases to permit robust gene discovery. CLARUM brings together six academic medical centers that will combine forces to look for genes in 2,000 patients. Columbia and CHOP will develop, in parallel, two comprehensive genetic panels to screen specimens generated by standard clinical care. The other parts of project will focus on increasing the diagnostic yield of these genetic panels by identifying novel mutations in known and unknown genes. Arkansas Children's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Columbia, and City St. George's University of London will contribute unique cases, and Broad will apply its advanced genetic bioinformatic pipeline to identify novel genes. NYU Langone, City St. George's, and Columbia will develop cell- and zebrafish-based models to rapidly screen VUS's to determine if they are disease-causing. The Columbia team will also work with collaborators at Broad on developing a robust and reproducible method to detect mosaic mutations before birth, which may prevent fetuses with cystic lymphatic malformations from being treated prior to receiving a genetic diagnosis with potentially ineffective therapies that carry the risk of side effects. "It's taken decades for us to find and evaluate the mutations that enabled current genetic tests," says Shawber. "With the help of ARPA-H's LIGHT Program, we can make a substantial leap forward."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can cause certain types of cancer or autoimmune diseases, but how the body controls this common viral infection is largely unknown. To do this, they evaluated genome sequencing data, which is actually intended for characterizing the human genome, in a new way. There were also indications of new genes that play key roles in EBV immunity. Their findings have now been published in the renowned journal Nature. EBV infection is a risk factor for various types of cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). After infection, which commonly occurs in childhood, EBV remains hidden in certain white blood cells, the B memory cells, for life. The virus is usually inactive in these cells and, in this so-called latency phase, evades removal by the immune system. The virus is reactivated spontaneously, but also as a result of stress, and then switches to an active state. "Despite its high relevance, very little is known about how exactly the immune system controls lifelong EBV infection and how this contributes to the development of diseases such as cancer or autoimmune diseases. This is largely due to a lack of suitable data-for example, large population-based studies such as biobanks lack direct measurements of EBV viral load." "To overcome these limitations, we established that the amount of EBV in human blood can be estimated using genome sequencing data. We were able to demonstrate this with laboratory tests. Since large biobanks, such as the UK Biobank, have collected genome sequencing data for all participants, we now have a measure with which the EBV viral load can be estimated on a large scale," says Schmidt. First, the authors investigated which non-genetic factors influence EBV viral load. Smoking is a risk factor for several EBV-associated diseases, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. "Our data indicate that current smoking in particular increases EBV viral load. Other groups have already shown that current smoking has an influence on the innate immune system. Another interesting observation was a correlation between the viral load and the season in which the sample was taken – on average, more EBV sequences were found in winter and fewer in summer. This section of our genome contains blueprints for special proteins that help the immune system recognize germs such as viruses or bacteria, making this DNA region a key player in the immune system. In addition to the MHC locus, associations were found in 27 regions of DNA outside the MHC that were largely consistent across both biobanks. Among the genes located in these regions are some with known functions in the immune system that could play a plausible role in controlling EBV viral load, but also a large number of new candidates. Analyses of genetic overlap with EBV-associated diseases also led to new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms involved in MS and identified new diseases for which EBV could be pathophysiologically relevant, such as type 1 diabetes. In a broader sense, our study illustrates how by-products of human genome sequencing data can be used to investigate persistent viral infections."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pioneering personalized mRNA vaccine study reveals lasting immune responses in triple-negative breast cancer, offering early signals that tailored cancer vaccination may help improve long-term outcomes pending larger trials. Study: Individualized mRNA vaccines evoke durable T cell immunity in adjuvant TNBC. In a recent study published in the journal Nature, researchers evaluated the feasibility, safety, immunogenicity, and long-term clinical outcomes of an individualized neoantigen messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine in patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC lacks expression of estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which limits eligibility for targeted hormonal or HER2-directed therapies. Recurrence risk peaks within the first three years after diagnosis, particularly among high-risk patients. Advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled the identification of tumor-specific somatic mutations known as neoantigens, which can serve as personalized vaccine targets. mRNA vaccine platforms offer a rapid and adaptable strategy to stimulate immune responses against tumor-specific mutations. However, long-term immune durability and demonstrated clinical benefit remain uncertain, necessitating further investigation into whether personalized vaccination can prevent relapse in high-risk TNBC populations. This first-in-human exploratory clinical trial enrolled patients with early-stage TNBC within one year of completing standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Tumor-specific somatic mutations were identified through next-generation sequencing of resected tumor tissue and selected as individualized vaccine targets. Personalized vaccines were manufactured by encoding up to 20 patient-specific cancer mutations into two RNA-lipoplex (RNA-LPX) mRNA molecules formulated in liposomal nanoparticles for intravenous administration. This design aimed to enhance antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II pathways to stimulate both cytotoxic and helper T cell responses. Participants received eight intravenous doses over nine weeks, consisting of six weekly and two biweekly administrations. Peripheral blood samples were collected at baseline and after vaccination to evaluate immune responses. Immune responses were assessed using interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays. Additional immunologic analyses included human leukocyte antigen multimer staining, intracellular cytokine profiling, bulk and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing, and transcriptomic phenotyping. All 14 evaluable patients generated vaccine-induced or amplified T cell responses against at least one personalized neoantigen. Most individuals mounted responses against multiple mutations, and nine patients developed T cell responses targeting five or more neoantigens, indicating broad immune activation. High-magnitude immune responses were detected in 86% of patients via ex vivo interferon gamma ELISpot assays, with several individuals demonstrating 2,000 to 4,000 interferon gamma-producing cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Among the evaluated neoantigens, 82.9% elicited measurable immune responses that were not detectable before vaccination. Immunogenic targets arose from insertions, deletions, and single-nucleotide variants. This distribution reflects engagement of helper and cytotoxic T cell compartments, although the trial was not designed to establish a direct causal link between immune responses and clinical outcomes. Multimer staining confirmed rapid expansion of mutation-specific CD8 positive T cells during vaccination. In one case, 10.3% of circulating CD8 positive T cells recognized a single mutation at treatment completion, with more than 3% remaining detectable two years later without booster vaccination. Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that many vaccine-induced T cells differentiated into late-stage cytotoxic effector memory CD45RA-expressing cells capable of rapid tumor cell killing. Concurrently, a subset developed into stem cell-like memory T cells expressing T cell factor 1 and interleukin 7 receptor alpha, markers associated with long-term immune regeneration and potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. These findings suggest durable immunologic memory capable of sustained tumor surveillance based on mechanistic observations, though not definitively linked to clinical relapse prevention. One additional patient remained relapse-free until death from unrelated causes. Among these cases, one patient exhibited the weakest vaccine-induced immune response but subsequently achieved a complete response lasting 15 months following anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy combined with sequential chemotherapy. Another recurrence arose from a genetically distinct primary tumor not represented in the vaccine design. The third case demonstrated tumor immune escape associated with downregulation and loss of MHC class I expression, impairing antigen presentation but not fully neutralizing circulating T cell responses. This study demonstrates that personalized mRNA neoantigen vaccines are feasible, safe, and highly immunogenic in patients with early-stage TNBC. Vaccination induced long-lasting and functional T cell responses that persisted for years without booster doses. Although most participants remained relapse-free during extended follow-up, the small sample size and absence of a randomized control group limit definitive conclusions regarding clinical efficacy. Overall, these findings position individualized mRNA neoantigen vaccination as a promising adjuvant strategy in high-risk TNBC. Larger, controlled clinical trials are required to determine its impact on long-term relapse-free survival and overall survival in broader breast cancer populations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large, multi-center study recently published online in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (JNCCN) provides new insight into the long-term health effects of contemporary chemotherapy regimens used to treat testicular cancer, highlighting differences in renal function, cardiovascular risk, and the overall burden of chronic health conditions among survivors. It's expected these study findings will be used to inform national follow-up guidelines for cisplatin-treated testicular cancer survivors in the future. However, as survival has improved, attention has increasingly shifted to the long-term health consequences faced by testicular cancer survivors who may live for many decades after completing treatment. The study assessed a broad range of adverse health outcomes and quantified survivors' cumulative burden of morbidity more than a decade after treatment. "Our findings show that while today's standard chemotherapy regimens are highly effective at curing testicular cancer, they're associated with meaningful long-term health risks that appear to differ by treatment approach," said Sarah L. Kerns, PhD, MPH, corresponding author and associate professor of radiation oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The study (https://doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2025.7120) found that testicular cancer survivors treated with four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EPx4) had significantly higher odds of renal impairment, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy compared with those treated with three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEPx3). Nearly 41% of all survivors in the study showed some degree of at least mild renal dysfunction, which was strongly associated with cumulative cisplatin dose. Importantly, reduced renal function was linked to higher risks of developing hypertension, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease later in life - conditions that can significantly impact long-term quality of life and survival. "This study demonstrates for the first time that even mild reductions in renal function after chemotherapy can signal elevated later cardiovascular risk in testicular cancer survivors," said Lois B. Travis, MD, ScD, senior author and the Lawrence H. Einhorn Professor of Cancer Research at the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center. "These findings underscore the need for lifelong monitoring of both renal and cardiovascular health in this young survivor population." Researchers also found that the overall cumulative burden of morbidity - a measure that captures both the number and severity of chronic health conditions - was similar between EPx4 and BEPx3, but significantly worse among survivors who received more intensive regimens. Worse morbidity scores were closely linked to poorer self-reported physical health, reinforcing the clinical relevance of these long-term effects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Can fragments of tumor DNA in the blood predict whether chemotherapy will be effective? Researchers at the Princess Máxima Center investigated this question together with experts from Italy and Slovakia. They focused specifically on young adults with germ cell tumors for whom standard chemotherapy doesn't work well. Blood samples from young adults treated at hospitals in Italy and Slovakia were analyzed before and during chemotherapy. They identified specific changes in the genetic material that came from cancer cells resistant to standard chemotherapy. The team then looked at whether these characteristics were linked with how long the cancer stayed away after treatment in young adults with germ cell tumors. The findings are promising: a blood test could potentially help doctors make more personalized decisions about whether initiating this intensive therapy is worthwhile, particularly in what may be the patient's final phase of life. Further research is required before this approach can be implemented in clinical practice. The next step is to confirm these findings in a larger group of people, including blood samples from children with germ cell tumors. This research was made possible by Stichting Kinderen Kankervrij (KiKa) and the Italian Ministry of Health. In the Netherlands, approximately 30 children are diagnosed with a germ cell tumor each year, as well as around 850 young men with testicular germ cell tumors. Despite treatment with high-dose chemotherapy, half of this group ultimately dies. For this reason, researchers from the Looijenga group at the Máxima Center worked with scientists from the Italian IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori "Dino Amadori" to study biomarkers that could predict clinical response and treatment outcome. Blood samples from 69 patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and 26 patients receiving standard chemotherapy were analyzed using shallow whole genome sequencing. These results were compared with an existing biomarker, miR‑371a‑3p. Analysis of cfDNA provides valuable prognostic information in germ cell tumors that do not respond adequately to, or recur after, standard chemotherapy. These minimally invasive biomarkers may refine risk stratification and support decision-making about whether to initiate a final, highly intensive course of chemotherapy in relapsed germ cell tumors. The researchers now plan to validate these results in a larger cohort of adolescents and children with germ cell tumors, within an international collaboration. If the follow-up study confirms the findings, clinicians may be able to use them in practice to determine the most appropriate treatment for patients with germ cell tumors. Researchers will also be able to more effectively explore alternative treatments that are both more effective and associated with fewer side effects.
