In 2026, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the daily deluge of stupidity. So much of it would be laughable if it wasn't also ruinous, which makes the whole endeavor that much more exhausting. The luckiest among us endure these quotidian absurdities indirectly, via news stories and social media feeds, their consequences delayed until sometime in the future. But for the good folks cruelly targeted by ICE and the skilled workers inexcusably pushed out by bots, I can only imagine it feels like being trapped in a vice of vacuity, where an unbearable pressure of preposterous origins grows tighter with every lie accepted as truth, every known fraudster anointed as a power broker, and every imagined reality treated as if it exists within the bounds of reason. Related Stories Tributes Pour in for Eric Dane: Sam Levinson, ‘Grey's Anatomy' Alumni, I AM ALS, and Many More Mourn Loss of Star ‘Strip Law' Review: Adam Scott's Chaotic Animated Netflix Series Is as Deliriously Distracting as Sin City Marco Bellocchio‘s six-episode Italian-language drama is a living nightmare of the past that doubles as an agonizing manifestation of the present — a potent reminder that widespread stupidity isn't confined to a single time or place. In telling the true story of Enzo Tortura — a beloved Italian TV host (played here by Fabrizio Gifuni) who, in 1985, was baselessly convicted of peddling cocaine for the mafia — “Portobello” plays out chronologically, starting with an hour-plus appreciation of Enzo's biggest success: the Italian variety program of the same name. Airing on Rai 2 (Radio Television Italy), “Portobello” features segments with inventors, musicians, and a pet parrot. Auditions include a woman who can cry on cue, clowns looking to start a circus for the elderly, and an illusionist specializing in building a house of cards (the latter of which “Portobello” returns to as a blunt, insufficient metaphor for Enzo's precarious court case). “What's wrong with feel-good stories?” Enzo poses to a reporter. “I'm not asking you, [but] I'd like to ask all these snobs, all these people who judge my show as provincial tear-jerking fluff.” The fluff, after all, is selling: Ratings are sky-high, and the network wants to renew “Portobello” for an extended run. But outside the comforting confines of a TV set, the government is cracking down on crime — or they're trying to. Just as they want to escape into a feel-good show every night, they want arrests, convictions, and security every day — the perfect conditions for paranoia to run rampant. Giovanni Pandico (played by Lino Musella, who HBO subscribers may recognize from “Gomorrah” and “My Brilliant Friend”) sees the dominos start to fall first-hand. Sentenced to multiple life sentences for multiple murders, the low-level Camorra member fancies himself as someone well above his station. His claim to fame is serving as a typist for a Camorra boss nicknamed “The Professor,” but facts don't matter to Giovanni. Despite his character's transparency, Musella's performance is mesmerizing. He so firmly believes his own lies — and so clearly enjoys telling them — that you can't wait to see what he'll come up with next. One is a serial killer, the other an Italian Mr. Rogers. But Giovanni watches “Portobello,” too, and he builds a grudge against Enzo for insults and slights that exist solely in his head. Watching his resentment build is hilarious up until the moment it's taken seriously. By the time Giovanni gets the chance to sour Enzo's good name, there's no question that he'll seize it. From there, the series largely lives in Enzo's head, stretching his increasingly infuriated perspective to a nearly intolerable degree. He knows the charges against him aren't true and believes the lack of evidence will clear his name. The convicted criminals accusing him of dealing drugs aren't expected to prove their claims. Instead, Enzo is expected to prove that their claims can't be true. It would be like if you walked into a police station and said, “This man killed my brother,” and they threw the man in jail without even asking if you had a brother to begin with. Whether it does (or did, given the series is based on Tortura's memoir) is a question “Portobello” wisely leaves hanging. At times in “Portobello,” it feels like that “someone” is us. The series' middle stretch contains plenty of redundancies, especially in the courtroom scenes, and witnessing so much needless torment is tough to endure when it exists off-screen, too. Whereas the original variety show was a delightful escape during a difficult time, HBO's “Portobello” doubles down on that difficulty. Warnings about considering con-men and their bad-faith contentions are important, of course, they're just also all too familiar.

If the philosophy of Guillermo del Toro‘s take on “Frankenstein” can be summed up in one line, it comes at the point in del Toro‘s film where Jacob Elordi's creature says to his creator, Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac), “I'm not something, I'm someone.” Long before the line was enshrined as a tag line on Netflix billboards and posters promoting “Frankenstein,” the film's makers looked to it as a guiding principle for their work. That's particularly true of the Academy Award-nominated sound team that was tasked with bringing Frankenstein's creature — not monster in del Toro's empathetic vision — to life. Related Stories ‘Strip Law' Review: Adam Scott's Chaotic Animated Netflix Series Is as Deliriously Distracting as Sin City ‘Zootopia 2': The Pawbert Twist, Andy Samberg, and the Big Last Minute Fix That meant blending Elordi's voice (both from production sound and extensive ADR work) with various animal noises and other sounds in a carefully calibrated balance that shifted throughout the film to subtly chart the creature's developing humanity. Working out of Sound Dogs in Toronto, Robitaille collaborated with Company 3 re-recording mixer Christian Cooke to create layer upon layer of tracks that used sound as a storytelling and character-building tool Appropriately, the “Frankenstein” sound team was at their most aggressive in these early moments. “In the beginning, we don't know who this is or where it came from,” Cooke said. “Chris had everything under a fader so he could creep the creature sounds in when he wanted to without it becoming really noticeable,” Robitaille said. “It would have been inelegant if he were just a normal man all the time and then the monster came out every time he roared.” “We were hesitant to alter Jacob's voice too much because it's really rich and full,” Robitaille said. “He had a lot to offer before we did anything, so we wanted to stay hands-off for as much of the movie as possible.” Using the high-res ADR and production sound mixer Greg Chapman's recordings of Elordi's performance, Robitaille gave Cooke and re-recording mixer Brad Zoern two different subsonic booster tracks to utilize. “That way Chris always had two options for where he was going to reach for those subsonic frequencies, just to add a bit of warmth where he felt like it was necessary.” “There was a lot of horse vocalization in the supplementary layers. “Chris did a brilliant job of tapering it back and tucking the sounds in to make sure that Jacob was there more than anything else, because his performance was breathtaking. The raw ingredients they created were incredible, and we just hung a lot of embellishment on it.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPDATED: Grey's Anatomy has lost one of its own. Eric Dane, one of the venerable ABC medical drama's most popular cast members, died Feb. 19 at the age of 53 after battle with ALS. The characters' presence has remained on the show, as Seattle Grace Mercy West was subsequently renamed Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in their memory. 'Euphoria' Creator Sam Levinson Pays Tribute To "Dear Friend" Eric Dane: "I'm Heartbroken" Eric Dane Tributes: Selma Blair, Ashton Kutcher, Paul Walter Hauser & More React To 'Euphoria' Star's Death “You'd see it effortlessly shine from him on the set of Grey's as well as when he was with Rebecca and the girls. During filming he'd get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you! Fellow veteran Grey's Anatomy cast member Kevin McKidd, who co-starred alongside Dane for four seasons, posted a photo of Dane from his time on the show with the caption, “Rest In Peace Buddy…” Similarly, original cast member James Pickens Jr., who was on Grey's for Dane's entire tenure, posted a tribute photo with the message “Rest In Peace.” Another OG Grey's star, Patrick Dempsey, opted to honor his former colleague by posting a clip from Dane's September video in support of ALS research, in which he says, “I'm Eric. Dempsey shared memories about Dane, including his final days, on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show Friday morning. Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes, speaking on behalf of her company Shondaland, which produces the show, called Dane “a beloved member of the Shondaland and Grey's Anatomy families.” “He was truly a gifted actor whose portrayal of Dr. Mark Sloan left an indelible mark on the series and on audiences around the world,” she wrote in a post next to photos of her and Dane through the years. Shondaland posted a moving “Celebrating Eric Dane” montage of some of his most memorable moments on Grey's, which you can see below. ABC and 20th Television, the studio behind Grey's Anatomy, issued a joint statement Thursday night. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as the many fans whose lives were touched by his work.” Dane and Leigh returned during the pandemic-themed 2020-21 season as part of the beach-themed dream sequences while Covid-stricken Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) was in a coma. Fittingly, it was Mark and Meredith's sister Lexie who ultimately convinced her to fight and choose life, with her coming out of the coma shortly thereafter. In a touching moment from Dane's 2021 return to Grey's Anatomy, Mark addresses in one scene what he misses about being alive and he mentions his daughter Sofia, sharing that he talks to her all the time. In an interview with Deadline about his guest appearance, Dane, himself the father of two young daughters, elaborated on Mark's conversations with his daughter from beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Craig Erwich, the president of Disney Television Group, serves many platforms. Soon, he'll serve a new master in Josh D'Amaro, the latest board-selected CEO to succeed Bob Iger. Even during this period of great change at Disney, which also includes technology shifts toward vertical video and gen-AI, the ins and outs of running Hulu and ABC won't change much for Erwich. In a wide-ranging interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Erwich discussed those modern-day transformations within a company that celebrated its 100th birthday more than two years ago. There was also much to celebrate, and we talked about those things too. Mere days ago, the last-ever episode reached 3.5 million viewers in its first day on Disney+ and Hulu, according to internal Disney data, an increase of 70 percent from the season three premiere. How 'Tell Me Lies' Creator Meaghan Oppenheimer Captivated Audiences With Three Seasons of "Messy, Complicated Chaos" Erwich told THR that there have been some discussions of a spinoff series with creator Meaghan Oppenheimer, who has an overall deal at 20th Television, but first they're doing “a completely new series” together about “family dynamics.” “We're excited work with Meaghan again,” Erwich said. “I think she's incredibly talented at telling stories about complicated relationships.” There was more new business to announce as well, like Bluey creator Joe Brumm's first foray into adult animation with a Hulu adaptation of the TikTok and Instagram shorts Deano. A new Zombies movie is being readied for summer 2027, Erwich confirmed, and there will be no rest for the undead: Erwich told THR that a new “Worlds Collide” concert tour with The Descendants and Zombies casts is readying, and this time, the Camp Rock (3) rockers are hitting the road with the other franchises' stars. Read THR‘s wide-ranging Q&A with Erwich below. You know Dana Walden well, but what is your working relationship with Josh D'Amaro like? How do you expect your job to change under the new regime? So, I think everyone's in a really good place. We had a great town hall couple weeks ago where it just felt like the company was in really, really good shape. Josh comes from Parks, so I don't know this answer: Is he more of a TV or a movie guy? [Both laugh] We'll invite him to the Emmys this year. I know that he's a fan of just great storytelling and creativity — it obviously shows up at the parks. Tell Me Lies has been a real standout performer and the latest proof-of-concept of YA TV. What are your future plans for the genre? So there's just endless fodder for storytelling, whether it's people going back to relive their youth or experience their lives in a different way. And it's always obviously a pivotal moment for people, and we're telling these stories in multiple different ways, with, I would say, honestly, multiple tones. So we have everything from Tell Me Lies, which is about toxic relationships in college, to a new show coming out called Phony, which is really almost Freaks and Geeks with a genre bend to it. Then we kind of have the queen or the king as it was of the rom-com, Mindy Kaling, who's just completed a show for us called Not Suitable for Work, which is really about coming of age in the workplace and navigating that time of your life. And then we have some really, I would say, classic takes on it. One of our big launches this summer for Disney+ will be Coven Academy, which is a bunch of young girls in a genre setting — but that one is also specifically geared for young audiences in 2026. We just launched Locker Diaries, which is a vertical video series where meet characters of our franchises — The Descendants, Phineas and Ferb — as they roam the halls of high school. This one came to be great because we were talking about vertical video, and it was asked in a meeting, “What else is vertical?” And someone said, “A locker.” And so you have a show told through the point of view of the locker. The lockers shorts are a really clever way for Disney to do vertical video. Do you see vertical video being a large part of Disney's streaming future? Or is it a passing fad to be used sparingly? So I think vertical video can be a lever towards that, or one thing that can provide a more immersive experience and a deeper fan experience around the show that they love, but that will also complement with things we do, like video podcasts … or concert tours, which we just did around The Descendants and Zombies — that comes out [on Disney+ on) Friday. You have to put a lot of assets towards that, and that's the strategy that drives — whether it's a vertical video or podcast or concert tours or social assets. I mean, we create really deep experiences beyond a first watch. It's something that we do, I think, better than anybody. Obviously, it's an honor to work at Disney. There's an incredible legacy here, but we really talk a lot about eventizing our legacy, So it was just, for instance, the 20th anniversary of High School Musical. And you saw the uplift of High School Musical on Disney+ just really spike. People have such deep memories and affection for the original franchise as part of their childhood, as something they want to share with their kids. And we really put up a classic version of it that created conversation. It has Sabrina Carpenter, who is among the most original contemporary artists. Suddenly that felt like a moment in 2026 that also was celebrating a moment from when the show first came out. I think the one we're really excited about is we have this Hannah Montana special coming up, which is a beloved character and a beloved part of the Disney library that still performs really well on Disney+. We put that trailer out and within 24 hours it had like 127 million views. So you can continue to inject relevancy and recency and, most importantly, an event around these classic shows, because there's new viewers coming in all the time, or people just want to go back and experience it again. I like when these stars return to whatever kids show first made them famous because they often spent so much time and energy trying to break away from that image. I know for Hannah Montana, Miley has just such a deep connection to her fans. We went through a similar thing this past summer on King of the Hill, which is a beloved show. And you know when the show came out, I just think the fans were so excited and happy and maybe even relieved that we not just did an honor to what the show was, but we really did a very clever update of it that just felt as relevant as the original one. My older daughter would kick me if I didn't ask what's next for Zombies and The Descendants. Well, these what we call, internally, Disney Channel Original Movies around music are something that we do that no other company can do, and that's a key part of our strategy. That's really where the bar is on things. So we have a new Descendants coming out. We're going to do another tour that will also include Camp Rock, which we're really excited about because we have the next generation of Camp Rockers coming out this summer in our new Camp Rock. These movies that combine music, they're incredible way to discover new talent. And they are things the whole family can watch together, you know, is a very important part of our strategy. Do you see a near-ish future where the number of scripted shows on ABC increases given how much viewing shows like Abbott Elementary and The Rookie drive on Hulu? One of the things that we're extraordinarily proud of at Disney is how we've been able to master the interplay between ABC and Hulu. If you kind of look at the ratings between High Potential and a show like (CBS') Matlock — on linear, they're somewhat close. And that's where you see the success of shows like High Potential, Will Trent, Abbott Elementary… Hulu allows us also to build those audiences who are catching up on the show later, and then they come in and can join it live. What's happened with The Rookie I think has almost been under reported. This is a show that, in its ninth season is, on an hour's basis, one of the top rated shows on streaming week in and week out. I'm really excited about RJ Decker, that's coming out next month. We talked about Scrubs, which I think is the perfect example of a show that's built for broadcast and streaming, as is Abbott. Is it better to have the biggest show via license, or would you consider Spidey & His Amazing Friends, which you own, the greater success for Disney? We're really proud to be in business with (Bluey creator) Joe Brumm. As matter of fact, we just greenlit a new show that Joe is executive producing called Deano, which is his take on what will ultimately be an adult animation show. And the circulation of Bluey then allows us to launch other shows, like our new Iron Man show, yeah, or the new preschool version of Avengers. Spidey is obviously the Grand Slam because it's a show that not only starts to rival Bluey in engagement, but it's also a show that we can then take people through that character's journey — everything from preschool to the parks to toys to consumer products. And that's when you can take a look at the case study of Spidey or Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Did you see this success coming with season three? Well, let me start with— from day one, we loved the show and believed in it. I do think one of the things that helped is we cast (Tell Me Lies star) Grace (Van Patten) in The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox, which introduced her to a wider audience. And that's very much, you know, a page from the Disney playbook. You know, (president of Disney Branded Television) Ayo Davis does this in our kids and family efforts. Malachi Barton, who I'm sure your daughter knows who started in Zombies and is now in Camp Rock 3, he's been introduced into our tentpole releases and is now in Coven Academy. But also it's so addictive, which is, I think— at the core of every great original that we do here, it's not that you just can't stop watching this show, you cannot stop talking about. And if you can empower the conversation and bring that community of fans together and give them the materials to kind of evangelize on your behalf, but just also to interact with it, it's pretty special. One way Disney+ may soon allow fans to interact with their favorite IP is through UGC gen-AI — how do you see the use of AI on Disney+ actually playing out? The key is that any use of it has to be human led. So if you look at Percy Jackson, for instance, Tyson, who was the new character we introduced this year— AI was utilized with Tyson, the cyclops character, but that was a creative decision used in the post production process. It feels appropriate to end with one more Tell Me Lies question. Given the massive surge in popularity, have there been discussions about a spinoff? Yes, we've definitely discussed what another Tell Me Lies might look like with a new set of characters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Donald Trump did not have the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, a rebuff of the president's central economic policy. “In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.” Roberts wrote: “We claim no special competence in matters of economics or foreign affairs. We claim only, as we must, the limited role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution. Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on overseas movie and TV production, and his authority to do so was in doubt even before Friday's decision.

It's unclear what happens to the tens of billions collected from the new tariffs that Trump imposed since taking office. RELATED: What To Know About The FCC Rule At The Center Of Trump Administration Efforts To Crack Down On Stephen Colbert And Other Late-Night Hosts In a dissenting opinion, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the majority “says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a ‘mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.” California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has challenged the tariffs in a state lawsuit, posted on X, “Issue an immediate refund to all Americans for your illegal tax. Ironically enough, the decision might give a boost to the economy, perhaps easing prices at a time when affordability is front and center in the midterm elections. Trump, though, was expected to try to invoke other authority to keep the tariffs active, but the Supreme Court ruling may foreclose other options as well. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement, “Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If this reads like gibberish, you are not familiar with Mystery Science Theater 3000, which originated on a Minneapolis UHF channel in 1988, and ran for seven seasons on Comedy Central, and three on the Sci Fi channel before vanishing for 18 years and re-emerging on Netflix in 2017. Mystery Science Theater 3000 creator Joel Hodgson was the original host, but he left in season 5 and was replaced by Mike Nelson, the show's head writer. When the show came back in 2017, Hodgson was onboard as producer, but he assembled an entirely new crew, led by comedian Jonah Ray. The revival fizzled out after three seasons, and the show truly seemed dead, until earlier this month when word hit that Hodgson had sold MST3K to Radial Entertainment, and they were reviving it with Mike Nelson as host, Kevin Murphy (Tom Servo seasons 2-10), and Bill Corbett (Crow T. Robot seasons 8-10). That trio has spent the past 20 years working at RiffTrax, an audio-only riffing enterprise that has taken on over 550 movies. As of now, only four movies are slated, including the 1978 Roger Corman/David Carradine film Deathsport. And in one episode, OG MST3K cast members Frank Conniff and Trace Beaulieu — who have their own riffing company The Mads — will make guest appearances. A Kickstarter was set up to raise funds for the productions, and so far it's raised nearly $2 million. All of this news is a lot for longtime MST3K fans (or Misties, if you will) to process. We hopped on a Zoom with Nelson to hear how it all came together, and what we can expect going forward. Did you think it was over forever when the show went off the air back then?Pretty much. I remember at the time being really naive and just going like, “Well, these things happen. What are you going to do?” And everyone else was really sad. So, I didn't really think of it. I just didn't think of it that much. I'm sure your 20 years at RiffTrax has been very satisfying because you made something that no one can cancel. I was in Minnesota [when MST3K went off the air] and I was doing freelance writing, and all of a sudden I realized, “Hey, there's not a lot of freelance writing out there. No one can stop you riffing, say, Star Wars or Titanic. There are no rights issues.That is pretty nice. My gag about it is that an executive will come in and go, “Pretty good. Why don't you throw a monkey in there.” Then they just leave the room and you got to go, “What does that mean?” And then the next executive goes in, “I like everything except the monkey. Hilary Duff Is Still Millennials' Guiding Light on ‘Luck…or Something' Steve Perry Denies Journey Reunion Rumors: ‘Simply Not True' Megan Moroney, Poet of Gen Z Heartbreak, Digs Deep on ‘Cloud 9' Kevin and Bill both made guest appearances. My standard answer back then was like, “I really got to do this RiffTrax thing right now.” I also remember, even with live shows I would have to demur and just go, “I can't.” Also, when you're raising children, now my children are full-grown, but back then you're like, “I don't know, man, I got a kid hanging on my ankle.” I was on set all the time, so it didn't really mean anything to me. And then all of a sudden, now I'm in their living room, and they don't like me. This was an entirely new cast all at once.Sure. They were on Netflix for two seasons but i was never a long-term home. Netflix rarely lets a show go for very long.I've never been part of the Netflix universe, but from what I hear, and this is hearsay, take it or leave it, is that they're very closed about that. You just walk in one day, and we're all fired. You walk in one day and the doors are chained. They did one more season that was entirely supported by fans. But that wasn't a long-term plan either. You need some sort of production company backing you.Yeah. How many times as a fan can you open your wallet? This new era was a pretty big surprise to the fans. How did you first hear about the possibility of Joel selling the show and you guys being called back in?It was really gradual. Let me think about it.” And then you're going about your day a couple months later and it's, “Well, there's a possibility. In a theoretical world, maybe, I guess.” So it was sort of gradual. You've been doing your own thing for 20 years. I think all three of us felt a little bit like you're saying, “We've got our lane, and it's been a while.” And then I think we gradually started to remember, “Man, we had so much fun doing this. How did it get to the place where it's at now where it's going to be shot again in Minneapolis with the old sets and everything?Kevin Murphy had produced for us before. It was him doing a lot of legwork with people we knew from the past. It's like, “We're thinking we're going to do this, would you be interested?” And it's gratifying to get a yes from people. I thought it was a really joyful thing to be able to live your life in a way that when you contact people from the past, they don't go, “Yeah, no, I don't want to do that.” Everyone was pretty happy about it. And we shot that little video for the Kickstarter, and a lot of the old crew came back. What's the timeline?We have to wait to see what happens with the Kickstarter, but production will follow pretty much on the heels of it and we'll try to get going on it and get them in the can, as they say. How is it going to be broadcast?I think we'll deliver them all on our RiffTrax platform, being the RiffTrax experiments. People are kind of used to that, and I think they'll just get them there. I'm sure it's going to be surreal to put the jumpsuit back on, have the puppets next to you again, and be back in this universe you've been out of for 27 years.When we did the shoot, the puppets came out of these cases. It was this weird thing of like, “I've been to the moon and now here's the moon rock that you picked up.” It was a surreal feeling, but it was also very joyful to see people scrambling around again. At the end of the series, Mike had escaped the Satellite of Love and was back on earth, watching a movie on a couch with Tom and Crow. Are you going to be back up in space for the new series?The fiction is sort of TBD. For most of us involved in it, we don't have a lot of preciousness about the actual fiction. I think we said goodbye to Gypsy in our final episode. You announced Deathsport as one of the first movies. What drew you to that one?There was a lot of talk about the movies that we were going to do. But over the years at RiffTrax, a real attachment to David Carradine has formed for whatever reason. This is the one where he has a loincloth. How did Frank Conniff and Trace Beaulieu get involved?Trace is in our general area, and we've kept in touch with him and always been friendly with him. We are always aware that they were doing the Mads, and have been sort of, as they say, friends of RiffTrax. And Frank, I saw him a couple months back. He had moved back to Minnesota from New York. Why just four episodes?I think everyone thought that was a good starting place production-wise. Because one of the things about MST that's far different from RiffTrax is that RiffTrax is much easier to produce since it's just audio. When you start putting puppets under the lights and things like that, they tend to catch fire. Four was just like, “What do we feel comfortable committing to and what do we feel comfortable actually producing?” It's a crazy echo of history that you're again replacing Joel 30 years later.It is odd, and then oddly comfortable. Might he guest at some point?I haven't been in touch with him. I don't think there's any plans for it because I think he's out of the game, at least that's our understanding. If the four go well, might you make a lot more?We're leaving that open. We're going to be at a rental studio. But we have our old cameraman and art director. They were like, “I'm retired, man, I don't want to do this.” They're chopping wood in their cabin and we're like, “Come on, man, one more job.” I want to briefly ask about some of the old movies. Manos: The Hands of Fate fascinates so many people. That was very polarizing even at the time. There's no way we're going to do it.” And then we showed it to everyone else and it was half-and-half, people just going, “I just don't ever want to see that again.” And the other half going, “This is so good.” It's like that Tommy Wiseau and The Room. You can't explain why some people are like, “I cannot believe you would sit and watch this once, let alone 300 times.” It's like this weird form of outsider art, people making a movie that don't know anything about the craft of filmmaking.Yeah, I think it has that same feeling of, “Where did this get made? Why?” You want to know everything about it. With Manos, we were like, “This seems like it was made by a fertilizer salesman from San Antonio.” And then it's like, “This was made by a fertilizer salesman in San Antonio. Who is a worse director: Ed Wood or Coleman Francis?Oh, I think Coleman Francis is worse than Ed Wood. In terms of just technical things, I feel like Ed Wood at least tried to capture the stuff on film. And Coleman Francis is like, “We got it.

We hear so often about the movies you dislike. My wife and I like old movies, so we watch a lot of black-and-whites, which I know some people go, “I can't even watch a black-and-white movie.” You're cutting yourself off from a lot of movies. You must be surprised that you raised $2 million so quickly.I've always been about, “Let's make this the most joyful experience, the most fun for the most people that we can.” When you get a reaction like this, you're like, “We're on the right track.” There's always going to be people who hate you. You can't do anything about that, but for the most part, we try to make everyone included in the comedy. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

A love story, with Sam Claflin and Simone Ashley attached; a Dusty Springfield project; and a film driven by music by Bastille's Dan Smith and To Kill a King's Ralph Pelleymounter feature on the slate of the longtime Quentin Tarantino collaborator and sync powerhouse.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Hollywood producer and long-time Quentin Tarantino collaborator Shannon McIntosh (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Hateful Eight) has struck a deal with Universal Music Group U.K.'s Globe business for a slate of music-driven feature films.


	Led by president Marc Robinson, the London-based Globe has been expanding into the U.S. and looking beyond its traditional sync business. McIntosh's McIntosh Films has now partnered with the Globe Originals arm on what the two companies described as “a bold slate of music-driven feature films.”

	The firms, which previously partnered on Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, said they were “in active development on a slate,” mentioning several projects. Falling, written and directed by BAFTA-winning filmmaker Dominic Savage, has Simone Ashley,  Evan Peters and  Sam Claflin attached and is described as “a modern-day love story developed in close collaboration with acclaimed music producer and composer  Marius de Vries.”Dusty vs Dusty, a new twist on the biopic, will explore identity, artistry and self-creation, with two actors set to portray Dusty Springfield, with producer Kate Driver attached. The project is the brainchild of Sophie Edelstein  and is co-written by  Emma-Jane Unsworth.And Annie Oakley Hanging, called a “fully music-driven feature ” and “a rebellious love story set in the wild American frontier,” will feature an original soundtrack created by Dan Smith, songwriter and lead singer of Bastille, and  Ralph Pelleymounter, songwriter and lead singer of To Kill a King.

	The projects “bring together Globe Originals' access to world-class artists, composers and music catalogue with McIntosh Films' track record in distinctive cinema,” the partners said. Globe Originals' mission is to develop films with music as the creative engine, “opening opportunities for artists in new avenues.”


	“These are films where music isn't ornamental — it's structural,” McIntosh emphasized. “Globe Originals creates an extraordinary bridge between artists and filmmakers, and this slate reflects a shared ambition to make cinema that feels emotionally and culturally alive.” Said Marc Robinson, president, Globe Originals: “There is huge opportunity to bring together the worlds of music and film — and this partnership is designed to do just that. Working with Shannon and McIntosh Films allows us to develop projects where artists, filmmakers and composers collaborate from the very beginning to create truly special audio and visual experiences.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court struck down large swaths of President Donald Trump's international tariff agenda on Friday, severely curtailing one of the president's signature second-term policy projects. In a 6-3 ruling, the court determined that Trump and his administration had exceeded their tariff powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA,) a 1977 law that allows the president to regulate certain aspects of international trade during a declared national emergency. “In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.” That view would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy,” Roberts added. “It is also telling that in IEEPA's half century of existence, no President has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.” “We claim no special competence in matters of economics or foreign affairs,” Roberts added. There, deliberation tempers impulse, and compromise hammers disagreements into workable solutions.” Trump was reportedly told of the decision while meeting with governors at the White House, and called it a “disgrace.” The president has continued to use tariffs or the threat of tariffs to bully other nations into complying with his demands. Economists have widely bashed Trump's tariff policy, which effectively amounts to a tax on American consumers. “This is a win for the wallets of every American consumer,” Senate Minority Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in response to the ruling.

Trump has continued to defend the tariffs, however, and seemed confident on Thursday that the Supreme Court would rule in his favor. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States simply isn't big enough for two bosses. That's one takeaway from a new missive from the White House, which has dismissed Bruce Springsteen as a “loser” with “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and an atrophying brain, doing so by way of a statement. Only this time, the titles of several choice Springsteen work are woven in for added effect. “When this loser Springsteen comes back home to his own City of Ruins in his head, he'll realize his Glory Days are behind him and his fans have left him Out in the Street, putting him in a Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out because he has a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his brain,” reads the message from White House comms director Steven Cheung, issued to Politico. Billboard has reached out to Springsteen for comment. 1 with “Streets of Minneapolis,” which debuted atop Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart dated Feb. 7. Springsteen is many things, but a “loser” — as the administration has referred to him — isn't one of them. Across a 40 year-plus career, the rocker has collected 20 Grammys, won an Oscar and a Tony, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, received a Kennedy Center Honor and, in November 2016, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And his album sales are north of 150 million, reps say. After 129 shows, the Springsteen and E Street Band 2023-25 tour grossed $729.7 million and sold 4.9 million tickets, according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, for the biggest result of his career. “We are living through dark, disturbing and dangerous times, but do not despair — the cavalry is coming!” said Springsteen in a statement Tuesday (Feb. 17) when announcing the forthcoming tour. He added, “We will be rocking your town in celebration and in defense of America — American democracy, American freedom, our American Constitution and our sacred American dream — all of which are under attack by our wannabe king and his rogue government in Washington, D.C. Everyone, regardless of where you stand or what you believe in, is welcome — so come on out and join the United Free Republic of E Street Nation for an American spring of Rock n' Rebellion!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rebecca Gayheart withdrew her divorce filing from Eric Dane after the late actor was diagnosed with ALS because she wanted to teach their children to “show up for family.” The actress explained her decision on the “Broad Ideas” podcast last November, saying that by calling off their divorce, she hoped to teach their daughters, Billie, 15, and Georgia, 13, to be there for their family even “when times are at their worst.” Last March, they called off their divorce after seven years of separation. One month later, the “Grey's Anatomy” star went public with his ALS diagnosis. “I'm just showing up and trying to be there for [my kids]. In a vulnerable essay for The Cut published last December, Gayheart said her and Dane's “love may not be romantic, but it's a familial love.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Gayheart addressed that they both have had romantic relationships with other people — she's been linked to billionaire Peter Morton and he dated filmmaker Janell Shirtcliff last June — but they regularly see each other for family gatherings. “This year, the girls and I have spent a lot of time at Eric's house, which is about a 12-minute drive away from our home,” the essay continued. Dane passed away on Thursday, 10 months after announcing his ALS diagnosis. Dane's family shared in a statement to People, “With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS.” “Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight,” the statement continued. “He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This series appreciates the virtues of smallness, that intimacy can reveal a world far more nimbly than scale. One half hour from the eyes of Ser Dunk is all there is and all there needs to be. This creative direction has its obstacles: On the page, we read Dunk's thoughts, know his memories as they spring to mind, and infer from those he represses the parts of his life he'd rather not dwell on. “In The Name Of The Mother,” the penultimate episode in Parker's agreeably earthy and entertaining debut season, begins and ends with the fateful Trial Of Seven, in which Ser Dunk faces his accuser, Prince Aerion “Brightflame” Targaryen (Finn Bennett), who just one night before tormented an innocent puppeteer and paid for it with a few fists and feet to his royal personage. Aerion rallies his father, Prince Maekar (Sam Spruell), the three Kingsguard who attended his family at the Ashford Meadow tourney, his drunkard brother Daeron (Henry Ashton), and the treacherous Ser Steffon Fossoway (Edward Ashley) to fight against Dunk—who, as we saw last week, had a much tougher time rallying heroes to his cause than the realm's royal house. Yet true company arrives, thanks to his squire, Aegon “Egg” Targaryen (Dexter Soll Ansell). He brings Sers Baratheon (Daniel Ings), Beesbury (Danny Collins), Hardyng (Ross Anderson), and Rhysling (William Houston) to fight under Dunk's star-lit standard, joining brave Raymun Fossoway (Shaun Thomas), who offered his sword in service to Dunk and was anointed in the mud. Rounding out Dunk's six champions—to the tourney audience's confusion and/or awe—is Prince Baelor “Breakspear” Targaryen (Bertie Carvel), who declares for Dunk in an act of chivalry so enormous that it could only end in doom. Remember: In Westeros, virtue has a half-life of hours. It's a thematic point that perhaps explains why this week's episode, so named for a knight's vow to protect the innocent (and a rallying cry for Ser Arlan Of Pennytree, as it happens), takes the added measure of flashing back to a fateful day in Dunk's past just before judgment comes crashing into his present. Martin's prose puts it, “the shadowy wynds and crooked alleys” of King's Landing, where Dunk grew up. With thorough detail, we're shown what compels Dunk to gather strength enough to beat Prince Aerion, twenty minutes of screentime to express this one line from the novella: “[Aerion] could vanquish Ser Duncan The Tall, but not Dunk Of Flea Bottom.” (You'll recall some of its finer details were discussed in song by Egg during “The Squire.”) It was there that Princes Baelor and Maekar formed the hammer and anvil that smashed Daemon I Blackfyre's forces and secured King Daeron's rule for a while longer—now a graveyard and primary source of income for Dunk (Bamber Todd) and Rafe (Chloe Lea). “We'll all be plundering that tomb for a dragon's age,” a fence grumbles to the kids when they bring him their findings. They're not just scraping for food; Rafe wants to ferry Dunk across the Narrow Sea for a fresh start in the Free Cities. Their chances of making this lateral move dim in the narrow causeways of Flea Bottom, where drunks and thieves like City Watchman Alester (Edward Davis) bully lowborn like Dunk and Rafe for sport. It's impressive how foul and claustrophobic this part of Flea Bottom looks: Men scream as surgery is done on them in the open; women weep in corners; people stagger into each other, leaving themselves vulnerable to pickpocketing or, as Rafe later learns to Dunk's woe, a strategically thrust dagger. “What if this is the best there is?” wee Dunk asks his companion, who responds: “That would be quite sad.” Even at this late hour, it's a neat bit of groundwork for Dunk's world philosophy, why protecting people with his size and strength matters to him, and why Ser Arlan (Danny Webb), for all his failings, appealed to him so. “Go out there and get a family.” We know he does, and now we have the additional knowledge that his found families—made with Ser Arlan and, one day, with Egg—are built on her memory. Considering how little of this Westerosi history was mapped out when Martin wrote The Hedge Knight, filling these gaps brings welcome heft and history. This episode should serve future seasons exploring the many complex Targaryen rifts and the lingering revolts spawned from them. It also reiterates a pervasive theme in this franchise, courtesy of Rafe's quick tale of fellow roughs Pudding and Cedric: Payment for past wrongs always comes with compound interest—if not now, then when one least expects it. For folks here to see some rock-'em-sock-'em knighttime action, still amped up from Prince Baelor's declaration for all that is just and good last week, this pause will chafe. This late into the series, it feels like padding. Still, it's well-directed, well-written padding, rife with narrative echoing: Ser Alran blorfs before protecting Dunk, just as Dunk blorfs before standing up to Prince Aerion; and wee Dunk hoists Ser Arlan's penny-hilted sword just as Egg takes it for practice years later. These added textures of Dunk's origin are appreciated, but at this defining moment? Which brings us back to the present, where Dunk rallies with the few commanding words from Ser Arlan we've yet to hear: “Get up.” Up is where Dunk goes, though not without effort (that lance through his side meekened him even before he was unhorsed). Here, Dunk's point of view is severely diminished by that narrow slit in his helm, and later, one of his eyes is closed shut, so we miss the peripheral thrills one might expect from this fracas (such as Ser Lyonel laughing his way through Maekar's defenses, the Fossoway cousins letting off long-fermenting steam between them, etc). We do see the only moment that counts: Prince Aerion dropping his dragon's facade under Dunk's relentless pummelling, yielding his accusations before all in Ashford Meadow. (Had he not thrown in the towel, would Dunk have risked killing a prince?) What we don't see is Maekar's blow to his older brother's head, which crushes Baelor's helm and removes another good man from the realm—one whose life might have changed much for Westeros had it not ended here. The man called “Breakspear” for trouncing the traitor Daemon Blackfyre's armies on the Redgrass Field, who ruled in the name of Daeron “The Good” and would have made a fair and just king himself, dies in service to a hedge knight who reminded him what justice looks like when those who swore to uphold it remember their vows.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just two months before actor Eric Dane died on February 19, 2026, the “Grey's Anatomy” and “Euphoria” alum announced he was writing his memoir, titled “Book of Days: A Memoir in Moments.” Dane, who was 53 at the time of his death, chose to work on his memoir with journalist Maria Shriver's publishing imprint at Penguin Random House, The Open Field. “I'm heartbroken by this devastating news about Eric Dane,” she wrote. He used his voice to let the world know what it was like living with ALS.” Shriver continued, “I was honored he chose my publishing imprint to publish his memoir. She then confirmed the memoir will not die with him, writing, “Godspeed, Eric. When Dane and Shriver announced their publishing partnership in December, she posted on social media how grateful she was that Dane chose to work on his 2026 book with her and her team, writing, “It is indeed an honor to publish @realericdane's new memoir about his account of being diagnosed with ALS and how he is dealing with it.” “I'm so humbled and honored that he chose @openfieldbooks to publish his important story,” Shriver continued, calling it “an imprint known for publishing bestselling books that rise above the noise and move humanity forward.” If sharing this helps someone find meaning in their own days, then my story is worth telling.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eric Dane fought a brave battle against ALS until his passing at age 53. In December 2025, Target ALS shared in a joint Instagram post with Dane that the beloved actor had joined their Board of Directors. “We're proud to share an important announcement: Eric Dane (@realericdane) has joined the Target ALS Board of Directors, deepening his commitment to accelerating ALS research and driving meaningful change for the ALS community,” the non-profit announced on December 18. The statement continued, “Diagnosed in 2024, Eric has become a powerful advocate for progress, lending his voice to our ‘Ending ALS Starts With You' campaign and even portraying a character living with ALS on NBC's ‘Brilliant Minds' to raise awareness. But I won't let it take my spirit. Target ALS embodies that spirit, and that's why I'm joinging the Board…This community deserves effective treatments, and I want to do my part to deliver them.” Dane passed away on Thursday, February 19, his family confirmed in a statement to People. Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few movies of recent vintage have had a longer or bumpier road to getting made than Mars, the first (and reportedly last) full feature-length movie from cult sketch comedy group The Whitest Kids U' Know. Originally conceived back in 2012—shortly after the group's IFC sketch series went off the air—the film has faced numerous hardships to getting made, none more obvious, or seemingly insurmountable, than the death of the group's co-founder, Trevor Moore, in 2021. Now, though, the animated movie is finally gearing up to get a limited run in theaters and a wide release on physical media and VOD, complete with a trailer that starts with a close-up of a character very clearly modeled on, and played by, Moore. (Who completed his voice work for the film several years ago.) Mars had a debut at the Tribeca Film Festival back in 2024, although reviews for the film seemed fairly mixed. (If more positive than the response to the previous film that Moore made with fellow WKUK Zach Cregger, 2009's widely excoriated Miss March.) Featuring voice performancess from Moore, Cregger, Sam Brown, Timmy Williams, and Darren Trumeter—with the group having crowdfunded the film personally—the movie was directed by Sevan Najarian, and focuses on a guy who wins a trip to Mars from an eccentric Richard Branson-esque billionaire (Moore). The group is currently gearing up to tour Mars with Q&As at Alamo Drafthouses in locations across the country. (Would the film be getting quite this treatment if Cregger hadn't become one of the biggest names in horror over the last several years, courtesy of Barbarian and Weapons?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bad Bunny and Gabriela Berlingeri were spotted out together after reigniting their romance. The “DtMF” hitmaker was pictured stepping out with Berlingeri in São Paulo, Brazil on Wednesday for dinner. The jewelry designer carried a cropped denim jacket while walking alongside the singer, who carried a large checkered bag. Last Thursday, the Puerto Rican musical phenomenon, 31, was spotted on an early Valentine's Day dinner date with Berlingeri, 32, in Buenos Aires. Photos obtained by Page Six showed the “Yo Perreo Sola” rapper going incognito outside the restaurant in a checkered face mask, ball cap, and blue hoodie. Berlingeri followed behind him, walking alongside a restaurant staffer, and wore a brown leather jacket with matching pants for the dinner date. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. For that outing, the musician — whose given name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasion — stopped to shake hands with several young fans as Berlingeri waited nearby in a vehicle. The duo previously dated off and on from 2017 to 2022. He also famously dated “The Kardashians” star Kendall Jenner, 30, for nearly a year before their split in December 2023 — though they briefly reconciled in May 2024 before splitting again. Through it all, the Grammy winner has remained famously tight-lipped about his relationships. “They don't know how you feel, they don't know how you live, they don't know anything, and I really don't want them to know,” he told Vanity Fair in 2023, referencing fan interest in his love life.</p>
