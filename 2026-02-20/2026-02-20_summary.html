Experts say new labeling could deceive consumers as dangerous substances still allowed under new rules

In a further retreat from its pledge to ban artificial dyes from food, Donald Trump's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would loosen labeling requirements to allow companies to state “no artificial colors”, even though products may contain some dangerous substances such as titanium dioxide.

The FDA in early February announced it would allow food makers to claim “no artificial colors” as long as the dyes are not petroleum-based, but health experts say even some naturally based additives present health risks, and the labeling would deceive consumers.

The move comes after the agency in 2025 began pressuring companies to phase out petroleum-based dyes, but stopped short of putting in place a ban. Removing toxins from food is a cornerstone of the Robert F Kennedy-led Maha movement. Kennedy is the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, which holds the FDA, and he quickly zeroed in on dye upon taking office last year.

The FDA agreed to what critics label a “handshake” with big food to stop using the dyes, though Kennedy framed it as “an understanding”. Some candy makers still are refusing to fully stop using artificial dyes.

The latest decision around labeling “is going to cause confusion and allow some companies to mislead folks about the colors that are present in their foods”, said Thomas Galligan, principal scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which researches food dyes.

“It's frustrating, especially when the rhetoric suggests they are solving the problem, but in practice they're just letting industry do whatever they want,” Galligan continued, adding that the rules were already so loophole-ridden that there were other ways that companies could deceive consumers. The most effective measure to protect consumers is a ban, he said.

Kennedy defended the move in a statement: “This is real progress. We are making it easier for companies to move away from petroleum-based synthetic colors and adopt safer, naturally derived alternatives. This momentum advances our broader effort to help Americans eat real food and Make America Healthy Again.”

Consumer Brands, a trade group for packaged foods, applauded the move, stating that it “is a positive example of the FDA taking the lead on ingredient safety and transparency”.

Kelly Ryerson, Maha advocate and author, praised the FDA for taking the first step to pressure industry to move away from dyes, calling it “enormous”. But she told the Guardian she was concerned about confusion over the labeling, and added: “I would like to see these things banned permanently.”

Synthetic dyes are linked to ADHD and hyperactivity in children, among other health harms. The FDA banned Red Dye 3 in January 2025, before Kennedy took over the agency, because studies found it probably caused cancer in lab rats.

West Virginia has since banned some synthetic dyes, and Texas passed a law to require warning labels. More than 25 states are considering new bans on synthetic food dyes and other food chemical additives.

Among naturally derived dyes are beet juice, beet powder, algae and butterfly pea flower. While most naturally derived dyes are generally safer than petroleum-based, some can be dangerous.

“As a foundational concept, natural doesn't mean safe,” Galligan said, which contradicts the average consumers' assumptions.

He noted that lead and arsenic, two of the planet's most toxic substances, are naturally occurring, though they are not used in food dyes.

Among natural dyes used in foods that advocates find most concerning is titanium dioxide nanoparticles added to brighten whites, or effectively serve as a primer for other colors. The toxic substance is banned in the European Union for use in food because regulators could not conclude that it is safe, and raised concern that it damages genes.

It is a potential carcinogen that accumulates in organs and is linked to neurotoxicity, intestinal inflammation, reproductive damage, birth defects and other health impacts.

Titanium dioxide is widely used across the US food system. The Environmental Working Group non-profit has found nearly 2,000 products in which the chemical may be used, though some estimates are as high as 11,000. The largest subgroups included candy, cakes, cookies and desserts or dessert toppings.

The FDA so far has ignored a petition filed in 2023 by five major US public health advocacy groups that asks it to withdraw its approval of titanium dioxide for use in food.

Meanwhile, naturally derived caramel color can contain 4-MEI, an impurity linked to cancer that is produced during processing. Food companies will be able to state that products that contain these ingredients have “no artificial flavors”.

The EWG co-founder Ken Cook said the shift ultimately represented “another broken promise” from Kennedy and Trump.

“They pledged outright bans on dangerous food chemical additives to their Make America Healthy Again base,” Cook said.

“Instead, states are doing the hard work to protect families, while Kennedy settles for handshake deals with big food and chemical companies – agreements with no real accountability and no guarantee they'll be honored.”

The White House cites Iran's nuclear capabilities — while maintaining their nuclear facilities were “obliterated.”

The Trump administration is reportedly on the verge of attacking Iran in order to force Islamic Republic officials to agree to President Donald Trump's demands for a nuclear deal, and to potentially push for regime change, which could spark a disastrous, protracted war.

U.S. officials have provided no evidence for an imminent threat — the only legal justification for the use of military force under international law — from Iran.

In the past few weeks, the U.S. has built up a military force likened to that of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The Pentagon has sent two aircraft carriers – including the world's largest warship, the USS Gerald R. Ford – to the Mediterranean in preparation for the attack, alongside an arsenal of more than 120 aircraft, drones, and combat ships.

Trump told reporters on Friday that he is considering a supposedly limited strike to coerce Iranian officials into agreeing to a nuclear deal. “I guess I can say I am considering that,” he said. 

Reports citing those familiar with the administration's talks have found that the U.S. is prepared to carry out a strike as early as this weekend, and that the limited strike scenario would come within the next few days. 

Trump said this week that he's giving Iran 10 to 15 days to strike a deal. However, Trump had given Iran a two-week deadline to strike a deal last June, just days before the administration struck nuclear facilities in Iran and killed over 1,000 people, including hundreds of civilians.

The rationale for striking Iran this time is even less clear. The White House is following a similar script as it did before the attack last year, banging the drum about Iran's nuclear capabilities. But the current escalation comes as the Trump administration continues to insist that it has, in fact, already obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities — contradicting their own stated rationale for the war.

This contradiction was clearest on Wednesday, when Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “There's many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran. The president had a very successful operation as commander in chief with Operation Midnight Hammer … [which] totally obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities.”

The White House still hosts a live webpage published following the strike last year that reads, “Iran's Nuclear Facilities Have Been Obliterated — and Suggestions Otherwise are Fake News.” 

A quote from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on that page says: “Based on everything we have seen — and I've seen it all — our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons.”

The idea that the nuclear facilities were “obliterated” is untrue. Numerous experts have said that the nuclear program was likely set back by a few years, if not just a few months. 

But, regardless of the facts, the Trump administration is seemingly claiming that the strikes are necessary to prevent Iran from making progress toward a nuclear weapon, while also saying that the military already completely destroyed their ability last year to make a nuclear weapon.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday in an interview with MS NOW that the U.S.'s negotiators, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have actually not demanded zero uranium enrichment at all. 

“We have not offered any suspension and the U.S. side has not asked for zero enrichment,” said Araqchi. “What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran's nuclear program, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever.”

And yet, the White House has repeatedly said that Trump seeks to end all of Iran's uranium enrichment activities, with Trump saying that “bad things will happen” if the country doesn't.

It is illegal under the UN charter to threaten the use of force to achieve diplomatic goals.

”The president has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them, and that they cannot enrich uranium,” the White House said in response to Araqchi's comments.

Trump said last weekend that regime change is “the best thing that could happen” in Iran, but the negotiations between the two countries have seemingly not included talks regarding the recent protests.

Reuters reported Friday that the U.S. has planned for options including an operation for regime change, with the military “preparing for a sustained, weeks-long operation against Iran that could include striking Iranian security facilities as well as nuclear infrastructure.”

Despite the similarities in the buildup of military force, the current circumstances stand in sharp contrast to the lead up to the Iraq War. 

Before the invasion, the Bush administration made up fantastical lies about Iraq's “weapons of mass destruction,” flooding media outlets with claims that Iraq had the capability to unleash terror on the U.S. at any moment. 

“The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons, for over a decade,” President George W. Bush said in his 2002 State of the Union address. According to Pew, following that address, 77 percent of Americans said that the U.S. should use military force if Iraq was shown to be developing such a weapon. 

Perhaps as a result of the contradictory messaging from the Trump administration and the public's memory of the disastrous consequences of the 2003 Iraq invasion, by comparison, the prospect of war with Iran is extremely unpopular. Last month, Quinnipiac found that only 18 percent of registered U.S. voters say the U.S. should take military action against Iran for its brutal repression of protesters, while 70 percent were opposed.

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

Completion of glass cross brings Antoni Gaudí's church to maximum final height of 172.5m, 144 years after work began

The final piece of the central tower of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia has been laid in place, bringing the church to its maximum final height 144 years after work began.

After several days when it has been too windy to work, the upper section of the 17 metre-high four-sided steel and glass cross was winched into position at 11am on Friday, completing the tower dedicated to Jesus Christ. At 172.5 metres, the Sagrada Familia, to which the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí devoted the later part of his life, is Barcelona's tallest building and the world's tallest church.

As the Catalan and Vatican flags were raised, Jordi Faulí, the chief architect for the project, said: “It's been a joyful day, wonderful for all the people who have made it possible.”

A ceremony to mark the completion of the tower – the tallest of 18 conceived by Gaudí – is due to take place on the centenary of Gaudí's death in 1926 on 10 June, 16 years after the church was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI.

The end to the building at the church is expected in about a decade with the construction of a striking south-facing facade.

It was nevertheless a day full of emotion for a city that has lived with Gaudí's unfinished work for generations and, although there remains much work to do, the temple now defines the Barcelona skyline as much as the Eiffel tower in Paris or the Empire State building in New York.

For decades it was a building site open to the skies, where generations of stone masons and carpenters worked around the tourists who have ultimately funded the construction. It's only in the past 15 years, since work began on the breathtakingly beautiful interior, that it has felt more like a church than a building site.

Here Gaudí's geometrical designs have created an oasis of light, with delicate, tree-like columns tapering off to the roof, the white stone of the interior picked out in colours from the stained glass windows.

The basilica is loved and loathed equally by those who live in Barcelona. George Orwell described it as “one of the most hideous buildings in the world” and regretted the anarchists did not blow it up when they had the chance.

The anarchists did, however, destroy Gaudí's drawings and the plaster model, which years later was painstakingly reconstructed. In the late 1970s, Mark Burry, a New Zealand architect, adapted rocket design software to realise Gaudí's design.

To those who claim the basilica is nothing like what was originally envisaged, Burry's retort was that Gaudí's geometry is so precise that should there be any deviation from his plan, the building would collapse.

It is, however, now the work of many hands. There are elements that jar, in particular the Passion façade, popularly known as Darth Vader façade, the work of the sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs, and yet overall it is unmistakably Gaudí's work.

Aside from finishing the details of the main tower, three artists – Miquel Barceló , Cristina Iglesias and Javier Marín – have been commissioned to present designs for the Glory façade, which is expected to take a further 10 years to complete.

The Sagrada Familia is the city's top tourist attraction, with about 5 million visitors a year and an annual income of roughly €150m (£131m), about half of which has so far been spent on construction.

“I will continue to work for the freedom of the Palestinian people,” says Mohsen Mahdawi.

An immigration judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University graduate and green card holder who was detained last April at what he thought was a citizenship interview. Mahdawi grew up in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank and was an outspoken critic of Israel's genocide in Gaza while attending Columbia. He spent two weeks in ICE custody before a federal judge ordered his release. Mahdawi's case is part of a broader pattern of the Trump administration targeting international students for expressing solidarity with Palestinians and demanding divestment from the Israeli government.

Mahdawi says even though immigration judges are part of the executive branch, the Trump administration clearly “violated the rules of law” in targeting him. “The harder they come on me, the more energy and power I will have, and I will continue to work for the freedom of the Palestinian people and the right of return and equal rights and human rights for Palestinians.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: “People Have the Power” by Patti Smith joined by Michael Stipe performing at Democracy Now!'s 20th anniversary. On Monday night we will be streaming our 30th anniversary celebration with Michael Stipe and Angela Davis, with Wynton Marsalis and Maria Ressa, also with the Palestinian Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Mosab Abu Toha and many others. Go to Democracynow.org for that livestream.

This is Democracy Now!, Democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman. An immigration judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting Mohsen Mahdawi, a graduate student at Columbia University who was detained last April for his outspoken support for Palestinian rights. Mohsen is a green card holder who grew up in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. At Columbia, he served as co-president of the Palestinian Students Union and served as president of the Buddhist Association.

Last April, masked and hooded ICE agents detained him when he appeared for what he believed would be a naturalization interview in Vermont. He spent two weeks in ICE custody before federal Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered his release. At the time, Judge Crawford wrote, “Our nation has seen times like this before, especially during the Red Scare and Palmer Raids of 1919-1920 and during the McCarthy period in the 1950's.”

Mohsen is just one of many international students targeted by the Trump administration solely for expressing solidarity with Palestinians and opposing the Israeli war on Gaza. Mohsen Mahdawi joins us now. Mohsen, welcome back to Democracy Now! We spoke to you right after you were released from jail. It was right before graduation at Columbia, at the reception in front of SIPA, the School of International Affairs where you are now a graduate student. Can you talk about the significance of this immigration judge's ruling?

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: Thank you for having me, Amy. This is very significant and actually it's unprecedented considering all of the cases that were brought forward against students for deportation, student activists. What Judge Nina Froes has done, she has actually taken a very brave and courageous step towards justice by holding the rule of the law.

Even though this immigration court is under the executive branch, still the judge has found that the document which was used, which was the memo by Marco Rubio, was unauthenticated. And the hope that this same finding will apply on other students and based on this determination of the case was done without prejudice.

Now, I have to share with you, Amy, that we also have to consider the many different circumstances. The first step that allowed me to get here was to not be deported, to not be transferred from Vermont to Louisiana, which allowed me to be freed on bail by Judge Geoffrey Crawford. And then to be able to be heard in this immigration court which is in Massachusetts rather than one that is in Louisiana. So that gives you hope that there are judges who still hold integrity and refuse to sell their souls to Trump's administration.

AMY GOODMAN: For people who don't understand how the system works, explain the difference between an immigration judge and a federal judge. You have cases in both courts.

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: Correct. And I hope my lawyers would not be angry at me, because I am not a lawyer, but my understanding that technically—and actually it's part of the vision of this country to have checks and balances, and federal courts are part of the checks and balances. This actually has been designed and envisioned by Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers. And the idea is to separate the executive branch from the judicial branch.

AMY GOODMAN: It's interesting that this is an immigration judge who is under the executive branch.

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: That's exactly right. So even though the immigration judge is bounded by the executive branch, the immigration judge has to go through the rules and the rules of law, and based on those rules of law, what the Trump administration has done, in fact, they have violated the rules of law. And that's why the case was terminated.

AMY GOODMAN: This was your message to Trump after you were released from an ICE jail in Vermont last year following more than two weeks in custody.

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: And I am saying it clear and loud to President Trump and his cabinet—I am not afraid of you.

AMY GOODMAN: Talk about that moment as you say you are “not afraid of you” and what it meant to be released and what it meant after you had gone for your naturalization hearing, for these federal immigration agents to move in on you when you had been told to come for the hearing.

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: By this time, I would imagine that it's becoming very clear to the American people and to the rest of the world that this administration's mentality, the Trump administration, is to intimidate people, to scare people, and to make an example of people like me so others would not actually dare to raise their voice and to share their truth. And what I meant to say, actually, why I wanted to say that I am not afraid—because if I am afraid, I would lose sight. And I would lose not only sight; vision and imagination.

AMY GOODMAN: Mohsen, we just have a minute. You were raised in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. You are a permanent U.S. resident. You enrolled in Colombia University to study philosophy where you are also president of the Columbia University Buddhist Association. How has your faith and upbringing in the occupied West Bank guided your activism and your stance today?

MOHSEN MAHDAWI: Amy, I have to share—because of one minute—I have to share with you that I was attacked and other students were attacked not merely for protesting. The media has missed the point. They started saying the pro-Palestine protests or the Palestinian movement. The movement had an actual goal, an objective, and that is divestment—divestment, boycott, and sanctions—because this is the only way that we can bring peace and justice in a nonviolent and peaceful way. And we do it with love, compassion, and empathy.

That is why the Trump Administration gets so scared of people like me who organize, and are still organizing, because I will not be deterred and I will not actually give up to their exhaustion tactics. The harder they come on me, the more energy and power I will have, and I will continue to work for the freedom of the Palestinian people and the right of return and equal rights and human rights for Palestinians.

AMY GOODMAN: Mohsen Mahdawi, graduate student at Columbia University, thank you so much for being with us. I'm Amy Goodman.

US president to hold news conference after 6-3 ruling against his tariffs; conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh dissented

Full report: Trump's tariffs are illegal, supreme court rules

Business live: Stock markets rally after Trump tariffs lose in court

Donald Trump is due to hold a press briefing at 12.45pm ET in what will be his first public remarks since the supreme court ruled against the legality of his sweeping global tariffs.

The only response we've had from the president so far is a comment he reportedly made at this morning's White House breakfast meeting with US governors. According to CNN he called the decision a “disgrace”.

We'll bring you all the key lines from the briefing once it gets under way.

Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, also welcomed the decision, slamming Trump's tariffs as “reckless, unconstitutional and costly” and “an abuse of executive power that unlawfully taxed millions of Americans”.

She said on X:

double quotation markTrump's sweeping tariffs were reckless, unconstitutional and costly for America's working families. Today, the Supreme Court rightfully struck them down, upholding the Constitution and rejecting an abuse of executive power that unlawfully taxed millions of Americans. The Court was clear. Tariffs cannot be enacted without the explicit authorization of Congress.

Another Republican senator, Susan Collins, of Maine, has welcomed the supreme court's ruling. She said on X:

double quotation markToday's Supreme Court ruling reaffirms that only Congress has the constitutional authority to impose tariffs, and the President can only do so under a clear and limited delegation of authority from Congress. My votes against the President unilaterally imposing tariffs on Canada reflected the same conclusion as well as my belief that these tariffs often harm Maine's economy and consumers.

We'll bring you all the key lines from the briefing once it gets under way.

Republican senator John Curtis, from Utah, welcomed the supreme court's ruling and, while not calling explicitly for refunds for consumers and small businesses, he also raises the question of “what happens to the revenue already collected”.

In a post on X he said:

double quotation markToday's ruling affirms, despite all the noise of the moment, that the Founders' system of checks and balances remains strong nearly 250 years later. Several questions remain unanswered, including what happens to the revenue already collected and how the Administration may use alternative authorities to impose tariffs. Looking ahead, it is critical that we provide the clarity and predictability businesses need.

California governor Gavin Newsom has also responded on X:

double quotation markEven Donald Trump's Supreme Court agrees: His tax on the American people is illegal. A huge win for families and small businesses across the country who have been suffering under this man's ego.

In a subsequent post, he added:

double quotation markIssue an immediate refund to all Americans for your illegal tax. Now.

However, as Shrai noted earlier, Elizabeth Warren has made the point that there is “no legal mechanism for consumers and many small businesses to recoup the money they have already paid”. She said:

double quotation markGiant corporations with their armies of lawyers and lobbyists can sue for tariff refunds, then just pocket the money for themselves. It's one more example of how the game is rigged.

Any refunds from the federal government should end up in the pockets of the millions of Americans and small businesses that were illegally cheated out of their hard-earned money by Donald Trump.

Democratic senator Tim Kaine has not minced his words in his response to the supreme court's ruling that Trump illegally used executive power when he imposed his sweeping global tariffs.

In a post on X, the Virginia senator wrote:

double quotation markWe told Trump his tariffs were illegal, dumb, and harmful to families, farms, and small businesses. Americans don't want tariffs, they want lower costs. Go back to square 1 and focus on US – not overseas invasions!

Dave Townsend, a lead attorney at Dorsey & Whitney who represents the US and foreign clients in trade litigation and disputes, said that it was “hard to overstate” the scale of the IEEPA tariffs as “they touch virtually every industry in one way or another”.

“Never in US history have tariffs been imposed by the executive branch so broadly. And likewise never in US history has a court invalidated tariffs on such a grand scale,” he added.

On the key question of refunds for those subjected to the now-invalidated IEEPA tariffs, Townsend noted that there are more than 2,000 lawsuits have already been brought seeking refunds, “but this is a small fraction” of US importers that may be entitled to them. A reminder that while that litigation was on pause during the supreme court's deliberation, legal experts say we could now see a “groundswell” of claims following today's ruling.

“The United States has said in litigation that more than 300,000 US importers have paid IEEPA tariffs. There are various ways that the refunds could be issued, and the supreme court did not say how the process should work,” Townsend said.

Mike Pence, the former vice-president during Donald Trump's first administration, welcomed the supreme court's decision that the president's global tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are illegal. 

“Our Supreme Court has reaffirmed that the Constitution grants Congress – not the President – the power to tax,” Pence said in a statement. “With this decision, American families and businesses can breathe a sigh of relief.”

Senator Rand Paul – a Republican who often bucks his party in Congress – welcomed the supreme court's ruling today.

“The Supreme Court makes plain what should have been obvious: ‘The power to impose tariffs is ‘very clearly a branch of the power to tax',” he wrote on social media, referring to the court's decision that Trump could not use the IEEPA and side-step Congress to implement the sweeping global tariffs.

Stephan Becker at Pillsbury notes that the big question is what happens next to the tariffs that are invalidated by the supreme court's ruling today.

“The administration will be keen to maintain the special bilateral agreements it previously struck with countries such as the UK in exchange for reducing tariffs,” Becker said.

He noted that the “broad speculation” is that Donald Trump would try to use the “previously obscure” Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which lets the President impose tariffs up to 15% for up to 150 days to address balance of payments problems. These levies would, however, require Congress's approval to extend beyond the deadline.

“This would allow the administration to quickly impose replacement tariffs while it takes the required procedural steps to impose tariffs under the other statutes,” Becker added.

The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, has said the supreme court's ruling that many of the president's global tariffs are illegal is “a win for the wallets of every American consumer”.

The administration's “chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable”, Schumer said. “Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly.”

Joining the chorus of lawmakers heralding the court's decision today, Schumer called on Donald Trump to “end this reckless trade war for good and finally give families and small businesses the relief they deserve”.

Reporting on international trade

Donald Trump is unlikely to abandon his tariff strategy on account of the supreme court ruling, say legal experts.

Basil Woodd-Walker, disputes and investigations partner at global law firm Simmons & Simmon said he can just switch focus from the blanket “liberation day” reciprocal tariffs he opposed on dozens of countries to sectoral tariffs.

“Most commentators had expected the supreme court to strike down Trump's IEEPA tariffs. But President Trump has made it clear that he is not going to abandon his international trade policy, and will find other ways to implement it,” he said. “The US administration may pivot to other tariff regimes or trade barriers to replace the lost income.”

Demonstrators were outside hotel in Washington demanding the release of political prisoners in Azerbaijan

Bodyguards traveling with the Azerbaijani president, who was visiting Washington for the inaugural meeting of Donald Trump's Board of Peace, punched, kicked and chased protesters outside a Washington hotel on Thursday, video footage shows.

Demonstrators calling for the release of political prisoners were driven from the street near the motorcade of Ilham Aliyev, the Azerbaijani leader.

The clashes broke out outside the Waldorf Astoria on Pennsylvania Avenue, blocks from the White House, where Aliyev was staying during an official visit.

Aliyev has spent more than two decades crushing political opposition and dissent in Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan's embassy defended its security personnel in a statement, alleging protesters had “violently attempted to enter the protected area and took offensive actions against the Presidential vehicle” as Aliyev's motorcade approached the hotel.

“The Presidential Security Service had no choice but to immediately intervene,” the statement said, arguing that any attempt to obstruct a protected vehicle carrying a head of state “constitutes a serious security concern”.

The embassy also said its personnel “always operate in strict coordination with the host country”.

Protesters told a sharply different story. Rahim Yagublu, 27, an Uber driver whose father is a politician imprisoned in Azerbaijan, told the Washington Post he was struck in the jaw and kicked in the stomach. Adil Amrakhly, 35, said he injured his leg fleeing from the guards and that at least four others were hurt.

“We intended to hold a peaceful protest to demand freedom for political prisoners in Azerbaijan,” Amrakhly, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, told the outlet.

Asked for comment, DC Metropolitan police and the US Secret Service referred questions to the state department, which referred questions back to the US Secret Service and the DC Metropolitan police.

Earlier on Thursday, the US Secret Service told the Washington Post the hotel was “part of the event security perimeter” because that was where the Azerbaijani delegation was staying, with its role limited to establishing security infrastructure for visiting heads of state.

The incident drew immediate comparisons to a 2017 confrontation in Washington in which bodyguards for Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, attacked protesters outside the Turkish ambassador's residence, injuring 11 people including a police officer. A similar altercation involving Erdoğan's security detail had occurred the previous year outside the Brookings Institution.

Aliyev was in Washington for the first meeting of Trump's Board of Peace, a new body the US president announced at Davos last month. Trump has described it as having “unlimited potential” to become “the most consequential international body in history”.

The gathering, focused primarily on the fragile Gaza ceasefire and colonial-envisioned reconstruction efforts for the devastated coastal strip, drew more than two dozen world leaders – though some US allies including France, Germany and Italy chose only to attend as observers.

Azerbaijan was among the countries Trump named as having contributed to a $7bn relief package tied to the initiative. On Wednesday, Aliyev posted on social media that he met with the chief executive of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), Elliot Brandt.

            House Speaker Mike Johnson has denied a request for the late Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. to lie in honor at the United States Capitol, citing past precedent over how the deaths of other high-profile figures were handled, according to sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The civil rights icon died this week at the age of 84. Jackson was praised by both Republicans and Democrats alike for his decades of activism and work in politics and international affairs. President Donald Trump repeatedly described Jackson this week as a “good man.”
    


            One of the sources told CNN that the decision to reject the request to lie in honor – which had been made on behalf of Jackson's family – was in keeping with precedent and was not political. The source said that requests for conservative political activist Charlie Kirk and former Vice President Dick Cheney were also denied, and that the general practice is for presidents, select military officials and select government officials to lie in honor. It was last done for former President Jimmy Carter.
    


            Lying in honor generally involves laying the casket of the deceased in the Rotunda of the US Capitol, where the public can come and offer final respects.
    


            Jackson's family has announced that next week, he will lie in repose at Rainbow PUSH headquarters in Chicago. That will be followed by formal services in his home state of South Carolina and in Washington, DC.
    


            Jackson, a fiery orator whose worked shaped the Democratic Party and America, twice made a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, inspiring Black America and stunning some with his ability to attract White voters. He rose to national prominence in the 1960s as a close aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
    


            His Rainbow Coalition, an alliance of Blacks, Whites, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans and LGBTQ people, helped pave the way for a more progressive Democratic Party.

The Trump administration's attacks on journalists have a side effect: further exposing the violence of prisons.

For decades, corporate media and elected officials have shown little interest in reporting by incarcerated individuals on the unchecked inhumane treatment and deplorable conditions inside U.S. jails, detention centers, and prisons.

But as a result of the Trump administration's escalation of anti-immigrant violence and efforts to quell all dissent, professional journalists and writers, who normally are severely restricted from entering into the U.S.'s carceral facilities, are now themselves experiencing the harsh realities that nearly 2.1 million incarcerated people are subjected to daily in this country.

Inadvertently, this inside view has reaffirmed what incarcerated journalists have long reported: rampant deprivation of basic human necessities, denial of due process, medical neglect, and an unrestrained culture of blatant cruelty. It has also prompted renewed scrutiny of U.S. law enforcement, as well as both public and private prison agencies' treatment of those under their control.

British journalist Sami Hamdi was traveling the country on a valid U.S. visa for a public speaking tour when he was abducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials at a California airport. The Trump administration revoked Hamdi's visa in response to a campaign by far right social media influencers who didn't like Hamdi's criticism of Israel's genocide in Gaza. For more than two weeks, Hamdi endured the trauma of being held in multiple ICE jails.

“It felt unreal, almost like being in a movie,” Hamdi told Truthout in a recent interview.

Hamdi described being treated like a subhuman during his detention by ICE officials. In addition to being held in painfully tight shackles for days, with his pleas to loosen them ignored, Hamdi said he and others were denied access to legal representation and medical treatment — people had to feign life-or-death emergencies to have a chance at seeing a medical professional.

Hamdi also told Truthout how he was forced to sleep in filthy, overcrowded cells, and to consume rotten food that made him violently ill. Others told him that experience was common for new detainees whose stomachs had not adjusted to their new diets. Since Hamdi's time in ICE custody, many others, including 5-year old Liam Conejo Ramos and other young children, have reportedly suffered similar reactions to the contaminated food served in ICE facilities. Ramos's case brought special attention to the conditions at the Dilley immigration jail, but those conditions are not unique, within ICE jails or the U.S. carceral system more broadly.

Hamdi's story also resembles the account of Mario Guevara, a journalist originally from El Salvador who had resided in the U.S. legally for over 20 years. Arrested by local law enforcement officials in Georgia while covering a “No Kings” protest, ICE took him into their custody. He spent months in multiple immigration jails before being illegally deported back to the country from which he fled political prosecution decades earlier.

“I don't know why ICE wants to continue treating me like a criminal,” Guevara wrote in a letter to the news outlet The Bitter Southerner during his detention. “It pains me to know that I have been denied every privilege and the right to be free when I have never committed any crime.”

Guevara wrote about how ICE officials unjustly held him in solitary confinement and denied him due process. Upon his release, Guevara stated he had to seek mental health treatment and start taking psychiatric medication to treat bouts of depression and recurring nightmares.

Then there's the appalling abduction of Rümeysa Öztürk, a doctorate student at Tufts University. After co-authoring an op-ed for her campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, that acknowledged the genocide in Gaza, Öztürk was grabbed off the streets by ICE agents. The deportation case against Öztürk was finally thrown out earlier this month, almost a year after her abduction, but the administration still could seek review of that decision.

For the next five months, Öztürk, a Fulbright scholar, was shackled and transferred to ICE jails as far away as Louisiana. While not a career journalist herself, Öztürk also shared alarming accounts of torturous treatment during her detention.

“I could have never imagined such an ordeal when I first came to the United States in 2018 to pursue my graduate studies, learn and grow as a scholar, and contribute to the child development field,” Öztürk wrote in an essay for Vanity Fair titled “God Cannot Hear Us Here: What I Witnessed Inside an ICE Woman's Prison.”

These horrors aren't exclusively reserved for non-citizens like Hamdi, Guevara, and Öztürk, who, it is important to note, had visas or work permits. U.S. citizens have suffered the same fate.

Steve Held, a Chicago-based journalist and co-founder of Unraveled Press, was detained by federal agents outside an ICE facility while reporting on a protest in September. His captors apparently realized what authorities elsewhere did not — when you lock up a journalist, they're likely to report what they see. Their solution, however, was not to change their practices, but to tape up the windows of Held's cell so he couldn't see out.

The accounts of people being detained by ICE show how being held for months or even years before being afforded an opportunity to challenge one's detention before a judge comes with serious personal, financial, and social costs. But their experience is not new. A significant number of U.S. citizens endure this daily all across the country.

Civil liberties organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union have condemned the practice of holding people in prolonged detention before trial. The “guilty until proven innocent” approach violates core principles of the U.S. Constitution.

Recalling his arrest, Hamdi said, “An agent grabbed me from behind, threw me against the car, handcuffed me tightly and tossed me in the vehicle. I repeatedly stated, I had not committed a crime … They would not let me call my attorneys or family. It was a very surreal experience.”

According to a report by the Prison Policy Initiative, in 2023, nearly 70 percent of the national jail population were pretrial detainees. There are now tens of thousands of people being detained by ICE without a deportation order. Like other U.S. jails, ICE jails lack programming or educational opportunities, limit people's access to legal representation, and provide low-quality food and health care, while caging humans in substandard living conditions.

Adding insult to injury, pretrial and pre-deportation hearing detentions induce lost wages, destabilization of family structures, physical and mental health complications, and the countless other adverse effects of being treated like a criminal, like pleading guilty to a crime or agreeing to a deportation despite supposedly having the law on your side. The lack of due process combined with the inhumane treatment chips at their morale. “All of us were losing hope and parts of who we are,” Öztürk wrote.

“The burden of being stuck indoors and cut off from our everyday lives was heavy for everyone,” she added. “It took a toll on growth, career prospects, dreams, and our wellbeing.”

Hamdi described how an elderly man from Uzbekistan who had been broken by 13 months of ICE detention confided in him that he was ready to volunteer for deportation back to his impoverished country, despite knowing he would be able to win his case in court.

“You can have this country,” Hamdi said the Uzbek man confessed.

At the beginning of an ABC News documentary called No Way Out about the failed response to the COVID-19 pandemic by Texas prisons (where I've spent almost three decades), you can hear me say, “We can't breathe!”

Those words were not mere hyperbole. They described the suffocatingly inhumane living conditions and outright cruelty inside Texas prisons.

My outcry was a product of watching healthy people die in record numbers from medical neglect after contracting the COVID-19 virus; of witnessing suicide after suicide because incarcerated individuals were being denied mental health access; of making unanswered pleas for help because we were being denied basic human necessities like toilet paper, soap, and deodorant; of consuming inedible, unhealthy food day after day.

That documentary failed to compel any meaningful change in the Texas prison system. Suicides and homicides have only increased annually. Incarcerated individuals are still dying or suffering lifelong health issues as a result of a lack of access to adequate mental health and medical services. New punitive rules have been implemented that interrupt communication with loved ones and destroy healthy family bonds. The food remains repulsive and the mentalities of the prison guards are as harsh as ever. People are dying to get out, literally.

“A decade ago, two killings, a suspected drug overdose, and a suicide at a single prison in less than two weeks would have been unthinkable,” investigative journalist Keri Blakinger wrote for the Houston Chronicle back in September about events at a prison in Livingston, Texas.

Those same conditions fueling the crisis in Texas exist at prisons and jails nationwide — including ICE facilities.

Öztürk wrote that people arrived “in relatively good health, but their conditions deteriorated day by day due to inadequate access to medical care, nutritious food, sleep, sunlight, and fresh air.”

Federal agents won't even provide treatment for journalists they shoot, like Los Angeles TikTok reporter Carlitos Ricardo Parias. Charges that Parias rammed his vehicle into an immigration officer's car prior to the shooting last June were later thrown out because the government's story was not credible. But his lawyer told a judge he was denied pain medication for his wounds for hours. Adam Rose of the Freedom of the Press Foundation (who is also the press rights chair of the Los Angeles Press Club) says Parias needed morphine but was denied even ibuprofen, and the neglect continued even after a judge ordered treatment.

Hamdi described how ICE officials dehumanized people being detained to the extent that some had to take mental health medication just to survive. “Breathing inside the detention center was hard, both symbolically and physically,” Öztürk expressed in her essay.

The pesky question now is why as a nation the United States allows such models of cruelty to exist?

One theory is the phenomenon called “moral panics.” Moral panics occur when authority figures, including members of law enforcement and politicians, select a handful of true anecdotes concerning a particular kind of behavior by a particular group of people and work with the media to create a society-wide frenzy.

For example, during the Biden administration, far right media personalities and legacy media outlets focused their coverage on isolated incidents of undocumented immigrants committing horrendous crimes, curating a misleading narrative that undocumented immigrants were uniquely responsible for crime in the United States.

In spite of seemingly unlimited data to refute this notion, this false narrative became a cornerstone for Donald Trump's presidential campaign and propelled him back into the Oval Office.

After his election, President Trump and his surrogates continue to peddle the same falsehood with the help of the media. They called undocumented immigrants murderers, rapists, violent gang members, and drug traffickers who had to be removed from the country at all costs.

That big, beautiful lie led to the creation and passage of Trump's first legislative achievement, the Big Beautiful Bill (BBB).

Instead of allocating funds to help people who are struggling to obtain basic necessities like housing, food, and health care, the BBB appropriated a record $170 billion toward criminalizing immigrants. Forty-five billion is reserved exclusively to build more immigration jails. This legislation increased ICE's budget by 265 percent and its bed space from 40,000 to 160,000. According to The Marshall Project, 85 percent of current and future bed spaces will be housed in private prisons, which a 2026 report from the Prison Policy Initiative revealed rake in $2.4 billion in taxpayer money annually.

These moral panics also work to generate consent for something more sinister: criminalization — the process by which populations are deemed unworthy of their rights and worthy of punishment. The state uses criminalization to redirect its responsibility for the social problems it causes — economic crisis, poverty, displacement, war — onto populations which are often the victims of state policies, and to justify the harms of policing and incarceration.

The framing of undocumented immigrants as criminals has permitted ICE agents to unleash unprecedented violent tactics on all immigrants, or mere visitors from abroad — including journalists like Hamdi.

The U.S. public should be reminded that this is the same rhetorical strategy used by the Reagan and Bush administrations' failed “war on drugs” and the “super-predators” sham to demonize young Black males perpetuated by the Clintons.

These administrations contributed to the U.S. becoming the world's leader in incarcerating its own citizens and resulted in the public's general desensitization to how caged humans are treated. Now, more journalists are seeing it for themselves.

The Trump administration's approach toward quelling dissent with brute force is uncharted territory, but the inhumane treatment of those in U.S. custody is routine.

This is why, as an incarcerated journalist who has devoted the past 20 years attempting to educate society on the culture of unchecked cruelty that exists inside these walls of the nation's jails, detention centers, and prisons, I am encouraged by the assistance these worthy causes are receiving from my colleagues like Hamdi, Guevara, Held, and Öztürk, and for the media outlets that are providing space for these stories. As Öztürk put it, all we want is “to be seen as humans again.”

What's happening inside these places should not just alarm society as a whole, but should mobilize us into action, especially those who want to further the cause of liberation. That includes joining and supporting civil liberties organizations, mutual aid groups led by prisoners, campaigns against jail construction and expansion, legal support groups, and journalism outlets like the nonprofit I founded to empower incarcerated journalists and highlight their work, JoinJeremy.

“They know that it is wrong,” Hamdi told Freedom of the Press Foundation during an online event in November. “They know that if the American public finds out the realities of what's happening, ICE will be dismantled in an instant.”

Hamdi may have overestimated us. The conditions at Dilley have been widely reported lately, but so far there has been no dismantling. Instead, the administration plans to expand ICE's capacity to warehouse people. Hopefully the talented writers who now know firsthand of the horrors that expansion will bring can help persuade the public to finally recognize the injustices currently exemplified by ICE jails but equally prevalent across all carceral institutions. 

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

England's Hull Kingston Rovers on Thursday overcame a ferocious second-half fightback by Australian NRL champions Brisbane Broncos to win rugby league's World Club Challenge 30-24.

Reigning Super League title-holders Hull KR, once on the brink of going out of business before winning a domestic treble last season, led by 26 points early in the second half.

Mikey Lewis' kicking game led to a succession of Broncos' errors, with tries from Tom Amone, Elliot Minchella and Joe Burgess leaving Hull KR 18-4 ahead at halftime in front of their own fans.

Gehamat Shibasaki scored the Broncos' lone try before the break against a Hull KR side transformed after starting their Super League title defense with a shock loss to promoted York City Knights last week.

Any thoughts of a fightback by Brisbane, playing their first match since beating Melbourne Storm in the NRL Grand Final in October last year, appeared fanciful as Hull KR's Oliver Gildart and Peta Hiku added further tries in the second half to extend the hosts' lead to 30-4. Yet the Broncos, who came from behind three times in last year's NRL final series, hit back with four tries in 16 minutes through Patrick Carrigan, Deine Mariner, Shibasaki and Kotoni Staggs to the despair of Robins supporters at the MKM Stadium in Hull, but the increasingly exhausted hosts clung on as they became the first club since Wigan in 2024 to hold the four major titles an English club can win at once.

Australia completed a 3-0 Ashes series clean sweep of England in November last year, reinforcing concerns about a gap in standards between two of the 13-a-side code's leading nations, but Hull KR coach Willie Peters told the BBC: “I'm proud of everyone involved in our club. I'm happy for our owner Neil Hudgell and the people of Hull. We had a responsibility for more than our local community, it was for Super League and the British game, and we did them proud.”

Brisbane Broncos coach Michael Maguire had no complaints about the outcome.

“They came out quick and fast, and we made some errors in the first part of the game and put pressure on ourselves,” Maguire said. “We conceded some soft tries, but you've got to respect everything in the game. It's a good wake-up call and a realization of what this game demands.”


ADVANTAGE ATLETICO:
                                        Well off the pace in La Liga, the Copa del Rey represents Atletico Madrid's best chance of silverware this season                                        Atletico Madrid on Thursday hammered Copa del Rey holders Barcelona 4-0 in the first leg of their semi-final.
After an Eric Garcia own-goal sent Diego Simeone's side ahead early on, Antoine Griezmann, Ademola Lookman and Julian Alvarez struck to give Atletico a landslide lead by halftime.
Barca defender Garcia was sent off in the final stages, with Atletico maintaining their significant advantage on the record 32-time winners, which they take into the second leg at the Camp Nou on March 3.
Both sides missed good chances in the second half, with Barca's Pau Cubarsi having a goal disallowed before Garcia was sent off                                    


‘EVERYONE SAW': 
                                         The visitors were left fuming after Jules Kounde was fouled by Claudio Echeverri in the buildup to the winning goal and it went unpunished                                        Spanish champions Barcelona on Monday fell to a damaging 2-1 defeat at Girona to leave them trailing Real Madrid by two points at the top of La Liga.
Los Blancos beat Real Sociedad on Saturday to overtake the Catalans and Hansi Flick's side could not defeat Girona in an gripping derby clash to reclaim the lead.
Teenage star Lamine Yamal missed a penalty for Barcelona, who took the lead through defender Pau Cubarsi just before the hour mark.
However, goals from Thomas Lemar and Fran Beltran helped Girona, 12th, mount an impressive comeback.
“In the end Girona deserved it, they had a lot of                                    



                                                                                Stade Rennais, four days after firing coach Habib Beye, stunned Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 on Friday, snapping the defending champions' seven-match winning run in French Ligue 1. 
Second-placed RC Lens could leapfrog the champions and retake top spot last night after press time if they beat Paris FC in the capital. 
PSG started brightly, with Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue carving openings to no avail. 
Rennes fired Beye on Monday and promoted his assistant Sebastien Tambouret, and the same players who had lost four games on the bounce seemed transformed. 
Jordanian forward Mousa al-Tamari bagged the opener, unleashing a fierce strike                                    



                                                                                Amanda Anisimova on Monday was handed a walkover into the last 16 of the Dubai Open after her opponent Barbora Krejcikova was forced to withdraw from the WTA 1000 event.
The American second seed enters the round-of-16 against Janice Tjen without swinging a racket as two-time Grand Slam winner Krejcikova pulled out due to an issue with her left thigh.
They became the seventh and eighth players to pull out, a list that includes the world top two Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek.
Tjen booked her meeting with Anisimova thanks to a 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 win in her round-of-32 match against 2021 US

Lori Chavez-DeRemer faces allegations of misconduct at the agency, and her husband faces sexual assault allegations.

Lori Chavez-DeRemer's tenure as head of the US Department of Labor was further embroiled in scandal on Thursday after bombshell New York Times reporting revealed that her husband has been banned from the agency's headquarters over sexual assault allegations leveled by at least two staffers.

The reporting landed on the same day that a group of Senate Democrats launched an investigation into Chavez-DeRemer's policy moves at the Labor Department, accusing her agency of showing “disregard for workers' lives” by “rolling back protections that keep workers safe and hobbling the agency that is tasked with overseeing worker safety.”

The sexual assault allegations against the labor secretary's husband, Shawn DeRemer, were made by two women “as part of an internal investigation by the department's inspector general into alleged misconduct by Ms. Chavez-DeRemer and her senior staff,” the Times reported Thursday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter and a police report.

“The widening misconduct scandal at the Labor Department has forced several aides and members of the security staff in Ms. Chavez-DeRemer's inner circle onto administrative and investigative leave,” the newspaper continued. “The inspector general's office is investigating a formal complaint that Ms. Chavez-DeRemer was having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a subordinate — a member of her security detail — and abusing her office by taking staff to strip clubs, drinking alcohol on the job, and taking personal trips at taxpayer expense. Her lawyer has denied the allegations.”

“This is Trump's America,” retired US diplomat Ken Fairfax wrote in response to the reporting.

Meanwhile, Chavez-DeRemer has been playing a central role in what six Senate Democrats characterized as the Trump administration's “attack on workers from all sides.”

In a Thursday letter to Chavez-DeRemer and David Keeling, the assistant secretary of labor for Occupational Safety and Health, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other Democrats expressed alarm over the Labor Department's “ambitious deregulatory agenda that includes many of the regulations that OSHA has promulgated to keep American workers safe.”

The lawmakers pointed specifically to Labor Department efforts to eliminate more than a third of the Mine Safety and Health Administration's offices, roll back “a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites,” and loosen “respirator requirements for workers exposed to dangerous materials like lead, asbestos, and formaldehyde, as well as chemicals known to be carcinogens.”

“But you are not only rolling back rules that protect workers — OSHA also appears to be taking a lighter hand in enforcing even the rules that still exist,” the senators wrote. “According to OSHA statistics comparing the months of April through September 2025 with the same period in 2024, the agency reduced workplace inspections by 20%. Those statistics also show a 42% decrease in the number of ‘willful violations' found during inspections by OSHA during the months of April-September of 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024.”

Chavez-DeRemer was confirmed as labor secretary last year with bipartisan support and a boost from the Teamsters union given some of her past pro-worker stances, such as support for the PRO Act — which she quickly distanced herself from during the confirmation process.

“Chavez-DeRemer refused to commit to supporting a minimum-wage increase, or paid leave for workers,” The Nation‘s John Nichols wrote following her confirmation hearing last February. “And, of course, she unapologetically declared, ‘The right to work is a fundamental tenet of labor laws, where states have a right to choose if they want to be a right-to-work state, and that should be protected.'”

“She has made it abundantly clear that she is not interested in serving as an ally of America's workers or the unions that represent them,” Nichols added. “In the great struggle between the working class and the billionaire class, Chavez-DeRemer has chosen to side with Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and the oligarchs.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

            US Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas is denying that he had an affair with a staffer who died by suicide last year, allegations that have gained new traction in the final days before a March 3 primary election.
    


            Attorney Bobby Barrera, who represents Adrian Aviles, said his client's spouse, Regina Ann Santos-Aviles, had confessed that she had been having an affair with Gonzales in June   2024.
    


            Gonzales denies having had the affair and says he's being blackmailed.
    


            Santos-Aviles, a former staffer in Gonzales' district office in Uvalde, Texas, died in September, according to CNN affiliate KENS. The county medical examiner ruled that she died of self-immolation and listed her manner of death as suicide.
    


            Barrera added that Santos-Aviles in 2024, showed text messages to her husband that revealed the extent of the affair. While Barrera described the messages as “substantial,” “graphic” and “detailed about the sexual relationship” that allegedly occurred between Santos-Aviles and Gonzales, he said it was up to Aviles to release the messages because of their sensitive nature.
    


            Gonzales is in the midst of a tough GOP primary fight against Brandon Herrera, a YouTube personality who ran against him in 2024. Gonzales, who beat Herrera in a runoff two years ago by 354 votes, insists that Herrera is behind the reports of an affair.
    


            In November, the lawmaker dismissed rumors of an affair in an interview with Punchbowl News and said the “rumors are completely untruthful.”
    


            He told CNN in a statement Thursday: “Ms. Santos-Aviles was a kind soul who devoted her life to making the community a better place. Her efforts led to improvements in school safety, healthcare, and rural water like never before. It's shameful that Brandon Herrera is using a disgruntled former staffer to smear her memory and score political points, conveniently pushing this out the very day early voting started. I am not going to engage in these personal smears and instead will remain focused on helping President Trump secure the border and improve the lives of all Texans.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Herrera for comment. In a post on X this week, Herrera wrote: “You blame me? Are you kidding me?”
    


            “Tony Gonzales is an irredeemable coward, who dodges accountability and lies to the people,” Herrera added. “This started with my problems with your votes in Congress, but now I understand you are a horrifically wicked man who must be removed.”
    


            The allegations from the attorney for Santos-Aviles' husband follow a report in the San Antonio Express-News that said Santos-Aviles told a former employee of Gonzales' district office, whom she worked closely with, about the affair. The San Antonio Express-News spoke with the unnamed former employee and cited a text message from Santos-Aviles in which she said she was having an “affair with our boss.”
    


            Barrera told CNN that Adrian Aviles did not originally want to go public with his allegations but did so following the report, because he did not like that Gonzales had denied the   alleged affair.
    


            “Tony is out there in the public domain telling people that never happened, that it's a false, politically hacked campaign against him, which Adrian knew was not true. That's why Adrian spoke out when he did finally,” he said.
    


            Gonzales, in a Thursday post on X, also accused Barrera of blackmailing him. “I WILL NOT BE BLACKMAILED. Disgusting to see people profit politically and financially off a tragic death,” he wrote. The congressman included a screenshot of an email from Barrera offering to engage in settlement talks with a non-disclosure agreement – saying it is not his intention to damage the congressman's career by filing a claim.
    


            Barrera called Gonzales' post  “a desperate act by a desperate man.”
    


            “The assertion of extortion is ridiculous,” he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump holds a chart detailing tariffs, at the White House in Washington, April 2, 2025.Carlos Barria/Reuters

The U.S. Supreme Court has struck down a key pillar of Donald Trump's protectionist trade agenda, ruling that the President acted illegally in using one of his emergency economic powers to impose sweeping tariffs on trade partners last year. 

The 6-3 decision, released Friday, is a major rebuke of the President on a signature economic policy. However, it's only a partial – and likely temporary – setback for the administration. 

Trade experts expect Mr. Trump to rapidly rebuild his tariff wall using other legal tools. And the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles and lumber, which are hitting Canadian trade the hardest, aren't affected by the decision and will remain in place. 

The Supreme Court decision focuses on duties that were imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. These include “fentanyl tariffs” imposed on Canada, Mexico and China, and the “Liberation Day” or “reciprocal” tariffs placed on the rest of the world. 

IEEPA allows the President to take extraordinary steps to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency. Mr. Trump relied on this extensively over the past year to quickly increase tariffs and pressure other countries to cut deals with Washington to avoid further duties.

By mid-December, the U.S. had collected around US$130-billion in tariff revenue using IEEPA. 

IEEPA, however, does not explicitly mention tariffs. The Supreme Court upheld two lower court decisions that found Mr. Trump was misusing the legislation and acting beyond the powers explicitly granted to him by the U.S. Congress.

“Had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs, it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes,” chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court decision. 

“While taxes may accomplish regulatory ends, it does not follow that the power to regulate includes the power to tax as a means of regulation. Indeed, when Congress addresses both the power to regulate and the power to tax, it does so separately and expressly. That it did not do so here is strong evidence that ‘regulate' in IEEPA does not include taxation,” he wrote.

The decision was a major test of the scope of U.S. presidential power, and the role of Congress. In his attempt to overhaul the global trading system and remake parts of the U.S. government, Mr. Trump has wielded executive actions in an unprecedented – almost imperial – manner. 

The Supreme Court pushed back against this, reminding the Trump administration that the President operates within a carefully constructed balance of powers. 

“Against that backdrop of clear and limited delegations, the Government reads IEEPA to give the President power to unilaterally impose unbounded tariffs and change them at will. That view would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy,” the court said. 

“It is also telling that in IEEPA's half century of existence, no President has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope. That ” ‘lack of historical precedent,' coupled with the breadth of authority” that the President now claims, suggests that the tariffs extend beyond the President's ‘legitimate reach'.”

A key question now is what happens to tariff revenue collected using IEEPA. Hundreds of companies reportedly filed lawsuits in U.S. courts ahead of the Supreme Court ruling to try to protect their right to a refund or position themselves at the front of the line for one.

Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's federal minister responsible for North American trade, welcomed the decision.

“The United States Supreme Court's decision reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified,” Mr. LeBlanc said in a statement. He added that “critical work lies ahead to support Canadian businesses and workers who remain affected by Section 232 tariffs on steel, aluminum and automotive sectors.”

Canada has less at stake in the Supreme Court decision than some other countries.

It was among the first countries to be hit with IEEPA tariffs last year, when Mr. Trump imposed a 25-per-cent tariff on most Canadian goods – which has since risen to 35 per cent – claiming it was needed to force Ottawa to do more to address fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration. 

However, two days later, the President granted a broad exemption to the “fentanyl tariffs” for Canadian products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on free trade. That carve-out has allowed more than 90 per cent of Canadian exports to continue crossing the border tariff-free, even as some sectors are being hammered by the separate industry-specific tariffs.

As of mid-December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had collected around US$2.4-billion in IEEPA tariff revenue on imports from Canada – less than 2 per cent of the total.

“For Canada, this ruling doesn't eliminate the most significant tariffs currently in place, which are on autos, steel, aluminum, lumber and some copper products,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce wrote in a note to clients.

“But it does remove the threat of that 35 per cent tariff being applied if the US opts to withdraw from the USMCA … So while this isn't a cure for tariffs facing Canada in targeted sectors (and actually provides more immediate relief to Canada's competitors in the US that face reciprocal tariffs on all of their exports) it is nevertheless an improvement in Canada's negotiating position in the upcoming USMCA talks.”

The decision may be more important for other U.S. trade partners, including the European Union, Britain and Japan, which agreed to increase market access and make substantial investments in the U.S. under the threat of escalating IEEPA tariffs. However, they may wait to see what the Trump administration does next before considering reneging on the deals they cut with Washington last year. 

“Call it Liberation Day 2.0 – arguably the first one with tangible upside for U.S. consumers and corporate profitability,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economics at Fitch Ratings said in a statement.

“This is a material rollback: more than 60 per cent of the 2025 tariffs effectively vanish. Mechanically, the U.S. effective tariff rate drops from about 13 per cent to around 6 per cent, removing more than US$200 billion in expected annual tariff collections … However, the bigger macro takeaway is not just ‘lower tariffs,' but ‘higher tariff-regime uncertainty.' The odds that tariffs reappear in a revised form remain meaningful. Layer on potential tariff refunds, and you introduce a messy operational and legal overhang that amplifies economic uncertainty."

Top Trump administration officials have said they have other options to recreate the President's tariff regime if the Supreme Court decision did not go their way.

Twenty-nine ways Trump has changed Canada

Trade experts expect the administration to ramp up the use of sectoral tariffs, which are imposed using Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The U.S. Department of Commerce has already launched a number of additional Section 232 investigations into various industries, including aircraft, critical minerals and pharmaceuticals.

The administration has at least three other laws it could potentially turn to: Section 301 of Trade Act of 1974, which permits country-specific tariffs following an investigation into alleged unfair trading practices; Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows for tariffs up to 15 per cent for 150 days before Congress must vote to extend them; and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which authorizes tariffs of up to 50 per cent in certain circumstances.

Conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh wrote lengthy dissents to the majority opinion. Mr. Thomas argued that, “the power to impose duties on imports is not within the core legislative power” of Congress, which can “therefore delegate the exercise of this power to the President.”

Mr. Kavanaugh argued that the sole question for the court was whether IEEPA confers the power to tariff by granting a president the ability to regulate importation. “Statutory text, history, and precedent demonstrate that the answer is clearly yes: Like quotas and embargoes, tariffs are a traditional and common tool to regulate importation,” Mr. Kavanaugh wrote.

The decision was cheered by business groups on both sides of the border.

“The Supreme Court's decision is welcome news for businesses and consumers,” Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. “We encourage the administration to use this opportunity to reset overall tariff policy in a manner that will lead to greater economic growth, larger wage gains for workers, and lower costs for families.”

Mr. Bradley said the tariffs had led to “significant cost increases and supply-chain disruptions” for small and medium-sized business. He called for “swift” refunds to U.S. importers who had been forced to pay the tariffs.

Candance Laing, president and CEO, Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that this “is a legal ruling, not a reset of U.S. trade policy. This is certainly not the last chapter of this never-ending story.”

She said that Canada should prepare for “new, blunter mechanisms to be used to reassert trade pressure, potentially with broader and more disruptive effects,” and redouble its efforts to diversify trade.

            The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump violated federal law when he unilaterally imposed sweeping tariffs across the globe, a striking loss for the White House on an issue that has been central to the president's foreign policy and economic agenda.
    


            The decision is arguably the most important loss the second Trump administration has sustained at the conservative Supreme Court, which last year repeatedly sided with the president in a series of emergency rulings on immigration, the firing of the leaders of independent agencies and deep cuts to government spending.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion and the court agreed 6-3 that the tariffs exceeded the law. The court, however, did not say what should happen to the more than $130 billion in tariffs that has already been collected.
    


            “The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Roberts wrote for the court. “In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”
    


Trump's emergency tariffs are illegal, Supreme Court rules



            The emergency authority Trump attempted to rely on, the court said, “falls short.”
    


            Trump received the news of the tariffs in a note while he was meeting with governors at the White House on Friday morning.
    


            After he read the note, he said aloud “that's a disgrace” and then left the room shortly after, according a governor in the room.
    


            The president and Justice Department officials had framed the dispute in existential terms for the country, telling the justices that “with tariffs, we are a rich nation” but that without them, “we are a poor nation.” A group of small businesses who challenged the duties similarly warned that Trump's position represented a “breathtaking assertion of power” to effectively levy a tax without oversight from Congress.
    


            Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch joined with Roberts and the three liberal justices in the majority. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.
    


            In his opinion, Roberts brushed aside an argument from the administration that the president had power to use tariffs to regulate commerce. That was an issue that came up during the oral arguments last year as Trump suggested the president had inherent authority to issue the tariffs.
    


            “When Congress grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints,” Roberts wrote. “It did neither here.”
    


            “We claim no special competence in matters of economics or foreign affairs,” Roberts wrote. “We claim only, as we must, the limited role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution. Fulfilling that role, we hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.”
    


            The 6-3 majority offered no clarity on the specific practical question of what to do with the money the administration has already collected through Trump's tariffs. The issue of refunds has loomed large over the case, with Trump administration officials saying that potential repayments could have devastating consequences for the US economy.
    


            As of December 14, the federal government had collected $134 billion in revenue from the tariffs being challenged from over 301,000 different importers, according to United States Customs and Border Protection data as well as a recent filing submitted by the agency to the US Court of International Trade.
    


            That question will likely need to be sorted out by lower courts.
    


            In his dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that the court said “nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers.”
    


            “That process is likely to be a ‘mess,'” Kavanaugh wrote.
    


            “Even though the Supreme Court has already ruled in dozens of cases involving the second Trump administration, those all involved emergency applications; this was the first Trump-related case to which the Court gave full review – and it's an overwhelming loss for Trump on both the specific legal question and the more general ability to broadly use statutes like IEEPA,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
    


            “What that underscores is that, for as controversial as the court's grants of emergency relief to the Trump administration have been over the past 13 months, the court is still willing to assert itself when these cases reach the merits – something that we're likely to see again later this term in the birthright citizenship and Lisa Cook cases.”
    


            The case was the most significant involving the American economy to reach the Supreme Court in years, challenging the legality of Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs, as well as duties he imposed on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. At stake were tens of billions of dollars in revenue the government has already collected.
    


            The so-called “reciprocal” tariffs raised duties as high as 50% on key trading partners, including India and Brazil, and as high as 145% on China in 2025.
    


            Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to levy the import duties at issue in the case. That law allows a president to “regulate … importation” during emergencies. The administration argued the word plainly includes the power to impose tariffs, but the businesses noted that the words “tariff” or “duty” never appear in the law.
    


            That raised a series of difficult questions for the Supreme Court itself, which in case after case involving controversial policies from former President Joe Biden, ruled that an administration cannot take certain executive actions unilaterally without explicit authorization from Congress. That is particularly true, the court repeatedly ruled, when policies involve “major” political or economic questions.
    


            In 2023, for instance, the conservative majority relied on the “major questions doctrine” to block Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. A year earlier, the court stopped Biden's vaccine and testing requirement for 84 million Americans, concluding that Congress never explicitly gave the government the power to demand those measures during the Covid-19 pandemic. Even some conservatives said the same logic should apply when it came to Trump's tariffs.
    


            Trump offered several counter-arguments, most notably that the tariffs implicate foreign affairs, where courts have traditionally referred to the executive branch.
    


            Roberts did not accept that position.
    


            “Taxes, to be sure, may accomplish regulatory ends,” the chief justice wrote. “But it does not follow that the power to regulate something includes the power to tax it as a means of regulation.”
    


            The president has other more established authorities to levy tariffs without input from Congress. But each of those come with strings attached, such as time limits, that would make it harder for Trump to pursue his on-again-off-again strategy of raising and then lowering barriers as a negotiating tactic.
    


            Another provision of law, for instance, clearly allows a president to raise tariffs — but only up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days. Another authority gives the president the power to impose higher tariffs for national security reasons. It can only be used to target specific industries and requires an investigation by the Commerce Department.
    


            Every lower court that has reviewed Trump's emergency tariffs found they violated federal law, though for different reasons. In one case, led by a New York-based wine importer called V.O.S. Selections, the US Court of International Trade concluded in May that IEEPA didn't authorize Trump's emergency duties. That decision was affirmed months later by an appeals court in Washington, DC.
    


            In a separate case, an Illinois-based educational toy company, Learning Resources, sued in a federal district court in Washington, which also ruled against Trump. The case quickly went to the Supreme Court, leapfrogging the DC Circuit.
    


            The courts in both cases put their rulings on hold temporarily, allowing the administration to continue to collect the tariffs while the appeals played out.
    


            A significant question looming over the arguments was whether all businesses would be entitled to tariff payment refunds if the justices rule against the Trump administration's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs.
    


            The filing was in response to a group of importers, including Costco, requesting a preliminary injunction to prevent CBP from finalizing their tariff payments, a process formally known as liquidation. The importers argued that it was imperative for their payments to be unliquidated to get refunds down the road. Their request for a preliminary injunction was denied, however.
    


            The three-panel judge explained that their verdict was supported by the administration's promise to refund IEEPA tariff payments, if it came down to it, even if entries were liquidated. However, the administration has stated that it would likely be a laborious process.
    


            Justice Elena Kagan wrote a concurrence, joined by the two other liberals, to rebuff some of the reasoning that the three conservative justices ruling against Trump put forward for blocking the tariffs.
    


            She specifically took aim at their use of a judicial doctrine known as “major questions,” which says that if Congress is giving the president the power to take an action with major economic or political consequence, it must use specific legislative language saying that it is doing so. The conservative court repeatedly relied on the major questions doctrine to shoot down major policies enacted by the Biden administration, including his efforts to forgive student loans.
    


            Kagan has in the past criticized the conservative majority's use of the major questions doctrines to halt executive actions on environmental regulations. Likewise, she was wary of using that tool to strike down Trump's tariffs, even though she agreed with the decision to do so.
    


            “The use of a clear-statement rule here is unnecessary because ordinary principles of statutory interpretation lead to the same result,” she wrote. ” It is not just that the Government's arguments fail to satisfy an especially strict test; it is that they fail to satisfy the normal one.”
    


            She said that the normal tools of statutory interpretation pointed to the ruling against tariffs, because the relevant law gives the President the emergency authority to “regulate” the importation of goods and nothing in the definition of that word “naturally refers to levying taxes”
    


            For that and other reasons laid out in her concurrence, “straight-up statutory construction resolves this case for me,” Kagan wrote. ” I need no major-questions thumb on the interpretive scales.”
    


            In a rare statement, former Vice President Mike Pence praised the ruling against Trump as “a Victory for the American People and a Win for the Separation of Powers enshrined in the Constitution of the United States.”
    


            “Our Supreme Court has reaffirmed that the Constitution grants Congress – not the President – the power to tax,” Pence wrote in a post on X.
    


            “American families and American businesses pay American tariffs – not foreign countries. With this decision, American families and businesses can breathe a sigh of relief,” the post continues. “With this historic decision, America can now return to the pursuit of Free Trade with Free Nations under the Constitution of the United States!”
    


            GOP Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Don Bacon have both faced the president's ire for criticizing his tariffs and backing legislation aimed at blocking them.
    


            Bacon was one of only a handful of House Republicans to rebuke President Donald Trump's tariffs in a vote on the House floor last week.
    


            “I feel vindicated as I've been saying this for the last 12 months,” Bacon said in a statement. “In the future, Congress should defend its authorities and not just rely on Supreme Court. Besides the Constitutional concerns I had on the Administration's broad-based tariffs, I also do not think tariffs are smart economic policy. Broad-based tariffs are bad economics.”
    


            Shortly after the Supreme Court decision landed, Trump signaled he had a backup plan.
    


            The court only struck down one method for imposing tariffs – the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
    


            There are other provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the Tariff Act of 1930 that he could try. He already used some of these in his first term.
    


Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for example, allows tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days under certain circumstances.
    


            Another possibility is Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, commonly known as “Smoot-Hawley.” It allows tariffs of up to 50% for five months on a country that “discriminates” against US commerce. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cited this as a possible backup.

            When scientists with the National Center for Wildlife in Saudi Arabia were surveying caves in search of wildlife in 2022 and 2023, they came across something unexpected: seven naturally mummified cheetahs in five caves near the northern city of Arar. The remains were largely intact with well-preserved soft tissue and skeletons.
    


            Now, an analysis of three of the mummies' DNA has revealed something that could help reintroduce cheetahs to the Arabian Peninsula wilderness, researchers say.
    


            Cheetahs once inhabited much of Africa and parts of Asia, but now they are found in only 9% of their historic range. It was previously believed that the Asiatic cheetah, called Acinonyx jubatus venaticus, was the only subspecies ever present in Saudi Arabia. The species is now critically endangered, with a small wild population remaining in Iran. Across the peninsula, cheetahs were deemed locally extinct in the 1970s.
    


            But when the researchers analyzed three of the mummies, they found that two of the oldest specimens were genetically closer to the subspecies Acinonyx jubatus hecki, known as the Northwest African cheetah.
    


            The findings, published in January in the journal Communications Earth & Environment,  reveal that at least two subspecies of cheetah once roamed the Arabian Peninsula. The discovery could help reintroduction efforts as scientists now know which cheetah lineages once lived in the peninsula and have evidence of their success in the area.

            “It was highly surprising,” said lead author Ahmed Al Boug, an ecologist researcher and deputy CEO of the National Center for Wildlife in Saudi Arabia. “This finding represents the first documented case of natural mummification in cheetahs, and first physical evidence that cheetah subspecies occurred in the Arabian Peninsula.
    


            “Moreover, cave use by cheetahs is extremely atypical behavior, making both the discovery itself and the context in which it occurred entirely unexpected,” he added in an email.
    


            The researchers are investigating why the cheetahs entered and used the caves; they do not believe it was accidental or for isolation as they neared the end of life. Nonetheless, the cave environment and its hyper-arid conditions contributed to the mummification of the cheetahs, Al Boug said.
    


            Alongside the seven cheetah mummies, the researchers came across skeletal remains of 54 additional cats within the caves. The study authors dated five of them and found the oldest to be about 4,000 years old. Two mummies that were analyzed date from about 130 to 1,870 years ago, according to the study. The authors plan to investigate further the remaining mummies and skeleton fragments to potentially identify the subspecies of additional samples, Al Boug said.
    


            “This discovery is significant in that it represents the easternmost record of an African cheetah subspecies and demonstrates that northern Saudi Arabia was occupied by multiple cheetah lineages over millennia,” Al Boug said. “Together, these findings refine our understanding of cheetah landscape use, clarify timelines of regional extirpation, and improve resolution on the subspecies historically present in this region.”
    


            To identify the subspecies of the mummified cheetahs, the authors extracted complete genome sequences from three of the seven remains. It was the first time DNA has been extracted  from naturally mummified cheetahs or large felines, according to a news release from the journal.
    


            Adrian Tordiffe, a veterinary wildlife specialist based in India, said it is surprising that some of the cheetah remains were only about a century old as it reveals that these cats lived in Saudi Arabia far more recently than people realized.
    


            “Even more striking is that the remains show different subspecies of cheetahs lived there at different times,” said Tordiffe, also a lecturer at South Africa's University of Pretoria, in an email. He was not involved with the study.
    


            “This tells us the Arabian Peninsula was once an important natural bridge for cheetahs, not an ecological dead end.”
    


Arabian oryx: Back from the brink



            Tordiffe added that the discovery gives conservationists clear evidence of what species lived in the area in a not-so-distant past. “Because we now know which cheetah lineages lived in Arabia, reintroduction efforts can focus on using animals that are ecologically appropriate, rather than bringing in cheetahs from completely different environments.
    


            “The remains also include young animals and adults, showing that cheetahs weren't just passing through, they were breeding and thriving. That tells us the landscape once supported full cheetah populations, especially alongside prey species like gazelles, which are now being successfully restored in Saudi Arabia. This research turns cheetah reintroduction from a hopeful idea into a well-informed plan based on real evidence,” Tordiffe said.
    


            Wildlife populations in the Arabian Peninsula were historically diminished  by the impact of humans, including overhunting and land-use changes, Al Boug said. But now, with large, protected areas in the Middle East, many of the primary threats to cheetahs, such as habitat degradation, human disturbance and competition with lions have been reduced, he added. As a result, Al Boug said he believes that Saudi Arabia is well-positioned to support the recovery of a species once widespread across the region.
    


Animal sacrifices and astral tombs: The mysteries still emerging from the Saudi deserts



            “Showing the length of time the cheetah lived in Saudi Arabia shows that they were an important part of the ecosystem and not just passing through,” said Laurie Marker, founder and executive director of the Cheetah Conservation Fund, a nonprofit that acts to prevent the extinction of cheetahs. Marker was not involved with the new study, but the fund is partnered with the National Center for Wildlife for cheetah reintroduction efforts in Saudi Arabia.
    


            “Cheetahs and other top predators play important roles in the ecosystem. Cheetahs are great hunters and eat rapidly then   also leave remains for feeding other species. Therefore where we find top predators there is a greater amount of biodiversity as they feed the other small mammals, birds and insects,” she added in an email.
    


            “As the Saudis are bringing back their wildlife species, the cheetah will be an important addition to rewilding, bringing back a healthy ecosystem to the desert once again.”

The European Commission would welcome Ukraine resuming operations on the Druzhba oil pipeline, but the final decision rests with Kyiv due to ongoing security risks from Russian attacks, spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said on Feb. 20.

The statement comes as tensions rise over the pipeline's suspension since late January, after Russian strikes damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure. 

The disruption has strained Ukraine's relations with Hungary and Slovakia, which remain dependent on Russian oil delivered through the system.

"We would welcome the reactivation of the pipeline... as far as we know, the Ukrainian government is committed to repairing the pipeline," Itkonen said during a briefing. 

"But the decision is for Ukraine only, whether and when to repair it."

The remarks show the EU's balancing act between supporting Ukraine amid Russia's war and addressing energy concerns among member states still reliant on Russian supplies.

Itkonen said the Commission has held frequent talks this week with Hungarian, Slovak, and Croatian counterparts. The bloc's Ad Hoc Oil Coordination Group will meet on Feb. 25 to assess the situation.

Hungary and Slovakia accused Kyiv of withholding transit for political reasons and escalated the dispute by announcing on Feb. 18 a halt to diesel exports to Ukraine.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, whose government is up for re-election in April, accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of deliberately undermining Hungary's energy security.

"President Volodymyr Zelensky has decided not to restart oil transit for political reasons," he said.

Budapest and Bratislava have sought alternative routes, asking Croatia to facilitate deliveries via the Adria pipeline. Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said Zagreb refused to transport Russian oil.

The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest oil networks with a capacity of about two million barrels per day, remains a critical supply route for Hungary and Slovakia — the only EU countries still importing Russian crude through the system.

Ukraine has argued that continued reliance on Russian energy undermines efforts to cut off funding for Moscow's war, while Russian strikes — and Kyiv's own attacks on energy infrastructure inside Russia — have further complicated the pipeline's future.

According to Ukraine, at least 322 Ukrainian prisoners of war had been executed by Russian forces as of Oct. 6.

 In December 2023, Hlib Benia, a Ukrainian soldier with the 79th Separate Air Assault Brigade, was delivering supplies to his comrades when Russian FPV (first-person view) drones struck. Two of his fellow soldiers were killed. He survived but lost an arm and a leg.

GENEVA, February 20. /TASS/. Even as Geneva served as the most recent venue for negotiations on Ukraine, Russia does not view Switzerland as the best country to hold talks in, Russian ambassador in Bern Sergey Garmonin said.

The diplomat admitted that Bern "is more restrained in comparison with a number of other Western nations" in the conflict in Ukraine, so Switzerland "can be looked at as a possible negotiating platform equal to other countries."

"But at the same time, it cannot be perceived as an 'honest broker' or a preferred location for negotiations," he said.

Mayor says Japanese city will respect donor's specification that £2.7m gift must be used to repair dilapidated system

Osaka has received a hefty gift of gold bars worth 560m yen (£2.7m) from an anonymous donor and a request for its specific use: to fix the Japanese city's dilapidated water pipes.

The gold bars, weighing a total of 21kg (46lb), were given to the Osaka City Waterworks Bureau in November by the donor who wants to help improve ageing water pipes, the mayor, Hideyuki Yokoyama, told reporters on Thursday.

“It's a staggering amount and I was speechless,” Yokoyama said. “Tackling ageing water pipes requires a huge investment, and I cannot thank enough for the donation.”

The mayor said the city –Japan's third largest, with 2.8 million people – would respect the donor's wishes and use the gift to improve waterworks projects.

Most of Japan's main public infrastructure was built during the rapid postwar economic growth, but urban development in Osaka, a regional commercial hub, started earlier than many and its water pipes and other infrastructure are ageing earlier, the city's waterworks official, Eiji Kotani, said.

Osaka needed to renew 160 miles (260km) of water pipes, he said. Renewing a 1.2 mile segment would cost about 500m yen, Kotani said.

Osaka had 92 cases of water pipe leaks under city roads in the fiscal year ending March 2025, Kotani said.

Concern over the safety of Japan's waterworks systems grew after a truck fell into a sinkhole last year, killing the driver. It was linked to a damaged sewer in Saitama, north of Tokyo.

You can go halfway around the world to escape Donald Trump and still not succeed. 

The man is a world disrupter. But I can say with confidence that, after spending a few weeks here and in New Zealand and meeting people hailing from all over the place – from Indonesia and Mexico to India and Kenya – that the U.S. President has put Brand America in deep, deep trouble.

Mr. Trump has succeeded in making people around the world not only loathe him but his country as well. Those I talked to want nothing to do with the U.S. and are astonished that a country that not so long ago was seen as that bright, shining city upon a hill that former president Ronald Reagan loved to talk about has allowed itself to fall into such disrepute – and at the hands of a corrupt, mendacious grifter, no less. A country that once sold hope to the world now exports a petty, mean-spirited cruelty instead.

Even many Americans are ashamed of America. In our travels, my wife and I encountered people from the U.S. who, upon learning we were from Canada, fell over themselves to apologize for the actions of their President. They lamented what Mr. Trump has done to the reputation of their country globally, not to mention the lasting damage he's done to it domestically.

Opinion: Can the U.S. finally just shut up about Canada's defence spending?

One Vermont businessman told us over dinner one night that he wasn't sure about what would be left of his country by the next presidential election. While he was hopeful that the Democrats could win back Congress in the midterm elections to slow the horror the President has unleashed, he told us that he fears Mr. Trump might just nationalize the voting system, as he has threatened, and rig the whole thing.

That conversation came a day after Mr. Trump posted a video that portrayed former U.S. president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, as apes in a jungle.

We were also shocked, but heartened, by how many people we encountered who were aware of how Mr. Trump has menaced Canada. Even more so, we couldn't believe how many had high praise for Prime Minister Mark Carney, from tour guides to servers in restaurants. A Melbourne taxi driver who had recently immigrated from Laos told us that he was impressed by Mr. Carney's speech at the World Economic Forum – and he wasn't the only one who cited that pivotal and widely heralded moment in Davos.

We also discovered that wearing the Canadian flag grants you much sympathy. Though this shouldn't be a great surprise: Most people are good, decent folk who recognize evil and malevolence when they see it. 

Even though we were so far removed from the fiery cauldron that is life in North America, next door to the suddenly terrifying, unpredictable monster that is the U.S. under Mr. Trump, it was impossible to avoid hearing about the mind-numbing developments in America.

Opinion: Trump's designation of fentanyl as a ‘weapon of mass destruction' hangs over Canadian banks

Every day it was something new, something as abjectly depressing as the day before. For instance, even a few years ago, it was impossible to imagine a U.S. President officially disassociating his country from the scientific finding that climate change endangers human health – a conclusion the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency used to justify regulations to limit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Now that is – poof – gone. With one signature from DJT, American companies can now pollute like they used to.

It's no wonder the world shakes its head in disbelief. No wonder people from countries around the world are distancing themselves from anything to do with America, including its most high-profile companies. Tesla car sales in Europe, for instance, effectively collapsed last year. Hard not to connect that phenomenon with the company's owner, Elon Musk, who took a chainsaw to the Washington bureaucracy in the service of Mr. Trump and continues to be the President's supporter after a brief falling-out.

Mr. Trump is building a wall around the U.S., and many people are happy to stay out, to do business and form new alliances with others. The world appears to be slowly turning its back on America.

One day in a hotel elevator, I had a conversation with an Australian woman who was in Sydney for a business conference. She mistook my accent for American, and asked me which part of the States I was from.

“Oh, I'm from Canada, not the U.S.,” I replied. 

She apologized. She said it was probably the worst thing she could've said to me – or to anybody, really. And in this worrying new world, she's right.

Ten people were detained in Moldova and Ukraine for allegedly plotting contract killings of prominent Ukrainians on Russia's orders, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Feb. 20.

The Moldovan Police and Ukrainian law enforcement agencies announced a day earlier that they had launched a criminal investigation into an alleged plot to assassinate several public figures in Ukraine. The probe is being carried out by a joint investigative team formed by the two countries.

The operation, codenamed "Enigma 2.0," was carried out jointly by the SBU, Ukraine's National Police, and Moldova's Police.

The suspects were reportedly planning attacks targeting Ukrainian journalists, public activists, the head of a strategic enterprise, and personnel of Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR), including members of the International Legion, according to the SBU.

Andrii Yusov, representative for strategic communications at the Main Intelligence Directorate, deputy head of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, was one of the targets of the attackers, Prosecutor General Ruslan Kravchenko said.

The suspects considered various assassination methods, including shootings and car bombings. The Russian organizers of the alleged plot promised payments of up to $100,000 for each target, the report read. 

In a joint operation, Ukrainian and Moldovan law enforcement agencies arrested the alleged leader of a criminal group — a 34-year-old man — along with several accomplices operating in Ukraine, EU member states and Transnistria, a Kremlin-occupied region in Moldova.

The SBU said the leader had been recruited by Russian special services while serving a prison sentence in Russia. He was tasked with forming and coordinating the group under Moscow's supervision.

The network was divided into surveillance and assassination teams. Some members entered Ukraine as tourists and stayed in rented apartments across different regions.

The suspects allegedly used cryptocurrency wallets and foreign bank cards to finance preparations. To monitor potential targets, agents posed as delivery couriers, conducted photo and video surveillance, marked geolocations on digital maps, and reported to their coordinator.

The detainees have been charged with preparation for premeditated murder and illegal weapons. They face potential life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

Ukraine's National Police described the case as an example of effective international cooperation against hybrid threats.

"Russian aggression takes many forms — from open military action to attempts to destabilize the country from within. Accountability for these crimes is inevitable," the Prosecutor General's Office said on Telegram.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Kyiv has repeatedly accused Russian intelligence services of orchestrating assassination attempts and sabotage operations inside the country.

A Polish court sentenced a Polish citizen to 3.5 years in prison on Feb. 3 for allegedly offering to assist Russia in a plan to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The operation, codenamed "Enigma 2.0," was carried out jointly by the SBU, Ukraine's National Police, and Moldova's Police.

"They told us: 'We are ready not to occupy your other regions.' But that is terrorism… 'I am ready not to kill you, just give us everything,'" Zelensky said.

Russia launched an Iskander ballistic missile and 128 drones at Ukraine during the night, the Air Force reported.

Ukraine is ready for "real compromises" in peace talks but will not accept conditions that undermine its sovereignty, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Kyodo News published on Feb. 20.

His remarks come as negotiations with Moscow remain deadlocked, with Russia maintaining maximalist demands, including Ukraine's withdrawal from Donbas, a position Kyiv has rejected.

"We are ready for real compromises," Zelensky said. "But not compromises at the sacrifice of our independence and sovereignty. We are ready to talk about compromises with the U.S."

Zelensky described Ukraine's current stance on a ceasefire as a concession in itself, pointing to Kyiv's willingness to negotiate based on existing front-line positions, without withdrawing.

"'We stand where we stand' is already a major compromise," he said. "They have occupied nearly 20% of our territory, and we are prepared to talk about peace now on the basis of this principle."

He contrasted this with Moscow's position, arguing that Russia has not offered meaningful concessions.

"What are they ready for?" Zelensky said. "They told us: 'We are ready not to occupy your other regions.' But that is terrorism… 'I am ready not to kill you, just give us everything.'"

"It is an ultimatum," he added, emphasizing that Ukraine is willing to consider compromises — but only those that safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity, armed forces, and citizens.

Territorial issues remain the central obstacle in the negotiations. 

Washington has floated alternative arrangements, including a free economic zone in the war-affected region, though Zelensky has indicated that neither side has shown strong support for the idea.

The latest round of talks on Feb. 18 also failed to produce a breakthrough on territory, underscoring how far apart Kyiv and Moscow remain on the future of occupied regions.

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. India has resolved to continue purchasing Russian oil despite US pressure; gas reserves in the EU have fallen to a four-year low, heightening concerns about potential supply shortages and price increases; and the United States is assembling its largest regional naval and air presence since the Iraq invasion near Iran. These stories topped Friday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

India has made a definitive decision regarding Russian energy resources. New Delhi will continue purchasing oil despite pressure from the United States, India's Ambassador to Russia Vinay Kumar told Izvestia. On August 21, the foreign ministers of Russia and India are set to meet in Moscow to discuss deepening their strategic partnership. Earlier, Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Indian imports in response to India's purchases of Russian oil. According to experts, Washington is attempting to leverage these measures to secure more favorable terms and gain broader access to the Indian market.

India is not considering an embargo on Russian oil, Ambassador Vinay Kumar said. "No, India buys what is best for itself. <…> The question is not whether to ban it or not. It is a matter of its security, of the country's economic and energy interests, particularly the energy needs of its people. Therefore, we will continue to purchase your oil depending on economic benefit. Our government has made it clear that India will take all measures to protect its national interests. And this is a national interest — the energy security of 1.4 bln people of India," the diplomat told Izvestia.

According to him, the country is highly sensitive to any measures or actions by those who "infringe on India's sovereignty."

Given the strong ties between Russia and India, which are also bound by close cooperation within BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the United States is unlikely to compel New Delhi to prohibit incoming supplies. However, Washington could trigger a substantial reduction in purchase volumes, Head of the Center for the Indo-Pacific Region at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Alexey Kupriyanov told Izvestia. In his view, such a development would slow the growth of India's oil refining sector and drive up domestic gasoline prices.

Moreover, it would create a supply shortage in the oil market and push global prices higher, Indian political scientist Rakesh Bhadauria noted. "If India stops purchasing Russian oil, it will signal that it has yielded to US pressure and will undermine the country's policy of strategic autonomy," the expert said.

 

As of February 18, gas reserves in the underground storage (UGS) facilities of the European Union countries had fallen below 33%. Across Europe, with at least another month of the heating season remaining, only about 35.04 bln cubic meters of natural gas remain in storage. According to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), this is the lowest level recorded on this date in the past four years. Experts interviewed by Rossiyskaya Gazeta believe there is a moderate risk of a summer gas crisis in the EU, driven by low storage levels, restrictions on short-term Russian LNG imports, and pricing dynamics in the United States that could incentivize suppliers to keep elevated European gas prices.

Europe is placing its hopes on US liquefied natural gas (LNG), the production capacity of which is expanding. However, the United States itself has recently faced an unexpected challenge in its domestic gas market, the newspaper writes. Due to rising exports to the EU, gas prices in the US have increased by 50%, causing significant dissatisfaction among Americans. Although export restrictions have not been introduced, discussions about such measures are underway.

Russia is unlikely to return to the European gas market in the near term, but it could derive certain benefits if gas prices in the EU rise. First, pipeline deliveries of Russian gas to Europe will continue through September 30, 2027. Currently, prices for these supplies are generally linked to average quarterly exchange quotations. Export duties are levied on pipeline gas supplied to the federal budget of the Russian Federation, and the size of this duty depends on the gas price. Deliveries via the TurkStream pipeline to Europe are ongoing, providing an opportunity for additional revenue.

Experts surveyed by Rossiyskaya Gazeta assess the likelihood of a gas crisis in the EU this summer as moderate. Maria Belova, Research Director at Implementa, told the newspaper that low gas reserves in European underground storage facilities, combined with the forthcoming ban on short-term imports of Russian LNG, create a risk of supply shortages and rising gas prices in the coming summer months.

According to Alexey Grivach, Deputy Head of the National Energy Security Fund, much will depend on gas prices in the United States. Suppliers may have an interest in maintaining high gas prices in Europe despite an increase in supply.

 

A second US strike group, led by the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, is expected to reach the eastern Mediterranean by the coming weekend, which would enable its air wing to take part in a potential attack on Iran, experts told Izvestia. The United States is assembling the largest air grouping in the region since the invasion of Iraq. However, Iran possesses the means to respond to possible aggression — it has a sufficient number of ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as long-range drones, to simultaneously strike US military bases in the Middle East and targets in Israel.

According to monitoring resources, the aircraft carrier Gerald Ford is already in the Mediterranean Sea. It will require two to three days to reach the eastern part of the basin and assume its position there.

"It is believed that until this group arrives in the area near Iran, the United States is unlikely to initiate any active operations," military expert Dmitry Kornev told Izvestia. "However, nothing actually prevents them from breaking that rule, since their decision-making will apparently be guided by short-term political motives known only to them," he added.

According to various estimates, more than 600 Tomahawk cruise missiles are currently deployed aboard US ships and submarines operating in the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the eastern Mediterranean.

Iran's retaliatory actions could include strikes using ballistic missiles and long-range kamikaze drones of the Shahed type. According to assessments by US and Israeli intelligence services and analytical centers, in 2025 Iran possessed the largest ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle East — up to 3,000 missiles.

"Iran will use all of this against targets in Israel and against American bases in the Persian Gulf region and across the broader Middle East. To defend its own territory, Iran will employ its air defense systems. It plans to repel the majority of US and Israeli air strikes. However, in June 2025, its air defense actions proved ineffective: the Americans and Israelis conducted several hundred sorties, yet not a single aircraft was downed," Dmitry Kornev said.

It is entirely possible that even the US military command does not know whether an operation will be launched, military expert Yuri Lyamin believes. "Perhaps President Trump has already made a political decision, and they are simply concealing it. But it is also possible that no decision has yet been made, and it is impossible to say when it will be," he told Izvestia.

In the expert's view, once the concentration of forces in the region is completed in the coming days, a window of opportunity lasting several weeks will emerge for the United States.

 

Commenting on the recent trilateral negotiations in Geneva on a peaceful settlement of the military conflict with Russia, Vladimir Zelensky once again called on Western allies to prioritize a ceasefire, while also presenting this demand as backed by Washington. He justified the idea by citing the need to hold elections. Zelensky also proposed arranging a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss territorial and security issues. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta believe Zelensky's ceasefire and election proposals are largely rhetorical responses to Western political signals, while a direct meeting between Putin and Zelensky is viewed as highly unlikely.

If Western partners, together with the United States, helped deprive Russia of the necessary resources, this would make it possible to end the large-scale armed confrontation with the Russian Federation that has continued since February 2022, former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vladimir Ogryzko told journalists on Thursday following the trilateral consultations on February 17-18 in Geneva concerning a peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian conflict.

Oleg Barabanov, a professor at MGIMO University and Program Director of the Valdai International Discussion Club, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that Zelensky's references to the need for a temporary truce may also have been voiced in response to US President Donald Trump's proposal to hold new elections in Ukraine as soon as possible. Previously, officials in Kiev had pointed to the necessity of lifting martial law and allowing for a six-month preparation period for an electoral campaign. Now, however, Zelensky has stated that Kiev is ready to hold elections, but that doing so would require a ceasefire, even if only for two months. Russian representatives have mentioned only the possibility of halting hostilities for one day.

"However, the issue of elections does not appear to be central to the negotiating agenda. Nor is it central to Kiev's consultations with Western partners, which are primarily focused on security guarantees for the Ukrainian side. So, it seems that this was more of a rhetorical response by Zelensky in his interview," Barabanov suggested.

In the expert's view, the proposed negotiations between Putin and Zelensky will not take place in any format. "In my opinion, such a meeting is psychologically impossible for the Russian side. Zelensky understands this and therefore regularly raises the issue," the expert believes.

 

Brent crude oil prices have returned to levels above $71 per barrel for the first time in six months. Over the past two days, quotations have risen by more than 6% amid reports that the United States is building up its military presence in the Middle East and that military action against Iran is expected. Should a negative scenario materialize, prices could reach $80 per barrel, as occurred in June 2025 during the exchange of missile strikes between Israel and Iran. On Russian markets, the situation has had a limited impact - however, experts do not rule out a reduced discount on Russian oil in the event of a reduction in global supplies from Iran, Kommersant writes.

The latest surge to a multi-month high was triggered by active US preparations for potential military operations against Iran, despite ongoing negotiations between the two countries.

"The strengthening of the US military presence in the Middle East and the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations increase the risk of supply disruptions, primarily through potential export restrictions or logistical risks in the region," investment banker Ilya Sushkov told Kommersant.

Iran remains a significant supplier of oil to the global market, with its exports estimated at 1.5-2 mln barrels per day. "Any threats of tightening sanctions or physically restricting supplies directly affect the balance. The market is already at a sensitive juncture amid the geopolitical situation in another part of the world," Ruslan Klyshko, Director of the Wealth Management Department at AF Capital Asset Management, noted.

The principal concern for investors centers on the risk of a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which approximately 20 mln barrels of oil per day are transported — about 20% of global demand for crude — originating not only from Iran but also from Iraq, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.

Further developments in the region will remain a key factor for the oil market. According to Ruslan Klyshko, even a limited military operation could rapidly propel prices into the $80-85 per barrel range.

The recent rise in oil prices has had a limited impact on Russia's equity and currency markets. "Given that the volume of Russia's external energy exports is declining both in physical terms and in value, the ruble's position is likely to deteriorate," Head of the Analytical Service Division at Zenit Bank Vladimir Evstifeev believes.

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. EU diplomatic chief Kaja Kallas must remember that without Russia, security in Europe cannot be guaranteed, Russian Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko stated to TASS, commenting on reports of an EU document pressing demands on Moscow over Ukraine.

"I believe that this European document with demands for Russia, if it indeed exists, once again clearly shows that with their current approach, Europeans have no place at the negotiating table for establishing a real, long-term peace. Their absence is logical. I would like to remind diplomat Kallas that it is impossible to ensure security on the European continent without Russia, the largest European country," Matviyenko said. "Security must be unified, indivisible, and equal for everyone. As our president said: 'some's security can't come at others' expense,'" she added.

Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier told in an interview with Vesti journalist Pavel Zarubin that "the authority of Ms. Kaja Kallas does not represent a 'golden age' of diplomacy for the European continent."

Ukrainian president calls for another round of talks to be held “very soon, as early as this February”.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just posted a big update after he had a chance to get a debrief on this week's peace talks with Russia and the US in Geneva.

He said “real opportunities to end the war with dignity still exist,” and called for another round of talks to be held “very soon, as early as this February”.

Zelenskyy said “Ukraine's responses to the most difficult questions ahead of the next meeting are ready,” and they still want to raise some issues at the leaders' level with Trump and Putin.

“It is the leaders' format that could prove decisive in many respects, and Ukraine is ready for such a format,” he said.

He also pointedly thanked his team for showing patience in all conversations with Russians, saying they “have not always been easy or reasonable”.

The Ukrainian president also said that “Europe is actively engaged in the process of ending the war,” and it's role “must grow”.

… and on that note, it's a wrap for today!

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has insisted that “real opportunities to end the war with dignity still exist,” as he called for another round of talks with Russia and the US, and moving some issues to the leaders' level (15:39).

His comments come just days before the fourth anniversary of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, with some EU leaders expected to visit Kyiv (12:11), and others joining online for a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing (15:26).

The EU is also racing to adopt the latest, 20th, package of sanctions against Russia before the anniversary (12:47), after EU ambassadors failed to reach an agreement today (11:58).

Meanwhile, Kyiv said Friday that 10 people were arrested in Ukraine and Moldova on suspicion of planning to assassinate senior Ukrainian political figures on Moscow's orders, with payouts of up to $100,000 (10:43).

Ahead of the anniversary, the Guardian's Shaun Walker prepared a detailed account, largely reported for the first time, of how the US and Britain uncovered Vladimir Putin's plans to invade, and why most of Europe – including the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – dismissed them.

In other news,

German defence minister Boris Pistorius suggested the E5 group could establish a European version of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (12:53).

German chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Germany must assert itself and take on greater responsibility as a new world order rapidly takes shape (13:35).

The European Commission has dismissed criticism of its participation in Donald Trump's Board of Peace event in Washington DC, rejecting suggestions that it had no mandate for attending (12:25).

The European Commission's chief deputy spokesperson Olof Gill has now responded to the US ruling on behalf of the bloc, saying:

“We take note of the ruling by the U.S. supreme court and are analysing it carefully.

We remain in close contact with the U.S. administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling.

Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on stability and predictability in the trading relationship.

We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.”

The EU has repeatedly been threatened with punitive tariffs by the US administration, including, most recently, over the status of Greenland.

Meanwhile, the US supreme court has issued a sharp rebuke against the Trump administration and ruled against the legality of the president's sweeping global tariffs.

It is a primarily US news story, but will no doubt be closely followed by many across Europe amid Trump's semi-regular threats of punitive tariffs against the EU.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just posted a big update after he had a chance to get a debrief on this week's peace talks with Russia and the US in Geneva.

He said “real opportunities to end the war with dignity still exist,” and called for another round of talks to be held “very soon, as early as this February”.

Zelenskyy said “Ukraine's responses to the most difficult questions ahead of the next meeting are ready,” and they still want to raise some issues at the leaders' level with Trump and Putin.

“It is the leaders' format that could prove decisive in many respects, and Ukraine is ready for such a format,” he said.

He also pointedly thanked his team for showing patience in all conversations with Russians, saying they “have not always been easy or reasonable”.

The Ukrainian president also said that “Europe is actively engaged in the process of ending the war,” and it's role “must grow”.

We spent a big part of yesterday looking at Donald Trump's Board of Peace, which continues to cause controversies in Europe (12:25).

What it is, what it is trying to secure, and will it really help Gaza?

Here's a short video explainer:

We are just getting a line from the Élysée Palace, via Reuters, that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will preside over a video conference meeting of the Coalition of the Willing on 24 February, the fourth anniversary of the Russian full-scale aggression on Ukraine.

UK's prime minister Keir Starmer will be the co-host.

France and Germany's plan to build a fighter jet of the future, planned to come with a swarm of drones and a “combat communications cloud”, is collapsing.

Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, said this week that the €100bn programme no longer worked for him. He insisted it was “not a political dispute”, but a technical one. France needs a jet that can carry nuclear weapons and launch from aircraft carriers, while Germany does not. However, the problems go back much further.

Known as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), the programme was announced to great fanfare in 2017 by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and then German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Spain joined in 2019.

The jet was meant to replace France and Germany's existing fighters by 2040, equipped with stealth capabilities and surrounded by drones scouting ahead or drawing enemy fire, all sharing data in real time.

Europe already fields three competing fighter jets – the Eurofighter Typhoon, France's Rafale and Sweden's Gripen. Successive chief executives of the pan-European aerospace company Airbus have warned the continent must consolidate these projects. Yet the collapse of FCAS would do the opposite, with a British-Italian-Japanese Tempest project and a mooted Gripen successor already in the mix.

For a bloc that collectively spent €381bn (£333bn) on defence last year but struggles to turn that into military capability, the stakes are high. Threats from Russia are mounting and Donald Trump has told Europe it is time to pay for its own security.

But for years, the companies building the Franco-German jet have not been able to agree who is in charge.

Let's briefly go back to the E5 defence minister's words on closer cooperation and all great things they can achieve together (12:53, 13:02).

As Alex Daniel will explain in a moment, it does not always work out that smoothly.

Over in the UK, the papers are focusing on the arrest of the 66-year old former prince, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and the consequences for the royal family.

My colleague Sam Jones looked also at the coverage in Europe, and discovered that neither the shock nor the historical significance of the event was lost on the European press.

And if there was one thing that correspondents and leader writers around the continent could agree on, it was that the former prince's detention had plunged the British monarchy into a place of unprecedented danger and vulnerability.

Separately, German chancellor Friedrich Merz has addressed the national party conference of his CDU party earlier today, telling members that Germany must assert itself and take on greater responsibility as a new world order rapidly takes shape, Reuters reported.

He repeated his claim from last week's Munich Security Conference that the rules-based international order “as we knew it no longer exists.”

“This will result in a new grand strategy for Germany in a united Europe. We are showing courage, the courage to shape the future, and the courage to assert ourselves,” he added.

Merz also reaffirmed his pledge that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.

“We will not allow these people from the so-called Alternative for Germany to ruin our country,” he said, adding that “this party cannot be a partner of the CDU.”

Germany's Pistorius was also asked about recent talk about Europe establishing its independent nuclear deterrence systems.

He says that while Europe needs to take more responsibility for its conventional deterrence and defence, but broader nuclear protection “is provided and will be provided by the US, at least for the foreseeable future.”

Picking up on Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz's comments on nuclear deterrence at the Munich Security Conference last week, he said that Germany was legally bound to not have nuclear weapons.

But he said it could support defence capabilities of France and other allies “by conventional measures, but not in terms of nuclear participation – and that I think is quite clear.”

Meanwhile, UK's junior defence minister Luke Pollard hailed the E5's new initiative to work on advanced low-cost air defence systems, such as autonomous drones or missiles, as part of the ‘Low-Cost Effectors & Autonomous Platforms' initiative, known as LEAP.

Its first focus will be on a new surface-to-air weapon – a lightweight, affordable weapon designed to counter the drone and missile threat, the UK's Ministry of Defence said.

Speaking in Kraków, Pollard said that “it's actions, not words, that will deter Putin,” adding that he feels confident that “this is the very first step of what we hope will be a series of initiatives under LEAP to look at how we can have ground to air and other capabilities that pulls our collective experience.”

Pollard also specifically wanted to send a message “to the people of Poland” and the Poles back in the UK, saying that they should “be in no doubt that when you need us, the UK will be there for you.”

German defence minister Boris Pistorius suggested the E5 grouping of Europe's five countries – France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom – could expand its cooperation to have a joint tanker fleet or even establish a European version of the Five Eyes alliance.

“What can we do next? One idea could be to consider the idea of a joint tanker fleet or multi-domain taskforce, or even a European version of Five Eyes,” he said at a press conference in Kraków, Poland.

The Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing alliance including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US.

Pistorius also said that Russia's continuing attacks on Ukraine amounted to “not simply a war,” but “terror against the civilian population of Ukraine.”

He said that “only maximum pressure from sanctions” can make Putin “back down” from his attacks.

Not much on sanctions from Brussels, but the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, is speaking at the E5 meeting in Kraków and she says that the bloc still aims to pass the 20th package of sanctions on Monday, despite ambassadors failing to agree on them today (11:58).

“Next Monday, we aim to adopt the 20th sanctions package against Russia,” she said.

She insisted:

“Sanctions are working.

They are severely hurting Russia's economy, and each new measure further limits its ability to wage the war. Moscow is not invincible. Its army is suffering record casualties, and its economy is under heavy strain.

But Putin won't end this war until the costs are higher than the benefits, and that is the point we must reach.”

ASTANA, February 20. /TASS/. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov and First Deputy Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan Yerzhan Ashikbayev held bilateral consultations in Astana on arms control and related upcoming events.

According to Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry, "the parties discussed a wide range of pressing issues on the global security agenda, including the strengthening of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regimes, biological security, and export control issues."

They also exchanged views on work within multilateral structures, including the First Committee of the UN General Assembly, which addresses disarmament matters, the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, and the upcoming 11th Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to take place in New York this year.

Kazakhstan joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1994 as a non-nuclear state.

Dozens of students who left a southwest Ohio school to protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rushed through a local grocery store, throwing objects that damaged the store and struck a customer, according to a witness who shot a video capturing some of the commotion.

More American schoolchildren are joining protests against ICE, which is working to deport illegal immigrants nationwide, especially those with criminal histories.

Live Updates

Read updates and analysis on the decision, which dealt a blow to an issue central to the president's agenda.


• Trump slams tariffs ruling: President Donald Trump said some Supreme Court justices are a “disgrace to our nation” after the high court ruled that his sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch joined with Chief Justice John Roberts and the three liberal justices in the 6-3 ruling.
    


            • Additional tariff: Trump also announced that he will impose a 10% global tariff on top of tariffs already in place. While these new levies can only take effect for a maximum of 150 days, barring congressional approval for an extension, Trump claimed, “We have a right to do pretty much what we want to do.”
    


• Iran negotiations: Meanwhile, Trump says he is considering a limited military strike to pressure Tehran into a nuclear deal. The president said yesterday he was giving Iran 10 to 15 days before deciding on potential military action.
    


            President Donald Trump began his address by calling the Supreme Court's decision, which ruled that his sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal, “deeply disappointing.”
    


CNN's Kit Maher, Elisabeth Buchwald, Adam Cancryn and Kevin Liptak contributed to this reporting.



            It's not just the tens of billions of dollars in tariff revenue that have been riding on the Supreme Court's verdict, but also the many trade agreements President Donald Trump inked.
    


            Trump said many of those will stand but “some of them won't, and they'll be replaced with the other tariffs.”
    


            The emergency economic powers Trump cited to impose his sweeping tariffs — which the Supreme Court struck down Friday — were also what backed trade agreements with major partners, including China and the European Union.
    


            Those agreements granted partners lower tariff rates compared to what the president had threatened in exchange for promises to purchase more American goods and increase investments in the US.
    


            President Donald Trump said he “couldn't care less” if the Supreme Court justices who ruled that his tariffs are illegal attend his State of the Union address next week.
    


            “They are invited barely, barely,” the president said, referring to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch.
    


            “Honestly I couldn't care less if they come,” he added.
    


            He added that the three justices who dissented are “happily invited.”
    


            The speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader are in charge of inviting the justices to the address. Both positions are held by Republicans.
    


            Pressed by another reporter if he regrets appointing Gorsuch and Barrett to the bench, the president deflected but called the justices an “embarrassment to their families.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Supreme Court about Trump's comments.
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday he expects the Supreme Court's decision invalidating his tariffs to prompt an extensive legal fight over whether his administration now has to pay companies billions of dollars in refunds.
    


            The 6-3 ruling did not address whether and how the government should handle the tariff money it's already collected, which corporations are now expected to sue to get back.
    


            “Wouldn't you think they would have put one sentence in there saying, keep the money or don't keep the money, right?” Trump said during a press briefing. “It's not discussed. We'll end up being in court for the next five years.”
    


            The president has touted the revenue generated by his tariffs as evidence of the success of his trade policy, insisting that it's made the nation richer and benefited Americans as a result.
    


            But his critics have responded that consumers are footing the bill for those tariffs, pointing to the anticipated sprint by companies to secure refunds of the money they have paid the government over the past year.
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday he's immediately going to enact a 10% global tariff under a trade law known as Section 122 following the Supreme Court's landmark ruling earlier in the day.
    


            In a 6-3 decision, the justices found Trump lacked the authority to impose sweeping tariffs citing emergency economic authority.
    


            But unlike the prior tariffs Trump imposed, the new levies can only be in place for a maximum of 150 days, barring congressional approval for an extension. Asked by a reporter whether Trump intends to keep that in effect indefinitely, he said, “We have a right to do pretty much what we want to do, but we're going to charge it starting, effectively I think, it's three days from now.”
    


            Trump also told reporters he will be initiating several new investigations that are necessary precursors to imposing tariffs under a separate trade law known as Section 301.
    


            President Donald Trump says there are alternative methods to apply tariffs that could potentially generate more revenue than the emergency powers now off limits.
    


“Other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected. We have alternatives,” he told reporters at the White House.
    


            He said the new avenues had been “approved by the decision” the court handed down today.
    


                    “Now I'm going to go in a different direction, probably the direction I should have gone the first time,” he said, calling it “even stronger than our original choice.”
                





            He cited various laws and sections that he would use, including the 1974 Trade Act and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, but said it would make for a longer process. A number of those avenues require investigations before tariffs can be applied.
    


            Trump argued the decision “made a president's ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear.”
    


            President Donald Trump called the Supreme Court's decision “deeply disappointing” and said he's ashamed of the Supreme Court justices — some of whom he appointed — who ruled against his tariffs.
    


            “The Supreme Court's ruling on tariffs is deeply disappointing, and I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,” Trump said from podium in the White House briefing room on Friday.
    


            During his first term, Trump appointed conservative justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who joined with Chief Justice John Roberts and the three liberal justices in the majority.
    


            “They're against anything that makes America strong, healthy and great again. They also are a frankly disgrace to our nation those justices,” Trump said.
    


            “I'd like to thank and congratulate justices Thomas Alito and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country,” Trump said. “When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them.”
    


            President Donald Trump is holding a news conference following the Supreme Court ruling that Trump's sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal.
    


            At a time when the United States is short millions of homes, new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have pushed building costs even higher.
    


            But many tariffs on the raw materials used to build new homes — such as those on lumber, steel and aluminum — will stay in place, despite the Supreme Court's decision today.
    


Why?: That's because they were imposed under separate laws allowing tariffs on national security threats or unfairly dumped imports.
    


            The National Association of Home Builders recently estimated that tariffs could add an average of $10,900 to the cost of building each new home.
    


                    “With the nation facing a housing affordability crisis, NAHB urges the president to exempt building materials as part of his tariff strategy because they raise construction costs, impede supply chains and result in market and business uncertainty that make it difficult for builders to price their homes,” NAHB chairman Bill Owens said in a statement after the Supreme Court's decision. 
                





            The biggest question on the mind of business owners today? Refunds.
    


            “Is that going to be a thing? No one knows,” said Michael Wieder, co-founder of the baby and toddler product company Lalo.
    


            Wieder told CNN's “One Thing” podcast last spring that Trump's massive tariffs on China were hurting his bottom line and had to raise prices on some of their products as a result.
    


            Today's decision, he told CNN, could provide some relief for families but he hopes it presents an opening for lawmakers to push for a permanent tariff exemption for baby products.
    


Listen to the ‘One Thing' podcast here.



            Now that the Supreme Court has taken away the bulk of President Donald Trump's tariff-wielding authority, what does that mean for your prices?
    


            “Nothing,” said Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research.
    


            That's because Trump has other tariff levers to pull. The Supreme Court noted other authorities remain available to Trump, including the laws that permitted the administration to raise significant tariffs on steel, aluminum and other imports – all of which remain in place.
    


            And even if the administration is ultimately required to refund companies that paid the overturned tariffs (a question that remains unsettled), that doesn't mean you'll get a refund for the higher prices you paid for sneakers, furniture or other items that grew more expensive because of Trump's policies.
    


            “Companies are highly unlikely to start trimming their prices as a result,” Roth said. “Walmart is not going to give you a check for the 15% tariff on sneakers you bought from them four months ago.”
    


            Trump's tariffs added $1,000 in tax expenses for the average US household in 2025, according to the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation.
    


            Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said the tariffs that remain in place will still amount to a $400 tax hike per household in 2026.
    


            But she noted that many companies paid the tariffs and did not pass the bulk of the tariff costs on to consumers. So prices aren't likely to fall because of the ruling Friday.
    


            “There won't be a dramatic overnight change in prices,” she said.
    


            No recent president has used national emergency declarations like President Donald Trump has. He declared eight of them in his first 100 days — about as many as other recent presidents had declared in entire four-year terms.
    


            And the reason is clear: They unlock emergency powers that Trump likes because he can exercise them on his own.
    


            But the justices seemed to have a warning for him, saying in no uncertain terms that emergency powers shouldn't be treated as some kind of cheat code.
    


            “'Emergency powers,' after all, ‘tend to kindle emergencies,'” they wrote.
    


            “And as the Framers understood, emergencies can ‘afford a ready pretext for usurpation' of congressional power,” they added.
    


            At another point, they summarized the Trump administration's argument as: “All it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a Presidential declaration of emergency, which the Government asserts is unreviewable.”
    


            Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch in his concurrence noted that the administration's argument would allow presidents to impose tariffs “on virtually any imports for any emergency any President might perceive.”
    


            The language is pretty strong. And it's inauspicious for Trump, given how much of his agenda is built on claiming emergency powers and how many of those claims could go before these same justices.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson did not reveal what his next steps will be after the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump violated federal law when he unilaterally imposed sweeping tariffs across the globe, only saying that “Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks.”
    


            “No one can deny that the President's use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America's trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades. Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks,” Johnson said in a statement posted to X.
    


            Senate GOP Leader John Thune said that tariffs “can be an important and effective tool,” but did not criticize the Supreme Court's ruling.
    


            Thune has previously acknowledged on numerous occasions that he personally has hesitations around tariff policy, though he has voted against blocking the administration's tariffs.
    


            “Tariffs can be an important and effective tool to address unfair trade practices and help level the playing field with foreign competitors. Senate Republicans will continue working with the administration and our colleagues in the House to advance our shared goal to strengthen rural America, including South Dakota's farm and ranch communities, and the broader U.S. economy,” Thune said in a statement posted on X.



            The White House announced after the Supreme Court's tariffs ruling that President Donald Trump will hold a news briefing this afternoon.
    


            Trump became enraged Friday morning when he learned about the decision, which declared his tariffs illegal, according to sources familiar with the matter.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the briefing will begin at 12:45 p.m. ET.



            Justice Neil Gorsuch's concurring opinion concludes with a pretty remarkable flourish — what sounds a lot like a plea for the federal government to return to the business of actually legislating.
    


            “For those who think it important for the Nation to impose more tariffs, I understand that today's decision will be disappointing,” he begins.
    


            He then writes that the Constitution gave Congress the power over taxes and tariffs for a reason.
    


                    “Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises,” Gorsuch says. “But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the Nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people's elected representatives, not just that of one faction or man.”
                





            He then suggests that Trump's tariffs, which often shifted by the day or even by the hour, are a good example of why legislation is preferable. Laws passed by Congress tend to “endure,” allowing “ordinary people to plan their lives in ways they cannot when the rules shift from day to day.”
    


            He concludes that “if history is any guide, the tables will turn and the day will come when those disappointed by today's result will appreciate the legislative process for the bulwark of liberty it is.”
    


            American industry groups applauded the Supreme Court ruling Friday that struck down President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs.
    


            The National Retail Federation, which represents retailers including Walmart, Kroger and Costco, said the decision provided “much-needed certainty for US businesses and manufacturers.”
    


            “Clear and consistent trade policy is essential for economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for American families,” said David French, NRFs executive vice president of government relations.
    


            The US footwear industry said this decision “provides relief at a time when cost pressures have been significant.”
    


            Ninety-nine percent of all shoes sold in the US are imported, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.
    


                    “By removing these widespread tariffs, the footwear industry can redirect billions of dollars toward innovation, job creation, and affordability for families across the country,” said Matt Priest, president and CEO of FDRA.
                





            The court did not rule on the fate of the $130 billion in tariffs that has already been collected, but the NRF urged the lower courts to “ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to U.S. importers.”
    


            The US Chamber of Commerce, which called the ruling welcome news for businesses and consumers, also urged refunds.
    


            “Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year,” said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce.
    


            Following today's SCOTUS ruling that President Donald Trump's sweeping emergency tariffs are illegal, California Gov. Gavin Newsom called on the administration to “immediately” issue refund checks “with interest.”
    


                    “Time to pay the piper, Donald,” Newsom wrote. “ These tariffs were nothing more than an illegal cash grab that drove up prices and hurt working families, so you could wreck longstanding alliances and extort them. Every dollar unlawfully taken must be refunded immediately — with interest. Cough up!”
                





            The governor also noted that his state had been the first to challenge Trump's tariffs, filing suit in April 2025 to stop the tariffs imposed without congressional approval.
    


            The USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group has entered the Mediterranean Sea heading towards the Middle East to join a significant number of other US military assets in the region as President Donald Trump weighs his options for military actions against Iran.
    


            Trump said a week ago he was sending the Ford to the region; up until then, the strike group had been in the Caribbean Sea for several months amid the administration's campaign against Venezuela. The Ford group entered the Mediterranean, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar on Friday, according to open source ship tracking data and pictures posted to social media reviewed by CNN.
    


            CNN reported Thursday that Trump is still weighing his options for strikes if he goes ahead with military action, ranging from more limited, target strikes to sustained operations that could last weeks. US forces have not yet been given a target list, a source familiar with the planning said.
    


            The US has been engaged in a massive buildup of military assets in the Middle East, deploying fighter jets and refueling tankers, as well as flowing in dozens of cargo planes worth of equipment including additional air defense systems. The Ford also joins nearly a dozen US Navy ships, including the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group.
    


            The Ford aircraft carrier is the world's largest carrier. The strike group includes destroyers USS Winston Churchill, USS Bainbridge, and USS Mahan, as well as Carrier Air Wing 8 which is composed of four fighter squadrons, an electronic attack squadron, and more.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision to restrict some of President Donald Trump's tariff powers could end up being a gift to US consumers and businesses caught in the crossfire of higher import prices and skyrocketing uncertainty, economists said Friday.
    


            “It will force a reset in tariff policy that is likely to lead to lower overall tariff rates and a more orderly imposition of future tariffs,” Heather Long, Navy Federal Credit Union's chief economist, wrote Friday. “This will boost economic growth and provide some relief for American consumers. Smaller firms will be especially helped by this ruling.”
    


            However, while Friday's decision could force a more straightforward approach to enacting tariffs, it might only end up stoking already high uncertainty, cautioned Olu Sonola, head of US economics at Fitch Ratings.
    


            Sonola estimated that the decision rolls back about 60% of the 2025 tariffs, totaling upward of $200 billion, and cutting the effective tariff rate by more than half, to 6%.
    


            “However, the bigger macro takeaway is not just ‘lower tariffs,' but ‘higher tariff-regime uncertainty,'” he wrote Friday.
    


            “The odds that tariffs reappear in a revised form remain meaningful. Layer on potential tariff refunds, and you introduce a messy operational and legal overhang that amplifies economic uncertainty.”
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hailed the Supreme Court's ruling on the president's ability to impose tariffs as a victory.
    


                    “The Supreme Court decision striking down the harmful Trump Tariffs is a big victory for the American people,” Jeffries said. “And another crushing defeat for the wannabe King.”
                





            Schumer called the decision a “win for the wallets of every American consumer.”
    


                    “Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly,” Schumer said. “We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The nation's highest court struck down some of U.S. President Donald Trump's most sweeping tariffs on Friday, in a 6-3 decision ruling that he overstepped his authority when using an emergency powers law to justify new taxes on goods from nearly every country in the world.

Trump has launched a barrage of new tariffs over the last year. Despite Friday's ruling, many sectoral levies remain in place — and the president has already said that he'll turn to other options for more import taxes. But the Supreme Court decision upends a core set of tariffs that Trump imposed using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.

IEEPA authorizes the president to broadly regulate commerce after declaring a national emergency. Over the years, presidents have turned to this law dozens of times, often to impose sanctions on other countries. But Trump was the first to use it to implement tariffs.

Here's a look at the now-overturned tariffs Trump imposed using IEEPA — and other levies that still stand today.

Trump used IEEPA to slap import taxes on nearly every country in the world last spring. On April 2, which Trump called Liberation Day, he imposed “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 50% on goods from dozens of countries — and a baseline 10% tariff on just about everyone else.

The 10% tax kicked in early April. But the bulk of Liberation Day's higher levies got delayed by several months, and many rates were revised over time (in some cases after new “framework” agreements). Most went into effect on Aug. 7.

The national emergency underlying these tariffs, Trump argued at the time, was the long-running gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from the rest of the world. Still, goods from countries with which the U.S. runs a trade surplus also faced taxes.

Major trading partners impacted by Liberation Day tariffs include South Korea, Japan and the European Union — which combined export a range of products to the U.S., like electronics, cars and car parts and pharmaceuticals. Following trade talks, Trump's rates on most goods stood at 15% for the EU, Japan and South Korea ahead of Friday. But just last month, Trump threatened to hike levies on certain South Korean products to 25% — and countries worldwide still face sector-specific, non-IEEPA tariffs.




At the start of his second term, Trump used IEEPA to impose new tariffs on America's three biggest trading partners: Mexico, Canada and China.

To justify these tariffs, Trump declared a national emergency ostensibly over undocumented immigration and the trafficking of drugs like fentanyl and the chemicals made to use it. The levies were first announced at the start of February 2025, but went into effect over time — and were at times delayed, reduced or heightened through further retaliation.

Ahead of Friday's decision, “trafficking tariffs” on Canadian and Mexican imports were 35% and 25%, respectively, for goods that don't comply with the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. China, meanwhile, faced a 10% fentanyl-related tariff. That's down from 20% imposed by Trump earlier last year. Chinese goods also once saw sky-high levies after Liberation Day, but rates have since come down during trade talks.

Top U.S. imports from China include mobile phones and other electronics, as well as clothing, toys and household appliances. Meanwhile, Canada and Mexico are both major sources of cars and auto parts. Canada is also the U.S.'s largest supplier of crude oil. And Mexico is a key exporter of fresh produce, beverages and more.

Trump also used IEEPA to slap steep import taxes on Brazilian imports over the summer, citing the country's policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro.

Brazil already faced Trump's 10% baseline Liberation Day rate. The Bolsonaro-related duties added another 40%, bringing total levies to 50% on many products ahead of Friday.

The U.S. has actually run a consistent trade surplus with Brazil over the years. But top exports from the country include manufactured products, crude oil and agricultural products like soybeans and sugar.

India has faced additional IEEPA tariffs, too. After Liberation Day, Trump slapped a 25% levy on Indian imports — and later added another 25% for the country's purchases of Russian oil, while also citing the emergency powers law, bringing the total to 50%.

But earlier this month, the U.S. and India reached a trade framework deal. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and that he planned to lower U.S. tariffs on its ally to 18%. Meanwhile, India said it would “eliminate or reduce tariffs” on all U.S. industrial goods and a range of agricultural products.

Indian's top exports to the U.S. include pharmaceuticals, precious stones, clothing and textiles.

Despite the Supreme Court knocking down sweeping import taxes Trump imposed with IEEPA, most countries still face steep tariffs from the U.S. on specific sectors.

Citing national security threats, Trump has used another law — Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act — to slap levies on steel, aluminum, cars, copper and lumber worldwide. He began to roll out even more Section 232 tariffs in September, on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture.

Amid pressure to lower rising prices, Trump has rolled back some of his tariffs recently. Beyond trade frameworks, that's included adding exemptions to specific levies and scrapping import taxes for goods like coffee, tropical fruit and beef.

Still, Trump has threatened more sectoral levies are on the way. And following Friday's decision, he said that he would sign executive order to enact 10% global tariff — using another federal law, known as Section 122. Those tariffs would be limited to just 150 days, unless they are extended legislatively.

LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — American freeskier Hunter Hess got to the end of his successful run in Olympic halfpipe qualifying, then leaned into the camera. He bent his left thumb and forefinger into the shape of an “L,” lifted it to his forehead and pointed at it with the other hand. 

“Apparently,” he explained, “I'm a loser.”

The 27-year-old who received that label from U.S. President Donald Trump at the start of the Olympics — leading to threats to his family and setting off the first major political imbroglio of the Games — finally got in the starting gate Friday. Fired up after nailing his first run, he flashed the “L” sign, then explained he has used the entire episode as motivation.

“I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this happen,” Hess said. “I'm not going to let controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough. My original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn't take it that way. I'm so happy to be here, so happy to represent Team USA.”

Hess was one of four Americans to qualify for the 12-man final, all of whom have a chance to give the U.S. team its first gold medal over nearly two weeks of skiing and snowboarding at the Livigno Snow Park. 

During a news conference at the start of the Games, skiers were asked how they felt representing the country during the Trump administration's heightened immigration enforcement actions back home. 




Hess' response: “If it aligns with my moral values, I feel like I'm representing it. Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the U.S.”

That caught Trump's attention.

“Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn't represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics. If that's the case, he shouldn't have tried out for the Team, and it's too bad he's on it,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social account.

After a few days, that died down. The freeskiers, placed on the back end of the Olympic schedule, retreated to Laax, Switzerland, for a week of training. Hess conceded it wasn't the easiest time. 

“I had a week that was pretty challenging,” he said. “Luckily, my family was there to support me and help me get through it. There was a lot of noise and I've never been subject to that kind of criticism. Skiing has saved my life time and time again and it seems to have done so again.”

He said, “There's been a lot of hate out there. All those people are super entitled to their opinion, and I respect it.”

Ultimately, though, he said he had no second thoughts about what he said in that fateful Feb. 6 news conference. The message, he insisted, was really a message of support.

“I stand with what I said. I love the United States of America. I cannot reiterate that enough. It means the absolute world to me to be able to represent Team USA here. I worked so, so hard to get here. I stick with what I said.”

An illegal immigrant is behind bars after police say he ambushed a woman on a popular Florida beach and attempted to drown her before leaving her for dead in a late-night attack. 

Said Alexander Hernandez Gonzalez, a 26-year-old Venezuelan national, was arrested on Sunday for his alleged role in the "unprovoked" attack at Tiger Shores Beach in Stuart, according to the Martin County Sheriff's Office. 

"This is an extremely alarming case," Martin County Sheriff John Budensiek told WEPC. "Random acts of violence like this are some of the most difficult crimes to solve — and that's exactly what this was."

Police say the victim was walking along the shoreline while on her phone at around 11 p.m. when Hernandez Gonzalez approached her from behind, "struck her, pushed her into the water and attempted to drown her."

"About five minutes after passing him, she was brutally attacked," Budensiek reportedly said. "She was grabbed around the throat, dragged into the ocean, and held down as she struggled to break free."

The victim eventually lost consciousness in the struggle, causing Hernandez Gonzalez to believe she was dead and throw her cell phone into the ocean, according to authorities. 

"The next thing she recalled was waking up half in and half out of the water," Budensiek told the outlet.

When she gained consciousness, the victim walked over a mile to nearby Stuart beach, where she was able to locate a sheriff's deputy. 

Following a days-long search, Hernandez Gonzalez was taken into custody after an individual reported a suicidal male claiming to have killed someone on a local beach.

"When asked if he felt any remorse, his response was, ‘No, I don't feel nothing,'" Budensiek reportedly said.

Hernandez Gonzalez remains in custody in the Martin County Jail, where he is being held without bond on charges of attempted first-degree premeditated murder. 

According to the Department of Homeland Security, Hernandez-Gonzalez entered the United States illegally in 2023, and was paroled and granted Temporary Protected Status by the Biden administration.

Trump loses, and the Democratic justices didn't need to concede anything.

The Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited decision in Learning Resources v. Trump on Friday, with a total of six justices concluding that a wide range of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican, wrote the opinion. At least some of his opinion was joined by five other justices, including Republican Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, along with the Court's three Democrats.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

But the Democratic justices withheld their support from seven key pages of Roberts's opinion, which discuss a recently created legal doctrine that consolidates power within the judiciary, thus denying a broader doctrinal victory to the Court's right flank.

Learning Resources, in other words, ends in the best possible outcome for Democrats. Trump's tariffs are gone, at least for now. And none of the Democratic justices needed to compromise on anything.

Roberts's opinion lays out two separate rationales for striking down the tariffs. One, which the three Democrats sign onto, is a fairly straightforward interpretation of a federal law. Trump claimed the power to impose tariffs under the federal International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which permits the president to “regulate … importation or exportation.”

In the part of Roberts's opinion that five other justices joined, he explains that the word “regulate” means “to ‘fix, establish, or control; to adjust by rule, method, or established mode; to direct by rule or restriction; to subject to governing principles or laws.'” But it does not mean the power to tax.

As Roberts writes, federal law is “replete with statutes granting the Executive the authority to ‘regulate' someone or something,” but Trump's lawyers were unable to “identify any statute in which the power to regulate includes the power to tax.”

And thus Trump cannot use IEEPA to impose a tax on imports. Simple as that.

It is likely that Trump will attempt to reinstate at least some of his tariffs by relying on other statutes. But, as Roberts points out, the federal laws that give the president more explicit authority to impose tariffs also limit his power to do so. One statute, for example, permits Trump to impose import taxes of no more than 15 percent, and for no longer than 150 days.

Before Roberts lays out the statutory argument against the tariffs, however, he also claims they violate a controversial new legal doctrine known as “major questions,” which the Court first mentioned in a 2014 opinion. Prior to Learning Resources, the major questions doctrine had only previously applied to one president: Joe Biden.

That 2014 decision stated that, when a presidential administration claims the power to do something very ambitious, courts should view that claim with skepticism. In the Supreme Court's words, “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.'”

Because the major questions doctrine is so new, and because it's only ever been used against a Democratic president, many legal observers – including myself – had criticized it as an unprincipled effort to choke off the authority of Democratic administrations.

The Court's three Democrats dissented in the Biden-era cases using this doctrine to strike down Democratic policies, and they did not join the parts of the Learning Resources opinion that apply it to Trump's tariffs either.

In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Elena Kagan explains that she and her fellow Democrats believed it was unnecessary to invoke the major questions doctrine in Learning Resources because “the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today's result.”

But three justices — Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett — all signed onto the seven pages of Roberts's opinion which argue that the tariffs violate this major questions doctrine. So that shows that half of the Court's Republicans are willing to use this doctrine against presidents of their own party.

Though the Court's Republican majority has often behaved sycophantically toward Trump — this is, after all, the same Court which held that Trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes — it's not particularly surprising that Learning Resources divided the Republican justices, because tariffs are also an issue that divides the Republican Party.

At a Federalist Society conference on executive power last spring, several speakers hosted by the powerful conservative legal group spoke out against the tariffs and questioned their legality. One of the lead lawyers challenging the tariffs was Michael McConnell, a former George W. Bush appointee to a federal appeals court.

What's more, several prominent Republicans joined briefs opposing the tariffs.

The broader political lesson that emerges from Learning Resources is that Democrats can win in this Supreme Court, but typically only when a case involves an issue that divides Republicans.

Learning Resources pitted Paul Ryan-style economic libertarians against MAGA-style Republicans who seek a more interventionist approach. And it pitted Republicans who have principled views in favor of free trade against Republicans who either had a shockingly rapid change of opinion about tariffs or believe that being a good partisan means following the leader.

In the end, these divides cleaved the Supreme Court's Republican majority straight down the middle. That doesn't just mean that Trump's tariffs were struck down, it also means that the Republicans were unable to assemble five votes to bolster their major questions doctrine. Learning Resources is the cleanest victory Democrats on the Court could have reasonably expected.

▶ Follow the latest updates on the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's tariffs

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump still has options to keep taxing imports aggressively even after the Supreme Court struck down the tariffs he imposed last year on nearly every country on earth.

The Justices didn't buy the president's sweeping claims of authority to impose tariffs as he sees fit. But Trump can re-use tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression.

“It's hard to see any pathway here where tariffs end,” said Georgetown trade law professor Kathleen Claussen. “I am pretty convinced he could rebuild the tariff landscape he has now using other authorities.”

Trump had claimed nearly boundless authority to impose tariffs under 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). But opponents argued before the Supreme Court that that power wasn't necessary because Congress delegated tariff power to the White House in several other statutes — though it carefully limited the ways the president could use the authority. 

Tariffs have been a cornerstone of Trump's foreign and economic policy in his second term, with double-digit “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on most countries, which he has justified by declaring America's longstanding trade deficits a national emergency. 

The average U.S. tariff has gone from 2.5% when Trump returned to the White House in January to nearly 17% a year later, the highest since 1934, according to calculations by Yale University's Budget Lab.

The president acted alone even though the U.S. Constitution specifically gives the power to tax – and impose tariffs – to Congress.




The United States has long had a handy cudgel to wallop countries it accuses of engaging in “unjustifiable,” “unreasonable” or “discriminatory” trade practices. That is Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.

And Trump has made aggressive use of it himself — especially against China. In his first term, he cited Section 301 to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports in a dispute over the sharp-elbowed tactics that Beijing was using to challenge America's technological dominance. The U.S. is also using 301 powers to counter what it calls unfair Chinese practices in the shipbuilding industry.

There are no limits on the size of Section 301 tariffs. They expire after four years but can be extended.

But the administration's trade representative must conduct an investigation and typically hold a public hearing before imposing 301 tariffs.

Experts have said Section 301 is useful in taking on China. But it has drawbacks when it comes to dealing with the smaller countries that Trump has hammered with reciprocal tariffs. 

“Undertaking dozens and dozens of 301 investigations of all of those countries is a laborious process,” Veroneau said.

In striking down Trump's reciprocal tariffs in May, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that the president couldn't use emergency powers to combat trade deficits.

That is partly because Congress had specifically given the White House limited authority to address the problem in another statute: Section 122, also of the Trade Act of 1974. That allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days in response to unbalanced trade. The administration doesn't even have to conduct an investigation beforehand.

But Section 122 authority has never been used to apply tariffs, and there is some uncertainty about how it would work.

In both of his terms, Trump has made aggressive use of his power — under Section 232 of Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — to impose tariffs on imports that he deems a threat to national security.

In 2018, he slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, levies he's expanded since returning to the White House. He also plastered Section 232 tariffs on autos, auto parts, copper, lumber. 

In September, the president even levied Section 232 tariffs on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture. 

Section 232 tariffs are not limited by law but do require an investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department. It's the administration itself that does the investigating – also true for Section 301 cases — “so they have a lot of control over the outcome,” Veroneau said.

Nearly a century ago, with the U.S. and world economies in collapse, Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930, imposing hefty taxes on imports. Known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs (for their congressional sponsors), these levies have been widely condemned by economists and historians for limiting world commerce and making the Great Depression worse. They also got a memorable pop culture shoutout in the 1986 movie “Ferris Bueller's Day Off.”

Section 338 of the law authorizes the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that have discriminated against U.S. businesses. No investigation is required, and there's no limit on how long the tariffs can stay in place.

Those tariffs have never been imposed — U.S. trade negotiators traditionally have favored Section 301 sanctions instead — though the United States used the threat of them as a bargaining chip in trade talks in the 1930s.

In September, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that the administration was considering Section 338 as a Plan B if the Supreme Court ruled against Trump's use of emergency powers tariffs.

'Home Team' actor and co-producer Kevin James reflects on his latest role.

Actor and comedian Kevin James recently opened up about the harsh realities of life on the road.

During an appearance on Theo Von's podcast, "This Past Weekend," James recalled an early-career comedy trip that took an unexpected turn.

He said he'd driven eight hours for a one-night stand-up gig that paid very little — especially after factoring in travel costs.

Exhausted from the trip, James checked into what he described as a "crappy motel-type thing." 

His plan was to take a quick nap before the show.

"I pull the bed back because I'm tired. Just drove eight hours," he said. 

And, he went on — "there's a roach in the blanket."

James said he didn't ask for a new room.

"I literally just put the blanket back," he said. "I went to the show. I just sat in my car in the parking lot 'til the thing was ready."

After finishing the set, he made another decision.

"Did the show. Drove home eight hours," he said. "Man, I'm not staying with a roach. Couldn't do it."

"There're some miserable places," James said.

While he decided to leave the room immediately in the circumstances he described, pest experts say travelers who encounter a roach should take specific precautions.

First, "to help reduce pest risks when checking in, keep your belongings elevated and away from soft surfaces — the bathroom is a smart place to store luggage, especially in the bathtub — while you inspect the room for signs of pest activity," Shannon Sked, national technical director at Orkin, told Fox News Digital.

The pest control company is headquartered in Atlanta. 

"Hotels can't address what they don't know about."

Sked added that common hotel pests such as roaches and bedbugs are "excellent hitchhikers" — and inspecting a room before settling in can help prevent them from spreading through luggage.

Rebeccah Heinrichs analyzes U.S.-Iran nuclear talks and rising military tensions. She discusses Russia-Ukraine peace efforts led by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and the potential for a ceasefire.

For weeks, the U.S. military has quietly amassed what President Donald Trump has described as an "armada" in Iran's backyard. Mapped out across the Persian Gulf and beyond, the deployment tells its own story — one of calculated pressure backed by credible capability.

The latest signal of escalation is the movement of the world's largest aircraft carrier, the U.S. Navy's USS Gerald R. Ford, and its strike group from the Caribbean toward the Middle East.

The buildup coincides with indirect negotiations between Washington and Tehran over Iran's disputed nuclear program. Trump has warned that the regime must fully dismantle its nuclear infrastructure — or face consequences.

At the heart of America's force projection is another carrier strike group: USS Abraham Lincoln — a mobile fortress at sea, guarded by destroyers and equipped to unleash precision strikes at a moment's notice. On deck, F-35 fighters and F/A-18 attack aircraft sit within range of dozens of key Iranian military and nuclear targets.

Meanwhile, in the Eastern Mediterranean, destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Roosevelt provide additional strike capability and missile defense coverage — and could potentially assist Israel in defending against any Iranian counterattack.

WORLD'S LARGEST AIRCRAFT CARRIER HEADS TO MIDDLE EAST AS IRAN NUCLEAR TENSIONS SPIKE DRAMATICALLY

Farther south, in the Red Sea, USS Delbert B. Black adds another layer of firepower along one of the world's most important shipping lanes. The Red Sea links the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean through the Suez Canal, a corridor that carries a significant share of global trade and energy supplies. 

A U.S. destroyer there not only protects commercial traffic but also gives Washington the flexibility to respond quickly to threats moving between the Middle East and Europe.

Even closer to Iran's coastline, in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, USS McFaul and USS Mitscher are operating in one of the most strategically sensitive waterways on the planet. Roughly a fifth of the world's oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz each day. Their presence signals that the U.S. can both defend that vital choke point and, if necessary, strike Iranian targets from close range.

Beyond naval forces, U.S. air power is spread across multiple Middle Eastern bases, giving commanders the ability to strike, defend and sustain operations quickly.

Several types of combat aircraft are operating from regional bases, including F-15s, F-16s and the radar-evading F-35. The A-10 specializes in close-air support missions against armored threats.

Those fighters are backed by a network of support aircraft. KC-135 and KC-46 tankers refuel jets midair, allowing them to fly farther and stay aloft longer. EA-18G electronic warfare aircraft can jam enemy radar and communications. E-3 Sentry aircraft serve as airborne command centers, tracking threats across wide areas. P-8 Poseidon planes patrol and monitor maritime activity.

Additionally, heavy transports — including C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster aircraft — move troops and equipment, while MQ-9 Reaper drones provide surveillance and can carry precision weapons. The assets give U.S. commanders flexibility to operate across air, sea and land.

Taken together, the air and naval deployments create overlapping strike capability, missile defense coverage and control over major maritime routes. For Iran, it means U.S. forces are not concentrated in a single vulnerable location — they are distributed, layered and positioned to operate from multiple directions at once.

Chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream provides details on the Supreme Court's ruling striking down all IEEPA tariffs. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley weighs in.

The Supreme Court on Friday blocked President Donald Trump's use of an emergency law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on most U.S. trading partners, delivering a blow to the president in a case centered on one of his signature economic policies — one he characterized as "life or death" for the U.S. economy.

In a 6-3 decision, the justices invalidated Trump's tariffs. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.

"The Framers gave that power to ‘Congress alone' — notwithstanding the obvious foreign affairs implications of tariffs," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. "And whatever may be said of other powers that implicate foreign affairs, we would not expect Congress to relinquish its tariff power through vague language, or without careful limits."

Roberts noted that Trump used "two words" that were "separated by 16 others" in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), "regulate" and "importation," to justify that he had the "independent power to impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time."

"Those words cannot bear such weight," Roberts wrote.

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in November in the case, which centered on Trump's use of the IEEPA to enact his "Liberation Day" tariffs on most countries, including a 10% global tariff and a set of higher, so-called "reciprocal" tariffs on certain nations.

In April, Trump declared the U.S. trade deficit a "national emergency," and lawyers for the administration have cited that declaration as the legal basis for invoking IEEPA, which allows the president to respond to "unusual and extraordinary threats" when a national emergency has been declared.

The high court agreed to take up the case last fall after lower courts, including the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, blocked Trump's attempt to use IEEPA to enact import duties.

Lower courts pressed the Justice Department to explain why Trump invoked IEEPA when other, more narrowly tailored statutes enacted by Congress more specifically address tariffs — including laws that cap tariffs at certain levels or set timeframes subject to congressional review.

The law authorizes the president to "regulate … importation" during a declared national emergency, but it does not mention the word "tariffs" — an omission that was at the heart of the hours-long arguments before the high court in November. The absence of the word was a key factor in the majority's decision.

During oral arguments, justices pressed Solicitor General John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the government, on whether IEEPA applies to tariffs or taxation powers and what guardrails — if any — would limit the executive branch should the high court rule in Trump's favor.

Sauer told the justices that IEEPA allows a president to "regulate" "importation" of goods, which he said was the practical equivalent of a tariff.

But justices, including Trump's conservative appointees, appeared skeptical, pressing Sauer on whether there has "ever been another instance in which a statute has used that language to confer the power" Trump seeks.

Other conservative justices questioned whether an "economic equivalent" to tariffs — such as sanctions, embargoes, licenses and quotas — could be used by the president under the law.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh raised in a fiery dissent what he said would be "serious practical consequences" of the high court's decision in terms of refunding illegitimately imposed tariffs. The majority did not address refunds, an issue now likely to be raised in lower courts.

"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others," Kavanaugh wrote. "As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process is likely to be a ‘mess.'"

Lawyers for the Trump administration have argued in lower courts that the IEEPA allows a president to act in response to "unusual and extraordinary threats" and in cases where a national emergency has been declared.

Trump has claimed that deep and "sustained" trade deficits amount to a national emergency that is sufficient to trigger his executive powers under the emergency law.

The DOJ urged the Supreme Court to allow the tariffs to remain in place, warning that denying Trump the tariff authority under IEEPA "would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses."

Plaintiffs countered that in the 50 years since its passage, the law has never been used by a president to impose tariffs. They also argued that, by the administration's own admission, the trade deficit cited by Trump has persisted for nearly 50 years — a fact they said undermines his claim that there is an "unusual and extraordinary" trade emergency.

They argued that authorizing Trump's use of IEEPA to continue his universal tariffs would drastically expand executive power at the expense of the other branches of government.

Judges on a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of International Trade voted unanimously last year to block Trump's tariffs from taking effect, ruling that as commander in chief, Trump does not have "unbounded authority" to impose tariffs under the emergency law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit also rejected the administration's use of IEEPA.

The Supreme Court handed President Donald Trump a major loss on Friday, striking down his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs as unlawfully implemented.

The high court ruled 6-3 that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. The ruling marks a significant setback for the president's signature economic agenda item and is a rare rebuke for Trump from the justices after a series of wins at the high court over the last year.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, finding that the law Trump cited to impose his “Liberation Day” tariffs on most countries and on Canada, Mexico, and China over the fentanyl crisis does not confer the sweeping power he claims it does.

“Based on two words separated by 16 others in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA—'regulate' and ‘importation'—the President asserts the independent power to impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time,” Roberts wrote. “Those words cannot bear such weight.”

“When Congress grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints,” Roberts wrote for the majority opinion. “It did neither here.”

Roberts's majority ruling was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Kagan, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Jackson each wrote their own opinions concurring with the judgment.

The three justices who dissented from the ruling were Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh, all conservatives. Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Alito and Thomas, while Thomas filed a separate dissenting opinion as well.

“Properly read, IEEPA does not draw such an odd distinction between quotas and embargoes on the one hand and tariffs on the other,” Kavanaugh wrote for the dissent. “Rather, it empowers the President to regulate imports during national emergencies with the tools Presidents have traditionally and commonly used, including quotas, embargoes, and tariffs.”

“The Court today nonetheless concludes otherwise and holds that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs to deal with the declared drug trafficking and trade deficit emergencies,” he added.

During oral arguments in November 2025, the justices appeared highly skeptical of the Trump administration's arguments that the IEEPA authorized the president to implement the sweeping tariffs.

Trump used the IEEPA to implement his sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” for most countries, with a 10% baseline rate and higher rates for select countries, along with his tariffs aimed at Canada, Mexico, and China over their role in the fentanyl crisis. Other tariffs imposed by the president on aluminum, steel, and cars, among other products, are not affected by the ruling, because they were implemented using a different law.

The two consolidated cases before the high court, Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, were appealed after a trio of losses for the Trump administration in two federal district courts and one federal appeals court.

In its arguments to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department defended the president's signature economic policy as a matter of Trump exerting his foreign policy, arguing in a brief that striking down the tariffs as unlawful would “effectively disarm the President in the highly competitive arena of international trade.”

The companies suing over the tariffs argued they were unlawfully implemented, and that the IEEPA does not grant the president the power to tariff, noting that the term “tariff” is not present in the text of the statute.

During oral arguments, Roberts grappled with how the imposition of the sweeping tariffs under the IEEPA balanced the president's broad authority dealing with foreign powers and Congress's inherent taxing power.

Sotomayor plainly said she did not “understand this argument” from the DOJ that the tariffs did not impose a tax, a power given to Congress under the Constitution, during the November arguments, while Gorsuch expressed concern over future uses of such a sweeping tariff power.

SUPREME COURT JUSTICES PIT PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC POWERS AGAINST FOREIGN POLICY POWERS IN TARIFFS ARGUMENT

After oral arguments, the Trump administration projected confidence over the outcome of the case but also stated it could recreate most of the sweeping tariffs using other laws if the high court struck down the ones levied using the IEEPA.

The ruling marks the first in a set of cases the Supreme Court will decide this term slated to deal with the president's powers and policies. The high court will also issue a ruling in the coming months with implications for the president's firing power within the executive branch and Trump's executive order regarding birthright citizenship.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia could have some form of uranium enrichment within the kingdom under a proposed nuclear deal with the United States, congressional documents and an arms control group suggest, raising proliferation concerns as an atomic standoff between Iran and America continues. 

U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden both tried to reach a nuclear deal with the kingdom to share American technology. Nonproliferation experts warn any spinning centrifuges within Saudi Arabia could open the door to a possible weapons program for the kingdom, something its assertive crown prince has suggested he could pursue if Tehran obtains an atomic bomb. 

Already, Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan signed a mutual defense pact last year after Israel launched an attack on Qatar targeting Hamas officials. Pakistan's defense minister then said his nation's nuclear program “will be made available” to Saudi Arabia if needed, something seen as a warning for Israel, long believed to be the Middle East's only nuclear-armed state. 

“Nuclear cooperation can be a positive mechanism for upholding nonproliferation norms and increasing transparency, but the devil is in the details,” wrote Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. 

The documents raise “concerns that the Trump administration has not carefully considered the proliferation risks posed by its proposed nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia or the precedent this agreement may set.” 

Saudi Arabia did not respond to questions Friday from The Associated Press.




The congressional document, also seen by the AP, shows the Trump administration aims to reach 20 nuclear business deals with nations around the world, including Saudi Arabia. The deal with Saudi Arabia could be worth billions of dollars, it adds. 

The document contends that reaching a deal with the kingdom “will advance the national security interests of the United States, breaking with the failed policies of inaction and indecision that our competitors have capitalized on to disadvantage American industry and diminish the United States standing globally in this critical sector.” China, France, Russia and South Korea are among the leading nations that sell nuclear power plant technology abroad. 

The draft deal would see America and Saudi Arabia enter safeguard agreements with the United Nations' nuclear watchdog — the International Atomic Energy Agency or IAEA. That would include oversight of the “most proliferation-sensitive areas of potential nuclear cooperation,” it added. It listed enrichment, fuel fabrication and reprocessing as potential areas. 

“This suggests that once the bilateral safeguards agreement is in place, it will open the door for Saudi Arabia to acquire uranium enrichment technology or capabilities — possibly even from the United States,” Davenport wrote. “Even with restrictions and limits, it seems likely that Saudi Arabia will have a path to some type of uranium enrichment or access to knowledge about enrichment.”

Saudi Arabia is a member state of the IAEA, a Vienna-based agency which promotes peaceful nuclear work but also inspects nations to ensure they don't have clandestine atomic weapons programs. 

The IAEA told the AP in a statement on Friday that it “maintains regular contact with both parties and is able to apply verification measures in connection with bilateral cooperation agreements.” 

“If the parties will request the agency to apply verification measures in connection with their bilateral cooperation agreements, the agency will continue to consult with the parties concerned and address the request in accordance with its established procedures,” the IAEA added.

Enrichment isn't an automatic path to a nuclear weapon — a nation also must master other steps including the use of synchronized high explosives, for instance. But it does open the door to weaponization, which has fueled the concerns of the West over Iran's program. 

The United Arab Emirates, a neighbor to Saudi Arabia, signed what is referred to as a “123 agreement” with the U.S. to build its Barakah nuclear power plant with South Korean assistance. But the UAE did so without seeking enrichment, something nonproliferation experts have held up as the “gold standard” for nations wanting atomic power.

The push for a Saudi-U.S. deal comes as Trump threatens military action against Iran if it doesn't reach a deal over its nuclear program. The Trump military push follows nationwide protests in Iran that saw its theocratic government launch a bloody crackdown on dissent that killed thousands and saw tens of thousands more reportedly detained. 

In Iran's case, it long has insisted its nuclear enrichment program is peaceful. However, the West and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. Tehran also had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90% — making it the only country in the world to do so without a weapons program. 

Iranian diplomats long have pointed to 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's comments as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran won't build an atomic bomb. However, Iranian officials increasingly have made the threat they could seek the bomb as tensions have risen with the U.S. 

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's day-to-day ruler, has said if Iran obtains the bomb, “we will have to get one.”

VIENNA (AP) — An Austrian court has convicted a man of manslaughter caused by gross negligence after his girlfriend froze to death as the couple attempted to climb the country's highest peak last year.

The 37-year-old defendant was given a five-month suspended sentence and a 9,600-euro ($11,300) fine in a verdict handed down by the Innsbruck state court Thursday night after a one-day trial, the Austria Press Agency reported. The court did not identify him, in keeping with local privacy rules.

The man and his 33-year-old girlfriend set out to climb the Grossglockner in western Austria in January 2025. Prosecutors said that she died about 50 meters (164 feet) below the 3,798-meter (12,460-foot) peak after he left her behind. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Judge Norbert Hofer said that the defendant had misjudged the situation on the mountain but had not wilfully left behind his girlfriend — whose knowledge of mountaineering, he said, was “galaxies” short of the man's own. The sentence was well short of the maximum three years in prison. 

“I don't see you as a murderer, I don't see you as a cold-hearted man,” he said, alluding to social media posts about the case. “I see you as the one who ultimately tried to call help and stand by his girlfriend.”

However, the judge said that the defendant had failed to take his “leadership responsibility.” He said the woman would almost certainly have survived “if the appropriate measures had been taken,” for example making an emergency call earlier or turning back.




The defendant told the court he was “endlessly sorry,” APA reported. He said that the couple had made all their decisions together and planned their climbs together, including the Grossglockner climb. 

He argued that he himself had no formal Alpine training and that his girlfriend's knowledge wasn't far short of his own. He said she had been in good condition when a police helicopter flew over the couple earlier in the climb and he couldn't explain her rapid deterioration. He said he had descended to seek help after consulting with her.

The verdict can be appealed.

            The Trump administration plans to double down on targeted immigration enforcement, taking Tom Homan's playbook in Minneapolis and applying it to multiple cities nationwide, according to current and former Homeland Security officials.
    


            It's a marked departure from the highly visible and aggressive tactics employed by top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino. That approach, documented in Hollywood-style social media videos and touted by senior Trump officials at the time, is being tabled, for now, following the scenes that unfolded in Minneapolis, including the shooting deaths of two American citizens.
    


            “No more Bovino bullsh*t. That show is shut down,” a Homeland Security official told CNN.
    


            The return to ICE's typical immigration enforcement tactics, which include identifying targets ahead of time, instead of broad sweeps in areas trafficked by immigrants, comes amid waning public support for how the administration has been conducting immigration arrests.
    


            The protests and images coming out of Minneapolis late last month prompted concerns from some Trump administration officials over the optics of the immigration crackdown. That included President Donald Trump, who privately expressed frustration that his immigration messaging was getting lost. The debate over federal immigration enforcement has also sparked a partial government shutdown affecting portions of DHS, as Democrats have pushed for ICE reforms in exchange for supporting funding for the department.
    


            “Targeting public safety threats is nothing new. …  Under Secretary Noem's leadership, nearly 70% of ICE arrests are of illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S.,” a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement, citing more than 700,000 deportations under the Trump administration.
    


            While the administration has said it is prioritizing people with serious criminal records, many of those detained over the last year do not fall in that category. DHS also issued a recent memo stating that immigration authorities should detain refugees who have not yet obtained a green card and detain them for additional screening.
    


            Sources told CNN that late last year, agents had been more focused on developing targets rather than only relying on street encounters. But that changed with an unprecedented surge of thousands of federal agents to Minneapolis over a welfare-fraud scandal that ensnared the Somali community.
    


            Two Americans — Renee Good and Alex Pretti — were shot and killed by federal agents. And two other officers are under investigation over their accounts about what unfolded in an operation where one of the officers shot a Venezuelan man in the leg.
    


            Homan announced a federal drawdown in Minneapolis last week, citing agreements with local officials allowing additional cooperation.
    


            Current and former Homeland Security officials stressed that the latest move toward a more targeted enforcement approach doesn't mean that the crackdown is softening, as some cities may still see larger footprints of ICE agents. The turbocharged sweeps are less likely, though officials cautioned that plans are subject to change. The administration has also escalated efforts to expand immigration detention — an indicator of plans to continue ramped up arrests.
    


            “What they were doing was hoping that high visibility enforcement operations would scare enough illegal aliens to increase self-deportation. I think that's part of what they were thinking,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for limited immigration.
    


            “What they didn't take into account is that people, even though they still back deportation of illegal aliens, they want to see less of the militarized type of action,” he added.
    


            After Trump dispatched Homan to Minneapolis, Bovino was sidelined and returned to his post as chief patrol agent of the El Centro sector. He's since confirmed on X that he was recently at Mammoth Mountain, the California ski resort, saying in a reply to a user: “Katie, the powder was excellent, and some shredding did take place!! Mammoth is an excellent mountain and looking forward to going back!!!! In the meantime, on the lookout for illegal aliens!!”
    


            Bovino's bravado and heavy-handed arrest tactics in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and Minneapolis captured the administration's aggressive approach to its mass deportation pledge — and penchant for public sparring with critics over controversial actions.
    


            It also marked a pivot from the way enforcement responsibilities are generally divided between Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with the latter charged with interior immigration arrests.
    


            Bovino's enforcement style had been backed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The pivot to Homan's approach is a rebuke of that style and reveals the ongoing tensions between different factions in the administration over how to tackle the president's immigration agenda, officials said.
    


            Homan has generally taken a more stringent approach to immigration enforcement, wanting to focus on public safety and national security threats, as well as so-called “collaterals,” meaning undocumented immigrants that may be in the vicinity of a targeted operation.
    


            “ICE has been doing interior enforcement before Bovino got involved. They prefer to conduct their ops without the optics,” another Homeland Security official told CNN. “(Border Patrol) never wanted anything to do with these interior ops and will go back to focusing on the border.”
    


            The change also means “there's less characters in this play and less storylines,” a former Trump official told CNN. “That's where they think they've set the course,” the official added, referring to the White House.
    


            White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN in a statement, “The President's entire team is working together to implement his immigration enforcement agenda – which has always focused on prioritizing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens. The successful deportations, dropping crime rates, and historically secure border prove that. As always, anyone in the country illegally is eligible to be deported.”
    


            Homan acknowledged the issues on the ground in Minneapolis, including officer misconduct, almost immediately after arriving and since then.
    


            In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” Homan said he increased the presence of internal affairs officers in Minnesota since arriving in the Twin Cities to address misconduct allegations among immigration enforcement officers.
    


            “In any instance where there have been allegations of misconduct or working outside the policy, it has been referred to internal affairs,” he said.
    


            Within the Trump administration, there has been infighting between factions who back Homan and those who back Noem. Homan and Noem have rarely spoken to each other in recent months, according to US officials.
    


            Homan said Sunday he doesn't agree with Noem “on everything,” but added that the pair regularly have discussions, and he described the administration's efforts as “one team one fight.”
    


            “We have discussions and different opinions. That's what makes it a strong team. We bring different ideas to the table and then agree on a mission,” Homan said.

            Lawmakers who oversee the Department of Homeland Security say the agency has repeatedly stymied their requests for information in recent months, with even some Republicans alleging they've had phone calls go unanswered and data requests left to languish.
    


            As the Department of Homeland Security has found itself embroiled in controversies across the country over high-profile killings by immigration agents and the resulting bitter policy disputes, lawmakers say they've stepped up their efforts to try to get answers for the public. But they've often been met with resistance, they said — thwarting their ability to hold anyone accountable.
    


            “I'm not going to sit here on bended knee hoping to God that somebody returns the call,” GOP Rep. Mark Amodei, the Republican who oversees the DHS budget in the House told CNN, after his request to speak with White House Border Czar Tom Homan went unanswered for days.
    


            One Republican staffer told CNN that the stonewalling extends beyond just thorny policy questions about immigration enforcement. Requests to the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the status of federal disaster funding and questions over potential crimes committed by those detained by federal officers have also been met with silence or evasiveness, the staffer said.
    


            The result, the staffer said, is not only that GOP lawmakers can't properly oversee the agency, they can't help blunt possibly unfair attacks from their Democratic counterparts.
    


            “It's really a shame that DHS has taken such an adversarial posture on sharing data. In some areas, like on immigration and the border they have a great story to tell, and we could be helping them tell that story,” the staffer explained. “In other areas where the story is not so good, like FEMA, we could also help. But they choose to go at it alone, so it's on them to defend, which is hard to do when no one believes a word they say or a number they put out. There is no trust and there is no way to verify.”
    


            Democrats, meanwhile, say they have received virtually no response from their inquiries to DHS. At least 15 letters sent by members of the party to the department have either been ghosted, received a cursory acknowledgement or were given a non-answer, a Homeland Security Committee Democratic aide told CNN. Another Democratic staffer told CNN that when they've asked for specific FEMA updates, whether it's on mitigation projects, staffing plans or briefings on various press releases, they've gotten no response.
    


            A DHS spokesperson told CNN the department works through “official channels” and would “not be litigating our relationship” with Capitol Hill through the press. But they also dismissed claims they've not engaged with members of Congress.
    


            “Any suggestion that DHS has ‘refused' to engage with lawmakers is simply false,” the spokesperson said in part, adding that “this administration has been the most transparent administration in history and has spent the last year clearing out congressional correspondence that went unanswered under the last administration.”
    


            Some Republicans told CNN they've been able to leverage their personal relationships with Trump administration officials to get their questions answered and others said they had no issues getting quick responses from DHS – “I communicate with them all the time,” GOP Rep. Andy Ogles said. But two top Republican congressman specifically tasked with overseeing DHS are among those who say they've run into issues.
    


            Amodei, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, sought to speak directly with Homan about the operation in Minneapolis shortly after federal officers' fatal encounter with Alex Pretti there, as well as to receive a broader status update on the administration's deportation efforts.
    


            Amodei's office put in the request in January and was redirected to White House Office of Legislative Affairs Director James Braid to coordinate the conversation. The request went unanswered for 10 days, prompting the Nevada Republican to eventually withdraw the request, Amodei said.
    


            The administration was focused on executing the mission in Minneapolis at the time of Amodei's request, an official said when asked by CNN about the request, adding that it could now be arranged.
    


            “At the time, we were prioritizing the actual execution of the mission in Minneapolis,” the administration official said. “Now going forward, we're happy to offer Chairman Amodei a briefing as well as other congressional committees.”
    


            But Amodei, who projected confidence he'll get the information another way, suggested it was a question of respect. “I wish they were more professional with how they dealt with the people who handled their budget,” he told CNN from his Capitol Hill office.
    


            After withdrawing his initial request, Amodei has recently spoken with Braid about arranging a call with Homan, the congressman's office told CNN.
    


            Another Republican chairman — Rep. Andrew Garbarino of the House Homeland Security Committee — tried for weeks to schedule DHS Secretary Kristi Noem for testimony for the annual worldwide threats hearing before his panel, and eventually resorted to asking the White House in December to lean on her to agree on a date, according to a US official familiar with the discussions.
    


            Noem finally agreed to a hearing, where she was excoriated by Democrats for her handling of immigration, FEMA and other issues. The administration official declined to comment on any coordination with Garbarino, saying they don't discuss private conversations with members.
    


            Garbarino said at the eventual December hearing that he made “numerous accommodations” for Noem's appearance.
    


            “This is why this hearing is so important. Congress must hear from the Executive. Oversight is not unfair. And asking questions is not unwarranted. We must ensure the people's representatives are informed,” the New York Republican said at the time.
    


            CNN has reached out to Garbarino's office for comment.
    


            According to a data analysis compiled by ProQuest Congressional Data and shared with CNN, there has been a 28.7% decline in appearances of DHS officials before congressional committees in 2025, compared to the first year of previous administrations.
    


            Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said he's never seen it this bad.
    


            “I've never met Secretary Noem other than the two times she came before the committee last year. I've met every secretary since the department was created in my office or in a number of occasions,” Thompson said.
    


            The Mississippi Democrat said that for a year, he had not had any direct interaction with an ICE official until he met the director the day before his scheduled hearing before the committee earlier this month. Witnesses before a hearing are required to submit their written testimony to Congress the day before a hearing, but Thompson said the ICE director came to his meeting with his prepared testimony in hand and said he was still working on it.
    


            “If the legislative is to function, then the executive branch has to be forthcoming with the information. If they're not forthcoming with the information, then it's almost impossible for the legislative branch to basically provide any road maps for future success because we don't have access to the data,” Thompson said.

Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan reports on the deadly Northern California avalanche that killed eight skiers as the search continues for one missing person on ‘Special Report.'

At least six victims have been identified in the tragic avalanche incident on Tuesday that killed up to nine people in Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, California.

Six of the victims were among a group of outdoor-loving mothers who regularly traveled together. A joint statement from the affected families identified the women as Kate Vitt, Carrie Atkin, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, and sisters Caroline Sekar and Liz Clabaugh.

"We are devastated beyond words," the families said in the statement. "Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women." 

All the women were described as "mothers, wives, and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors."

Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said during a news conference Wednesday that authorities had told the families the mission had shifted from rescue to recovery.

"They were on their way back to camp when the avalanche actually hit," Moon said, adding that it took search and rescue crews hours to find the first few survivors.

The group of women, most of whom resided near California, were reportedly seasoned backcountry skiers. They were reportedly well-trained, fully prepared, and equipped with avalanche safety gear.

"They were passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains," the families' statement said. "They lived in the Bay Area, Idaho, and the Truckee–Tahoe region."

They expressed being "heartbroken" and said they are doing their best to support one another and their families in the way they believe the mothers would have wanted.

McAlister Clabaugh, the brother of Sekar and Clabaugh, told The New York Times that Sekar, 45, was a mother of two who lived in San Francisco. 

Liz Clabaugh, 52, served as a graduate nurse residency program coordinator at St. Luke's Health System in Boise, Idaho, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Vitt, a San Francisco resident, held positions at SiriusXM and Pandora, according to her LinkedIn profile, and was a mother to two children.

Several members of the group were also connected to Sugar Bowl Academy, an elite boarding and day school for competitive skiers and snowboarders that has counted multiple Olympians among its alumni.

"This tragedy has affected each and every one of us. The depth of support for the families whose lives have been changed forever reminds us of how special this community is," Executive Director Stephen McMahon said.

The Feb. 17 avalanche near Castle Peak in the Sierra Nevada mountains became the deadliest in California's history.

Authorities reported that the tragedy involved a group of 15 backcountry skiers, including 11 clients and four guides, on a multiday guided expedition organized by Blackbird Mountain Guides.

Eight people were confirmed dead, with one additional person presumed dead.

"We are profoundly grateful for the extensive rescue efforts by Nevada County Search and Rescue, Tahoe Nordic Search and Rescue and all of the authorities involved, and for the outpouring of support from the Tahoe community and beyond," the families said in the statement.

"We are heartbroken and are doing our best to care for one another and our families in the way we know these women would have wanted," they added. 

To continue recovery efforts for the final missing individual, authorities announced Thursday that all National Forest lands and trails around Castle Peak will be closed for roughly one month, from Feb. 20 through March 15.

Authorities emphasized that emergency personnel may need to use snow machines, aircraft and even explosives during the operations.

"Due to the current instability of the snowpack and need to prioritize first responder access to the area, members of the public are prohibited from entering the closure area during search and rescue operations," the U.S. Forest Service-Tahoe National Forest said.

"It is our top priority to ensure the safety of first responders during this recovery mission and aid in the return of each victim to their families," Tahoe National Forest Supervisor Chris Feutrier added in a statement. "Our deepest condolences to the families that have lost their loved ones from this tragic incident. Our sincere appreciation to all first responders, law enforcement and partners that are supporting this recovery."

The avalanche marks the deadliest in the U.S. since 1981, when 11 climbers were killed on Mount Rainier in Washington state. It is also the second deadly slide near Castle Peak this year after a person on a snowmobile was buried in January.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House announced a reciprocal trade agreement with Indonesia on Thursday while President Prabowo Subianto was in Washington to attend the first meeting of President Donald Trump's Board of Peace.

Under the agreement, Southeast Asia's largest economy will eliminate tariffs for 99% of American goods while the U.S. will maintain tariffs on most Indonesian goods at 19%, the White House said. That is the same rate the U.S. has set for Cambodia and Malaysia. Indonesia also agreed to address non-tariff barriers to U.S. goods and to remove restrictions on exports to the U.S. for critical minerals and other industrial commodities, the White House said.

Indonesian and U.S. companies also reached 11 deals this week worth $38.4 billion, including purchases of U.S. soybeans, corn, cotton and wheat, cooperation in critical minerals and oil field recovery, and joint ventures in computer chips.

“We have negotiated very intensively over the last few months, and I think we have reached solid understandings on many issues,” Prabowo told business executives Wednesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

A White House statement called it a “great deal” and said it “will help both countries to strengthen economic security, promote economic growth, and thereby continuously lead to global prosperity.”

The agreement was later signed by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and his Indonesian counterpart, Airlangga Hartarto.

Hartarto told a news conference from Washington that both governments cast the agreement as marking the start of a “new golden age” in bilateral economic ties and Indonesia will introduce measures designed to keep trade flows secure and prevent misuse of sensitive goods. 




The agreement was announced the same day that Prabowo, leader of the world's most populous Muslim country, reiterated his pledge at the Board of Peace meeting to send 8,000 troops or “more if necessary” for an international stabilization force in Gaza.

Indonesia was among the first to make a firm commitment to a critical element of Trump's postwar Gaza reconstruction plan. 

“President Prabowo of Indonesia, thank you very much,” Trump said at the Board of Peace meeting. “It's a big country you have, and you do a great job.”

Prabowo praised Trump in return. “We are very optimistic with the leadership of President Trump, this vision of real peace will be achieved,” Prabowo said. “There will be problems, but we will prevail.”

Cambodia and Vietnam are the two other Southeast Asian countries that joined the board, which was originally envisioned as overseeing the Gaza ceasefire but has taken shape with wider ambitions to broker other global conflicts.

Their leaders also came to Washington for the inaugural meeting. Cambodia has already inked a trade deal with the U.S., while Vietnam has reached a framework agreement.

Indonesian companies agreed this week to buy 1 million tons of soybeans, 1.6 million tons of corn and 93,000 tons of cotton from the U.S. They also pledged to buy up to 5 million tons of U.S. wheat by 2030.

The countries agreed to cooperate on critical minerals, though details were not immediately available. 

Washington is seeking Indonesia's agreement to lift restrictions on critical mineral exports, which the Trump administration argues could safeguard U.S. manufacturers from supply‑chain disruptions. The administration has sought to defend against China's stranglehold on the key elements needed for everything from fighter jets to smartphones.

At the Chamber of Commerce event, Prabowo said Indonesia can serve as a “bridge” and “honest broker” between great powers, apparently referring to the U.S.-China competition.

At the Board of Peace meeting, Trump called Vietnam “incredible as a country and as a force” and told leader To Lam that it was “a really great honor to have you.”

Lam's visit to the U.S. is his first since he was reelected as the head of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party last month. Typically, China is an initial stop in a nod to the countries' ideological ties and Beijing's status as Vietnam's largest trading partner. Lam did visit China in August 2024 before traveling to the U.S. during his first term.

Analysts say Lam's visit to the U.S. before traveling to Beijing this time around is a notable shift in sequencing. Hanoi describes its foreign policy as independent and balanced among major powers. 

Trade negotiations between Vietnam and the United States are ongoing following the Trump administration levying 20% tariffs on Vietnamese exports. The latest, sixth round of talks concluded in early February.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) criticized President Donald Trump on Thursday night for announcing he would be releasing government files related to aliens. He categorized the decision as an attempt to divert attention from the Epstein files. 

“They've deployed the ultimate weapon of mass distraction, but the Epstein files aren't going away,” Massie said in a post on X. “Even for aliens.”

Trump announced he would “begin the process” of releasing government files “related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena, and unidentified flying objects” in a Truth Social post on Thursday night. 

“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,” Trump said in his Truth Social post. “GOD BLESS AMERICA!”

COMER SAYS ‘REAL BAD PEOPLE' SPOKE TO EPSTEIN POST-CONVICTION, INSISTS FILES ABSOLVE TRUMP

Massie's criticism and Trump's announcement about releasing government files about aliens came on the same day Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, was arrested in the United Kingdom due to suspected misconduct while in public office in connection with the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. 

Massie, along with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), has been one of Congress's most fervent supporters in demanding transparency regarding the Epstein files. Khanna introduced the Epstein Files Transparency Act on July 15, 2025, and Massie cosponsored it on the same day. In the days, weeks, and months following the bill's introduction, 23 other Democrats joined on to co-sponsor the bill. 

Trump signed the bill into law in November.

President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would direct all relevant agencies to release government files related to aliens and any information “connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.” 

Trump cited a heightened interest in extraterrestrials as the reason for his new order in a Truth Social post. 

“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,” Trump said. 

The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office at the War Department is the defense office in charge of detecting and analyzing UAPs and determining possible risk. NASA also has a department dedicated to researching UAPs. 

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) backed Trump's move and called it a “bipartisan thing.”

“I grew up watching The X-Files. If he's going to release all of The X-Files, I think that could be a bipartisan thing,” Fetterman told Jesse Watters on Fox News, saying he believes alien life exists given the trillions of planets in the universe.

During a recent interview, former President Barack Obama said aliens are real but that they aren't being held at Area 51 as online discourse has suggested for years and has been depicted in films and TV shows. Obama later clarified that during his tenure, he saw no evidence of aliens. 

Trump called Obama's comments “a big mistake” and said the former president was disclosing classified information. 

While Trump now said he will make information on E.T.s public, he joked about the possibility early in the day, saying he would need to do so to get Obama “out of trouble.” He also joked that while he doesn't know whether aliens exist, he knows “illegal aliens” are real.

Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, previously said that the president already has a speech prepared to announce information about life beyond Earth. She said the president was “coy” when she asked about the topic.

A reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt about the supposed speech, but Leavitt said she is not aware of such a thing but that she would “check in” with the president's speech writers.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico's attorney general has reopened an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein 's former Zorro Ranch, as allegations swirl about what role the secluded spot played in sexual abuse or sex trafficking of underage girls and young women.

Attorney General Raúl Torrez's office said Thursday that the decision was made after reviewing information recently released by the U.S. Justice Department.

Although New Mexico's initial case was closed in 2019 at the request of federal prosecutors in New York, state prosecutors say now that “revelations outlined in the previously sealed FBI files warrant further examination.” 

The New Mexico Department of Justice said special agents and prosecutors at the agency will be seeking immediate access to the complete, unredacted federal case file and intend to work with other law enforcement partners as well as a new truth commission established by state lawmakers to look into activities at the ranch.

“As with any potential criminal matter, we will follow the facts wherever they lead, carefully evaluate jurisdictional considerations, and take appropriate investigative action, including the collection and preservation of any relevant evidence that remains available,” the New Mexico Department of Justice said in a statement.

The investigation was one of several major developments in the continuing fallout from the release of the federal government's so-called Epstein files. Earlier Thursday, British police arrested the former Prince Andrew on suspicion of misconduct in public office related to his links to the late sex offender.




In Washington, D.C., members of Congress are still working to lift the veil with more testimony from powerful people.

On Thursday, video was released of a six-hour deposition of billionaire retail mogul Les Wexner. In it, Wexner remains defiant that he didn't know of or participate in Epstein's crimes, and he doubles down on the fact that the two “weren't friends.”

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is scheduled to appear before the same House Oversight Committee next week, with former President Bill Clinton following the next day.

In New Mexico, the state's truth commission had its first meeting Tuesday. Aside from looking into the abuse and trafficking allegations, New Mexico lawmakers want to know why Epstein was not registered as a sex offender in the state after pleading guilty in 2008 in Florida to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl and whether there was corruption among public officials.

Epstein never faced charges in New Mexico, but state prosecutors confirmed in 2019 that they had interviewed possible victims who visited the ranch south of Santa Fe. They never elaborated on how many accusers were interviewed or what they say took place at the ranch.

Also Thursday, lawyers for Epstein accusers said they've reached a proposed settlement in a class action lawsuit against his estate — the latest effort to compensate his victims. Pending a judge's approval, Epstein's estate would pay between $25 million and $35 million, depending on how many victims qualify for the settlement.

The estate previously paid 136 claimants a total of $121 million via its Epstein Victims Compensation Program and paid more than $48 million to settle claims from 59 other victims, court records show.

Epstein purchased the sprawling Zorro Ranch in New Mexico in 1993 from former Democratic Gov. Bruce King and built a hilltop mansion. Nearby was a private airstrip with a hangar and helipad. The property also included a ranch office, a firehouse and a seven-bay heated garage.

The property was sold by Epstein's estate in 2023 — with proceeds going toward creditors — to the family of Don Huffines, a Republican running for state comptroller in Texas. In a social media post on X, Huffines said the property has been renamed San Rafael Ranch after a saint associated with healing and that his family plans to operate a Christian retreat there.

A spokesperson for Huffines has said that the owners have never been approached by local, state or federal law enforcement requesting access to the ranch and if they do, full cooperation will be granted.

There are thousands of references to the ranch in the documents released by federal authorities.

Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, was among the guests to have visited the ranch. Following one of the early investigations into the disgraced financier, Richardson donated $50,000 in 2006 gubernatorial campaign contributions from Epstein to charity.

Emails and schedules recently released by federal authorities also show a long list of entrepreneurs, actors and scientists were invited to the ranch over the years, including Woody Allen, Robert Redford, Reid Hoffman, Joi Ito and Peter Thiel.

New Mexico Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard canceled grazing leases held by the ranch in 2019 after her office was denied access to inspect the nearly 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) of leased state land.

Garcia Richard in a letter sent last week called on federal authorities and state prosecutors to ensure a thorough criminal investigation into allegations related to the ranch. She called the allegations “deeply disturbing.”

In 2019 after Epstein's death, a woman identified as Jane Doe said in court that he had molested her at Zorro Ranch in 2004, when she was 15. The woman recalled feeling small and powerless, describing how he laid her on the floor so she was confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians.

“People deserve to know the truth about what happened on Epstein's ranch and are looking to leaders for answers,” Garcia Richard said in a statement.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Actor Shia LaBeouf has been charged with battery and is accused of repeatedly using homophobic slurs while hitting multiple people at a New Orleans bar during Mardi Gras, according to a police report.

The New Orleans police report obtained by The Associated Press via a public records request states that LaBeouf, 39, “became irate and aggressive throughout the night” and struck multiple people with a closed fist at the Royal Street Inn & R Bar, near the historic French Quarter. 

Jeffrey Damnit, a well-known local entertainer who police identified as Jeffrey Klein in the incident report, said he was one of the people attacked by LaBeouf.

“He hit me, he connected a few times with punches, he pushed me a few times,” Damnit said.

LaBeouf “just got nuts” trying to start fights and telling the entertainer and others that he would beat them up, Damnit said. He added that LaBeouf had pushed him from behind at the bar earlier in the night, shouting homophobic slurs and threatening his life.

Damnit was wearing eye makeup and lipstick and said he believes his appearance motivated LaBeouf's attack. 

“That's just somehow something that set him off, angered him and gave him a direction for his anger,” Damnit said. “This guy wants me to be dead because I wear makeup. It's a screwed up thing.”

A video shows a shirtless LaBeouf shoving one person to the ground and hitting another person in the face, “causing his nose to possibly dislocate,” according to the police report.




Damnit and others subdued LaBeouf and tried to get him to leave the area, but he would not leave and became more aggressive, according to Damnit and the police report.

Police arrived at the bar around 12:45 a.m. on the morning of the city's famous Fat Tuesday revelry.

Another video recorded by Damnit and shared with the AP shows LaBeouf looking at the camera and appearing to mouth a homophobic slur while police detained him. He continued to repeat the slur throughout the arrest, the police report stated.

“These f–––––s put me in jail,” LaBeouf said, and then told police he's Catholic, according to the report. 

“I didn't shove nobody, I never touched nobody,” LaBeouf tells New Orleans police officers in the video recorded by Damnit.

Representatives for LaBeouf did not immediately respond to request for comment. In the early morning hours of Feb. 18, LaBeouf wrote “Free me” on his X account. 

A New Orleans magistrate judge ordered LaBeouf to be released from custody on Tuesday without a bond requirement, according to Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gary Scheets. LaBeouf has been charged with two counts of simple battery.

Videos later show LaBeouf dancing throughout the French Quarter and appear to show him waving his jail release papers.

Damnit, a member of the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, says he is worried that he will face ramifications in his professional career for pressing charges against LaBeouf. 

This isn't the first time LaBeouf has faced legal troubles. He was sent to court-ordered rehabilitation after being arrested in New York in 2017 for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct, which was captured on livestream video. 

While on location in Georgia filming “The Peanut Butter Falcon,” later that year, he was arrested for public drunkenness and accused of disorderly conduct and obstruction and sentenced to probation. 

In 2020, he was charged with misdemeanor battery and petty theft in Los Angeles.

That year, the English singer and actor FKA Twigs, whose legal name is Tahliah Barnett, also filed a lawsuit alleging LaBeouf was physically and emotionally abusive to her during their relationship, which they settled in July.

Barnett said LaBeouf put her in a constant state of fear and humiliation, once slammed her into a car, tried to strangle her and knowingly gave her a sexually transmitted disease.

LaBeouf apologized in a statement after the lawsuit was filed. He also denied the accusations in the lawsuit in a 2021 filing, saying any injuries done or damages incurred by Barnett were not his doing.

The actor first gained acclaim as a child for his role on the Disney Channel series “Even Stevens,” and continued working steadily into adulthood. He is perhaps best known for his roles in 2007's “Transformers” and in 2008's “Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.”

LaBeouf shares a daughter, born in 2022, with actor Mia Goth.

Speaking at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace, President Donald Trump warned anew that “bad things will happen” if Iran refuses to make a deal on its nuclear program. Trump said the world will find out “over the next, probably, ten days.”

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

President Donald Trump was in Georgia Thursday for a trip designed to help boost Republicans' political standing heading into the midterms.

In the battleground state, the president spoke on economic issues. The White House has long said Trump would focus more on the economy, and he frequently complains that he doesn't get enough credit for it. But recent months have been dominated by other issues, including deadly clashes during deportation efforts in Minneapolis.

Trump began the day by announcing at his inaugural Board of Peace meeting that nine members have agreed to pledge a combined $7 billion for a Gaza relief package and five countries agreed to deploy troops for an international stabilization force in the war-battered Palestinian territory.

But $7 billion is only a fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild Gaza, where a shaky ceasefire deal looms over Trump's ambitions for his board to rival the United Nations in solving world conflicts.

What to know:








One senior regional government official said he has stressed to Iranian officials in private conversations that Trump has proven that his rhetoric should be taken at face value and that he's serious about his threat to carry out a strike if Iran doesn't offer adequate concessions.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate diplomatic conversations, said he's advised his Iranian interlocutors to look to how Trump has dealt with Venezuela, the Russia-Ukraine war, relations with Europe and pressing allies and foes for tariffs and draw lessons on how it should move forward.

The official said he's made the case to the Trump administration that it could draw concessions from Iran in the near-term if it focuses on nuclear issues and leaves the push on Tehran to scale back its ballistic missile program and support for proxy group for later.

The official also said Trump ordering a limited strike aimed at pressuring Iran could backfire and lead to Khamenei withdrawing Iran from the talks.

The president kicked off his remarks at a Georgia steel company by complaining about the fact that many of his tariffs have been challenged and are waiting a ruling from the Supreme Court that could come as soon as Friday .

“I have to wait for this decision!” Trump said. “I've been waiting forever!”

Reaching a yell at several points, Trump said of his imposition of tariffs, “I have the right to do it as president.”

“What a country,” he said. “So sad.”

With the Supreme Court's tariff's decision still pending, Trump during a tour of Coosa Steel expressed exasperation that his administration is even in court over the issue.

“Every country in the world was ripping us off,” Trump said, addressing reporters as he toured the plant with owner Andrew Saville. “And to think that we have to be before the Supreme Court on a thing like this.”

The high court's decision over the legality of Trump's tariffs is still pending, three months after the case was argued.

Several justices expressed skepticism about the tariffs' legality at arguments in November. Standing with Trump, Saville told the president he'd “leveled the playing field” for businesses like his, which Saville said was struggling previously.

Stopping at The Varsity hamburger restaurant in Rome, Georgia, Trump said Democrats were “fighting like hell” against his administration's seizure of voting records and ballots in Georgia's Fulton County.

“All those crooked ballots were taken,” he said, of the FBI search last month.Trump has long seen Georgia as central to his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen by Democrats and President Joe Biden, a fabrication that he reiterated this week during a White House reception on Black History Month.

Audits, state officials, courts and Trump's own former attorney general have all rejected the idea of widespread problems that could have altered the election.

Ahead of taping a podcast interview, a steel company tour and remarks on the economy, Trump called the Fulton County situation “a disgrace” and said his administration was “cleaning it up.”

Police in the town of Aberdeen believe someone Wednesday afternoon threw from a moving vehicle a flash-bang — which creates a very loud noise — that landed 150 yards from a tent where the site operates in a park.

No one was injured and no property damage occurred. Police Capt. Shannon Blackburn said investigators believe the cylinder was detonated because of the voting site, which is being used for next month's primary elections. Flash-bangs can be used to attempt to disperse crowds.

Blackburn said witnesses reported hearing what they thought was a blown electrical transformer, and saw no vehicle or potential suspect. The investigation is continuing.

Aberdeen is a town of 9,000 about 70 miles southwest of Raleigh.

Early voting for the March 3 primary runs Feb. 12-28. Races includes nominations for a U.S. Senate seat, and for various congressional, legislative and judicial positions.

The president was asked about his threat that “really bad things” will happen to Iran if it does not strike a deal with the U.S. over its nuclear program. 

When asked by a reporter what the goal of a strike would be, Trump said, “I'm not going to talk to you about that. We're either going to get a deal or it's going to be unfortunate for them.”

He said Iran has 10 to 15 days to reach a deal.

“I would think that would be enough time,” he said.

Javier Milei, Argentina's right-wing president and one of Trump's closest allies in the region, announced he would be willing to deploy members of the country's international humanitarian assistance corps, Cascos Blancos, to support reconstruction efforts in Gaza.

“Our track record in peacekeeping operations is a proven asset that we put at the service of the stabilization force,” Milei said during his speech. Since their creation in 1994, the Cascos Blancos have operated in more than 80 countries.

Milei said Argentina believes “in a diplomacy that assumes risks to achieve peace” and praised Trump's determination to pursue a solution in Gaza.

“Argentina participates in this Council with the conviction that peace requires political will and an institutional framework capable of sustaining real solutions over time. Trump has led by example by mediating the peace agreement in Gaza,” Milei added.

President Donald Trump on Thursday refused to say whether he's seen evidence that aliens had visited earth.

The president was asked directly about “non-human visitors” while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One.

Trump said that former President Barack Obama shared classified information by recently suggesting that aliens are real.

“I don't know if they're real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information,” Trump said of Obama. “He's not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information.”

Trump continued: “I don't have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.”

President Donald Trump said the arrest of former Prince Andrew on suspicion of misconduct related to his ties to Jeffrey Epstein “is a shame,” telling reporters he is an “expert” on the matter and claiming to be “totally exonerated” in the scandal.

The president said to reporters as he prepared to head to Georgia for an event that the arrest of the former prince is “very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family.”

Trump praised his brother, King Charles, and said he “would be coming to our country very soon.”

Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address next week, just months after resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican.

The Democratic rebuttal will immediately follow Trump's address to Congress next Tuesday, offering the party's most high-profile opportunity to deliver a countermessage.

Spanberger, who served three terms in Congress, became Virginia's first female governor earlier this year. She won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families.

The second lady thanked people for “the outpouring of love and excitement” that followed the January announcement by her and her husband, Vice President JD Vance, that she is pregnant with their fourth child.

“Your support means more to us than we can say,” she said Wednesday in a social media post.

But she asked supporters to refrain from sending gifts and to consider helping others instead.

“We would be honored if you would consider making a donation to your local diaper bank to help families in need,” she said.

The newest member of the Vance family, the couple's third son, is due in July. They also have a young daughter.

The Trump administration last week made a $160 million partial payment of its past dues to the United Nations regular budget, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told the Associated Press.

The payment comes as Trump adjourned his first meeting Thursday of the Board of Peace, a new initiative many see as his attempt to replace the U.N. Security Council's role in preventing and ending conflict around the world.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had warned earlier this month that the world body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues, a message clearly directed at the United States.

The U.S. owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.'s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year, according to a U.N. official. The U.S. also owes $1.8 billion for the separate budget for the U.N.'s far-flung peacekeeping operations, and that also will rise.

It wasn't only heads of state who offered major contributions to Trump's Board of Peace.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino outlined a new plan by the world's governing body of football — “soccer” for those who live in the U.S. — to bring new sports opportunities to war-torn Gaza.

“We don't have to rebuild houses or schools or hospitals or roads,” Infantino said. “We also have to rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust. And this is what football, my sport, is about.”

Specifically, FIFA pledged to spend $50 million for a national football stadium in Gaza to hold between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators in addition to a FIFA academy at a cost of $15 million. The organization also vowed to build 50 “FIFA arena mini pitches” and five full-sized pitches at a total cost of $7.5 million.

Workers are restoring an exhibit depicting the history of the nine people once enslaved in Philadelphia amid a legal fight between the city and the Trump Administration.

Mayor Cherelle Parker visited the site Thursday morning and saw the work being done, spokesperson Joe Grace said.

A federal judge had set a Friday deadline for the Interior Department to restore the exhibit on the people enslaved by George Washington at the former President's House on Independence Mall.

Senior U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe issued the deadline Wednesday even as the Justice Department appeals her order to reinstate the exhibit.

In the last of several statements made about the United Nations, Trump ended his inaugural meeting Thursday by hinting that the U.S. -- the world body's largest donor -- will be making more changes to the institution, including to the appearance of its headquarters in New York.

Many world leaders and diplomats have been worried that Trump's new initiative was an attempt to eclipse the U.N. Security Council. But Trump attempted to assuage those concerns, saying that the U.S. will “work again with the United Nations and, bring it back to health.”

He added that his administration plans to “fix up even the building.”

“I like to see beautiful buildings. I like to see buildings fixed up physically, not look like they are in disrepair,” Trump said. “We don't like that. So we're going to do a job with the United Nations.”

Billionaire investor Marc Rowan, a member of the Board of Peace's executive committee, said reconstruction would begin in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.

He said 100,000 homes for 500,000 people, about a quarter of Gaza's population, were initially planned, along with $5 billion of infrastructure. He said “over time,” 400,000 new homes for Gaza's entire population were planned, with $30 billion in infrastructure projects.

He gave no timeline for when construction would begin.

“This is not a problem of money or collateral,” he said. “This is a problem of peace.”

In an hourslong meeting, leaders from various countries, including Peru, Bahrain and Pakistan, spent most of their speaking time praising Trump and what they called his “unprecedented” ability to end conflicts around the world.

Pakistan called him the “savior of South Asia,” while others said that years of U.S. foreign policy efforts by his predecessor failed to do what Trump has done in the last year. 

The glowing remarks that went around from each corner of the globe resembled the same format and tone of Trump's Cabinet meetings, which involve less policy substance and more adulation for the Republican president.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his pledge that Gaza will not be rebuilt until Hamas disarms.

“We agreed with our friends in the United States: There will be no reconstruction of the Gaza Strip before the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip,” he said in a speech to graduating officers at an army base in southern Israel.

“Soon, Hamas will face a dilemma: disarm the easy way — or disarm the hard way. But it will be disarmed, and Gaza will no longer threaten Israel.”

Iran held annual military drills with Russia on Thursday as a second American aircraft carrier drew closer to the Middle East, with both the United States and Iran signaling they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran's nuclear program fizzle out.

Trump said he hopes to reach a deal with Iran, but the talks have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups. Indirect talks held in recent weeks made little visible progress, and one or both sides could be buying time for final war preparations.

Iran's theocracy is more vulnerable than ever, following 12 days of Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites and military last year, as well as mass protests in January that were violently suppressed. But it is still capable of striking Israel and U.S. bases, and has warned that any attack would trigger a regional war.

Despite repeatedly underscoring the importance of preventing and ending conflict, Trump made several pointed remarks during his Board of Peace meeting directed at Iran as the U.S. has amassed a significant military in the region.

The Republican president stood in front of many of the same regional allies who have pressured the U.S. in the last few weeks to not take military action against Iran and once again warned its longtime adversary to come to the table with an acceptable deal or face the consequences.

“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise bad things happen,” Trump said.

The inaugural meeting of Trump's Board of Peace comes perhaps ironically at a time of high tension between the United States and Iran and one of the largest U.S. military buildups in the Middle East in decades, with one aircraft carrier group in the region already and another on the way.

The military moves have coincided with the series of threats Trump has made to Iran if it does not accede to his demands to denuclearize, give up ballistic missiles and halt funding extremist proxy groups.

Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, the leader of the newly-created International Stabilization Force, announced that Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have all pledged troops to the effort. In addition, Egypt and Jordan, which border the Gaza strip, have agreed to train the police and security forces.

“With these first steps, we help bring the security that Gaza needs for a future of prosperity and enduring peace,” Jeffers said.

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved Trump's proposal, despite raising concerns at the panel's January meeting. Some commissioners had questioned the lead architect about its “immense” design and scale, roughly twice the size of the White House itself.

Trump's demolition of the East Wing prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment typical for even relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued in federal court to halt construction. And the project is scheduled for additional discussion at a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission, now led by one of Trump's top aides.

The vice president nodded to domestic politics heading into the midterm elections in his brief statement to the board. 

“The reason that we're here today is yes to save lives and yes to promote peace, but this creates incredible prosperity for the American people,” Vance said.

He said the countries represented on the board represent “trillions of dollars of investment” in the U.S., and support millions of American jobs by buying goods made in America.

The direct line between the Board of Peace and the U.S. economy is not completely clear. Trump's trade war has strained economic relations with several major U.S. allies.

The Republican president repeated his concerns and criticism of the United Nations during his Board of Peace meeting, saying the UN should have been more involved in conflict-solving than it has been.

But, Trump also said that the U.S. is going “to be working with the United Nations very close.”

“Someday I won't be here. The United Nations will be, I think, is going to be much stronger,” he said. “The Board of Peace is gonna almost be looking over the United Nations, and making sure it runs properly.”

Trump also announced the U.S. is pledging $10 billion for the Board of Peace, but didn't specify what the money will be used for.

“The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room,” Trump said.

Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait are the countries that are making pledges, Trump said.

“But every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region),” said Trump in thanking the donors.

The amount, while significant, represents a fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory decimated after two years of war.

Shouting out all of the various conflicts he says he solved, Trump mentioned that Iran is “a hotspot right now.” He said his envoys have had “very interesting” meetings with Iranian officials. 

His positive comments come as the two adversaries have leaned into gunboat diplomacy in recent weeks, with nuclear talks between the nations hanging in the balance, Tehran holding drills with Russia and the Americans bringing another aircraft carrier closer to the Mideast.

“It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran, and we have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise bad things happen,” Trump said.

Trump is fueling the rivalry between the two members of his administration considered the frontrunners to replace him as the GOP's next presidential nominee: Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance.

Trump described Vance as “a fantastic man” and a “fantastic talent” before running through the highlights of the vice president's education and marriage and noting that Vance “gets a little bit tough on occasion.”

The president then pivoted to Rubio, calling his leadership style “the opposite extreme. ... Marco does it with a velvet glove, but it's a kill.”

Trump then praised Rubio's performance at the Munich Security Conference this week, joking that if he did his job any better he'd be fired for outshining him.

Much can change in the two years before voters pick the GOP's 2028 presidential nominee. The Constitution bars Trump from seeking a third term.

A week after Trump blasted him as a RINO, short for Republican In Name Only, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt struck a conciliatory tone toward the White House.

“Politics is tough,” Stitt said Thursday at an event sponsored by Politico at the outset of the National Governors Association's annual meeting. “Politics has a way of just beating you down over time so I can't imagine being president of the United States. He's got a tough job to do.”

Stitt is the president of the NGA this year. The group, made up of governors from both parties, is typically one of the few bipartisan organizations to convene in Washington each year.

But this year's meeting has been defined by tensions as Trump has refused to invite two Democratic governors to a business meeting at the White House. Trump said Stitt mischaracterized his position.

Trump says Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the driving force behind renaming the U.S. Institute of Peace the “Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace,” in a move still being contested in courts.

“Marco named it after me,” Trump said Thursday at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace at the former USIP building. Trump said it was a surprise. Rubio is not known to have played a significant role in the renaming, although the State Department is the current custodian.

The USIP was created as an independent entity by Congress in 1984, a status Trump sought to revoke last year when the building was seized from its leadership and nearly all of its employees fired. The changes remain subject to litigation.

In one of many tangents, Trump used his speech at the Board of Peace meeting to reinforce his support for various foreign leaders who are facing or were recently facing a contested election in their country. Many of the endorsements are part of Trump's pattern of embracing autocratic leaders who are part of a global pushback against democratic traditions.

“I'm not supposed to be endorsing people, but I endorse, when I like people. You know, I've had a very good record of endorsing candidates within the United States, but now I endorse foreign leaders, including Viktor Orbán, who's here,” Trump said, mentioning also Milei and the prime minister of Japan.

While Trump convenes his Board of Peace, the nation's governors also are gathering in Washington. Their annual gathering has traditionally been a show of bipartisanship. Trump disrupted norms by not inviting all governors to meetings at the White House. 

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, joined Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, both Republicans, in opening this year's National Governors Association on a panel where they emphasized bipartisanship, regardless of Trump's actions. 

The break with tradition reflects Trump's broader approach in his second term. He has taken a confrontational stance toward some state leaders, withholding federal funds from states that draw his ire and deploying federal troops to cities over the objections of local officials.

Despite the presence Thursday of dozens of world leaders, Trump noted that many countries — including the U.K., France and Canada — have chosen to not yet accept the invitation to the Board of Peace.

“Almost everybody's accepted, and the ones that haven't, will be. And some are playing a little cute — it doesn't work. You can't play cute with me,” Trump said. “But, this is the most prestigious board ever put together.”

In his opening remarks, Trump welcomes the dozens of world leaders in attendance and says many of them have become “incredible friends of mine.”

“Board of Peace is one of the most important and consequential things, I think, that I'll be involved in,” the second-term president said.

Trump and other world leaders have arrived at the first meeting of the Board of Peace.

Flanked by Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump stood in front of leaders from Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Qatar, among others, to take a group photo before discussing the various parts of the president's peace plan for Gaza.

A number of world leaders, including Argentina's Javier Milei, Hungary's Viktor Orbán and others carried red hats with the emblem “USA” and an American flag on the side, and put them on the tables next to their country signs.

The new research tied to one of America's leading banks provides more evidence that Trump‘s push to charge higher taxes on imports is causing economic disruption.

The additional taxes have meant that companies that employ a combined 48 million people in the U.S. — the kinds of businesses Trump had promised to revive — have had to absorb the new expense by passing it along to customers in the form of higher prices, employing fewer workers or accepting lower profits.

“That's a big change in their cost of doing business,” said Chi Mac, business research director of the JPMorganChase Institute, which published the analysis on Thursday.

The research adds to a growing body of economic analyses that counter the administration's claims that foreigners pay the tariffs.

Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin told reporters earlier this week that “at the international level it should above all be the U.N. that manages these crisis situations.” 

The Trump administration on Wednesday pushed back: “This president has a very bold and ambitious plan and vision to rebuild and reconstruct Gaza, which is well underway because of the Board of Peace,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “This is a legitimate organization where there are tens of member countries from around the world.”

And Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said the board is “not talking, it is doing.”

“We are hearing the chattering class criticizing the structure of the board, that it's unconventional, that it's unprecedented,” Waltz said. “Again, the old ways were not working.”

Trump said this week he hopes the board would push the U.N. to “get on the ball.”

“The United Nations has great potential,” he said. “They haven't lived up to the potential.”

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts is one of two federal panels reviewing the president's plans to build a ballroom twice the size of the White House itself on the site of the former East Wing.

The commission, now led by Trump's appointees, is scheduled to further discuss the project at its monthly meeting on Thursday, held over Zoom.

At last month's meeting, some of those commissioners questioned the architect about the “immense” design and scale of the project even as they broadly endorsed the president's vision for the massive expansion.

The U.S. trade deficit slipped modestly in 2025 as Trump upended global commerce by slapping double digit tariffs on imports from most countries.

The gap the between the goods and services the U.S. sells other countries and what it buys from them narrowed to just over $901 billion from $904 billion in 2024, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 

Exports rose 6% last year, and imports rose nearly 5%. The trade gap surged from January-March as U.S. companies tried to import foreign goods ahead of Trump's taxes, then narrowed most of the rest of the year.

Trump's tariffs are a tax paid by U.S. importers and often passed along to their customers as higher prices. But they haven't had as much impact on inflation as economists originally expected. Trump argues that the tariffs will protect U.S. industries, bringing manufacturing back to America and raising money for the U.S. Treasury.

Members of the United Nations Security Council are calling for Gaza ceasefire deal to become permanent, and blasting Israeli efforts to expand control in the West Bank as a threat to prospects of a two-state solution. They met Wednesday on the eve of Trump's first Board of Peace gathering to discuss the future of the Palestinian territories.

The high-level U.N. session in New York was originally scheduled for Thursday but was moved up after Trump announced the board's meeting for the same day, complicating travel plans for diplomats. It is a sign of the potential for overlapping and conflicting agendas between the United Nations' most powerful body and Trump's broader ambitions to broker global conflicts, which have raised concerns in some countries that it may attempt to rival the U.N. Security Council.

Retail mogul Les Wexner's lawyer scolded him over the lengthy answers given during a House oversight committee hearing on Wednesday. 

The video of Wexner's nearly five-hour deposition, where he was questioned about his association with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was released Thursday, and Wexner's lawyer could be heard telling him to tighten up his answers. 

“I'll f***ing kill you if you answer another question in more than five words,” Michael Levy whispered into Wexner's ear. 

The remark came after Wexner was asked how Epstein could have other clients when managing Wexner's extensive wealth portfolio, to which he began explaining the breakdown of his employees who manage his personal finances.

Before telling Wexner to answer briefly, Levy had to continue reminding Wexner to answer the question and not tell stories. 

Questions about President Donald Trump's relationship with Epstein also came up during the deposition. 

“I would go to some of the Victoria's Secret fashion shows because it was very important to the brand,” Wexner said. “At some of the fashion shows, Jeffrey was there, and [at] some, Trump was there. Trump would always introduce himself to me. I always thought it was kind of odd … because [Trump] had nothing to do with fashion.” 

Wexner did not place Epstein and Trump together at the same fashion show, “I have no specific recollection.” He also said he didn't think of the two as friends and said Epstein “held him out as a friend.” 

Wexner was subpoenaed to testify before the committee after his name appeared over 200 times in the Epstein files. Wexner answered questions from his home in New Albany, Ohio. 

Throughout the deposition, Wexner maintained that he was unaware of Epstein's involvement with underage girls and said their association ended when Epstein was being investigated in 2006. 

Wexner, the founder of LBrands, which owns clothing lines such as Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch, called Epstein a “conman” and said he was not aware of Epstein's crimes.

The 88-year-old billionaire explained that Epstein started managing his personal finances in the 1980s. He said Epstein called the services “favors” in a con to gain Wexner's trust. 

Once the Epstein files were released and Wexner had time to review the finances managed by the late financier, Wexner said Epstein had stolen millions of dollars from his family.

President Donald Trump said Friday he will sign an executive order imposing a new 10% "global tariff," hours after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping "reciprocal" import duties in a major rebuke of his trade agenda.

The new "Section 122" tariffs will come on top of the existing levies that remain intact following the high court's decision, Trump said as he raged at the "deeply disappointing" ruling during a White House press briefing.

"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country," Trump said.

The court's ruling invalidated the legal underpinning of many of the tariffs that Trump insists are essential for the U.S. economy and for rebuilding America's shrinking manufacturing base. 

Trump was adamant that he will find other ways to impose tariffs without Congress.

"I don't have to," Trump said when asked why he did not want to work with the legislative branch. "I have the right to do tariffs."

Trump's remarks vacillated between defiant and scathing. He even went after Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he nominated, after they voted with the majority in the 6-3 tariff ruling."I think their decision was terrible," Trump said. "I think it's an embarrassment to their families, you want to know the truth. The two of them." 

He said he will sign an order later Friday imposing the new 10% duties, which are being invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Tariffs conjured using that statute can only last for 150 days, with any extension requiring congressional approval.

Asked at the press briefing about that time limit and about getting congressional buy-in, Trump said, "We have the right to do pretty much what we want to do."

Trump also declared that all the tariffs active under statutes known as Section 232 and Section 301 will remain "in full force and effect."

The Trump administration is also wielding Section 301 to launch several investigations into potentially unfair trade practices, which could result in additional new tariffs, Trump said.

The court's ruling struck down the tariffs Trump had invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. Trump's reciprocal tariffs and his drug-trafficking-related duties both hinged on that law.

The high court majority ruled Friday that IEEPA "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs."

Most of the U.S. tariff revenue generated last year came from the IEEPA duties.

Trump said Friday, "other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected."

"We'll take in more money, and we'll be a lot stronger for it," he said.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking at the Economic Club of Dallas shortly after Trump, said that the administration will replace the rejected IEEPA tariffs by leveraging a number of other existing tariff laws.

Doing so "will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026," Bessent said. "No one should expect that the tariff revenue will go down."

A federal judge in Miami denied Tesla's bid to toss out a $243 million verdict in a lawsuit that requires the automaker to compensate the family of a 2019 fatal Autopilot crash victim as well as a survivor.

The collision, which occurred in Key Largo, Florida, killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides and severely injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. Tesla owner George McGee was driving his Model S sedan while using the company's Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system. During the trial, McGee said that when he dropped his phone while driving and scrambled to pick it up, he thought the system would brake if an obstacle was in the way. 

McGee's car instead accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 mph, hitting a nearby empty parked car as well as Angulo and Benavides, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle. 

A jury determined last year that Tesla should be held partially responsible for the fatal crash. Tesla filed to appeal the suit, seeking to have the verdict tossed or to proceed with a new trial. 

In her order out Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom wrote that "evidence admitted at trial more than supports the jury verdict," and there was no error previously, or additional argument introduced justifying a new trial or change to the earlier verdict.

"We are of course pleased, but also completely unsurprised that the honorable Judge Bloom upheld the jury's verdict finding Tesla liable for the integral role Autopilot and the company's misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed Naibel and permanently injured Dillon," Brett Schreiber, lead trial counsel for the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement. 

Attorneys for Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The ruling marks the latest setback for Elon Musk's automaker as the company tries to play catch-up in the nascent robotaxi market. Tesla is way behind Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China, as both companies offer commercial ride-hailing services. Musk said last month that Tesla will have a "widespread" network of driverless robotaxis in the U.S. by the end of 2026, but the company doesn't yet offer driverless ride-hailing services widely and only operates a handful of robotaxis in Austin, Texas.

Gibson Dunn, which represented Tesla, had argued that compensatory damages in the Florida case should be steeply reduced from $129 million to no more than $69 million, which would have resulted in Tesla having to pay a $23 million award. The firm also said punitive damages should be eliminated or reduced to, at most, three times compensatory damages due to a statutory cap in the state of Florida.

The student loan delinquency rate is surging, new research finds. 

Nearly 25% of student loan borrowers with a payment due are now behind, compared with around 9% in 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term, according to a report published Friday by The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.

Around 7.9 million student loan borrowers entered delinquency in the first three quarters of 2025 alone, the authors of the study wrote. The foundation used data from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel, a 2% nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with credit records, for its analysis.

The researchers said the Trump administration's policies during the president's second term are to blame for the spike in delinquencies. 

"By blocking access to the very programs designed to help struggling borrowers, Donald Trump is trapping millions in a spiral of debt that is destroying their credit scores and locking them out of homeownership, buying a car and other life milestones," said Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and lead author of the study.

Ellen Keast, press secretary for higher education at the Education Department, said the Biden administration had masked delinquency rates with its relief measures for student loan borrowers. 

"The idea of a sudden increase in delinquencies in student loans is a misnomer," Keast said. "The Trump Administration is once again reporting full and accurate data on student loan repayment instead of extending so-called flexibilities related to a pandemic that ended five years ago."

More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Student loan borrowers are facing a recent barrage of changes to the lending system, including the end of the Biden administration's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That plan was designed to be the most affordable repayment plan to date, but faced Republican-led legal challenges and was ultimately blocked in court. 

For roughly five years, starting with the Covid pandemic, student loan borrowers who missed their payments were also shielded from collection activity and negative credit reporting. That relief is now expired. 

Around 2 million student loan borrowers with delinquent loans have seen their credit scores fall, with an average drop in score to 580 from 680, the Foundation estimates. Credit scores, which impact people's ability and costs to borrow, typically range from 300 to 850, with around 670 and higher considered good.

The Education Department announced last year that it would begin collection activity against defaulted borrowers, but has repeatedly paused those enforcement efforts.

The Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce have likely also exacerbated student loan borrowers' repayment struggles, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. 

In March, Trump officials terminated thousands of the Education Department's staffers, including many who helped borrowers. The administration has also rolled back the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's enforcement activity and sought to reduce the agency's staff and funding, although many of those actions have been challenged in court. The CFPB oversees student loan servicers and combats abusive practices in the lending space.

"When you get rid of people who help borrowers face financial challenges, is it any surprise that these borrowers encounter problems dealing with debt?" Kantrowitz said. 

More than 600,000 federal student loan holders remain in a backlog of applications for an affordable repayment plan, the Education Department disclosed in a recent court filing. More than 86,000 borrowers are waiting for a decision from the department on their student loan forgiveness.

Student loan delinquency rates are especially high in several Southern states, according to the Century Foundation's analysis.  

In Louisiana and Mississippi, the analysis found, nearly 40% of federal student loan borrowers with payments due are delinquent, the largest shares nationwide. 

Black borrowers are struggling most, the researchers found.

Around 20% of white student loan borrowers were past-due in the third quarter of 2025, compared with more than 48% of Black student loan borrowers and around 30% of Hispanic borrowers. 

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act's overhaul to the student loan system is likely to make it harder for people to afford their payments, consumer advocates say. The law phases out several affordable repayment plans and lengthens terms for others. 

The median U.S. household, with a family of four and an income of $81,000, could see its monthly bill surge to $440 from $36, due to the legislative changes, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit organization that promotes college affordability.

U.S. trading partners offered a cautious welcome to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to strike down large parts of President Donald Trump's flagship trade policy on global tariffs — but global trade bodies warned of lingering uncertainty surrounding import levies.

The law that undergirds the import duties "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs," the majority ruled six to three in the long-awaited Supreme Court decision.

Trump's tariff regime impacted a swathe of countries from the U.K. to India and the European Union. Some governments, like Vietnam and Brazil are still in negotiation.

A U.K. government spokesperson said the country would continue to work with the White House administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the U.K. and the rest of the world

"This is a matter for the U.S. to determine but we will continue to support U.K. businesses as further details are announced," the spokesperson said.

"The U.K. enjoys the lowest reciprocal tariffs globally, and under any scenario we expect our privileged trading position with the U.S. to continue." The U.K. agreed a wide-ranging trade deal with the U.S. in May last year, which imposed a broad 10% levy on many goods, but also included certain carve-outs on steel, aluminium, cars and pharmaceuticals.

The Supreme Court case focused mainly on reciprocal tariffs, and the ruling leaves much of the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. — including preferential sectoral tariffs on steel, pharmaceuticals and autos — unaffected.

However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) trade body said the U.S. Supreme Court decision adds to the ongoing uncertainty around levies.

William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the move "does little to clear the murky waters" for British businesses, warning that the President still has "other options at his disposal" to retain his current regime on steel and aluminium tariffs.  

"The court's decision also raises questions on how U.S. importers can reclaim levies already paid and whether U.K. exporters can also receive a share of any rebate depending on commercial trading terms," Bain said in a statement. "For the U.K., the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible."

Olof Gill, European Commission spokesperson for trade and economic security, said businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on "stability and predictability." 

"We remain in close contact with the U.S. Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling," Gill said. "We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them."

Meanwhile, Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for U.S.-Canadian trade relations, said the decision "reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified."

Elsewhere, Swissmem, Switzerland's technology industry association, welcomed the ruling — but warned that the Trump administration could invoke other laws to "legitimize tariffs," and called on Swiss policymakers to strengthen the competitiveness of the country with new free trade agreements.

"From the perspective of the Swiss export industry, this is a good decision. The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry. However, today's ruling doesn't win anything yet," Swissmem said.

"The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry," Swissmem wrote on X. "The crucial thing now is to quickly secure relations with the U.S. through a binding trade agreement."

The International Chamber of Commerce noted that many businesses will welcome the ruling given the "significant strain" that has been placed on balance sheets in recent months.

"But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of U.S. import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex. Today's ruling is worrying silent on this issue and clear guidance from the Court of International Trade and the relevant U.S. authorities will be essential to minimise avoidable costs and prevent litigation risks," the ICC said.

We're a 10-minute walk from the Palace of Versailles. My wife attends ISIPCA, one of the most prestigious graduate perfumery programs in the world, and I'm an American writer living right outside Paris.

It may sound glamorous, but my daily routine hasn't really changed. Before our move in October, I sat in front of a computer all day. After our move, my life has looked pretty much the same.

I must admit, there was a wide-eyed part of me that thought the lifestyle of an American expat living outside Paris would all but confirm my Great American Novel, but the reality was much more boring.

Although there are major differences in etiquette, architecture, food, and language, as a work-from-home writer, I was surprised to find myself mostly insulated from them.

I arrived here knowing nobody but my wife. Most of the time, I'm alone all day.

Sometimes I FaceTime friends and family back home, but the six-hour time difference forms a barrier. By the time they're getting off work, it's midnight in Versailles.

I can go days without speaking French, unless you count Babbel.

When I do, it's in 60-second batches, ordering a baguette at the nearby boulangerie or picking up a cheap bottle of Beaujolais at the local épicerie for a carb-heavy dinner.

Then, I return to the apartment to write in English for hours on end, which is the same way I spent my time in New York.

Granted, there are reminders even in my apartment that I'm in a different place: The hot water doesn't last long, the kitchen tile is a dark terra-cotta with darker grout, and the labels of the spices and sauces left behind in the kitchen are, naturally, all in French.

When I look out of the window, I see the slate-colored mansard roofs that match the persistent gray of wintry Versailles.

After a while, though, even these charming distinctions recede into the furniture of daily life.

As an expat working remotely, I soon realized I would have to be proactive if I wanted to meet new people.

The halcyon days of friends falling into my lap — as in college or in my early career, when my coworkers functioned as my adoptive New York family — were long gone. No, I would have to take initiative.

I made an effort to tap into the community of expat writers in Paris. I connected with a couple of Paris-based writers online, and then met up with them for coffee.

One of them, a poet and a scholar, told me about an Anglophone writers' salon in Paris. I went to the event, read some of my work, and met fellow English-speaking writers, mostly American and British.

Another invited me to a literary journal launch event in Le Marais. At the launch party, I ran into a few people I'd met at the salon a couple of days earlier, including a friendly English guy who invited me to a reading at his apartment in the 19th arrondissement.

Earlier that week, I didn't know anyone in Paris. Suddenly, I was bumping into people I knew at a party, then getting invited to another one.

Parties always come to an end. Daily routine reasserts itself. My wife leaves first thing and doesn't return until dark.

During the day, all I hear is the clacking of the keys and the groaning of the floorboards whenever I walk to the kitchen for another cup of coffee. I welcome chores and errands, which break up the lonely monotony.

When my wife comes home and asks me how my day was, I don't know how to respond. "Same," I think. "Always the same."

That's not entirely true, though. Some days are punctuated by heartwarming messages or small wins, like a friend reaching out or an editor accepting one of my stories.

The bulk of my daily activities, however, remains unchanged. Admittedly, this malaise may be more a function of remote work than being alone in a strange place; I felt a similar isolation working remotely in New York, after all.

It took my wife and me years to start to find a sense of community in our neighborhood. That didn't just happen. We had to work for it. Around the time we were figuring that out, my wife got her acceptance letter.

I suppose the repetitiveness of daily life is hardly unique, but I was surprised to find how similar it was here. Routine notwithstanding, I'm lucky. I live in a beautiful place, and I get to do the thing I love, as does my wife.

Living in Versailles has put into focus something that was starting to come into view back in the US: The life you want doesn't come knocking on your door, regardless of where you are. You have to go out and find it.

Congressional Democrats rejoiced on Friday and Republicans remained divided in the wake of a momentous Supreme Court decision striking down a large portion of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.

"Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement following the decision. "We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed."

The ruling is a major hit to Trump, who used a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to slap a barrage of tariffs on American trading partners. Tariffs and the economy more broadly will be a key messaging issue for Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections. Primaries start next month leading up to the November general election.

The Supreme Court decision sets up additional potential showdowns in Congress over how to handle Trump's trade war after the U.S. House voted last week to overturn tariffs on Canada.

For Republicans, Trump's tariffs, which have proven largely unpopular in a pivotal election year, are a more complicated issue.

"SCOTUS's outrageous ruling handcuffs our fight against unfair trade that has devastated American workers for decades. These tariffs protected jobs, revived manufacturing, and forced cheaters like China to pay up," Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, posted to X. 

"This betrayal must be reversed and Republicans must get to work immediately on a reconciliation bill to codify the tariffs that had made our country the hottest country on earth!" Moreno continued.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has voted with Democrats in opposition to Trump's tariffs, celebrated the decision. He and other opponents of the trade policy have argued that it is Congress, not the president, that has the constitutional authority to enact taxes and tariffs.

"In defense of our Republic, the Supreme Court struck down using emergency powers to enact taxes," Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., posted on X. "This ruling will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism."

The court ruled a little over a week after a small group of House Republicans joined most of their Democratic colleagues to overturn Trump's 35% tariff of Canada, though the resolution was largely symbolic since it would requires approval from the Senate and the White House to take effect.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., one of the six Republicans who voted to overturn the tariffs, called the decision "a common-sense and straightforward ruling by the Supreme Court. 

"The Constitution's checks and balances still work. Article One gives tariff authority to Congress," Bacon wrote on X. "In the future, Congress should defend its own authorities and not rely on the Supreme Court."

Some Democrats suggested Trump would look for other mechanism to impose tariffs, while some Republicans said that he should do so."Good news today. The Supreme Court has struck down many of Trump's tariffs. Sadly, this President is absolutely dedicated to making you pay these taxes. He's going to try other ways to keep them in place," Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said in a post to X. "I will continue voting to block Trump's reckless tariffs in the Senate."

In the House, Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., touted his legislation, dubbed the RELIEF Act, that would trigger tariff refunds to small businesses.

"These taxes stole money from working families and small businesses who were forced to pay them from the very beginning. Now, it's time to start repairing the economic damage these Trump taxes have caused," Horsford posted to X.

The legislation is symbolic because its success would require significant Republican buy-in in the GOP-controlled House and Senate. And many allies of Trump suggested the SCOTUS decision would not be the end of the president's tariff agenda.

The U.S. government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers after the Supreme Court ruled Friday in a 6-3 decision that tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal, a new estimate says.

The potential refunds to a broad range of companies would be for tariffs already collected by the government since Trump slapped on the duties without authorization from Congress.

The $175 billion refund estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model was produced at the request of the Reuters news wire service. The model is a nonpartisan fiscal research group at the University of Pennsylvania.

Multiple importers already have pending lawsuits seeking refunds of their tariffs, citing lower-court rulings that found Trump's tariffs are not legal. 

The Supreme Court ruling on Friday did not say that the federal government could keep the money it has already collected from those tariffs but didn't explicitly address refunds.

The president had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs. He was the first president to ever use IEEPA for that purpose.

Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three conservative members of the high court to dissent from Friday's ruling, warned about the potential logistical difficulty of having to refund tariffs already collected.

"In the meantime, however, the interim effects of the Court's decision could be substantial," Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent.

"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others," he wrote.

"As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process is likely to be a 'mess,'" Kavanaugh wrote.

"In addition, according to the Government, the IEEPA tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars — including with foreign nations from China to the United Kingdom to Japan, and more," he wrote.

"The Court's decision could generate uncertainty regarding those trade arrangements." 

Brian LeBlanc, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group, in a LinkedIn post Friday said "we estimate" that the IEEPA-related tariffs that have been ruled illegal constitute "roughly 60% of the tariffs issued to date."That's a big deal. Until President Trump replaces those tariffs with alternative authorities, the tariff rate just dropped from around 9.5% to around 5%," LeBlanc wrote. "Refunds are going to be tricky, and we expect the Trump administration to replace most (but not all) of this lost tariff revenue."

U.S. Customs and Border Protection in December said the amount of tariffs collected that would be at risk of having to be refunded was $133.5 billion. 

That tally would have risen since then because of the ongoing collection of duties.

U.S. importers will be facing many hurdles trying to recover billions in tariff costs now that the Supreme Court has ruled President Donald Trump's International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, tariffs are illegal.

Companies large and small may be eligible for refund payments that in total could reach hundreds of billions of dollars, but trade attorneys have warned that tariff refunds could be denied or delayed, depending on how U.S. courts rule and how the legal system and U.S. Customs and Border Protection go about issuing any eligible payments.

Record tariff revenue has been recorded by the U.S. government, with tariff collections surging in January to $30 billion and reaching a year-to-date total of $124 billion. That is up 304% from the same period in 2025.

The Supreme Court decision could mean as much as $175 billion sought in refunds, according to estimates, but the ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded.

In his dissent from the majority Supreme Court decision on Friday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote: "the Court's decision is not likely to greatly restrict Presidential tariff authority going forward. But the Court's decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term. One issue will be refunds. Refunds of billions of dollars would have significant consequences for the U. S. Treasury. The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument."

Trump wrote in a social media post back on Jan. 12 that "it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay." He added, "It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay."

At a White House press conference on Friday afternoon, Trump raged against the Supreme Court decision and said of paying the refunds, "I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years. ... We'll end up being in court for the next five years." 

Trump also said he would sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, "over and above our normal tariffs already being charged. And we're also initiating several section 301, and other investigations to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies," Trump added, referring to another section of the 1974 act.

Lori Mullins, director of operations at Rogers & Brown Custom Brokers, says her initial view of the Supreme Court decision is that it does not grant or guarantee refunds. "They have remanded this back down to the lower courts to decide if refunds will be issued. Without knowing for certain, many believe that the refunds will not be issued retrospectively," she said. For importers hoping for refunds, "the answer is yes, we have a ruling but we do not have a ruling on if any refunds will be granted. That will be handled by a lower court at a future date/ time," she said.

"Keep in mind also that several countries have also already signed written agreements with specific tariff rates such as the signed agreement with the UK for a flat 15% tariff. This does not impact those already signed agreements so we are not sure, right now, how those country specific agreements will be impacted if at all," Mullins added.

In the lead-up to the decision, importers and customs experts have been pushing back on claims about refunds being a "messy" process, saying that because the tariffs being paid are itemized, the process for refunding the money should be straightforward.

The Court of International Trade is typically in charge of refund processes. Trade attorneys do expect the case to be sent back to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which would presumably then remand the case to the CIT to decide on how to handle refunds.

Timothy Keeler, partner and co-head of international trade practice at Mayer Brown and former chief of staff for U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, believes refunds will ultimately be due to companies. "There will be refunds," he said. "It's just not clear what the process will be to get refunds. It's not clear if companies will have to file in court and become a plaintiff to get refunds, or whether it'll end up being an administrative process," handled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, he said.

For starters, the Court of International Trade and litigants who file cases against the tariffs, in coordination with the U.S. government, would need some time to figure out how to manage any refund process. The Department of Justice and the litigants in the tariff cases previously asked the CIT to appoint a steering committee to manage the more than 1,000 refund-related cases filed to date. It's common for a steering committee to be established to manage the tariff repaying process.

Even if courts ultimately rule refunds are required, importers betting on a cash infusion from tariff refunds should be aware there's no set timeline and any rush for refunds could overwhelm the system and likely lead to long delays. 

Joyce Adetutu, international trade lawyer at Vinson & Elkins, said her firm is telling clients it is going to be difficult to issue a broad-scale refund with the "push of a button."

"I don't think that is going to be the scenario here," Adetutu said. "I think what's more likely is that the CIT and the government, Customs, are going to work together to try to allow those who have preserved their claim for a refund to seek that refund ... and those who don't protest will forfeit any refund," she added.

"We believe it may take months, if not years, to be decided by the CIT," said Greg Tompsett, vice president of customs brokerage USA at logistics company Kuehne + Nagel. "The extended period of time may also result in additional subsequent lawsuits, which may drive that back to the Supreme Court. So the good news is we do have some finality on the decision. The bad news is there is no immediate action to be taken by any importer to request refunds or to go back after that money," he said.

Companies will not only be seeking billions in tariff refunds, but billions that are tied up in customs bonds and collateral. Tariffs not only lead to additional import taxes, but by inflating the cost of the products, result in the need for importers to increase the value of customs bonds the government requires them to hold. 

International trade experts told CNBC that with some tariffs increasing from 10%-25% or more for certain products, importers are facing customs bond amounts that now range from the minimum bond amount by regulation of $50,000 to as high as $450 million. The increase in bond values have left some companies forced to put up additional money in the form of collateral to ensure they could pay the tariffs. 

The rise in tariffs and related need for bonds and collateral has led to a historic number of "bond insufficiencies." CBP told CNBC it identified more than 24,000 customs bond "insufficiencies" valued at nearly $3.6 billion. That's double the 2019 level when insufficiencies first soared due to Trump's first-term tariffs under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.

Importers have told CNBC because tariffs are itemized, as are their customs bonds and collateral documentation, in theory they should be able to receive their refunds quickly. However, trade attorneys also say it may be difficult for companies to get any refunds on bond overpayment or collateral quickly because the insurers will want to make sure they are not exposed to any tariff payments.

Vincent Moy, international surety leader for Marsh Risk, recently told CNBC that companies should expect some lag time in receiving these customs bond funds due to insurance paperwork requirements. The insurance company will need to verify and audit the paper trail before it releases any collateral.

Some sureties have collateral return review procedures that can take 30 to 60 days for them to go back to underwriting to review. Many small and medium-sized businesses were expected to be reaching out to their insurers ahead of the Supreme Court decision to get the process of review started. "If you are hoping that the collateral will just be returned in due course, the squeaky wheel may make this happen a little bit faster," Jennifer Diaz, board-certified international attorney at Diaz Trade Law, recently told CNBC.

Democrats on Capitol Hill weren't waiting to press for action from the administration after the court loss. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asking for details on administration plans to refund businesses that paid the illegal tariffs.

"Many American businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses, have struggled to pay these illegal tariffs and, for some, the financial strain has placed them on the brink of bankruptcy," wrote Cantwell. "It is essential Treasury implement an expeditious and transparent process to remediate the financial harm that resulted from these illegal tariffs."

The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority.

The 6-3 decision centered on the tariffs Trump justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.

Those IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. They include Trump's so-called "Liberation Day" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.

In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Trump administration's use of the law to impose taxes on imports, which is normally the purview of Congress, went too far. Trump would need a distinct law from Congress "to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs," he wrote.

"What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms," he wrote. "When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits."

The majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the "major questions doctrine" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance.

The Supreme Court's decision comes as the United States trade deficit ticked down over the last year, largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. It shrank to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest figure since 2009, before ticking back up in the last two months of the year, Commerce Department data published Thursday showed.

Trump on Friday called the ruling "deeply disappointing." At a White House press conference, he said "foreign companies that have been ripping us off for years" were "ecstatic" about the rulings. He blasted the justices who ruled against him as "fools" and "lapdogs" for opposing political interests. 

Two groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. The Supreme Court combined the cases and put them on the fast track, holding oral arguments at the beginning of its November term.

IEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to "regulate" importation in times of emergency. The Trump administration claimed that it included the ability to impose tariffs — a position no other president has taken.

Lawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president.

During oral arguments, most justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, said taxes were "part of the spark of the American Revolution" and should get careful treatment.

"The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different," Gorsuch said. "And it's been different since the founding."

Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs.

"Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies," he wrote. "The plaintiffs and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or even total embargoes on all imports from a given country. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty."

The Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion.

But his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.

The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a huge chunk of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, delivering a major rebuke of the president's key economic policy.

The law that undergirds those import duties "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs," the majority ruled 6-3 in the long-awaited decision.

The ruling is a massive loss for Trump, who has made tariffs — and his asserted power to impose them on any country at any time, without congressional input — a central feature of his second presidential term.

Trump's legal stance "would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy," the majority concluded. And they highlighted that Trump imposed the tariffs without Congress, which has the power to tax under the Constitution.

Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the opinion of the court. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.

The decision noted that before Trump, no president had ever used the statute in question "to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope."

To justify the "extraordinary" tariff powers, Trump must "point to clear congressional authorization," the court wrote. "He cannot."

The ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded. That sum could total $175 billion, according to a new estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model.

Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent that the refund process "is likely to be a 'mess,'" after predicting that the short-term impact of the court's tariff ruling "could be substantial."

Since retaking the White House, Trump has rapidly reshaped America's long-standing trade relationships by imposing a staggering array of import duties that have touched nearly every country on earth.

Many of those tariffs were invoked using a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. They include Trump's near-global "reciprocal" tariffs, and separate duties related to the alleged trafficking of deadly drugs into the U.S.

The IEEPA does not explicitly mention tariffs, as the Supreme Court noted Friday. Instead, it allows the president to "regulate … importation" of foreign property transactions after declaring a national emergency in order to deal with certain "unusual and extraordinary" threats.

The Trump administration has argued that language empowers the president to impose tariffs on foreign goods.

Critics charged that the law does not permit the president to unilaterally impose levies of any size on any country at any time. A federal trade court and a federal appeals court both found Trump's IEEPA tariffs illegal before the Supreme Court took up the case.

The majority of U.S. tariff revenue generated last year came from the IEEPA duties.

Reaction to the ruling quickly poured in, with the loudest voices cheering the demise of the chaotic policy that has been blamed for raising prices and straining long-standing global alliances.

"This ruling is a victory for every American family paying higher prices because of Trump's tariff taxes," Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the House Budget Committee's top-ranking Democrat, said in a statement. "The Supreme Court rejected Trump's attempt to impose what amounted to a national sales tax on hardworking Americans."

House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Richard Neal, D-Mass., in a statement called the decision "a victory for the American people, the rule of law, and our standing in the global economy."

Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a U.S. sneaker industry group, said Friday's ruling "marks an important step toward creating a more predictable and competitive environment for American businesses and consumers."

"This ruling provides relief at a time when cost pressures have been significant," Matt Priest, president and CEO of the footwear group, said in a statement.

The Distilled Spirits Council, an advocacy group for U.S. liquor makers, responded to the ruling by urging the Trump administration to "secure a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs" with top trade partners.

Doing so "would provide much needed certainty for American spirits exporters while helping ease financial pressures on bars, restaurants and retailers at a time when affordability remains a major concern for consumers," said the council's president and CEO, Chris Swonger, in a statement.

Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for trade with the U.S., said in a post on X that the decision "reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified."

Trump last April unveiled his sweeping reciprocal tariff plans at a much-ballyhooed White House event marking what he had dubbed America's "liberation day."

That announcement stoked a sudden market panic, and the tariffs were quickly put on pause. They have since been repeatedly tweaked, delayed and reimposed, adding confusion and further complexity to the administration's tangled web of trade policies.

Other IEEPA-based tariffs include a set aimed at Mexico, Canada and China related to allegations that those countries have allowed the deadly drug fentanyl to flow into the U.S.

Trump, a fierce critic of America's recent history of making free trade deals, has repeatedly praised tariffs as both a bountiful source of federal revenue and a key tool in negotiations with foreign partners and adversaries alike.

He has claimed foreign countries bear the cost of his tariffs, and he has downplayed concerns that the taxes lead to higher prices for Americans. His administration, however, has admitted that the duties are paid by U.S. importers.

Trump has claimed the tariff revenue has been so large that the duties may be able to replace the income tax. He has also floated the idea of sending Americans $2,000 tariff dividend checks.

"We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs," he wrote in a recent Truth Social post.

Other estimates are significantly lower: The Bipartisan Policy Center, for instance, tallied U.S. gross tariff revenue in 2025 at about $289 billion. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it had collected roughly $200 billion between Jan. 20 and Dec. 15.

For the IEEPA-specific tariffs, the administration said it has collected about $129 billion in revenue as of Dec. 10.

Ahead of the ruling, Trump and his administration talked up the consequences of the high court striking down the tariffs.

"If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED!" Trump wrote on Jan. 12.

U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have stated they believed the Supreme Court would not undo the president's "signature" economic policy.

Forty minutes before the federal government revealed that economic growth slowed sharply in the last quarter, President Donald Trump dropped a hint that the incoming data would be weaker.

"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post at 7:50 a.m. ET.

At 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025. That's a decline of 3 percentage points from the previous three-month period. 

Trump's Friday morning post referred to last year's record-length government shutdown, which began Oct. 1 — the start of the fourth quarter — and lasted 43 days.

The federal funding lapse was expected to take a toll on GDP. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that, depending on its length, the shutdown would shrink annualized real GDP growth in Q4 by up to 2 percentage points.

But economists from Dow Jones were still estimating a 2.5% gain for the period.

Trump has previously revealed economic data before its official release, raising questions about possible policy violations and concerns that traders may be getting a heads-up from the president, who can be briefed on the data before it comes out. 

The Office of Management and Budget not only prohibits executive branch officials from commenting early on such releases, but forbids public statements about them until 30 minutes after they have come out.

A White House official defended Trump's post, telling CNBC on condition of anonymity that the president has consistently pointed out how the shutdown has been a drag on the economy, including by sharing GDP percentage figures "consistent with his 2% Truth this morning."

In a Truth Social post in January, Trump indirectly revealed forthcoming nonfarm payrolls data.

The White House at the time admitted that there was an "inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data" while attacking the media for "grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy."

During his first presidential term, Trump signaled optimism about a blowout jobs report shortly before its release.

Trump's post Friday morning also reiterated his long-running criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates as sharply or quickly as the president wants.

"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!" Trump wrote.

He has previously branded Powell with the derisive nickname "Too Late"; it was unclear if the president meant to misspell the nickname in Friday's post.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's social media post.

Happy Friday. I've spent the last 24 hours going back and forth on whether I need to hop on the "dad shoe" trend.

Stock futures are little changed this morning. The major indexes are coming off a down day.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Wall Street returned to its hunt for artificial intelligence losers yesterday, once again zeroing in on software names. The three major averages all closed Thursday's session in the red.

Here's what to know:

Economic data nerds, rejoice: We're getting December's personal consumption expenditures price index report, also known as the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge, at 8:30 a.m. ET. Gross domestic product, consumer spending and income data are also on the docket for this morning.

These reports follow yesterday's data on the U.S. trade deficit, which came in at $901.5 billion for the full 2025 year. As CNBC's Jeff Cox notes, that's a 0.2% decrease from the prior year, despite Trump's broad and steep tariffs.

Speaking of tariffs: There's a chance the Supreme Court will rule on the legality of many of Trump's levies this morning. Regardless of when the ruling comes and which way it sides, the court's decision could have big implications for consumers and companies.

There's a new king of the retail jungle by one measure. Amazon dethroned Walmart in annual revenue for the first time ever.

Walmart said yesterday that it saw $713.2 billion in revenue for its latest fiscal year, below the $716.9 billion figure that Amazon reported. About a year ago, Amazon beat Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time.

Meanwhile, Bath & Body Works announced this morning that it launched an authorized storefront on Amazon. It's the home goods retailer's latest push to hawk products outside of its namesake storefronts.

In California, skyrocketing rents and a housing shortage are pushing an increasing number of people to live in RVs. As CNBC's Kate Rogers and Jeff Kopp report, that's created a shadow rental market led by what some are calling the "vanlords."

It's a particularly acute problem in Silicon Valley's Santa Clara County, despite being home to Apple and Google, as well as some of the costliest zip codes in the country. Government data for the county shows the share of individuals sleeping in cars has jumped from 18% in 2019 to 37% last year.

Advocates say RVs are a popular option because they provide more autonomy than a shelter or streets. But there's a network of people looking to cash in on others' misfortunes by renting out aging RVs to those searching for housing without a lease or tenant protections.

Remember when job hopping was the key to big wage gains? That's increasingly in the rearview mirror, data shows.

The gap between pay increases for workers staying and leaving jobs fell below 2 percentage points last month, according to the ADP. That's down from a peak of 8.4 points in April 2022, when the "great resignation" was economists' hot term.

To be sure, the pay outlook varies by industry. There's still notable compensatory incentives for employees in sectors like construction or natural resources to switch jobs, while you're better off staying for pay bumps in hospitality and leisure. 

Here are some articles we'd recommend making time for over the weekend:

— CNBC's Sean Conlon, Hugh Leask, Spencer Kimball, Liz Napolitano, Jeff Cox, Greg Iacurci, Annie Palmer, Courtney Reagan, Kate Rogers and Jeff Kopp contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

Correction: Walmart said yesterday that it saw $713.2 billion in revenue for its latest fiscal year, below the $716.9 billion figure that Amazon reported. About a year ago, Amazon beat Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time. An earlier version misstated the figures and the ranking of the companies' revenue numbers.

It's been nearly one month since tax season opened, and many filers expect bigger refunds due to changes enacted via President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill." 

But it's still too early to tell how much bigger refunds could be amid limited IRS filing data.

"In some cases, estimates are that over 20% will be returned to the Taxpayer," he wrote.

In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump said tax refunds are "substantially greater than ever before." 

It's unclear which estimates Trump was referencing. The White House did not respond to CNBC's request for clarification. 

Typically, filers see a refund when they overpay taxes throughout the year via paycheck withholdings or estimated payments. Filers generally have a balance due when they don't pay enough.

Early on Feb. 13, Treasury Secretary and acting IRS Commissioner Scott Bessent told CNBC's "Squawk Box" the average tax refund was 22% higher so far this season. It wasn't clear how many days of returns Bessent's figure included or what comparison period he used.

IRS filing season statistics released later on Feb. 13 showed the average refund was $2,290 as of Feb. 6, up about 11% from one year prior. The Treasury has not responded to CNBC's requests for comment about the discrepancy. 

However, "we're still very early in tax filing season," Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank, told CNBC.

The filing season opened Jan. 26, and the first batch of IRS data included returns through Feb. 6. Typically, the average refund size "pops" in late February once payments include the earned income tax credit or additional child tax credit, Lautz said.   

Currently, "it's way too early to tell if any data points are durable trends," he said. 

As the IRS shares more filing data, the average refund compared with 2025 could increase, according to a Feb. 18 note from Bank of America Securities.

The company expects Trump's tax law changes could create "about $1,000 of stimulus per household, on average," during the 2026 tax filing season. About half of that change could come from the higher cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, and the "no tax on overtime" deduction, analysts wrote.  

This refund estimate aligns with October research from investment bank Piper Sandler, which projected that Trump's "retroactive tax cuts could average about $1,000 per return, though it will be substantially more for some filers."

In 2025, the average tax refund through Oct. 17 was $3,052, according to IRS data. 

However, individual refunds could vary significantly this season, depending on 2025 withholdings and which of Trump's new provisions impact that taxpayer's situation.

Bath & Body Works Champagne Toast bodywash, with no minimum shipping threshold, is now just a click away for Amazon Prime members.

The mall-favorite brand is making some of its best-selling fragrances, bodywashes, hand soaps and candles available for Amazon's U.S. shoppers. The selection is also eligible for Prime shipping. 

Amazon is the No. 1 online destination for U.S. beauty shoppers, accounting for 47% of the online beauty and personal care market in the U.S. in 2024, according to Euromonitor. Sephora is second with 9% share. Euromonitor estimates 39% of all beauty and personal care sales take place online. 

"Launching our first authorized brand storefront on Amazon allows us to put ourselves directly in the path of the consumer," Bath & Body Works CEO Daniel Heaf told CNBC. "It's about meeting them where they already shop."

The Amazon launch marks the latest effort by Columbus, Ohio-based Bath & Body Works to expand its access points for customers. Last year, it began selling its products in college campus stores — with a footprint of now more than 1,000 locations — in the company's first points of sale outside its roughly 2,600 owned and franchised stores and its own website.

Heaf joined Bath & Body Works in May after his role as Nike's chief transformation and strategy officer was eliminated by CEO Elliott Hill. 

Heaf recently laid out his "plan to return [Bath & Body Works] to profitable, sustainable growth." He calls it a "consumer-first formula" with four pillars: creating disruptive and innovative products; reigniting the brand; winning in the marketplace; and operating with speed and efficiency.

The Amazon partnership, Heaf said, "is the first of many milestones that we'll be delivering this fiscal year against that strategy."

Before the official storefront launch, Bath & Body Works products were sold on Amazon through third-party resellers. 

Now, Heaf says, the company is attempting to reclaim the brand story on Amazon — and those marketplace sales.

While Amazon has many first-party relationships with brands from Nike to Calvin Klein that use wholesale partnerships as part of their business models, there are few examples of retailers selling on the site that design, manufacture and sell their products entirely on their own. 

For those so-called vertically integrated brands, like Bath & Body Works, Amazon is increasingly filling the role of skilled logistics partner rather than retailer. 

Gap, J.Crew and Everlane are similarly vertically integrated and have small selections of branded products for sale on Amazon. 

Gap began selling what it calls "core basics for the whole family" in 2022 through a wholesale relationship, where Amazon owns and sells the products, which are Prime eligible. Gap has said its goal is to reach new or lapsed customers as well as provide existing shoppers the convenience for "core essentials." 

Under Bath & Body Works' new agreement with Amazon, the brand will retain ownership of the inventory and control pricing, but will use Amazon's fulfillment partners network for Prime eligibility. 

Everlane declined to comment on its Amazon partnership. J.Crew did not respond to request for comment.

Jewelry company Kendra Scott has an authorized storefront on Amazon after initially opposing the partnership — even though it had wholesale relationships with other retailers, including Macy's and Nordstrom. But over time, the brand began to view Amazon as another opportunity to reach shoppers rather than a competitive threat, according to a person familiar with the company's decision-making, who spoke about internal matters on the condition of anonymity.

On its own website, Bath & Body Works is making it easier for shoppers to place their orders. The company lowered its free shipping threshold to $50 from $100 last month. 

Still, Heaf admits, "We know that we will never compete with Amazon in terms of their Prime Network. No one is going to be offering next-day shipping. That's just not what we're in the business of. And so I think that by going on Amazon, we are also making our own site more competitive but recognizing that our job is not to build a fulfillment network that can operate at the speed of Amazon."

Big Tech and watch fans could own the crossover piece of their dreams.

Two custom timepieces made by Swiss watch brand Tudor for employee watch collector clubs at Apple and Google are up on the market.

Silicon Valley is a place where flashy watches can be spotted on the wrists of leaders like Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison. The love of watches has bred collectors' groups within some of the biggest companies.

A watch made for an employee group at Apple is up for bidding on watch auction house Loupe This, through February 25. The current bid as of Thursday afternoon stood at $13,500.

The style is part of Tudor's Black Bay collection. Similar pre-owned models typically resell for around $3,000.

The limited Apple collectors group edition features a skull-and-crossbones pirate flag motif with deep ties to Apple's history.

It's a callback to the Steve Jobs era. The late CEO once said in a meeting, "It's better to be a pirate than join the Navy," and the members of the Macintosh team often referred to themselves as pirates, as a former employee described in a blog post. In a nod to those roots, the company flew a pirate flag over Apple's headquarters for its 40th anniversary.

About 82 of these "pirate" watches were produced around 2021, according to the Loupe This listing.

A Tudor watch created in collaboration with Google's watch collector group, Watches@, is also for sale on the vintage watch marketplace Wind Vintage.

It's from Tudor's Pelagos collection and features a Google-centric twist that tech fans may recognize: the Google Chrome Dino at the 6 o'clock position on the dial. The design is inspired by the Chrome Dino that pops up when your computer isn't connected to the internet. It's also the character in a game you can play on Google Chrome.

The watch, created in 2024, is listed for $14,900. A similar model sold at an auction on Loupe This last week for $10,451.

Other Pelagos models are reselling for around $4,000 on pre-owned watch marketplaces.

Apple, Google, and Tudor did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Loupe This cofounder Eric Ku said these sorts of collaborations come together through groups reaching out to companies like Tudor for customized watches with their logo and other changes, like an engraving.

They tend to sell for more than base models because of their limited quantities, Ku said, and they attract "real fans" of the brands they represent.

"For tech nerds like myself, the pirate flag is a symbol that has a long tradition of being used by the Apple folks," Ku said. "Also, the imagery of that pirate flag is quite charming."

Blue Owl Capital, a leading investor in the data center boom, was unable to arrange financing for a $4 billion data center it is co-developing in Pennsylvania after pitching lenders to help bankroll the project in recent months.

The facility, 80 miles west of Philadelphia in the city of Lancaster, will be occupied by CoreWeave, a provider of artificial intelligence cloud computing services that has become a closely watched name in the AI race for its rapid expansion — and the billions of dollars of high-interest-rate debt it has taken on to fuel that growth.

An executive who arranges debt for major data center deals told Business Insider that the lack of interest in the Lancaster project was due to growing caution among lenders and investors about taking on sizable exposures to AI players with less-than-sterling credit.

CoreWeave has a below-investment-grade rating of B+, according to S&P Global Ratings.

"We saw it. We passed," a senior executive at a large specialty lender told Business Insider.

A spokesman for Blue Owl said that the company had "considered" third-party financing for the Lancaster project "as we would with any transaction as we explore alternatives before choosing the most attractive path forward."

The spokesman added that the project, which he said is already under construction, "is fully funded, on time, and on budget."

It is unclear whether Blue Owl has been funding construction entirely from its own capital. If Blue Owl is unable to raise debt for the Lancaster development, it could be on the hook for a potentially huge outlay of cash to pay for the data center's construction.

The situation shows the complications and risks involved in financing the massive buildout of infrastructure for AI computing.

Brennan Hawken, an equity analyst at BMO Capital Markets who covers Blue Owl, said that difficulties to raise debt for the Lancaster project would raise concern.

"I'm not familiar with this deal, but if there is a struggle to find the debt financing, that's a bit of a red flag that I would want to drill into," Hawken said.

Business Insider previously reported that major banks had recent difficulty selling off pieces of $38 billion of debt to finance the construction of two data center campuses that will be anchored by Oracle. Banks often sell pieces of such large commitments to other lenders to spread risk and also reap a quick profit.

The slowdown in interest in participating in that financing was due to worries about Oracle's enormous AI spending and whether the tech company's credit rating could be impacted by those outlays. Oracle has since sought to calm the lending market, announcing that it would raise up to $50 billion of cash from stock and bond offerings in order to "maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet."

Last summer, CoreWeave announced it would lease 100 megawatts of initial capacity at the Lancaster data center and potentially expand its commitment to 300 megawatts. The company said it would pour up to $6 billion into the project to equip it with chips and other cloud infrastructure.

A month later, in August, Chirisa Technology Parks announced it would partner with Blue Owl and Machine Investment Group to develop the project. The partnership said it would provide $4 billion of funding, an amount separate from CoreWeave's investment, to support the construction of the project's data center facilities.

In the fall, Blue Owl began shopping the development to potential lenders, a person familiar with that effort said.

Blue Owl has been one of the most creative financial architects of the data center building boom. Last year, it structured a deal to partner with Meta in the ownership of a large data center campus that Meta will build and operate in Louisiana. Blue Owl utilized Meta's strong credit to raise $27.3 billion of investment-grade corporate bonds against its share of the project's equity, proceeds that will be used to help pay for construction, according to S&P.

Blue Owl could arrange a similar type of vehicle that could attempt to tap the credit of an investment-grade customer of CoreWeave's who might use the Lancaster facility or Nvidia, the chipmaker that has purchased large stakes in CoreWeave. It could also potentially raise cash for construction debt by tapping large institutional investor clients to pool together a loan, Hawken said.Blue Owl is facing questions after reports emerged that it had permanently halted withdrawals on one of its retail private credit funds.

Much of the development of hyperscale data center campuses has sought to utilize the strong credit ratings and deep pockets of big-tech partners.

Fluidstack, a peer of CoreWeave's, announced a deal last year to lease a 168-megawatt data center in Colorado City, Texas, which will be built by the crypto mining firm Cipher. Google, Fluidstack's tenant for the project, said it would guarantee about half of the $3 billion due under the 10-year lease. Fluidstack signed another similar-sized lease in December with the data center builder TeraWulf that will also provide "investment-grade credit support."

Social media's most influential tech reviewer said Tesla keeps leaving him on read.

Marques Brownlee — better known as MKBHD to his 20.8 million YouTube subscribers — said he had to take a trip to a nearby car dealership to source his own Tesla Model Y Performance for a January review.

"Tesla stopped talking to me," Brownlee said in a recent TikTok, filmed as he picked up the SUV from New Jersey EV dealer George Saliba. "It's not cause I gave them a negative review."

Tesla stopped talking to @Marques Brownlee, so he's borrowing one of ours to review #cardealership #carreview #tesla

Automakers typically offer loan cars to influencers and journalists for weeklong test drives, and Tesla has supplied Brownlee with its vehicles in the past.

In 2022, he called the Model S Plaid the "best overall car of the last decade," after a review.

The TikTok clip is the latest sign that the relationship has cooled.

In 2023, Brownlee spoke out after the Cybertruck's delivery event. The pickup, which Musk initially said would have a 500-mile range and a starting price under $40,000, launched with just over 300 miles of range and a $70,000 sticker.

Brownlee said Tesla's reveal was "straight up not delivering" on its promises.

He still took delivery of the new car, but sold the Cybertruck after eight months and replaced it with the Rivian R1T, a rival electric pickup.

And in September 20205, Brownlee publicly canceled his $50,000 deposit for two long-awaited Tesla Roadsters.

"Tesla has been sitting with my 50 grand for eight years and hasn't done anything with it, obviously," he said on his "Waveform Podcast."

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Despite the apparent chill in the relationship, Brownlee's latest Tesla review was largely rosy.

After spending time with the refreshed Model Y Performance — a dual-motor SUV with about 460 horsepower and a starting price of about $59,130 — Brownlee said Tesla still leads in several key areas.

"The thing about testing one and actually driving a Tesla for a while, you start to remember all of the ways that Tesla is still ahead of the competition," he said in the video.

He praised the center display as the automotive "gold standard," highlighted improvements to the ride and rear design, and said Tesla's regenerative braking remains best in class.

His review wasn't completely glowing.

Brownlee said he wants more physical controls and argued that the trim doesn't meaningfully sharpen the steering or overall driving feel in sport mode.

He also said Tesla's lead isn't as commanding as it once was, pointing to rising competition from Lucid, Rivian, and General Motors.

It's not the first time Brownlee has turned to Saliba's lot when a carmaker didn't provide a vehicle.

In 2024, he picked up a Fisker Ocean from the same dealership and called it the "worst car I've ever reviewed," setting up a PR firestorm for Fisker.

The automaker pushed back on the review, saying he had driven the car just before an expansive software update.

Fisker filed for bankruptcy three months later.

An esteemed American economist isn't feeling good about where things are headed.

Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and Columbia economist, said he believes the US economy would continue to weaken when speaking to CNBC about his macro outlook on Thursday. That's largely due to a handful of issues he sees hanging over the US, he said, pointing to tariffs, a decline in jobs, and interest rates in particular.

"Not great right now, and the prospects are that we're just going to get worse," Stiglitz said of his economic outlook.

His downbeat sentiment regardi g the US economy doesn't square with recent growth figures. GDP grew at a robust 4.4% in the third quarter, and is expected to have expanded by 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to the latest estimates from the Atlanta Fed.

But there are a few under-the-surface details that suggest the economy isn't on a good path, Stiglitz suggested. Here's what explains his pessimistic view about where the US is headed:

President Donald Trump's tariffs are hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court, but should they stick around, the import taxes are expected by many economists to raise prices for consumers.

Moreover, the inflationary impact of tariffs is regressive, meaning they're expected to impact lower-income consumers the most, Stiglitz said.

An analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale University found that, over the short run, tariffs are expected to hit the bottom 10% of US households the hardest, reducing disposable income by an estimated 3.5 percentage points.

"If you look at who is paying these tariffs, it is the lower-end people in terms of percentage of their incomes," Stiglitz said. "It's regressive and it's distortive."

President Trump has said that tariffs would help jump-start a revival in America's manufacturing sector, but a recovery isn't yet visible in broad-strokes employment data, Stiglitz said.

Manufacturing, one of the US's largest industries, is estimated to make up around 10% of GDP.

Employment in the manufacturing sector has declined for more than two years straight, according to data from the Labor Department.

"The decline in blue-collar jobs is even larger," Stiglitz said. "The point is there's a mismatch between what they say — they've done these policies, these are the results."

Stiglitz also pointed to the push from the Trump administration to lower interest rates.

In particular, he pointed to recent comments from Kevin Warsh, Trump's Fed Chair nominee, who said that AI could unlock a productivity boom in the US. In that scenario, the economy could grow without stoking inflation, meaning the US could have room to lower interest rates more than markets expect.

Stiglitz said he was "most disturbed" by Warsh's comments.

Among investors, the fear is that the central bank could lower rates prematurely, which could lead to hotter inflation down the line.

Additionally, if the Fed were to be seen as caving to political pressure to cut rates, that could undermine the Fed's credibility, which could also unanchor inflation expectations.

"I don't think there's any significant body of thought that thinks that AI productivity increases are going to percolate into the macro economy fast enough to justify any significant or with any impact on rate increases. And the fact that he said that, to me, was very worrisome," Stiglitz said.

TikTok superstar Khaby Lame's $975 million deal is getting squeezed.

Hong Kong-based Rich Sparkle Holdings last month unveiled plans to merge with Lame's social media and e-commerce business.

The deal made Lame's payout dependent on Rich Sparkle's share price, which has plunged to $11.19 as of market close on Thursday from a high of over $180 last month.

Lame, a Senegalese-Italian creator, built a following with dialogue-free videos mocking overly complicated life hacks, like using a gadget to open a soda can instead of just popping the tab. He is now the world's top TikTok influencer with over 160 million followers.

As part of the deal, Rich Sparkle — formerly a financial printing company — planned to create an AI avatar of Lame to do brand deals and sell products on social media while earning a commission. Rich Sparkle projected Lame's avatar could drive as much as $4 billion in annual product sales.

In return for its IP, Lame's company would get 75 million new shares in Rich Sparkle, valued at $13 each. (That $13 is a guide. Someone actually has to buy the shares for Lame and his team to cash out. So, if the share price of Rich Sparkle tumbles, the value of Lame's stake will fall as well. The same is true if it goes up.)

Rich Sparkle's drop-off isn't affecting Lame's current wealth, as there have been no formal filings indicating that the deal has closed or been approved by the Nasdaq. Lame and representatives for Rich Sparkle did not respond to requests for comment.

Paul Nary, a management professor at Wharton, said it's hard to know what will happen next.

Public details about the business are scarce, and the company's value — based on a projection of how much Lame's fame could be worth — is hard to assess. If Lame's team and Rich Sparkle shared more financial information, it could boost confidence in the company, Nary said.

"Normally, you'd have more specifics on the asset being acquired," he added. "The entire value of the company depends on that person and his related ventures."

The Lame example highlights the friction many solo creators face in trying to translate their social media fame into big, sustainable businesses.

Using a digital clone of Lame to sell stuff may seem like a wildly futuristic idea. However, digital avatars are becoming increasingly common in the influencer e-commerce playbook, particularly in China.

Chinese platforms like Baidu, JD.com, and Alibaba's Taobao have become hubs for digital avatars to sell on livestreams. AI clones of celebrities or influencers can pull in millions of dollars in a single livestream. The avatar for one Chinese influencer, Luo Yonghao, drove over $7 million in sales during a more than 6-hour selling session last year, CNBC reported.

While humans can appear more authentic to viewers, AI avatars can sell 24 hours a day without breaks and answer viewers' questions in real time.

"After an hour, you start to lose your concentration, you start to lose your voice," said Alexandre Ouairy, Director of PLTFRM, a marketing, advertising, and e-commerce agency in China. "A machine will continue speaking nonstop."

Lame doesn't narrate his videos, which could make it even easier for his digital avatar to succeed.

"He's got a great following, but it doesn't translate to a parasocial relationship like Mark Rober or Jimmy Donaldson does," said Jim Louderback, a creator economy advisor, name-checking the popular science influencer and creator behind MrBeast. "Because the character he built on TikTok is separate from himself, if he decides to pull back, his character lives on in the digital twinning."

Rich Sparkle's plan, in partnership with a Chinese marketing agency known as Three Sheep Group, is to use Lame's likeness to craft brand deals and sell products on apps like TikTok Shop, primarily in the US, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

As avatars become "the latest style of livestreaming in China," a lot of Chinese companies believe they can "copy the same format and do it in other countries," said Ophenia Liang, cofounder of the agency, Digital Crew, which helps Western brands break into the Chinese market.

No matter how skilled Lame's partners are at cloning his likeness, it still may be very hard to translate his fame into $4 billion in annual live-commerce sales, the figure that Rich Sparkle said it could hit in its acquisition announcement, the marketers said.

Whatnot, a buzzy platform focused on livestream commerce in the US and a few other markets, said it drove a total of $8 billion in 2025 product sales, as measured by gross merchandise value (GMV). Rich Sparkle's estimate suggests that Lame himself could drive sales equal to half that entire platform.

Sales on other top US social commerce platforms like TikTok Shop are growing quickly, but are still a far cry from those in the Chinese market. During the busiest four-day stretch of the holiday shopping season last year, TikTok Shop said its total US sales were around $500 million.

"Using his digital clone, there would be good revenue," Liang said of Lame, but he's unlikely to drive $4 billion in sales.

While the influencer economy is a buzzy category among investors, it has yet to produce an enduring IPO success story, aside from social media giants like Meta and Reddit.

That isn't stopping some creators from dreaming of going public. MrBeast's team has hinted at plans to IPO, for example. The top YouTuber's company was valued at around $5 billion in its latest funding round.

Lame is looking to enter the public markets through a reverse merger. That's when a private company goes public by merging with an existing public company, often called a shell. In this case, the shell is Rich Sparkle, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, with its main financial printing business based in Hong Kong. It reported $6.2 million in revenue in its 2025 fiscal year.

A reverse merger can be a way to access public markets with less time, cost, and scrutiny than a traditional IPO.

"I always think of reverse mergers as a poor man's IPO, because I don't have to spend all this money to get listed, and it's much cheaper than going through the IPO process," said Tim Loughran, a professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. "For investors, they should be wary."

Other creator economy firms have opted for reverse mergers to list on public markets, including the video app Triller and the Los Angeles influencer collective Clubhouse Media Group. Clubhouse shrunk down to a penny stock and is now traded over the counter. Triller was delisted by the Nasdaq in December after failing to file its SEC paperwork on time. Its market cap has fallen over 90% from its first day of trading.

One risk of running an influencer-fronted public company is reliance on a single personality to drive revenue.

Gaming and esports company FaZe Clan, which went public in 2022 via a special-purpose acquisition company valued at $725 million, relied on one creator for about 20% of its revenue. It sold itself in 2023 for a fraction of its SPAC price, and its influencer business later unraveled in late 2025 after many of its top talent left abruptly amid a contract dispute.

"It would be very difficult to have an IPO for a company that's based entirely on an influencer and personality," Wharton's Nary said. "This is precisely a case of an asset that would be very hard to value and take through a standard IPO process. Having a key man risk, it's tough."

If you want to know one of the biggest rivalries in AI, just ask for a show of hands.

On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei provided what is sure to become an iconic image of their feud. The pair went viral for refusing to join hands as the rest of the world's tech leaders gathered for a moment of unity, sparked by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Here's a timeline of how Altman and Amodei went from colleagues to becoming the face of AI's Cold War.

In July 2015, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Altman, and a group of elite AI researchers all gathered at the swanky Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, California.

According to The New York Times, Musk had a falling out with then-Google CEO Larry Page. Weeks later, Musk, Altman, Amodei, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, and others discussed the formation of a new AI lab to ensure Google had a worthy competitor in the AI space. Musk invited Amodei, per tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz.

Their vision became OpenAI, though Amodei initially elected not to join the startup research lab. Roughly a year later, he changed his mind and joined OpenAI as "Team Lead for AI Safety."

Amodei quickly moved up the ranks at OpenAI. In September 2018, the startup named him its research director.

Altman, who cofounded OpenAI while still serving as president of Y Combinator, began to devote more time to the startup.

In March 2019, Altman stepped down as YC's leader. He then became CEO of OpenAI and led the startup's pivot to a capped for-profit structure.

In November 2019, OpenAI released GPT-2, which Amodei played a major role in developing. A month later, OpenAI named Amodei as its Vice President of Research.

In June 2020, OpenAI began to show just how far the technology had come with the release of GPT-3, considered to be the first highly capable Large Language Model (LLM).

Amodei told The New York Times that the model had "this emergent quality." Independent researchers told the publication that GPT-3's capabilities surprised them, even as the model still showed signs of struggle.

To address safety concerns, OpenAI initially controlled access through a private beta.

The release of GPT-3 solidified OpenAI's standing, but behind the scenes, tensions were rising.

The rifts began when Amodei successfully lobbied to keep Greg Brockman, an OpenAI cofounder, off the team that developed GPT-3, according to Keach Hagey's biography of Altman, "The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future."

Hagey wrote that Amodei's stunning power within OpenAI had started to ruffle feathers. Differences continued to escalate over Amodei's long-held views on safety, Hagey wrote, especially regarding slowing the pace of updates to prevent malicious uses of the AI models.

Amodei told friends that he "felt psychologically abused by Altman," Hagey wrote. Altman, in turn, was telling colleagues that the tension "was making him hate his job."

On December 29, 2020, OpenAI made it official. Amodei was leaving, and a "handful" of other colleagues were leaving.

Amodei has since suggested that his vision became incompatible with OpenAI's direction.

"It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision," Amodei told podcaster Lex Friedman in 2024, when asked why he left OpenAI.

With seven other former OpenAI employees, Amodei founded Anthropic in early 2021. The group was extremely close and included Daniela Amodei, Dario's sister. Daniela Amodei later said the name was chosen to emphasize their company's focus on humans.

Only one of Anthropic's initial employees hadn't worked at OpenAI, according to AI Business.

Despite starting from scratch, Amodei said that by the Summer of 2022, the company's chatbot, Claude, had finished training. Amodei said he was worried about what the release of a powerful AI could mean. Anthropic held off on a release.

"I suspect it was the right thing to do," Amodei told Time Magazine in 2024. "But it's not totally clear-cut."

Months later, OpenAI released ChatGPT, kicking off the AI race and making Amodei's former employer a household name.

As Anthropic began to establish itself in its own right, Amodei began to use his public appearances to take what were widely viewed as implicit shots at OpenAI.

During an appearance at a Bloomberg event, Amodei noted how Anthropic had kept its leadership intact.

"We have 7 cofounders," he said, Gizmodo reported. "Three and a half years later, we're all still at the company."

While never calling out by name, OpenAI was experiencing upheaval at the time. Months earlier, Andrej Karpathy, an OpenAI cofounder, had left the company. And in November 2023, Altman was briefly pushed out of OpenAI, an effort fellow cofounder Ilya Sutskever assisted. (Sutskever later expressed regret over his role. He formally left OpenAI just days after Amodei's jab, though there had been months of speculation surrounding Sutskever's standing.)

By the end of 2025, OpenAI's lead in the AI race was slipping. When presented with the opportunity, Amodei seized the moment to troll his rival.

Journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Amodei about OpenAI's decision to declare a "code red" to marshal resources for ChatGPT amid Google's rising strength.

We have a little bit of a privileged position where we can just keep growing and just keep developing our models, and we don't have to do any code reds," Amodei told Sorkin during an appearance at The New York Times' DealBook summit.

Earlier in their conversation, Amodei appeared to take another swipe at Altman when he talked about some players "who are YOLOing" by making too risky bets on future demand based on their current revenue.

"Who is YOLOing?" Sorkin asked. 

"I'm not going to answer that," Amodei replied.

Anthropic used the biggest stage available to take its most direct shot yet at OpenAI.

Ahead of the Super Bowl, Anthropic revealed it was spending millions on an advertising campaign to denounce AI chatbot ads. While OpenAI was not named directly, it was clear who the intended target was, given that just months earlier, OpenAI had said it would begin testing ads on ChatGPT.

The ads featured real human actors mimicking the voice of product-pushing AI chatbots when asked questions like how to get a six-pack quickly or how to better connect with your mom.

"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed," Altman wrote in a lengthy post on X." But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest."

Altman wasn't done.

"Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people," he continued. "We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions."

Days later, the companies went head-to-head again. This time, with the release of major updates to their coding-focused model within minutes of each other.

A who's who of AI and tech elite gathered in India for a major summit on artificial intelligence.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the opportunity to orchestrate a classic image of unity: competing CEOs with their hands raised together. (It's something Modi has done before with other world leaders, and politicians have been doing forever.)

Modi almost got his moment. While Altman held the prime minister's hand, the OpenAI CEO didn't grasp Amodei's hand, who was positioned to his other side. Amodei grasped the hand of the other person next to him, but not Altman's.

The internet, predictably, had a field day. And the world got a perfect encapsulation of one of AI's bitter rivalries.

Oil prices edged lower on Friday, after President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited military strike to pressure Iran over its nuclear program.

"I guess I can say I am considering that," Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors.

International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery fell 43 cents to $71.23 per barrel by 11:10 a.m. ET, erasing earlier gains, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery lost 41 cents to $66.02. 

Both contracts notched their highest settle in six months in the previous session as energy market participants continue to monitor supply risks in the oil-rich Middle East.

The U.S. and Iran have held talks in Switzerland this week to try to resolve a standoff over Tehran's nuclear program. Initial reports of progress, however, gave way to accusations from Washington that Iran had failed to address core U.S. demands. 

Speaking at the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday, the U.S. president said "bad things will happen" if Tehran doesn't agree to a deal over its nuclear program. 

Trump added that the world will likely find out over the next 10 days whether the U.S. will reach a deal with Iran or take military action. He later told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wanted an agreement within "10 to 15 days." 

His comments come after a significant buildup of U.S. military forces in the Middle East and amid reports the White House is considering fresh military action against Tehran as soon as this weekend. 

Trump said Iran's nuclear potential had been "totally decimated" by U.S. strikes on its facilities in June last year, before adding "we may have to take it a step further or we may not," without providing further details.

Iran reportedly said in a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday that Tehran will respond "decisively" if subjected to military aggression.

The Islamic Republic has conducted military drills in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz in recent days, as well as joint naval drills with Russia in the Gulf of Oman, also known as the Sea of Oman.

"Everything is in place, or will be by Saturday night, for strikes to commence and so the window opens then," Daniel Shapiro, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, told CNBC's "Access Middle East" on Friday. 

"Doesn't mean that's going to happen immediately. The president did indicate that he is waiting to hear from Iran whether they are prepared to make concessions on their nuclear program that he's insisting on," Shapiro said. 

"I think it's unlikely. We have never seen Iran open to those types of concessions, so I think it is unlikely they will agree to those, which means that in the days coming, the president will have to make that decision on military strikes," he added. 

The Trump administration has said it still hopes to reach a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear program, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying on Wednesday that it would be "very wise" for Iran to make a deal. 

Martijn Rats, chief commodity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that, while the oil market is "very well supplied" on a global basis, there are three factors propping up prices. 

"Worries about Iran, clearly. Also, an unusually large amount of buying by China, simply for stockpiling purposes. It makes you wonder what they are going to do with all these inventories and then also we have very high freight rates," Rats told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Friday.

"The factor of those three that is most prominent, of course, is the issue in Iran," Rats said. 

Strategists at Barclays said Friday that while equity markets have largely shrugged off the geopolitical noise so far, tensions have been rising since Vice President JD Vance accused Iran of failing to discuss so-called "red lines," alongside reports of increased U.S. military capability in the region. 

"We believe that any strike would likely have to be time limited and with defined targets (nuclear, ballistic missiles), as they were last summer," the strategists said in a research note. 

"With midterm elections later this year and the administration prioritizing affordability for US consumers, we suspect their willingness to tolerate a prolonged period of significantly higher oil prices, and potentially casualties too, will be limited," they continued. "So if conflict is imminent it is likely to be short lived, in our view."

The AI boom isn't just lifting chipmakers and Big Tech. In Japan, it's flushing gains into a toilet manufacturer and a seasoning giant.

As demand for AI chips surges, investors are piling into companies that sit inside the semiconductor supply chain — even if they're better known for bathrooms and soup stock.

Toilet maker Toto, famous for its high-tech bidets and heated seats, has drawn investor attention. The company makes electrostatic chucks, which are critical components used in the production of NAND memory chips.

Memory prices have climbed sharply in recent months, driven by AI-related demand.

Last week, UK-based activist fund Palliser Capital called Toto "the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary," according to reports by Bloomberg and the Financial Times.

After news broke on Tuesday that Palliser Capital had taken a stake and was pushing Toto to promote its chip-parts business, the toilet maker's stock jumped more than 5%. Its shares are up more than 54% over the past year.

It's not just Toto. Japanese food giant Ajinomoto, better known for its umami seasonings and soup bases, has become an unlikely AI infrastructure play. The company produces an insulating material used in advanced semiconductor packaging.

Ajinomoto's latest financials point to strength beyond its core food business. For the nine months ended December, the company reported an 8.9% rise in net profit, while operating profit increased 5.6% year-on-year. The gains were partly driven by its "Healthcare and Others" segment which includes electronic materials used in semiconductors, the company said in a February earnings statement.

After Ajinomoto posted its earnings on February 5, the company's stock rose 13%. Its shares are up more than 56% over the past year.

Not all non-tech companies are benefiting equally from the AI boom. Daikin, best known globally for its air conditioners, supplies high-purity chemical materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. It recently trimmed its outlook, citing uncertainty over US tariffs as a drag on demand.

The Japanese air conditioning maker reduced its operating profit forecast by about 5% to 413 billion Japanese yen, or $2.6 billion, for the fiscal year ending in March.

"Operating profit was significantly affected by the decline in semiconductor demand, decreasing by 44.6% year over year to ¥18,102 million," the company said in its financial report in February.

"Net sales of fluoropolymers fell year over year, despite focused Group efforts to capture strong new demand in the data center field, and was due to the stagnation in the construction markets of the United States and China and the significant overall impact of delays in the recovery of semiconductor demand," it added.

The company said it plans to cushion the blow through price increases and cost reductions.

Daikin's stock dropped as much as 8.4% in Tokyo following its financial results.

U.S. markets had a shaky Thursday, pressured by Washington's escalating tensions with Iran and renewed worries over private credit. 

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he will decide within 10 days whether to strike Iran. Concerns over oil supply in the event of military action in Iran pushed oil prices up almost 2% in U.S. trading, and rose further during Asia hours.

Meanwhile, Blue Owl Capital tightened investor liquidity after selling $1.4 billion in loan assets, raising alarms about the stability in the private credit market. Its stock fell nearly 6%, while shares of other asset managers, such as Blackstone and Apollo Global Management, retreated as well. 

"This is a canary in the coal mine," Dan Rasmussen, founder and adviser at Verdad Capital told CNBC. 

The combined set of worries led markets lower. The S&P 500 lost 0.28%, putting it near the flat line for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.54% and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.31% down.

In Europe, Airbus stock fell 6% Thursday after the aircraft maker said its deliveries this year would be fewer than analyst expectations. CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC that the supplier-driven engine shortages are "unsatisfactory."

But there's some positive sentiment at India's AI Impact Summit. CNBC talked to Microsoft President Brad Smith, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Qualcomm head Cristiano Amon about their views on the artificial intelligence industry, semiconductor manufacturing, competition with China, among other topics.

Memory chip shortage is still the limiting factor for agentic AI, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, told CNBC. 

Nonetheless, Nvidia appears to be going full steam ahead on AI companies. The chipmaker is planning to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, CNBC has confirmed. That would put the startup at a $730 billion pre-money valuation.

— CNBC's Ashley Capoot, Spencer Kimball and Hugh Leask contributed to this report.

Blue Owl sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held in three of its private debt funds, the private market and alternative assets manager said Wednesday, curbing liquidity payments to investors. The concern is that years of ultra-low interest rates and thin yield spreads encouraged lenders to make riskier moves.

Japan's headline inflation rate fell to 1.5% in January, its lowest level since March 2022. The reading ended a run of 45 straight months in which inflation had remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 2%.

Shares of Japanese drugmaker Sumitomo Pharma fell over 12% Friday on what appeared to be profit-taking, a day after the government endorsed the company's iPS cell-based therapy for Parkinson's and heart disease.

Major U.S. indexes fell Thursday as investors shifted away from financials and software stocks. Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Friday. South Korea's Kospi, however, rose more than 2% to touch a record high for the second straight day.

[PRO] Analysts still like Airbus stock despite the aircraft manufacturer providing a conservative delivery guidance for 2026 — here's why.

India is throwing its weight behind AI — but is there substance behind the headlines?

Three years ago, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told an audience in India, "it's totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation models but you should try anyway." Altman walked back his comments the next day. 

A couple of years later, China's DeepSeek emerged as a contender to OpenAI's ChatGPT and chatbots from other U.S. tech giants. Indian citizens resurfaced Altman's comment, declaring that China had already proven him wrong.

But can India compete with the U.S.?

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would direct the Department of Defense and other agencies to make public government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life.

Trump said the files that will be identified and released will also concern unidentified aerial phenomena and unidentified flying objects, as well as "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters."

In a Truth Social post, the U.S. president said his move was based on the "tremendous interest" in the subject, without providing additional details. This comes after he accused former U.S. President Barack Obama of leaking "classified information" on aliens. "I don't know if they're real or not, but I can tell you he gave classified information," Trump told reporters on Air Force One. 

Obama said on Saturday in a podcast that aliens were real, "but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51." 

"There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States," Obama added.Area 51 refers to a classified U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada, and has been the center of conspiracy theories saying the U.S. government has been conducting research and using the facility for storing extraterrestrial materials and technology. 

Obama had previously said that the first question he wanted answered when he became president was "Where are the aliens?"

After the podcast on Sunday, the former U.S. president clarified his stance on a post on Instagram, saying that the universe was so vast that the odds are good that there's life out there. 

However, he said that he also saw "no evidence" during his presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with Earth." 

In late 2024, the Pentagon said it had seen 757 new reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs between May 2023 and June 2024, NBC News reported.

Of these, 21 "merit further analysis" due to "anomalous characteristics and/or behaviors," the report said, adding that there was no evidence, so far, to substantiate life from another planet being involved in these sightings.

A federal grand jury indicted three Silicon Valley engineers on charges of stealing trade secrets from Google and other technology companies and transferring sensitive data to Iran, prosecutors said Thursday.

Samaneh Ghandali, 41, her sister Soroor Ghandali, 32, and Mohammadjavad Khosravi, 40 — all residents of San Jose — were arrested Thursday and appeared in a federal district court the same day.

The indictment identified the defendants as Iranian nationals. Soroor was in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant student visa. Samaneh later became a U.S. citizen, and Khosravi, her husband, became a U.S. legal permanent resident. Prosecutors said that Khosravi previously served in the Iranian army.

The trio faces charges of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of California.

Prosecutors alleged the three defendants exploited their positions at leading technology firms that develop mobile computer processors to obtain hundreds of confidential files, including materials related to processor security and cryptography. 

Samaneh and Soroor worked at Google before joining a third company identified only as Company 3. Khosravi worked at a separate firm referred to as Company 2, which develops system-on-chip (SoC) platforms such as the Snapdragon series for smartphones and other mobile devices.

SoC is a semiconductor that integrates numerous components, such as graphics processing units and memory, into a power-efficient package. Common SoCs include Qualcomm's Snapdragon, found in most high-end Android phones, and Apple's A-series for iPhones.

In a statement to CNBC, Google said it had detected the alleged theft through routine security monitoring before referring the case to law enforcement. 

"We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident," spokesman José Castañeda said. 

The tech giant also pointed to measures to protect its trade secrets, including restricting employees' access to sensitive information, two-factor authentication for work-related Google accounts and logging file transfers to third-party platforms such as Telegram. 

Authorities alleged the defendants routed stolen files through a third-party communications platform to channels bearing each of their first names, before copying the material to personal devices, each other's work devices, and to Iran. 

"The method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities," said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani. 

The defendants sought to cover their tracks after Google's internal security systems flagged Samaneh's activity and revoked her access to company resources in August 2023. 

According to the indictment, she signed an affidavit falsely claiming she had not shared Google's confidential information outside the company. During that period, a personal laptop linked to Samaneh and Khosravi was used to search for methods to delete communications and to research how long mobile carriers retain message records, prosecutors said.

The couple also allegedly photographed hundreds of computer screens containing confidential information from Google and Company 2, in what appeared to be an attempt at circumventing digital monitoring tools. 

On the night before the pair traveled to Iran in December 2023, Samaneh allegedly took about 24 photos of Khosravi's work computer screen containing Company 2's trade secrets, including its Snapdragon SoCs. 

Prosecutors allege that while in Iran, a device linked to Samaneh accessed those photographs, while Khosravi accessed additional Company 2's proprietary information, such as Snapdragon SoC hardware architecture.

Prosecutors said in the indictment that Snapdragon SoC trade secrets had independent economic value because they were not generally known and could not be readily obtained from Company 2's competitors, who could benefit from their disclosure or use. 

If convicted, each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison for each trade secret charge and up to 20 years for obstruction of justice, along with fines of up to $250,000 per count.

The private credit boom is facing a new test after Blue Owl Capital permanently restricted withdrawals from one of its retail-focused debt funds.

Shares in Blue Owl Capital fell nearly 6% on Thursday after the private market and alternative assets manager sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held in three of its private debt funds.

The biggest portion of the sale came from a semi-liquid private credit fund marketed to U.S. retail investors called the Blue Owl Capital Corporation II, which will stop offering quarterly redemption options to investors, reigniting debate over whether stress was beginning to resurface in one of Wall Street's fastest-growing corners.

"This is a canary in the coal mine," Dan Rasmussen, founder and adviser at Verdad Capital told CNBC. "The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst."

The broader concern is that years of ultra-low interest rates and thin yield spreads encouraged lenders to make riskier moves, financing smaller, more leveraged companies at yields that appeared attractive compared with public markets, market watchers said.

"Years of ultra-low rates and ultra-low spreads and very few bankruptcies led investors to go further and further out the risk spectrum in credit," Rasmussen said. "This is a classic case of 'fool's yield,' high yield that doesn't translate into high returns because the borrowers were too risky."

Private credit, which are generally direct loans made by non-bank lenders to companies, have ballooned into a roughly $3 trillion market globally.

Publicly traded business development companies, or BDCs, which are investment vehicles that lend to small and mid-sized private companies and are a major part of the private credit market, are increasingly funded by retail investors rather than institutions, according to Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. 

The Fuqua research, which was published last September, showed that institutional ownership of BDC shares has steadily declined over time, falling to about 25% on average by 2023.

"This trend indicates that retail investors are playing an increasingly large role in supplying equity capital to publicly traded BDC," the researchers pointed out.

In 2025, the eight largest members of the S&P BDC Index offered dividend yields which can go up to 16%, with Blue Owl's at over 11%. For comparison, the S&P Global's U.S. high yield corporate bond index 1-year, 3-year and 5-year returns stand at around 7.7%, 9% and 4%, respectively.

"The majority of loans in private credit funds that individual investors tend to own, they're high yield loans. They are, by their nature, somewhat risky," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

"Over the course of the cycle, you can anticipate some material defaults across these funds," he added.

Private credit concerns recently resurfaced after investors grew uneasy that AI tools could disrupt traditional enterprise software models, a major borrower group of the industry, adding to existing concerns in over rising leverage, murky valuations and the possibility that isolated borrower stress could reveal deeper systemic weaknesses. 

The First Brands Group collapse last September brought to fore risks in private credit after the heavily leveraged auto-parts maker ran into distress, highlighting how aggressive debt structures had built up quietly during years of easy financing. 

The episode heightened fears that similar risks could be lurking across the market, prompting JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to warn that private credit risks were "hiding in plain sight," warning that "cockroaches" will likely emerge once economic conditions deteriorate.

The fundamental problem private market deals have is multi-year commitments that don't line up with quarterly redemptions, said Michael Shum, CEO of Cascade Debt, which builds infrastructure software for private credit and asset-based lenders.

"When times are good, cashflows cover normal redemption requests. When times are bad, requests surge and it becomes a race to the bottom," he said.

Blue Owl did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

President Donald Trump says he is directing federal agencies to declassify UFO files. For traders betting on aliens, that could mean a very earthly payday.

"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters," Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday night.

Earlier on Thursday, Trump took aim at former President Barack Obama, accusing him of improperly discussing classified material when speaking about extraterrestrial life on a recent podcast.

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Obama "gave classified information" and wasn't "supposed to be doing that," adding that he could get him "out of trouble" by declassifying the relevant files.

Obama said in a tongue-in-cheek exchange with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen last week that aliens are "real" and that they're not "being kept" at Area 51. He later clarified in an Instagram post that there was no evidence during his presidency that aliens "have made contact with us."

Aliens have always had a niche following. In prediction markets, aliens are tradable assets.

On the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, guessing about aliens has become a high-volume betting category. Traders have poured millions of dollars into whether the US will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life.

One of the platform's largest markets asks whether the US will confirm that aliens exist before 2027. The market has drawn more than $4 million in trading volume as of Thursday.

Betting activity has also centered on whether a Trump administration would declassify UFO files before 2027, with odds climbing above 80% in December.

Polymarket users also placed bets on other extraterrestrial theories, including whether mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey were aliens.

If the files are released and contain anything definitive, longtime alien bettors may finally cash in.

In November 2024, unidentified drones were seen flying at night over New Jersey and other East Coast states.

The mysterious sightings unsettled residents and drew questions from local officials, fueling a wave of speculation about what — or who — was in the sky. Alien theories quickly gained traction.

At that time, Trump said the government "knows what is happening" but wasn't sharing it.

"For some reason, they don't want to comment. I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows, and our president knows, and for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense," he said at Mar-a-Lago.

"Something strange is going on," he added.

A Facebook group titled "New Jersey Mystery Drones — let's solve it" has grown to more than 81,000 members as of writing. Users in the group continue to float the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement, alongside speculation about commercial or military craft.

It's up to you whether AI makes you sharper or slowly dulls your brain, says Demis Hassabis.

In a Thursday interview with entrepreneur Varun Mayya on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit, the Google DeepMind CEO said that AI is just like the internet. People can use it to learn all kinds of topics, or use it in ways that "degrade" their thinking.

"With AI, if you use it in a lazy way, it will make you worse at critical thinking and so on," he said. "But that's down to you as the individual. No one can help you do that."

He added that people need to be smart and use these technologies in ways that enhance their thinking rather than dull it.

Hassabis cofounded DeepMind in 2010, which Google acquired in 2014. It merged with Google Brain in 2023 to form Google DeepMind, the lab behind tools such as Gemini and Nano Banana. The CEO and a DeepMind coworker, John Jumper, were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their work on protein structure prediction.

As AI gets incorporated into daily life, debates about its risks and rewards have intensified, with several tech leaders warning about the dangers of an overreliance on AI tools.

Earlier this week, tech billionaire Mark Cuban said that there are two types of people who use AI.

"There are generally 2 types of LLM users, those that use it to learn everything, and those that use it so they don't have to learn anything," Cuban said of large language models in an X post on Tuesday.

Cuban has previously said that AI models can't provide all the answers and are "stupid" but like "a savant that remembers everything."

At a June conference, the CEO of French AI lab Mistral said that a risk of using AI for everything is that humans will stop trying.

"The biggest risk with AI is not that it will outsmart us or become uncontrollable, but that it will make us too comfortable, too dependent, and ultimately too lazy to think or act for ourselves," Arthur Mensch said.

Mark Cuban says there are two types of people who use AI. Which one are you?

"There are generally 2 types of LLM users, those that use it to learn everything , and those that use it so they don't have to learn anything," Cuban said of large language models in an X post on Tuesday.

The "Shark Tank" billionaire has been bullish about AI and said that companies need to embrace it.

Cuban has said there will be "two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else," Business Insider's James Faris previously reported. He's also said that AI models can't provide all the answers and are "stupid" but like "a savant that remembers everything."

Bill Gurley, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capitalist firm Benchmark, agrees "100%" with Cuban that there are two types of AI users.

"If you are on a custom career path where you aim to differentiate yourself, AI is 'jet fuel' - you can learn and soar faster than ever before," Gurley said on X in response to Cuban.

Or, it could have the opposite effect.

Even some of AI's biggest proponents have warned that the technology could make people lazy.

Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral AI, said last year that the biggest risk to humans posed by AI was "deskilling" and employees becoming lazier as they rely too heavily on the AI tools.

"You want people to continue learning," he said in an interview with The Times of London. "Being able to synthesize information and criticize information is a core component to learning."

Business Insider reached out to Cuban for additional comment.

Core Scientific operates in one of crypto's most capital-intensive segments, where energy costs and production efficiency shape long-term returns. Paloma's latest filing highlights how institutional investors are positioning around those mining fundamentals.

According to an SEC filing dated February 17, 2026, Paloma Partners Management Co reduced its holdings in Core Scientific by 2,547,000 shares. The estimated transaction value, based on the average closing price for the fourth quarter of 2025, was $44.41 million. The fund's position value fell by $46.32 million over the quarter, reflecting both trading activity and share price movement. Paloma Partners now holds 185,000 shares, valued at $2.69 million at year-end.

Following the sale, Core Scientific now accounts for 0.49% of Paloma Partners Management Co's reportable U.S. equity assets.

Top five holdings after the filing:

As of February 17, 2026, Core Scientific shares were priced at $17.23, up 39.1% over the past year. The stock outperformed the S&P 500 by 25.81 percentage points over the same period.

Core Scientific is a leading provider of digital asset mining and blockchain infrastructure services in North America, leveraging proprietary software and large-scale datacenter operations. The company's integrated approach combines self-mining with colocation hosting, enabling flexibility and operational scale. With a focus on advanced infrastructure and security, Core Scientific is positioned as a key enabler for institutional adoption of blockchain technologies.

Core Scientific provides digital asset mining, blockchain infrastructure, and colocation hosting services, with revenue streams from mining for its own account and equipment hosting for third parties.

The company operates a dual-segment model: direct mining of digital assets and offering large-scale datacenter colocation and equipment sales for blockchain participants.

Core Scientific's primary customers include institutional miners, blockchain enterprises, and organizations seeking secure, scalable infrastructure for distributed ledger technology.

Core Scientific sits at the intersection of Bitcoin price volatility and the high fixed costs of operating large-scale mining datacenters. After rising roughly 39% over the past year, the stock reflects improving crypto sentiment, but its underlying economics remain tied to production efficiency and power costs. 

Core Scientific generates revenue in two primary ways: mining Bitcoin for its own account and hosting equipment for institutional customers. The first depends not only on Bitcoin prices but also on mining difficulty and fleet efficiency, which determine how much Bitcoin can be produced per unit of energy. The second depends more on datacenter capacity, energy costs, and long-term hosting relationships. This mix provides upside potential when digital asset markets improve but also exposes the company to operational risk if prices or mining economics decline.

For investors, the key factors to look out for are Core's Bitcoin production efficiency, power cost management, and the stability of its hosting business. Metrics such as Bitcoin output per megawatt, cost per coin, energy contracts, and debt flexibility will determine whether the recent rally signals stronger fundamentals or is merely a favorable phase in the crypto cycle.

Ethereum (ETH) is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies today. Most people familiar with the crypto world know its name. Unlike Bitcoin, which is often seen as a store of value, Ethereum primarily acts as a platform for supporting DeFi and NFT systems. These systems come in different shapes and sizes, but many play a role in influencing the Ethereum price. This is because transactions, collateral, and smart contracts on the network require ETH.

By establishing a basic understanding of the relationship between DeFi/NFT adoption and Ethereum price, prospective users can approach decentralized markets with the knowledge needed to recognize how and why real network utility affects short-term price movements and long-term valuation.

Defining Terms: DeFi and NFTs

As a brief reminder, DeFi, short for decentralized finance, pertains to a financial system that operates via blockchain technology. An article notes that, unlike traditional finance, “DeFi is entirely decentralized. This means that it is not controlled by a central entity or government. Instead, it relies on open protocols and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.” 

Because DeFi applications are not tied to any one entity, they can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, by anyone, all without needing a standard bank account. Additionally, by using blockchain technology, DeFi programs are able to offer complete transparency and substantial security.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meanwhile, are assets like digital content, videos, or artworks that have been tokenized by way of a blockchain. These tokens can be traded and exchanged on platforms in networks like Ethereum for money, cryptocurrencies, or even other NFTs. Not every exchange platform accepts NFTs, but some DeFi applications do. This opens up new opportunities for financial transactions and investments on the Ethereum blockchain.

The Role of Ethereum Price in DeFi Protocols

ETH, the native token of Ethereum, is often used as collateral in decentralized lending, borrowing, and yield protocols. In these cases, this means that the value of your collateral goes up or down with the price of Ethereum. It is important to note that more DeFi activity often makes it harder to get liquid ETH. This puts upward pressure on the price of Ethereum because of demand.

Different DeFi protocols always react to these changes in different ways. For instance, decentralized exchange protocols like Uniswap let people trade ETH and ERC-20 tokens, while protocols like DAI make decentralized stablecoins that are worth the same as the US dollar. The protocol that interacts more directly with ETH will probably have a stronger connection to changes in price than protocols that are less connected to ETH.

Important Shifts in NFT Market Activity

With NFTs gradually gaining recurring popularity, possibly thanks to the increasing number of DeFi protocols and platforms on Ethereum, their value in relation to changes in ETH pricing has become more notable over time. This development is largely due to the fact that NFT minting, trading, and royalty-sharing are primarily executed in ETH. As a result, a surge in NFT adoption can coincide with short-term spikes in Ethereum price due to higher transactional demand.

As it so happens, these short-term spikes also provide traders with useful information that can be used to inform short-term price indicators. By monitoring NFT and DeFi market cycles, traders can sometimes gauge how current trends line up with past ones, thereby providing them with some means of predicting price changes for the near future.

How Real-World Utility Signals Adoption

Much of the trading done on crypto markets is speculative since cryptocurrencies (outside of stablecoins) may have little inherent value. This speculation plays a significant role in crypto's notorious volatility, necessitating stabilizing forces like real-world utility.

DeFi and NFT usage are good indicators of demand and future adoption because they show how useful the Ethereum network really is. So, when the ecosystem grows quickly, it usually means that people will want ETH for a long time. This keeps the price of Ethereum stable and helps it grow.

This idea is further supported by the fact that activity in DeFi and NFT markets typically indicates increased confidence in Ethereum's capabilities and long-term relevance. As a result, people who trade Ethereum may see more use as a good sign for its price. However, it is important to remember that these signals do not always mean growth or positive change, since there are so many factors that affect crypto prices at any given time.

What DeFi and NFT Usage Could Mean for Ethereum

Ethereum remains popular largely because it does so much more than provide a novel means of storing wealth. Through the network's growing number of DeFi protocols and NFT markets, users can participate in a variety of financial transactions without dealing with central figures like banks.

With ETH playing an instrumental role in supporting all of these functions on the Ethereum network, its price and the ways it fluctuates are worth noting and planning for in order to make transactions as favorable as possible. As a general rule, the more people use applications on crypto networks, the more valuable those networks tend to be for short- and long-term valuations alike.

As the digital asset ecosystem continues to mature, large financial players are increasingly shaping market dynamics through specialised trading approaches. Many organisations entering this space begin by exploring services such as crypto otc trading, which are designed to support large-scale transactions with efficiency, discretion, and reliability. This shift marks a clear distinction between retail participation and the more structured world of institutional involvement.

At its core, institutional cryptocurrency trading refers to the buying and selling of digital assets by professional entities rather than individual investors. These entities include hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms, corporate treasuries, and even traditional financial institutions. Their participation brings higher volumes, advanced strategies, and stricter operational standards to the crypto markets.

Unlike retail traders, institutions operate with defined mandates, risk frameworks, and compliance requirements. Trades are often executed in large sizes and must align with broader portfolio strategies or business objectives. As a result, institutions require infrastructure that can handle complex execution needs, provide transparency, and integrate with existing financial systems.

One of the defining characteristics of institutional participation is its focus on reliable liquidity. Large orders must be executed without causing significant price disruption, which is not always possible on public order books. This need has driven the growth of alternative execution venues and professional trading services tailored to high-volume participants.

To address the limitations of traditional exchanges, many institutions rely on OTC markets. These over-the-counter venues allow buyers and sellers to negotiate trades directly, often with the support of a dedicated desk. By moving large transactions off public order books, institutions can avoid slippage, reduce market impact, and gain greater certainty around execution prices.

OTC trading is particularly useful during periods of volatility or when handling strategic reallocations. It also offers flexibility in terms of settlement timing and trade structuring, which is valuable for organisations coordinating trades with internal treasury or accounting processes.

Managing large digital asset positions requires more than execution capabilities. Secure storage and asset management are equally important. This is where custodial solutions play a critical role. Institutional-grade custody services are designed to safeguard assets through advanced security controls, access management, and operational oversight.

These solutions help institutions mitigate risks associated with private key exposure and internal misuse. By separating trading functions from asset storage, organisations can implement clearer governance structures and demonstrate accountability to regulators and stakeholders.

Institutions also differentiate themselves through the use of algorithmic strategies. Automated trading systems analyse market data in real time, execute orders based on predefined rules, and manage exposure across multiple venues simultaneously. This approach allows institutions to operate efficiently at scale while reducing reliance on manual intervention.

Algorithms are commonly used for tasks such as order slicing, price optimisation, and inventory management. When supported by robust infrastructure, these strategies can improve execution quality and consistency, even in fast-moving markets.

The growing presence of institutional traders has a stabilising effect on the crypto ecosystem. Higher volumes, professional risk management, and structured execution contribute to more orderly markets. This, in turn, attracts additional participants and supports the long-term development of digital assets as a legitimate asset class.

Dubai, UAE, Feb.  20, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 

Pepeto Presale Hits $7.27M While Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered Call for $200,000 Bitcoin 

Goldman Sachs' digital assets team isn't being subtle anymore. Their latest projection puts Bitcoin at $200,000 before this year ends. ETF inflows, big money piling in, and a clearer regulatory picture are all fueling the call (Forbes, January 2026). Standard Chartered backed it up with a $150,000 floor target. Two of the biggest names in finance are saying the same thing. And anyone who's been through a crypto cycle knows what comes next.

Bitcoin runs first. Then altcoins go parabolic. It happened in 2017 when BTC jumped from $1,000 to $20,000 and altcoins did 10x to 100x after that. It happened in 2021 when Bitcoin topped $69,000 and SHIB turned $1,000 wallets into retirement money. Right now BTC is sitting around $67,000. That's a 47% pullback from October's $126,080 high. CoinShares and Nexo say this dip is building the floor for the next move (CNBC, January 2026). Most people are staring at Bitcoin charts. Smart money? It's already loading the altcoins that'll do the biggest multiples once capital rotates.

That's where Pepeto comes in. The presale has raised $7.27M at $0.000000184 per token with three product demos already live. Unlike the coins that made headlines in past cycles, Pepeto isn't built on hype alone. It's built on infrastructure the meme economy has never had.
		



Pepeto Announces Three Working Product Demos as Crypto News Highlights Altcoin Season Forming 

Every previous altcoin season rewarded projects that solved real problems. Most presales in 2026 still ship roadmaps and Telegram stickers. Pepeto took a different approach.

PepetoSwap handles cross chain meme coin trades. Pepeto Bridge routes tokens between fragmented ecosystems. Pepeto Exchange is being built as the central hub for the meme economy. All three exist as working demos right now. After buying $PEPETO, investors get immediate access to test every product before full launch.

"Pepeto was built as infrastructure for a meme economy worth billions but fragmented across dozens of chains," said a Pepeto team representative. "We showed investors working products instead of asking them to trust a whitepaper."

SolidProof and Coinsult completed dual audits. Zero tax. Created by a cofounder of Pepe. Binance listing confirmed. That combination of live demos, verified security, and exchange access is why the cap is already 70% filled.

Pepeto's 250x Math Makes the Case Before Altcoins Start Moving 

Here's what separates Pepeto from large caps. Bitcoin going from $67,000 to $200,000 is roughly 3x. Strong return. But it won't change your life the way earlier cycles changed lives for people who found the right altcoin at the right time.

Dogecoin reached $90 billion with no swap, no bridge, no exchange, and no audits. Just a logo and a community. Pepeto has three working demos, dual audits, zero tax, and a confirmed Binance listing at a price still starting with six zeros. If Pepeto reaches even a fraction of DOGE's peak, early participants are looking at 250x or more. That turns $1,000 into $250,000.

Staking at 214% APY adds another layer. A $50,000 position generates $107,000 in yearly yield. But don't confuse the yield with the main opportunity. Staking is the holding bonus. The real play is what happens to a six zero token with live products when capital rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins (CoinGecko, December 2025).
		



Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, and Nexo all project Bitcoin heading higher. History says the altcoin explosion follows. This time, it won't be random meme coins catching the wave. It'll be projects with real products, real audits, and confirmed exchange access. Pepeto checks every box at $0.000000184. The investors who found DOGE and SHIB before listings didn't wait. They saw the setup and moved.

The US under President Donald Trump's orders could soon strike Iran and that's not great news for cryptocurrencies.

Indeed, analysts told DL News that another Middle Eastern conflict could prompt investors to further derisk, potentially bringing more pain to crypto investors. 

“We're already starting to see the uncertainty there weigh on crypto and equity markets,” Carlos Guzman of GSR Research said. 

The warning comes as Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have lost about half their total value since October, with many analysts saying things could get worse from here.

Bitcoin has long-been touted a hedge against global uncertainty, be that macroeconomic or geopolitical. 

But history has proven that the top cryptocurrency has failed to live up to that title.

“A true bottom requires ownership to change hands, and right now it's kind of like all the same people — it's like, who's the next buyer?” 

Just last year, when tensions flared between neighbours Israel and Iran — with later involvement from the US — investors shorted Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin's price fell sharply following Israel's June 2025 “Operation Midnight Hammer” strike and dipped again later that month when the US joined in. 

Crypto prices then recovered after Trump signalled a pause in attacks. 

This time, though, things are different. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum have slumped severely following a brutal October $19 billion liquidation event that has continued to unwind. 

Bitcoin was trading above $100,000 per coin during last year's strikes and now trades around $67,000.

“In the current context of a bear market, geopolitical headwinds would exacerbate selling pressure on digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, causing prices to decline further,” Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant's head of research, told DL News. 

Regardless of a war, experts added, the bottom is not in, and a large war in the Middle East could do more harm than good. 

“I don't think the bottom's in at all,” Greg Magadini, Amberdata's director of derivatives, said of Bitcoin's price. 

“A true bottom requires ownership to change hands, and right now it's kind of like all the same people — it's like, who's the next buyer?” 

He added that a US strike on Iran would be a de-risking event that immediately sends Bitcoin nosediving, while gold and treasuries would benefit. 

How low could Bitcoin go? Sebastian Serrano, the CEO of crypto exchange Ripio, forecasted Bitcoin dropping as low as $53,000 if bearish momentum following a strike were to continue. 

“That said, if Bitcoin holds its ground and fails to move lower despite the macro headwinds, that would actually be a notably strong bullish signal — demonstrating real resilience in the face of risk-off sentiment,” he said.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday struck down President Trump's tariff regime in a 6-3 decision.

"No President has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope," the court ruling said.

"That 'lack of historical precedent,' coupled with the 'breadth of authority' that the President now claims, suggests that the tariffs extend beyond the President's 'legitimate reach.'"

Bitcoin knee-jerked about 2% higher on the news, rising past the $68,000 level. As has been typical in crypto lately, though, the gain was reversed within minutes, returning to just below $67,000 at the current time.

Crypto's fleeting gains stood in contrast to what's appearing more sustainable in stocks, with the Nasdaq rising 0.6% to a session high.

Earlier Friday, a batch of U.S. economic data showed signs of stagflationary impulses. The U.S. economy grew only a modest 1.4% in the final three months of 2025, the Commerce Department reported. Alongside core personal consumer expenditure prices rose 3% year-over-year, faster than the hoped for 2.9% and up from 2.8% previously.

On a yearly basis, the economy grew 2.2%, which is the slowest growth since Covid year 2020.

"Today's economic data delivered a messy message of both hotter than expected inflation, and slower than anticipated growth," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said. "The confusing message from today's data confirms the current Fed bias to take their time with monetary policy."

PALM BEACH, Fla. — Attending World Liberty Financial's forum at Mar-a-Lago felt less like a high-powered summit and more like an intimate gathering — if the guest list included people who control trillions in assets and the future of finance.

Tucked beneath chandeliers and gold-painted trim, the guest list read like a who's who of the industry's old guard and rising disruptors. There were no name tags needed. Everyone seemed to know everyone, or at least know someone who did.

Conversations floated from the future of finance to how it might fix what's been broken in the past — ambitious visions of tokenized assets, regulatory overhauls, and reimagined capital markets. But just as easily, the talk turned to the upcoming FIFA World Cup tournament and press-on nails, courtesy of a few unexpected names who probably had no business being there, and yet somehow made the whole thing feel even more surreal.

The event was not targeted toward an exclusively U.S. audience; attendees hailed from a number of countries. Several attendees flew from Consensus Hong Kong last week directly to Palm Beach to attend the World Liberty Forum. One attendee said they had flown in on Wednesday morning from ETHDenver, and several others said they would be flying to the Colorado conference following the forum.

In any other context, the event would seem to be a typical crypto conference; speakers from traditional financial backgrounds explaining how they're using blockchain or why they're discussing crypto to a dimly lit room. 

However, the backdrop loomed: This was a conference put on by World Liberty Financial, the crypto company launched and owned in part by the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, held at his golf club Mar-a-Lago, with several attendees tied to his business interests. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, in his first U.S. appearance since receiving a pardon from Trump, was spotted at the event. Goldman Sachs' David Solomon joked on stage that he was there because his client had requested his presence.

Many of the panels themselves were high-level; World Liberty Financial co-founder Alex Witkoff asked U.S. Senator Ashley Moody to walk the audience through her background, or Eric Trump and Donald Trump, Jr. reiterating their past grievances with the banks.

"It was forced and maybe opportunistic but we lived a life that opened our eyes to maybe how corrupt the system was … banks [canceled our accounts] for no reason other than my father was wearing a hat that said 'Make America Great Again,'" Eric Trump claimed. "We realized how antiquated finance was, how punitive finance was."

Amid these sessions, some speakers walked through their arguments for the digital assets sector. Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson laid out the rationale for the U.S. dollar remaining the global reserve currency, saying the European Union was too uncoordinated for the euro to take the dollar's place and other currencies just didn't meet the moment.

"About 50% of trade today is done in dollars, another 30% is in the euros, [but] there's no single European debt market. They can't even coordinate around the euro … so that's not going to be the next reserve," she said.

China's renminbi and India's rupee are contenders, but neither is free-floating, and so that makes it unlikely either of those currencies can take on the role, she said.

"As long as people are still looking for their stablecoin to be backed by the most risk-free currency, it's going to be the dollar," she said.

Many of the panels nevertheless only had a passing focus on digital assets themselves. The audience reflected this, with crowds mingling outside the actual room to chat during several panels.

It wouldn't have been a Trump gathering without the biggest real estate moguls in the room — and that's when tokenization (putting assets on blockchain) became a topic. Hotel billionaire Barry Sternlicht, whose Starwood Capital manages over $125 million in assets under management, said the firm was ready to tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, but continues to be unable to do so given the regularity uncertainty.

Similarly, Kevin O'Leary told listeners that sovereign wealth funds, with whom he speaks regularly, won't touch crypto because they're afraid of the regulatory risk that comes with it in the U.S.

From O'Leary to Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to FIFA president Gianni Infantino, if the day's lineup were ranked by celebrity status, the organizers surely saved the best for last — and probably the least relevant.

Nicki Minaj closed out the event as the final panelist, but the first that caused half the room to take out their phones to snap a picture. Her presence may not make sense in the context of finance or crypto specifically — when moderator Alex Bruesewitz informed her that people gathered to talk about a new innovation in finance, she said she “can like it" — but given her recently developed close relationship with President Donald Trump, it wasn't entirely surprising to see her support the family's event.

The World Liberty Forum wasn't just a conference, it was the kind of room where fortunes are steered, not pitched, and where the side chatter was just as telling as the main agenda.

On-chain analytics platform Parsec has shut down after five years of operation, founder Will Sheehan confirmed in a public statement, citing shifting market conditions and changes in on-chain activity.

Describing the closure as “the end of the road for parsec,” Sheehan said the company struggled to stay aligned with how the market evolved. “The market zigged while we zagged a few too many times,” he wrote.

Parsec began in early 2020 as a side project focused on charting Uniswap v1 activity. During DeFi Summer and the broader 2021 market expansion, it developed into a full DeFi analytics terminal. The platform provided customizable dashboards and on-chain data tools used by traders and firms tracking decentralized finance markets.

Sheehan said Parsec's most significant traction came during the 2022 deleveraging cycle. He referenced major events including the collapses of Wonderland, Olympus, Terra, and the 3AC/stETH depeg, noting that firms and traders relied on Parsec to navigate the volatility and liquidation events that followed.

According to Sheehan, decentralized finance activity changed materially after the collapse of FTX. He stated that DeFi spot lending leverage “never really came back in the same way,” adding that on-chain behavior evolved into patterns the team did not fully understand.

While the platform experienced temporary spikes in usage—including dashboards tied to Friendtech and a Polymarket election tracker that drew several hundred thousand visits in a single night—those moments did not translate into sustained product momentum. Sheehan described the increasing ephemerality of crypto trends as a structural challenge.

Reflecting on the company's lifespan, he acknowledged making “about a thousand mistakes” but expressed pride in the team he built. He also reiterated his belief that DeFi can reinvent traditional finance and open opaque legacy systems, a vision he said he continues to hold.

Parsec will not continue operations, but Sheehan said he plans to remain active in the industry through writing and other contributions.

Parsec's focus on DeFi and NFT data tracking came at a time when market activity has evolved from its earlier patterns, with slower growth in these segments and less leverage in key DeFi protocols than in prior cycles. NFT sales volumes fell during 2025 compared with 2024, reflecting cooler market interest in that sector.

Parsec also experimented with artificial-intelligence-powered tools such as Parsec Agent, which used language models to analyze market activity and social sentiment. Despite these efforts, the project has decided to end services and return funds to paying users.

The closure of Parsec arrives amid broader consolidation in the crypto analytics space as some firms struggle to maintain relevance and sustainable business models in a shifting market environment.

France's gambling watchdog is now taking applications from companies that want to offer games with resellable digital content, moving a big legal experiment from law to everyday supervision.

The Autorité nationale des jeux (ANJ) said operators must now submit a prior declaration before making a JONUM game available in France. The JONUM category was created by the SREN law in May 2024 and is running as a three-year trial.

ANJ says declarations must be filed through an online process. Once a submission is complete, the regulator will issue a receipt.

However, ANJ has stressed that the receipt is not a stamp of approval on every detail of an offer. Instead, it confirms the filing has been made and allows the regulator to monitor the game as the experiment progresses.

ANJ also plans to publish a public list of declared JONUM offers, making it easier to see which companies are willing to operate under the new rules.

A JONUM title is an online game that combines a paid stake, an element of chance, and the award of monetisable digital objects that can later be resold, such as NFT-style items or blockchain-linked tokens.

The regime is designed to keep a clear separation from licensed gambling products. JONUM games can involve digital items that may hold value on resale, but they are not meant to operate like cash-prize gambling. The rules also keep minors out of these games.

With the process now live, ANJ has also begun direct engagement with the sector. The regulator held an exchange session for interested Web3 companies on 19 February, giving studios and publishers a first official chance to test their understanding of the requirements and what the regulator expects in a declaration.

London, United Kingdom, 20th February 2026, ZEX PR WIRE, CT3 has announced the launch of the CT3 On-Chain Commerce Ecosystem – a Web3 layer for businesses that enables companies to distribute digital products through NFT access keys backed by decentralized storage.



With this release, CT3 introduces a full-cycle flow for digital commerce: sellers upload a digital product to CT3, receive an NFT “key,” and list it on supported marketplaces. When the NFT is purchased, ownership transfers to the buyer's wallet, and the buyer can instantly access and download the file via CT3. The first marketplace integration has already been successfully launched with OpenSea.

Why it matters

Digital sales are still burdened by payment gateways, chargebacks, manual fulfillment, and fragmented tools. CT3 replaces this complexity with a wallet-first model: purchase → ownership → instant delivery, available globally and 24/7, without the need for traditional storefront infrastructure.

Advantages vs Existing Solutions









About CT3

CT3 is a company that has been operating since 2022 and is developing a decentralized cloud storage solution: you upload a file, it is stored across a distributed network, and access is granted through an NFT key. This approach virtually eliminates the risk of shutdowns, data leaks, and makes cyberattacks significantly harder: data is split into fragments and stored on different nodes, access is controlled cryptographically, and the system does not rely on a single provider- so there is no single point of failure.

At the core of CT3's philosophy are three principles: security, anonymity, and freedom of speech. The company believes that everyone has the right to protect their data, maintain privacy, and express their thoughts freely without fear of censorship or information leaks.

Invitation for sellers to collaborate

CT3 invites sellers of digital products to collaborate – including licenses, subscriptions, tickets, certificates, promo codes, private releases, as well as databases and datasets. Anyone looking for wallet-native distribution with automated delivery and a verifiable usage status can contact CT3 to join the first wave of merchants.

BNP Paribas Asset Management has issued a tokenised share class of French‑domiciled money market fund, recorded on public blockchain infrastructure.

The initiative relies on a permissioned access model on Ethereum, restricting holding and transfers to authorised participants within a regulated framework.

Conducted as an intra‑group experiment, the project leverages the joint expertise of BNP Paribas Asset Management, CIB AssetFoundryTM and BNP Paribas' Securities Services business to test new end‑to‑end fund processes. 

BNP Paribas Asset Management has issued a tokenised share class of an existing French-domiciled money market fund, marking a new step in its exploration of fund tokenisation using public blockchain infrastructure.

The project involved the issuance of a tokenised share class of the BNP Paribas Asset Management money market fund on the public Ethereum network via BNP Paribas' AssetFoundryTM platform. The tokenised shares are issued under a permissioned access model, whereby holdings and transfers are restricted to eligible and authorised participants, in line with applicable regulatory requirements.

This initiative follows BNP Paribas Asset Management's earlier tokenised money market fund issuance in Luxembourg on a private blockchain. This second tokenised money market fund project was implemented using a different technological and operational setup through a public blockchain. Together, these initiatives reflect BNP Paribas' approach to exploring multiple tokenisation and distribution models to better serve the fund managers and their investors.

Leveraging BNP Paribas' cutting edge capabilities across the Group's integrated model

Within this project, BNP Paribas Asset Management acted as the fund issuer. BNP Paribas Securities Services business acted as transfer agent and fund dealing services provider, while BNP Paribas CIB's AssetFoundryTM platform provided the tokenisation and connectivity layer to the public blockchain network. 

Moreover, BNP Paribas' Securities Services business operated the wallet setup and held the private key within the scope of this controlled intra‑group pilot. 

The initiative was conducted as a one‑off, limited intra‑group experiment, enabling BNP Paribas to test new end‑to‑end processes, from issuance and transfer agency to tokenisation and public‑blockchain connectivity, within a controlled and regulated framework.

Public blockchain with permissioned access

The tokenised fund shares were issued on the public Ethereum network with permissioned tokens ensuring that only eligible participants can hold and transfer the tokens, while benefiting from the strength and broad adoption of public blockchain infrastructure.

This approach allows BNP Paribas and BNP Paribas Asset Management to assess, how public blockchains can be integrated into regulated fund structures, while maintaining the highest standards of governance, investor protection, and operational robustness.

Tokenisation is an innovative technology that is being explored across the financial industry for its potential to enhance how investment funds are issued and distributed over time. For money market funds in particular, which play a central role in liquidity management for corporate and institutional investors, tokenisation could be used as an alternative to traditional batch‑based fund processing, including more regular and flexible processing of fund related operations, while preserving the regulated nature of these funds.

“BNP Paribas Asset Management is committed to driving innovation that will ultimately benefits our clients. This second issuance of tokenised money market funds, this time using public blockchain infrastructure, supports our ongoing efforts to explore how tokenisation can contribute to greater operational efficiency and security within a regulated framework.” Edouard Legrand, Chief Digital and Data Officer at BNP Paribas Asset Management

“BNP Paribas' AssetFoundryTM platform delivers key digital-assets capabilities, from tokenisation to network connectivity and wallet-related functionalities within a controlled setup. This initiative allows us to better understand the operational and governance implications of tokenisation for money market funds.” Julien Clausse, Head of AssetFoundryTM (Digital Assets & Tokenisation) at BNP Paribas CIB

“BNP Paribas' Securities Services business transforms innovation into tangible value for our clients. By acting as transfer agent and leveraging the Group's tokenisation infrastructure, we deliver a streamlined and secure operational setup that supports fund processes enabled by public blockchain infrastructure, within a regulated and permissioned context.” Paul Daly, Head of Distribution Product Solutions at BNP Paribas' Securities Services business

Altcoin breadth on Binance has deteriorated sharply, with a large majority of tokens now trading below a widely watched long-term trend level, an exhaustion signal that CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost frames as a liquidity problem as much as a price problem.

In a post on X, Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) shared a CryptoQuant chart tracking the share of Binance-listed altcoins trading below their 50-week moving average alongside Bitcoin's price. His headline claim: “LIQUIDITY CRUNCH PUSHES 83% OF ALTCOINS INTO BEAR TREND,” arguing that most investors exposed to non-Bitcoin, non-stablecoin assets are “now in significant difficulty,” particularly those still holding positions.

Altcoin Breadth Breaks Down On Binance

Darkfost's chart, titled “Altcoins performance (Binance)”, shows the percentage of altcoins below the 50-week moving average rising back into historically stressed territory. In his latest read, 83% of Binance altcoins are below that threshold, a sign that weakness is not isolated to a handful of names but spread across the tape.

He also pointed to an even more extreme episode earlier this month. “Since the end of the bear market in 2023, a new record was set on February 7, with more than 92% of altcoins on Binance trading below this key technical support,” he wrote, describing it as a post-2023-cycle high in downside participation.

That stands in stark contrast to the conditions seen during earlier upside phases. Darkfost noted that in March 2024 only 6% of Binance altcoins traded below the 50-week line, and in December 2024 the figure was 7%. Outside of those multi-month windows, he added, at least half of altcoins remained under the threshold, behavior he characterized as meaningfully different from the prior cycle's breadth dynamics.

Darkfost framed the altcoin drawdown as inseparable from Bitcoin's trend and the macro backdrop, suggesting that the market's risk budget has tightened while altcoin supply has expanded.

“The market continues to be driven by BTC's movements, which has been in a downtrend since October 2025 following an ATH at $126,000. At present, BTC's momentum remains highly uncertain, with price still hovering at roughly 46% of its all time high. Rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between the US and Iran, alongside increasingly hawkish projections and tone from the Fed expressed in the latest FOMC minutes, are making the current environment especially challenging for highly volatile assets such as altcoins,” he wrote.

The chart itself marks BTC near the mid-$60,000 range, underscoring his broader point: in a regime where Bitcoin direction is unclear and macro inputs are hostile to duration and volatility, breadth in higher-beta tokens can deteriorate quickly and then stay impaired.

Why The 50-Week Line Matters

Darkfost emphasized the 50-week moving average as a long-horizon filter used by market participants to separate corrective phases from structurally constructive ones. When a majority of tokens sit below it, rallies tend to be narrower, selection pressure rises, and “alt season” narratives become harder to sustain without a decisive shift in liquidity conditions.

He attributed the current setup to “the increase in altcoin supply across the broader crypto market combined with still constrained liquidity conditions,” a combination that can mechanically dilute marginal flows. In that environment, he argued, outperforming becomes less about broad beta exposure and more about understanding how market structure has changed.

At press time, the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin stood at $943.46 billion.

Value and utility are two very different things in the investment world.

For more than a century, no asset class has been able to hold a candle to the stock market in terms of annualized return. Despite its volatility, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC +0.42%) has significantly outperformed commodities, real estate, and bonds over the very long term.

But over the last decade, cryptocurrencies have absolutely crushed the S&P 500 in the return column, with Bitcoin (BTC +1.86%), the world's largest digital currency, leading the way. Over the last 15 years, Bitcoin has catapulted from around $1 per token to approximately $68,500, as of this writing in the late evening of Feb. 15.

There's arguably no asset or investment on the planet that incites more polarizing discussions from professional and everyday investors than Bitcoin. But there's a problem with these debates: they often conflate value and utility. As you're about to see, value and utility are two very different things in the investment world -- especially in the cryptocurrency arena.

In its simplest form, value is determined by the amount investors are willing to pay for an asset. If someone is willing to purchase Bitcoin for $68,500, this very clearly demonstrates the token has value (at least at that specific moment in time).

Whereas value in the stock market is determined by a combination of operating fundamentals and investor perceptions, value for digital currencies is almost solely reliant on perceptions. Without income statements and balance sheets to pore over, emotions tend to rule the roost with Bitcoin and the laundry list of important altcoins.

Bitcoin's stratospheric rise can effectively be boiled down to a handful of investor perceptions.

Firstly, it's one of a relatively small number of digital currencies with a fixed or limited supply. When all Bitcoin are eventually mined, there will be just 21 million tokens in circulation. Just as product scarcity allows businesses to increase their prices when demand is high, the value of Bitcoin has risen due to the perception that it's scarce.

This scarcity also plays a key role in the belief that Bitcoin is an inflationary hedge. With few exceptions, U.S. M2 money supply continues to expand. As the value of fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, is eaten away by inflation over time, a fixed-supply token like Bitcoin is seen as a smart hedge against inflation.

Furthermore, there's the expectation that Bitcoin's blockchain network will become an increasingly utilized peer-to-peer payment platform that operates without the need for centralized financial institutions. For example, the average number of Bitcoin transactions per day has climbed from 200,000 to 300,000 in 2022 to between 400,000 and 600,000 over the last six months. 

Based on these perceptions, Bitcoin has value.

However, Bitcoin having value in no way proves that it offers real-world utility.

On Wall Street, there are plenty of examples of companies with sizable market caps that technically offer no utility. Purely clinical-stage drug developers can potentially sport billion-dollar market caps based on the perception of what one or more of their experimental therapies can do for patients. But until these companies have an approved therapy, they lack utility. If clinical-stage drug developers fail to produce an approved drug, their shares (and market cap) ultimately pay the price.

The perception of value has never been in question with Bitcoin. It has an ardent online following, with some Wall Street analysts and pundits (e.g., Cathie Wood and Tom Lee) also coming to its defense. But Bitcoin fails the utility test.

Although Bitcoin is perceived as scarce, its supply is limited only by lines of computer code that can be changed with developer consensus. Although consensus is highly unlikely, it isn't 0%. In comparison, precious metals like gold and silver are truly finite resources that can't be produced out of thin air. Though we're still in the process of recovering these metals from deep in the Earth, we can't create additional gold or silver beyond what's already present on the planet.

Bitcoin's payment network also lacks a competitive edge. While it's still riding its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin's blockchain network costs in the neighborhood of $0.30 per transaction and, depending on the size of the payment, can take anywhere from 10 minutes to one hour to validate and settle. Comparatively, payment-facilitating coins like XRP and Stellar sport transaction costs that are a tiny fraction of a penny, and they typically settle on their respective blockchain networks in five seconds or less. The point being that several other blockchain projects can run circles around Bitcoin's network where it counts.

We've also witnessed Bitcoin fail the real-world utility test in El Salvador. The Salvadoran government legalized Bitcoin as a form of tender in September 2021, aiming to have its citizens use the token for everyday transactions. Ultimately, data from 2024 showed that roughly eight out of 10 El Salvadorians didn't use Bitcoin. While El Salvador's government continues to hold the world's largest digital currency as a reserve asset, Bitcoin has failed as a medium of exchange.

Given what history tells us, Bitcoin's very limited utility should eventually weigh on its value -- though there's no blueprint or precise timeline for when this might happen.

Does Bitcoin have value? Yes, thanks to investors' perception. But does the world need Bitcoin? Based on the data we have, no, it doesn't.

Few business topics are garnering more coverage than Michael Saylor's unconventional strategy at Strategy, the software purveyor turned Bitcoin treasury outfit he still controls as top shareholder and executive chairman (the firm was formerly known as MicroStrategy). But one big shift has gone almost entirely unnoticed: As Bitcoin prices plunged, Saylor has attempted to remediate the situation by unleashing a torrent of new shares, at a scale never before witnessed at a big market-cap U.S. company. This immense dilution is keeping his Bitcoin stash growing as a point of pride—but dragging shareholders into dangerous territory.

Let's examine the specifics. At the close of Q2 2020, shortly before Saylor started buying Bitcoin, Strategy had 76 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding (it also has Class B shares harboring extra voting rights that are mostly owned by Saylor; I'll focus on Class A shares since they account for all the issuance over the past six years). As of Feb. 12, the number stood at 314 million. That's an increase of 4.13x or 313%. For all of the several hundred U.S. companies that today are valued at over $10 billion, the one ranking closest to Strategy over the same span was home furnishings and decor seller Wayfair at a 30% dilution, one-tenth the Saylor number. In third place is software provider Twilio at 27%.

Strategy pioneered a model based on constantly increasing the amount of Bitcoin its investors own per share, or its key metric of BPS (Bitcoin per share). Until this year, when it also moved into preferred stock in a big way, Strategy relied mostly on raising funds from equity offerings to amass the signature virtual currency. The process amounted to a kind of magical arbitrage: Strategy's stock price kept increasing much faster than the price of Bitcoin. So by selling shares at what now look like highly inflated prices and buying ever more coins, Saylor could keep hiking the count every shareholder effectively “owned.”

Here's an example. From the end of 2023 until mid-July of last year, Strategy shares jumped more than sevenfold, three times the Bitcoin climb of 2.8 times. At the start of the period, Saylor could buy about 1.5 Bitcoin by selling 1,000 shares. But by the time Strategy's market cap reached its summit just after Independence Day last year, it could purchase 3.8 tokens, or 150% more, selling the same amount of stock. For a while, Saylor ran what was essentially an “accretion” machine. It bore some resemblance to a scenario in which a financial engineer deploys a highly overvalued stock to keep issuing shares as a “currency” for making multiple acquisitions that raise its earnings per share.

And for a long time, it worked. When Strategy's shares peaked in the summer of 2025, the accretion-via-dilution approach had raised the coins held for each 1,000 shares from that 1.5 at the end of 2023, to 2.12, a rise of 41%. Well past midyear, Saylor kept cranking on stock sales despite the worsening math. The investor presentation for Q4 boasts that Strategy towered as the “biggest raiser of common equity” in the U.S. for 2025, selling shares worth $16.5 billion to capture 6% of the total.

Then the wheels came off. Since the apex, Strategy shares have fallen 72% from $457 to $130, far faster than Bitcoin's 51% tumble from $129 to $68 (as of Feb. 17). As a result, the accretion game no longer worked. Every time Saylor sells stock to buy Bitcoin now, instead of sweetening the mix, he's watering it down. The vaunted BPS ratio funded by equity keeps dropping.

Still, Saylor's not abandoning his holy grail. The investor presentation trumpeted: “Our business objective is increasing Bitcoin per share.” Why didn't all the shares Saylor kept selling as his stock price tanked lead to a big dilution in BPS? He offset that drag by reverting to a different and dangerous scheme: issuing tons of preferred stock. The investor presentation boasts that Strategy also reigned as America's largest issuer of preferreds last year, collecting an additional $7 billion from the offerings or one-third of every dollar Wall Street raised. The huge influx of cash from preferreds has enabled Saylor to keep BPS more or less constant. Were he to keep selling stock as his prime funding method instead, he'd be transforming Strategy into a dilution machine, just the opposite of what he wants. Hence the lurching shift in financing.

The problem Saylor faces: He can no longer count on a soaring stock to keep the train rolling. Even before Strategy went big on preferreds, it had accumulated a large pile of debt that now stands at $8.2 billion. The preferred stock is paying junk rates at an average of over 10%, costing the company $888 million a year in dividends. Plus, Strategy will need to refinance $6 billion in debt in 2028, and guess how Saylor plans to do it? By issuing more shares in a campaign to “equitize” the borrowings.

But unless the stock soars again, the “equitizing” formula will keep undermining Saylor's cherished, and heavily touted, goal. Plus, the heavy debt load and the big payments for the preferred stock have rendered Strategy an extremely risky company. It's already proved a lousy investment in the past two years, dropping by 30%.

Big dilution's got a bad name. The major tech players from Apple to Microsoft consider it a matter of pride to keep shrinking their share counts. Michael Saylor took the opposite tack on steroids. Now, Saylor's stuck. He can only pursue his vaunted game plan by taking on huge dividend payments that he's paying from shrinking reserves since Strategy generates no cash. The more Bitcoin's price drops, the more it looks like Saylor divided those holdings among too many shares. His investors are lately paying the price for financing that Saylor claimed was supercheap and now looks extremely expensive.

The crypto analytics sector is losing another player as Parsec, an on-chain data platform founded during the last major bull cycle, announced it is shutting down after five years. The company's closure reflects deeper changes across decentralised finance and NFT markets, where trading activity and leverage have declined from earlier peaks. As crypto markets mature, analytics firms built around earlier trading patterns are finding it harder to remain relevant. Parsec's shutdown also comes amid falling Bitcoin prices, declining NFT sales, and broader signs of weakening participation across key parts of the crypto ecosystem. https://twitter.com/parsec_finance/status/2024519983330468049?s=20 Strategy fell behind market shift Parsec confirmed its closure in a post on X on Thursday, stating that it is shutting down after years of tracking…

Real-time market monitoring

SINGAPORE, Feb 20, 2026, 14:38 SGT

On Friday, Ether changed hands at $1,955.79, slipping 0.73% in the previous 24 hours. About $18.0 billion worth of Ether was traded, according to data from CoinMarketCap. (CoinMarketCap)

Ethereum's narrative is once again in flux. This round, some investors are pointing to “utility” NFTs—think ticketing or licensing projects—as the main driver, instead of yet another hype cycle. Meyka, in a Feb. 19 note to UK clients, pegged ether at $1,963.24, down 1.39% for the day, highlighting that the relative strength index (RSI) was sitting close to 30, a mark plenty of traders see as oversold territory. The note also pointed to a wave of enterprise-grade NFT platforms now touting features like custody, fiat rails, KYC requirements and even dispute resolution. Meanwhile, project teams keep diversifying: Ethereum, layer-2 rollups, and competitors like Solana are all in play as efforts to shave down costs and hunt liquidity ramp up. (Meyka)

The back-and-forth spilled into Polymarket, with users putting down $1.17 million on a bet about ether's price at noon ET on Feb. 19. The contract referenced Binance's one-minute ETH/USDT close, according to the platform's own rules. In the end, the market paid out “yes” for ether above $1,500 and $1,900, but not for levels above $2,000. (Polymarket)

Prediction markets are now facing criticism of their own. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin—who was among the early backers of Polymarket—flagged concerns on X, cautioning that the space could slide into “corposlop” fixated on “low-value gambling.” He specifically pointed to short-term bets on crypto prices, according to Business Insider. (Business Insider)

Macro risks are still front and center for major tokens. “No major catalyst looks set to push [cryptocurrencies] higher,” said Gerry O'Shea, head of market insights at Hashdex, in comments to Barron's, highlighting lingering uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy and the broader economy. Bitcoin hovered around $67,088 as late U.S. trading wound down Thursday; ether edged up about 0.3%, per Dow Jones Market Data referenced by Barron's. (Barron's)

Utility isn't just about NFTs, and plenty of it flies under the radar. Meyka, in a Feb. 11 note, highlighted things like enterprise pilots for luxury authentication, tokenized loyalty programs—think loyalty points as tokens—and Scope 3 emissions reporting, which tracks indirect emissions across a company's value chain. According to the note, these applications generate steady, smaller on-chain transactions, which help drive both base fees and validator income—the payouts for network operators. (Meyka)

Ethereum keeps it simple: each transaction comes with a gas fee, usually settled in ether. Should transactions with steeper fees pick up and remain, validators pocket more, potentially lifting demand for the token that covers those costs.

The key question: which network gets the action. Layer-2s bundle up transactions, return them to Ethereum, which keeps user fees down. Solana, with its lower costs, is pushing to capture the rapid-fire, smaller trades—exactly the kind of volume that first gave NFTs their buzz.

The center of gravity doesn't always stay put. Should “utility” end up as just another marketing tagline and liquidity start drying up, bids might vanish, price floors could plunge, and wash trading—fake deals that puff up volume—can scramble key trading signals.

The crypto market continues to face notable selling pressure, with several leading altcoins struggling to regain upward momentum after months of volatility. Sentiment remains fragile as investors weigh macro uncertainty, liquidity conditions, and the lack of sustained bullish catalysts. While periodic rebounds have emerged, most altcoins remain well below previous cycle highs, reinforcing a cautious environment across the broader market.

A recent CryptoQuant report provides additional perspective on this dynamic. According to the analysis, retail investors appear to be under persistent pressure to sell altcoins, particularly as price weakness and negative sentiment dominate headlines. At the same time, the data suggests a more complex underlying picture. Despite ongoing pressure, certain segments of the market are forming notable buying walls, indicating that demand has not disappeared entirely.

Trading volume across altcoins has risen significantly since Ethereum established its recent bottom, reaching levels that are difficult to compare directly with the previous cycle. This increase in activity, even while prices remain depressed, may reflect repositioning rather than pure capitulation. Importantly, most altcoins have yet to stage meaningful recoveries, suggesting that current participation could represent accumulation, speculative positioning, or a mix of both as the market searches for direction.

The CryptoQuant analysis indicates that much of the current altcoin selling pressure is being driven by retail participants reacting defensively to volatility and prolonged drawdowns. Fear-driven liquidations often emerge during uncertain phases, particularly when liquidity tightens, and price recovery lacks momentum. This behavior tends to amplify short-term weakness, especially across mid- and lower-cap crypto assets.

However, the same data suggests that a portion of this selling volume is being systematically absorbed by larger or more patient market participants. This absorption dynamic typically reflects positioning rather than speculation, as buyers accumulate exposure while sentiment remains fragile. Historically, such phases have preceded structural market transitions, although timing remains uncertain and outcomes are not guaranteed.

Some analysts argue that the current cycle may be characterized by unusually strong preparatory accumulation compared with previous market phases. Elevated spot volumes alongside persistent volatility suggest capital rotation rather than outright market exit in certain segments.

That said, projections about a future altcoin bull phase being significantly stronger than the previous cycle remain speculative. Market structure, macro liquidity conditions, regulatory developments, and Bitcoin dominance will all influence whether such expectations materialize. The data primarily supports a market undergoing redistribution rather than a confirmed bullish reversal.

The total crypto market capitalization excluding the top ten assets continues to show persistent weakness, reinforcing the view that the broader altcoin sector remains under structural pressure. The chart reflects a clear failure to sustain momentum following the mid-2025 rally, with capitalization steadily declining since the last major peak. Recent price action shows the market hovering near roughly $170B, significantly below previous highs and still trending downward.

Technically, the structure appears fragile. Price has moved below the shorter-term moving averages and is testing longer-term support zones. The inability to reclaim these averages suggests declining momentum rather than a consolidation phase. Volume spikes accompanying downward moves also indicate that selling activity remains dominant, not merely passive drift.

Historically, similar configurations have occurred during late corrective phases when capital rotates back toward Bitcoin and larger-cap assets. This typically reflects risk reduction rather than outright market exit, but it nonetheless suppresses altcoin performance for extended periods.

Importantly, the absence of strong recovery attempts suggests liquidity constraints remain a key factor. Unless broader market sentiment improves or Bitcoin stabilizes convincingly, the altcoin segment may continue to face headwinds. At present, the data support ongoing redistribution rather than a confirmed cyclical bottom for the broader altcoin market.

The kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie – the mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie – is the latest in a string of crimes in which ransoms have reportedly been demanded in Bitcoin.

The 84-year-old was taken from her home in Tucson, Arizona, in the middle of the night on January 31. A ransom of US$6 million (£4.4 million) has been demanded by the kidnappers.

Now, renewed movement in the Bitcoin wallet linked to the case has intensified scrutiny – and raised a critical question: although Bitcoin is not inherently untraceable, can perpetrators ultimately profit without being identified?

Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency often described as anonymous and private. That perception has made it attractive to criminals who believe it offers a convenient way to receive, transfer and store funds beyond the reach of authorities. But experts say that belief is dangerously outdated.

"When a wallet like this moves, it is never just a transaction. It is a signal," says Bezalel Eithan Raviv, CEO of Lionsgate Network, a crypto-forensics and recovery firm.

"In some cases, it is operational, testing access, moving funds, trying to stay ahead. In others, it is noise, designed to confuse investigators and the public. But here is the reality we see every day. Criminals move. The blockchain remembers."

According to Bezalel, every transaction creates a permanent data point. "Every movement creates a new data point, a new lead, a new opportunity to follow the money. In many cases, movement happens because pressure is building."

But one of the most persistent myths surrounding Bitcoin is that it is anonymous. "There is a dangerous misconception that Bitcoin is anonymous. It is not," Bezalel says. "Bitcoin is one of the most transparent financial systems ever created. Every transaction is recorded permanently. No one can edit a transaction after the fact."

He argues that in high-profile cases especially, criminals may be underestimating the scrutiny that follows public exposure.

"In many cases, yes," he says, when asked whether offenders misjudge blockchain transparency. "Criminals still believe Bitcoin gives them protection. In reality, it often does the opposite, especially in high-profile cases.

"The moment a case becomes public, the ecosystem activates. Exchanges monitor, analysts track, investigators collaborate."

Unlike physical cash, cryptocurrency must eventually be converted into usable money. "Crypto is digital value. You cannot directly consume it," Bezalel explains. "To use it in the real world, criminals need someone willing to convert it into fiat currency, usually through a centralized exchange. That is where intervention becomes possible."

When funds reach regulated services, he says, "blockchain transparency becomes a bridge to real world identity." Modern investigations combine blockchain analysis with traditional detective work.

"We map transaction patterns, identify clusters of wallets, track interactions across chains, and correlate activity with services such as exchanges and payment processors," Bezalel says. "But the real breakthrough happens at the intersection of blockchain data and human behavior."

Speed varies. "Sometimes attribution happens quickly when funds reach a known entity. In other cases, it takes time. But one thing remains constant. The data does not disappear. The trail remains, waiting to be connected."

As for whether renewed wallet activity signals investigative progress or misdirection, Bezalel says it can be both. "Movement creates exposure. Exposure creates opportunity. And often, it is in these moments that mistakes are made and cases move forward."

For victims and families watching closely, the distinction matters. While Bitcoin's association with extortion and ransomware has fuelled fear that funds simply vanish into the digital ether, specialists insist that narrative is incomplete.

"Crypto is traceable. And it is recoverable," Bezalel says. In a case as high profile and emotionally charged as the alleged kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, every transaction will now be examined not just as a payment attempt – but as a potential clue.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Just when experts thought they knew every moai on Rapa Nui, otherwise known as Easter Island, a dried-up lakebed kept them on their toes. These statues—largely made of a stone formed from volcanic ash and dust called tuff—pepper the island, with more than 1,000 already found and logged. 

Finding a new one came as a surprise. And a bit of a mystery.

“We think we know all the moai, but then a new one turns up, a new discovery, and in this case, in the lake, at the statue quarry,” Terry Hunt, professor of archeology at the University of Arizona, told Good Morning America. “There have been no moai found in the dry bed or in what was previously a lake, so this is a first.”

And it may not be the last. 

As the area undergoes drying, the lakebed in question has given up its moai. And this opportunity may occur again. “Under the dry conditions that we have now, we may find more,” Hunt said. “They've been hidden by the tall reeds that grow in the lakebed and prospecting with something that can detect what's under the ground surface may tell us that there are in fact more moai in the lakebed sediments. When there's one moai in the lake, there's probably more.”

The newly discovered moai is also one of the smallest found, leading experts to believe that hidden within these reeds is the potential for a bounty of new moai. 

Created by the Rapu Nui people, moai have a mythical legend attached to them and have gained worldwide renown for their appearances. Some believe these moai were given special powers to walk across land and end up in their resting place. Whether or not the legend has legs, there are many theories regarding how these statues moved from building sites to various locations. 

While the largest of the statues weighs 86 tons and rises 32 feet tall, most of the moai average about half that size. About 95 percent are carved from the volcanic tuff, but a few are made from basalt. Each one is unique, created by carvers to represent the characteristics of the person it resembled, often a chieftain or key leader. 

The finishing touch on moai was the inclusion of special stones for the eyes, not carved or placed  until the statue found its home. 

Even though experts thought they knew the locations of all of these moai homes, finding this new, small one in the lakebed proves some had remained a complete mystery.

“It's here in the lake and nobody knows this exists,” Salvador Atan Hito, vice president of Ma'u Henua, the group that oversees the island's national park, told Good Morning America, “even the ancestors, our grandparents don't know [about] that one.”

Researchers at UC San Francisco have identified a biological process that may explain why exercise sharpens thinking and memory. Their findings suggest that physical activity strengthens the brain's built in defense system, helping protect it from age related damage.

As people grow older, the blood-brain barrier becomes more fragile. This tightly packed network of blood vessels normally shields the brain from harmful substances circulating in the bloodstream. Over time, however, it can become leaky, allowing damaging compounds to enter brain tissue. The result is inflammation, which is linked to cognitive decline and is commonly seen in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

Several years ago, the research team discovered that exercising mice produced higher levels of an enzyme called GPLD1 in their livers. GPLD1 appeared to rejuvenate the brain, but there was a mystery. The enzyme itself cannot cross into the brain, leaving scientists unsure how it delivered its cognitive benefits.

The new research provides an answer.

How GPLD1 Reduces Brain Inflammation

The scientists found that GPLD1 influences another protein known as TNAP. As mice age, TNAP builds up in the cells that form the blood-brain barrier. This buildup weakens the barrier and increases leakiness. When mice exercise, their livers release GPLD1 into the bloodstream. The enzyme travels to the blood vessels surrounding the brain and removes TNAP from the surface of those cells, helping restore the barrier's integrity.

"This discovery shows just how relevant the body is for understanding how the brain declines with age," said Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute.

Villeda is the senior author of the paper, which was published in the journal Cell on Feb. 18.

Pinpointing TNAP's Role in Cognitive Decline

To determine how GPLD1 exerts its effects, the team focused on what the enzyme does best. GPLD1 cuts specific proteins from the surface of cells. Researchers searched for tissues containing proteins that could serve as targets and suspected that some of these proteins might accumulate with age.

Cells in the blood-brain barrier stood out because they carried several possible GPLD1 targets. When the scientists tested these proteins in the lab, only one was trimmed by GPLD1: TNAP.

Further experiments confirmed TNAP's importance. Young mice genetically modified to produce excess TNAP in the blood-brain barrier showed memory and cognitive problems similar to those seen in older animals.

When researchers reduced TNAP levels in 2-year-old mice -- which are the equivalent of 70 human years -- the blood-brain barrier became less permeable, inflammation decreased, and the animals performed better on memory tests.

"We were able to tap into this mechanism late in life, for the mice, and it still worked," said Gregor Bieri, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in Villeda's lab and co-first author of the study.

Implications for Alzheimer's and Brain Aging

The findings suggest that developing medications capable of trimming proteins such as TNAP could offer a new strategy to restore the blood brain barrier, even after it has been weakened by aging.

"We're uncovering biology that Alzheimer's research has largely overlooked," Villeda said. "It may open new therapeutic possibilities beyond the traditional strategies that focus almost exclusively on the brain."

Dated to the ninth century C.E., a time when the Vikings ruled the area, the grave held the remains of at least 10 different young men.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

 A team of University of Cambridge students made a giant discovery during a training dig just three miles outside of the city, both figuratively and literally. The dig seemed unpromising at first, but that changed with the discovery of a ninth-century C.E. group burial.

Based on the number of skulls found among the remains, the archaeology team concluded that burial pit in Wandlebury contained the bodies of at least 10 individuals. The most remarkable individual discovered in the pit was a man whose height, at 6 feet 5 inches, was so far above average for his time that he would have been considered a giant. Adding to the intrigue, the giant had a hole surgically bored into his skull. 

“Before we uncovered the first remains, our best find was a 1960s Smarties lid,” said archaeology undergraduate student Olivia Courtney in a statement. “I had never encountered human remains on a dig, and I was struck by how close yet distant these people felt. We were separated by only a few years in age, but over a thousand years in time.” 

The spot on the outskirts of Cambridge was once a frontier war zone during the conflict between the Saxon-run kingdom of Mercia, which controlled the area in the late eighth century under King Offa, and the neighboring kingdom of East Anglia. Around 874, the Viking Great Army sacked the town, and Cambridgeshire was subsequently incorporated into a Viking-ruled kingdom of East Anglia.

The burial pit was probably a result of that conflict, given that all the remains in it were those of young men. The mass grave was a mix of complete and dismembered remains, ranging from skulls without clear accompanying bodies, a stack of legs, and four complete skeletons. Some of the remains were even found in positions suggesting that they had been tied together. Experts believe the young men were tossed into the pit without ceremony, likely after a battle or a mass execution. 

The “giant” was between the age of 17 and 24, face down in the pit. With the average male standing only 5-foot, 6-inches tall in that day, the man would have been considered wildly abnormal. A one-inch-diameter hole in his skull points to a trepanation procedure, which was believed at the time to relieve migraines and seizures.

“The individual may have had a tumor that affected their pituitary gland and caused an excess of growth hormones,” Trish Biers, curator of the Duckworth Collections at the university, said in a statement. “We can see this in the unique characteristics in the long shafts of their limb bones and elsewhere on the skeleton. Such a condition in the brain would have led to increased pressure in the skull, causing headaches that the trepanning may have been an attempt to alleviate. Not uncommon with head trauma today.”

Some of the men had traces of combat injuries, including one who had chop marks on his jaw, indicating that he was beheaded. The way that parts were tossed haphazardly into the pit, including ribs, a pelvis, and legs stacked together on top of corpses, suggested that the burial followed some sort of mass execution.

“Those buried could have been recipients of corporal punishment, and that may be connected to Wandlebury as a sacred or well-known meeting place,” said the university's Oscar Aldred. “It may be that some of the disarticulated body parts had previously been displayed as trophies and were then gathered up and interred with the executed or otherwise slaughtered individuals.”

However, apart from signs of beheading, there isn't much evidence that the body parts were chopped up. Aldred therefore concluded that they may have been “literally falling apart” from decomposition when they went into the pit. “Cambridgeshire was a frontier zone between Mercia and East Anglia, and the continual wars between Saxons and Vikings as they clashed over territory across many decades,” Aldred said. “We suspect the pit may relate to these conflicts.” 

Radiocarbon dating links the bones to the ninth century, but no additional artifacts were found in the pit to help narrow down the date range. Historic England plans to commission a new geophysical survey of the area to learn more about the burial. A Cambridge team will go to work on bone analysis, including ancient DNA and isotopic work, to investigate health, kinship, and ancestral links. The team may also attempt “refitting” to see if they can piece the remains back together to get a more accurate count of buried individuals. 

“I would never have expected to find something like this on a student training dig,” said Grace Grandfield, a Cambridge undergraduate, of the literally giant discovery. “It was a shocking contrast to the peaceful site of Wandlebury.”

Military budgets are growing, especially in larger economies. In 2024, global military spending totalled U$2.7 trillion1, a 9.4% increase in real terms over the previous year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a think tank specializing in conflict, peace and weapons. Just two countries, China and the United States, accounted for almost half of the total. 

At their two-day summit in June 2025, all but one of the 32 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries agreed to spend 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence and security by 2035, in response to “profound security threats and challenges” — chiefly perceived threats from Russia and from terrorism. If achieved, this would be an enormous escalation in spending. UK military expenditure of 5% of GDP would amount to half of what the country spends on its National Health Service2 (NHS). 

But nations have considerable leeway to decide what falls under this umbrella, which can include research and development (R&D) funding. Spain, for example, which opted out of the 5% target, has called for a broader view of defence spending, to encompass areas such as quantum computing.

What impact, if any, will defence-spending pledges have on research budgets? Some scholars who work on science funding, defence and peace, such as Lucy Suchman, a technology-focused sociologist at Lancaster University, UK, say that certain scientific fields could benefit (such as artificial intelligence) but others lose out (such as climate science) as funding priorities shift increasingly towards militarization. 

One study of 183 countries between 1989 and 2022 found that higher defence spending was associated with fewer trademark applications and fewer people working on R&D3. In many countries, increased government spending on defence exists alongside lowered spending on other research. In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, public R&D spending on health declined by 11.5% from 2020 to 2024, while spending on defence R&D rose by 17%4. Government spending in the OECD on ‘general advancement of knowledge' has also started to decline. 

Nature's careers team spoke to more than ten researchers working on science, peace and defence. They highlighted five interrelated themes that demonstrate changes to science — and to the careers researchers might expect to have — that could ensue in a more militarized world.

Evidence suggests that admitting more international graduate students leads to economic benefits, yet Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia are among those countries making it harder for international students to secure visas. China and the United States generate more influential research when they collaborate than when they do not, yet this collaboration is declining5. Overall, immigration controls, data-access restrictions and a focus on security are creating a more restricted environment for science.

On the basis of current trends, science is likely to become more constrained by ideas of national self-interest and scientific self-sufficiency, against a backdrop of increased military spending. “There's been a rise of nationalism, and scientific cooperation has been influenced by that,” says Caroline Wagner, a public-policy researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus. 

Nevia Vera, an international-relations researcher at the National University of the Center of Buenos Aires Province in Tandil, Argentina, dates this trend to 2018, when the United States launched its China Initiative to counter potential espionage in US laboratories and businesses. That year, China surpassed the United States as the largest source of peer-reviewed articles5, and publications authored jointly by Chinese and US authors started to decline from a peak of 16% of the total number from both countries. Sino–US co-authored papers in the main Web of Science databases dropped by more than 10% between 2018 and 2024, according to Li Tang, a science-policy researcher at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. 

But the collaborations haven't ended entirely, which echoes previous ups and downs in international research. In 1984, Bill Foster started working as a physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, Illinois. Even during the cold war, Foster says, there were Russian physicists working well alongside US ones — even though “you always knew that there was a KGB person”, he adds. “You could tell: he was the guy … who didn't really know the physics.”

Foster was elected to the US House of Representatives as a Democrat in 2013 and has co-sponsored a bipartisan bill in Congress that would allow some Russians working in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to gain permanent residence in the United States. He argues that this “will simultaneously kick the legs out from under Russian President Vladimir Putin's war effort — to lose some of the best and brightest” Russians — and “do something that will be of permanent value to the United States”.

The future of research collaborations involving Russia

Sylvia Schwaag Serger, an economic historian at Lund University in Sweden, thinks that it would take years, if not decades, to reverse the overall decline in international research collaborations. But she also speculates that international research career moves could lose some of their lustre in the longer term. “Whereas before, international experience often was generally considered positive,” she notices that in some countries, “researchers are reconsidering whether it's actually helping their career”, she says.

Although overall collaboration between scientists of different nations might decrease, some expect this to be more of a splintering effect, with researchers collaborating increasingly within regional blocs or geopolitical alliances. There is already growing collaboration in Europe, in Asia and among OECD countries, according to Schwaag Serger.

For instance, while their country's relationship with the United States has cooled in the past few years, Chinese researchers have increased their collaborations with colleagues in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

But overall, Tang emphasizes, “the decreasing collaboration between scientists in China and the US is not being compensated for by increased collaboration between China and other countries, such as India and Russia”. 

Most countries have limited scope to manoeuvre around the big military spenders (the biggest spenders among which are the United States, China, Russia, Germany and India1). Vera calls these countries' influence “the trends of great powers”. Although the geopolitical situation is more complex now than during the cold war, scientists in many nations could again feel pressed to align with one set of countries or another.

Also widening is the technology gap between countries. A report by United Nations secretary-general António Guterres details how the R&D benefits of military spending tend to pool in a few countries6, disadvantaging low-income nations where the military spends little on R&D. “Technology advances so quickly that countries cannot catch up” to scientific superpowers such as the United States, the European Union and China, Vera thinks. Some AI researchers have warned that this type of technological–military competition could spill over into conflict7.

Although the United States and China will remain interested in parts of Latin America and Africa for minerals crucial to technological transition and rearmament, Vera worries about these relationships being extractive rather than genuine partnerships. The United States has embraced a transactional approach to security assistance, for instance, by supporting peace and security efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in exchange for influence over mineral resources.

We all know ice is slippery. The physics behind it is more complex than you'd think

The reason we slip and slide on ice—a phenomenon central to figure skating, curling and other Winter Olympic events—is a centuries-old physics mystery that may have finally been cracked

[CLIP:NBC Olympics commentator Sloane Martin discusses a mixed doubles curling competition on February 6: “Welcome inside the Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium. The U.S. mixed curling duo of Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse faces Team Canada in a matchup of unbeaten teams.”]

Pierre-Louis: And watching the Olympics I started to realize that if you really think about it, so many of the Winter Olympic sports are just about controlled slipping on ice, like bobsledding, the luge, curling. And yet scientists still don't really know why ice is slippery.

Sure, they have theories, like the pressure that we put on the ice maybe melts the ice, creating a thin watery layer. But scientists mostly agree that those theories aren't the full picture. The slipperiness of ice is actually still a mystery.

Paulina Rowińska: It's such a simple question that should have been answered centuries ago. But turns out all the stuff we learned in school, it's not fully correct, like with many, many other things.

Pierre-Louis: So today we're going to try to get some answers.

[CLIP: Theme music]

Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

There are at least three long-standing scientific theories that try to explain what makes ice slippery.

One of the oldest potential explanations dates back to the mid-1800s. It comes from a Scottish engineer named James Thomson, the older brother of famous physicist Lord Kelvin. And it involves the pressure that an object exerts on ice.

Rowińska: We know that the melting temperature is generally zero degrees Celsius, or 32 [degrees] Fahrenheit. And above that we have water; below that we have ice. But then pressure changes this—changes the properties of water.

Pierre-Louis: That is Paulina Rowińska, who we also heard at the top of the episode. She's a science journalist at Quanta Magazine, and she wrote an article in December that dug into the competing theories about why ice is slippery.

One of the hypotheses is that when we step onto the ice we put pressure on it, possibly lowering the melting point.

Rowińska: It's freezing out there, but we are getting closer to the melting temperature, so we might be melting, like, the surface layer of ice. And then it would get kind of a layer of water, and we all—like, water is slippery because it's a liquid, not a solid.

Pierre-Louis: Thomson came to this idea—that pressure on the ice basically creates a liquid layer—by studying glaciers, says Martin Müser.

Martin is a theoretical physicist in the Department of Materials Science at Saarland University.

Martin Müser: Glaciers, there is a heavy, heavy load that sits on the points of contact, and we know that when we are a little below the freezing point and we squeeze on ice, it becomes liquid. So [Thomson] argued that ice liquefies because of the pressure.

Pierre-Louis: But there's a problem with the pressure hypothesis—a big one, according to Daniel Bonn, a professor of physics at the University of Amsterdam.

Daniel Bonn: You would need 10 elephants resting on a single skate in order to get a decent amount of melting due to the pressure.

Pierre-Louis: Given that humans do not weigh as much as 10 elephants and we still manage to slip on ice, pressure alone does not seem to be why ice is slippery. So another theory emerged—and this one is especially popular among tribologists, scientists who study friction, lubrication and wear between moving surfaces.

Here's Martin again.

Müser: When you talk to a tribologist, in particular in the field of ice friction, they would come up with an explanation that was proposed by Frank Bowden. And he made a very neat experiment in the Alps where he put two identical skis—they had the same weight, the same surface finish, the same everything—but one conducted the heat inside a little better than the other one. And the one that conducted the heat less well was noticeably faster. So he said, “Look, what happens is because you have friction, you get heat. When [there's] heat, it melts the water, and the more heat is retained in the contact, the better it is. What happens is melting by frictional heating.”

Pierre-Louis: The idea that Bowden laid out with another physical chemist, T. P. Hughes, is that as we walk or skate on ice the friction we create heats and melts the surface. The concept is called frictional heating.

Daniel's team did experiments where they measured the friction on ice over a very large temperature range, from -100 degrees C, or -148 degrees F, to the freezing point of water.

Bonn: And then all kinds of interesting things happen. At very low temperatures—you probably don't want to be ice-skating anyways at -100 [degrees C], but it's actually impossible to ice-skate because the friction's very high. But then increasing the temperature from those very low temperatures the friction decreases extremely rapidly.

Pierre-Louis: Daniel and his colleagues found that the friction decreased until a temperature of roughly -7 degrees C, which is about 20 degrees F. But when they went closer to the melting point of ice the friction went up again.

Bonn: And this is something that you've experienced if you do ice-skating: if the ice is too warm, it actually becomes mushy and you leave traces in the ice, which—this is what we call plowing friction. And so we were very happy because we found that there was an optimum temperature for ice-skating, which is -7 degrees C. And so we went to our ice-skating rink, and they said, “We've known this for many decades.”

Pierre-Louis: These experiments reinforced for Daniel that the answer to what makes ice slippery lies beyond friction.

Sure, frictional heating might be responsible for melting the ice in our wake—that is, melting the ice behind us—but as we all know ice is slippery before you've even stepped on it, before friction has even occurred.

Bonn: As you know it's difficult to remain standing on the ice, even at zero speed, yeah? And so we don't think that the sliding itself has something to do with it.

Pierre-Louis: So if it's not pressure or friction, could ice be slippery because there's already a pre-melted layer of water on top?

Paulina says that's what a third hypothesis suggests.

Rowińska: So this has to do with how ice is structured. So, you know, ice is just water. So we have water molecules, but they are structured in a very ordered way, so they form bonds, and they—it's kind of like a nice lattice. That's why ice is solid. In a liquid, like liquid water, the molecules are kind of moving freely, and the structure is much looser.

So the idea is that close to the surface of ice the bonds are much weaker, so it's kind of like a boundary between two different materials. So it's not that the surface of ice is melting, but there is, like, a pre-melted layer of water on top of ice because of these structural differences between water and ice.

Pierre-Louis: This theory, like the pressure hypothesis, dates back to the 1800s. It was first proposed by English chemist and physicist Michael Faraday, Martin explains.

Müser: He basically saw that from putting two ice cubes together, and when they were fresh they would slide, but if he would wait a bit longer time, they were stuck. So a single, basically, interface would form, and he said, “Well, they are slippery because there must be a very thin lubricating layer.” And in the last 30, 40 years there was a lot of experimental effort proving the existence of this layer.

Pierre-Louis: But this theory, too, has holes. Among them, Martin says ...

Müser: Is this layer is relatively thin. And a very thin layer, even if the viscosity of the liquid is as small as that of water, would still give quite noticeable friction. [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: So let's recap: the three long-standing, leading hypotheses as to why ice is slippery are, one, the pressure applied by an object melts the ice, causing us to slip. Two, friction heats the ice, causing us to slip. And three, ice has a thin layer of pre-melted water that, again, causes us to slip.

On the one hand all of these theories have flaws. On the other hand computer simulations run by a group of European scientists a few years ago suggest that it might not be any one of these theories but all of them together.

You might be asking yourself, “Why does any of this matter? We know that ice is slippery. Does it really matter if we know why?” For Daniel, who is Dutch, it's actually a matter of national pride.

[CLIP: “Het Wilhelmus”]

Bonn: So the most important application for the Dutch is getting gold medals at speed skating, yeah? So we are the best speed skaters in the world, and we wanna keep it that way, and so we also want to have the fastest ice-skating track.

Pierre-Louis: But it also matters if you're not Dutch, he says.

Bonn: It's extremely interesting to think about why things are slippery because if you can understand what's happening there, you might be able to transfer that knowledge to other systems. And so things that are extremely slippery are extremely interesting because friction is responsible for an estimated 25 percent of the world energy consumption, yeah? And so the friction on ice is roughly an order of magnitude lower than friction on all other materials. And so if you could transpose that to all the moving parts in the world, you would save almost 25 percent of the world energy consumption.

Pierre-Louis: In other words ice is slipperier than most other materials. If scientists could figure out why, they might be able to mimic its behavior for use in other applications, like train tracks or motorized energy. This would allow us to lose less energy to friction, cutting energy usage in the process.

But let's come back to the eternal question of why ice is slippery. Last year a new theory surfaced.

Here's Paulina again.

Rowińska: So a new hypothesis came out last year in a paper, and the idea is: it's not really about melting. It's about, almost, like, a mechanical moving of atoms and molecules on the surface. So you know how when we step on ice, we kind of destroy the structure because there are some almost, like, electrostatic attraction—it's not exactly electrostatic, but it's, like, an attraction between molecules of our shoe and of ice. But then we keep going—we keep skiing; we keep walking—and we kind of keep attaching and disattaching these molecules.

So there is—they call it, like, an amorphous layer, so it's a layer that's liquidlike, but it's not really liquid because it's very thin. So it's not really water. It's not really ice. It's something in between.

Pierre-Louis: And it was Martin's team that published this theory in the journal Physical Review Letters.

He said that to understand the idea imagine stacking a bunch of egg cartons.

Müser: You put them perfectly in parallel, of course they're going to stick. But ice crystals will never be oriented that well; they will be misoriented. And very much to my surprise did I see that if I put two misaligned ice crystals in contact, even if they go extremely, extremely close to absolute zero, would I see amorphization right away.

Pierre-Louis: In other words instead of the crystalline structure one might expect ice to have, the surface structure starts to fall apart a little bit and become more disordered. It's not quite a solid anymore.

Müser: So we saw this very fast amorphization at 10 kelvin, and then we said, “Hey, now let's look what happens at -10 degrees C,” or in Fahrenheit—I don't know, roughly, it's about 10 [degrees] F or 12 [degrees] F. And we did see that the water also liquefied.

Pierre-Louis: To understand what Martin is getting at it helps to understand the difference between an ordered and a disordered solid.

An ordered solid is when all of the atoms are arranged in a precise, repeating 3D structure—think about a phalanx of Roman soldiers all lined up. Those structures can handle a lot of stress. For example, most metals are ordered structures.

A disordered solid, though, is more chaotic. The structures can be more random, less repeating.

When water becomes ice the outer layers are disordered; their structure looks like an open honeycomb. When we step on that surface with, say, a sneaker or ice skate we break up that structure, introducing stress into the system. As the ice works to adjust to that stress it creates an amorphous layer—something that's not quite liquid and not quite solid—that causes us to slip. Or at least that's the latest theory.

Müser: Sometimes people ask me if people accept the answer and I always say, “I hope not,” because any [Laughs], any good, nontrivial, correct scientific answer is met by a lot of skepticism.

Pierre-Louis: So the next time you go ice skating or wipe out on an icy sidewalk you'll at least have a clearer idea of why it might have happened.

There is a need to quantify the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening using primary colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) compared with usual care with no screening. Guidelines recommend screening in individuals aged 50–75 years using colonoscopy or FIT, and many screening programs use one-sample biennial FIT. Here we compare incidence of diagnosed CRCs and gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events between screening and usual care during the diagnostic phase of the SCREESCO trial. A randomized block method (no masking) assigned 278,280 individuals aged 60 years to once-only colonoscopy, 2 rounds of two-stool FIT with a low cutoff (10 μg g−1 feces) or usual care (control group) in a ratio of 1:6 for colonoscopy versus control and 1:2 for FIT versus control. In the analysis, 31,113 individuals were in the primary colonoscopy arm and 60,267 were in the FIT arm, and there were 186,671 primary colonoscopy controls, of whom 120,521 were also controls for comparison with the FIT arm. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the incidence rate of CRC was 107.9 in the colonoscopy arm and 99.9 in controls per 100,000 person-years (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91–1.28) and 96.0 in the FIT arm and 103.9 in controls (IRR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.81–1.05). Rates of stage I–II CRC were higher in the colonoscopy arm (IRR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09–1.74) and in the FIT arm (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.99–1.43) versus controls. Rates of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events were slightly higher in the intervention arms during the first year and were subsequently more similar to controls. Our findings of an increase in CRC detection implies a benefit of screening while the increase in adverse events suggests some initial harm. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02078804.

To inform health policy in early detection and removal of CRC and precancerous lesions, there is a need to quantify the benefits and harms from CRC screening. The American College of Gastroenterology and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommend CRC screening in individuals aged 50–75 years by colonoscopy or FIT, where colonoscopy is performed only in those with increased risk indicated by a higher fecal hemoglobin level1,2. Several countries have implemented FIT-based organized screening often with a similar age range and biennial testing but with cutoffs for a positive test ranging between 8.5 μg hemoglobin per g feces and 120 μg hemoglobin per g feces3,4. In Sweden, screening by use of a one-sample biennial FIT has been ongoing in the Stockholm-Gotland region since 2015 in individuals aged 60–69 years and since 2020 in individuals aged 60–74 years, with a cutoff of 40 μg hemoglobin per g feces for women and 80 μg hemoglobin per g feces for men5,6. A national biennial FIT-based screening program with the same cutoffs and age range began its rollout in 2021 with full implementation planned for 2026.

There are several trials of colonoscopy screening, but few have examined FIT compared to usual care7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. The Spanish randomized controlled trial (RCT) COLONPREV recently found similar CRC incidence in the FIT arm and the primary colonoscopy arm at 10 years but did not include any control arm15. Colonoscopy may cause serious adverse events, although the reported rates have been low8,16. There is also limited evidence from RCTs on the impact of screening using primary colonoscopy and FIT on CRC incidence and adverse events compared to usual care.

The RCT SCREESCO trial (Screening of Swedish Colons; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02078804) in Sweden includes a primary colonoscopy screening arm, two rounds of a two-stool FIT screening arm with an unusually low cutoff (10 μg g−1 feces) and a control arm with individuals not invited to screening but following usual care17. By adding extensive information from Swedish healthcare registers, we now report a comparison of the diagnostic yield, in terms of total CRCs diagnosed, and of adverse events occurring in all participants in the trial—screening versus control arm—during the diagnostic phase (from 2014 to 2020, when all interventions occurred) on an intention-to-screen basis. The aim of the present study was to assess if the randomization has resulted in the three arms being similar in terms of baseline demographic variables and medical history and to assess if the screening approaches resulted in a higher rate of diagnosis of CRC during the diagnostic phase, especially stage I–II CRC, compared to usual care. It also aims to assess potential harms of screening approaches in terms of an increased rate of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events in general and short-term all-cause mortality during the diagnostic phase. The present analysis extends previous trial information, which was limited to screen-detected CRCs and adverse events in screening colonoscopies17.

Between 11 February 2014 and 1 March 2016, 201,000 individuals turning 60 or aged 60 were randomized to one of three arms: primary colonoscopy, two rounds of two-stool FIT (FIT×2) or controls. All these controls were controls to both intervention arms. Because of low participation in the primary colonoscopy arm, an additional 77,280 individuals were randomized to primary colonoscopy or control between 30 May 2017 and 25 May 2018. A total of 278,280 individuals were randomized. Due to administrative lag in registration, 159 individuals who died and 70 individuals with prevalent CRC before the date of randomization were identified only after randomization and were excluded. Another two control individuals were excluded because they were not identifiable in any register (Fig. 1). There were 278,051 unique individuals included in the final analyses, 31,113 in the primary colonoscopy arm, 60,267 in the FIT×2 arm and 186,671 primary colonoscopy controls (randomized 2014–2018), of whom 120,521 were also controls for comparison with the FIT×2 arm (that is, FIT×2 controls, randomized in 2014–2016).

Number of randomized, excluded and included individuals.

Baseline demographic variables (for example, educational level and country of birth) and history of comorbidities (Table 1) were balanced between the primary colonoscopy arm and colonoscopy controls (n = 186,671) and between the FIT×2 arm and FIT×2 controls. Most individuals (92%) did not have any prior gastrointestinal or cardiovascular event.

The maximum and median follow-up were 6.9 years and 4.8 years, respectively, and 1,385 (0.5%) individuals migrated out of Sweden during the follow-up. The median time from randomization to screening colonoscopy in the 10,679 (35% of the 30,400 invited) participants in the primary colonoscopy arm was 349 days (interquartile range (IQR): 253–446 days), and the median time from randomization to first FIT in the 33,383 (55% of the 60,137 invited) participants in the FIT×2 arm was 338 days (IQR: 229–395 days) (Extended Data Fig. 1). Men (35%) participated slightly more often than women (33%) in the primary colonoscopy arm, whereas more women (59%) participated in the FIT×2 arm than men (52%) (Supplementary Table 1). Individuals who did not participate in colonoscopy in the primary colonoscopy arm or in fecal testing in the FIT×2 arm (that is, non-participants) had lower educational level, originated more often from another country and exhibited slightly more comorbidity.

The incidence rate of diagnosed CRCs during the diagnostic phase was 107.9 per 100,000 person-years (160 individuals/148,337 person-years) in the primary colonoscopy arm and 99.9 (889 individuals/889,774 person-years) in the control arm (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91–1.28) and 96.0 (330 individuals/343,703 person-years) in the FIT×2 arm and 103.9 (715 individuals/687,048 person-years) in the FIT×2 control arm (IRR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.81–1.05) (Table 2). Figure 2 shows that the incidence rates and IRRs peaked around year one after randomization in both the primary colonoscopy arm and the FIT×2 arm as compared to respective control arms. The corresponding cumulative incidence proportions at the end of follow-up of CRC were 0.69% (95% CI: 0.66–0.71%) in the primary colonoscopy arm, 0.72% (95% CI: 0.71–0.73%) in the control arm, 0.61% (95% CI: 0.60–0.63%) in the FIT×2 arm and 0.73% (95% CI: 0.72–0.75%) in the FIT×2 control arm (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Yearly incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years) and IRRs of CRCs in total and by stage in the primary colonoscopy arm and FIT×2 arm as compared to respective control arms (reference). CRCs include both screen detected and those diagnosed outside of SCREESCO in a usual care setting. Vertical bars indicate 95% CIs.

The incidence rate of diagnosed stage I–II CRCs in the primary colonoscopy arm was 58.7 per 100,000 person-years compared to 42.5 in the control arm (IRR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09–1.74) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Similarly, the rate in the FIT×2 arm was 52.7 and 44.4 in FIT×2 controls (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.99–1.43). Cumulative incidence proportions were higher in the intervention arms compared to controls throughout most of the study period (Extended Data Fig. 2).

The rate of diagnosed stage III–IV CRCs was somewhat lower in the primary colonoscopy arm than in the control arm (IRR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.67–1.11) and lower in the FIT×2 arm than in the FIT×2 control arm (IRR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.58–0.86) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Cumulative incidence proportions in the intervention arms were initially similar to those in controls but became lower than controls after around 4 years after randomization (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Of CRCs diagnosed in the primary colonoscopy arm and in the FIT×2 arm, 32% and 38%, respectively, were screen detected (Table 2). Few CRCs were diagnosed outside of the trial in individuals who had undergone a screening colonoscopy in the primary colonoscopy arm and in the FIT×2 arm (nine (0.03%) and eight (0.01%) individuals, respectively) during the diagnostic phase. Two of the 170 previously reported CRCs detected within the trial were, after a review of medical charts, deemed not to be CRC. Nine additional CRCs were similarly detected within the trial after the review. All but two of the 177 CRCs diagnosed within the trial were also registered in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Register or the Swedish Cancer Register. Stage disagreed in three (1.7%) and was missing in nine (5.1%) of these CRCs (Supplementary Table 2).

Compared to women, men had a higher rate of CRC in the FIT×2 arm (IRR men / IRR women: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.99–1.67) and especially of stage III–IV CRC in both intervention arms (Supplementary Table 3).

Incidence rates of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events were slightly higher in the intervention arms compared to the control arms during the first year of follow-up but were subsequently more similar (Fig. 3). At the end of follow-up, the incidence rate of cardiovascular events was similar in all arms—that is, 1,475.8 per 100,000 person-years in the primary colonoscopy arm and 1,475.8 per 100,000 person-years in the control arm (IRR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.96–1.05), although the rate of venous thromboembolism was 60.1 in the FIT×2 arm compared to 43.3 in corresponding controls (IRR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.16–1.66) (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4). The rate of gastrointestinal events was somewhat higher in the FIT×2 arm compared to the control arm also at the end of follow-up, primarily iatrogenic bleeding (IRR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05–1.32) and unspecified gastrointestinal bleeding (IRR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04–1.26).

Yearly incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) and IRRs of deaths, gastrointestinal events and cardiovascular events in the primary colonoscopy arm and the FIT×2 arm as compared with respective control arms (reference). Vertical bars indicate 95% CIs.

We previously showed that the proportion of serious adverse events directly linked to screening colonoscopies during the trial was 0.2%, including two bowel perforations and 15 major bleedings17.

Death (from any cause) was similar in all arms, with a rate of 554.6 per 100,000 person-years (825 deaths) in the primary colonoscopy arm and 579.0 per 100,000 person-years (5,163 deaths) in the control arm (IRR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.89–1.03) and 577.1 (1,989 deaths) in the FIT×2 arm and 601.8 (4,145 deaths) in the FIT×2 control arm (IRR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91–1.01) (Table 3 and Fig. 3). We previously reported one death in the FIT group on day 15 after the colonoscopy, which followed a pulmonary embolism in a man with metastatic cancer17.

Men had a similar rate of cardiovascular events, a somewhat lower rate of gastrointestinal events and a higher rate of death than women (Supplementary Table 5).

In this assessment of the diagnostic phase of the SCREESCO trial, there was an increase of stage I–II CRC incidence in the intervention arms compared to usual care, particularly during the first year after randomization when most of the screening colonoscopies were performed. More stage I–II and fewer stage III–IV CRCs were diagnosed in the intervention arms compared to controls after a median follow-up of almost 5 years. Similarly, we found similar incidence rates of death and gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events in all arms, except a slightly higher rate of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events in particular during the first year after randomization.

The only ongoing RCTs other than the SCREESCO trial, involving both primary colonoscopy and FIT, are the Spanish trial COLONPREV16 and the American trial Colonoscopy vs. Fecal Immunochemical Test in Reducing Mortality from Colorectal Cancer (CONFIRM)7,13, neither of which has a control arm. SCREESCO provides a comparison of screening effectiveness between invitation to FIT screening and usual care. In the FIT arms of COLONPREV and CONFIRM, a single stool sample with a higher cutoff was used compared to SCREESCO, which used two stool samples. CONFIRM recruited individuals from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, where the majority of the population were men7.

Similar to the Nordic-European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer (NordICC) RCT, we found in intention-to-screen analyses a higher rate of CRC during the first years since randomization to primary colonoscopy compared to usual care, but the rates were similar later on9. Screening using primary sigmoidoscopy has also been shown to reduce CRC incidence in RCTs compared to usual care18,19,20 and lead to a stage shift toward lower stage, particularly for screen-detected CRCs20. Similar evidence for FIT-based screening compared to usual care is lacking. COLONPREV reported similar rates of screen-detected CRC in the two screening arms16. Previous RCTs on screening using repeated fecal occult blood (FOB) followed by colonoscopy after positive FOB test found an initial increase in CRC incidence and a stage shift toward lower stage, especially in screen-detected CRCs21,22,23,24. In the present study, the rates of stage I–II cancer were higher in both intervention arms compared to controls, in particular during the first years of follow-up when most of the screening colonoscopies were performed. This excess risk decreased with time, and the incidence of stage III–IV simultaneously decreased after around 4 years, particularly in the FIT arm compared to controls. The duration of the trial is likely too short to detect a net benefit of the prevention in terms of a lower CRC incidence in the intervention arms compared to controls and/or to determine if a part of the early-stage CRC excess risk in the intervention arms represents an overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant CRCs25. Taken together with the detection and removal of adenomas, our findings suggest a possible future reduction in CRC incidence and CRC mortality in the intervention arms in the subsequent follow-up of SCREESCO (to be reported with follow-up until 31 December 2030)26.

We previously showed that the rate of serious adverse events directly linked to screening colonoscopies in SCREESCO was low17 and in line with other studies8,16,27,28. The present study indicates that the potential harms of colonoscopy in terms of deaths and gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events were generally similar in individuals invited to screening involving colonoscopy at some step in a routine clinical setting and in non-invited individuals following usual care on a population-based level. Individuals who underwent screening colonoscopy in the FIT×2 arm more often had precancerous lesions needing therapeutic intervention compared to the primary colonoscopy arm; hence, the slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal events (that is, bleeding) is expected. The rate of venous thromboembolism was also higher in the FIT×2 arm than in controls, speculatively because anticoagulant users may have a higher risk of positive FIT and pause their treatment during colonoscopy. We are not aware of any other studies reporting gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events in general on an intention-to-treat level comparing primary colonoscopy or FIT followed by colonoscopy to usual care. Our findings motivate further studies on complications related to therapeutic interventions and use of medications.

This large RCT has several strengths. It was performed in a screening-naive setting covering 18 out of 21 of the Swedish regions, comprising 75% of the total population. It had a unique design using two FIT samples instead of one, an unusually low cutoff (10 μg hemoglobin per g) for the maximum of the two FIT values, two rounds of screening 2 years apart and a control arm following usual care. Thirty-three hospitals and 146 endoscopists were involved, which reflects routine care in Sweden. Follow-up was facilitated through reliable and high-quality Swedish registers and allowed us to assess CRCs, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events and colonoscopies in all arms during the entire diagnostic phase. The Swedish Cancer Register captures almost all cancers29, and the proportion of correctly registered diagnoses in the Swedish Patient Register is generally high30.

This study also has some limitations. Although around half of the invited individuals in the FIT arm participated, which was higher than the COLONPREV study15, most with a positive FIT participated in colonoscopy. Participation in the primary colonoscopy arm was lower than initially expected but similar to, or higher than, that in many other countries31 and similar to the NordiCC study8 (outside Norway) and the COLONPREV study15. The increase in CRC incidence during the diagnostic phase was likely lower than what would be expected in settings with higher participation in screening. Some gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events may not have been registered in the Swedish Patient Register, and some may have been re-registered at subsequent hospital visits, potentially underestimating or overestimating incidence rates, although we expect the coverage to be similar in all arms and, thus, less likely to influence IRRs. Our study was restricted to individuals aged 60 years and does not inform on the tradeoffs between benefits and harms of the interventions in younger or older individuals32,33.

In conclusion, we found that a program of screening, by primary colonoscopy or two rounds of two-stool FIT using a low cutoff, detects more lower-stage CRCs than usual care. Rates of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events were higher in the first year and later on more similar to usual care. The increase in CRC detection implies a benefit of screening while the increase in adverse events suggests some initial harm. Subsequent follow-up of SCREESCO will report CRC mortality (not reported here).

This study has trial number NCT02078804 and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov at https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02078804.

We performed an individual RCT with a study base population from 18 out of 21 regions in Sweden17 comprising 74.5% of the total national population where CRC screening had not previously been offered (Stockholm, Gotland and Västernorrland regions were not included). Residents aged 60 years of age or who turned 60 in the year of randomization were identified from the Total Population Register maintained by the Swedish Tax Agency34. Individuals who had a previous diagnosis of CRC or anal cancer or who had participated in the NordICC trial were excluded8.

All individuals invited for screening signed a written informed consent for the procedure and for biobanking of samples. Individuals assigned as controls were not informed about study participation. The Stockholm Ethics Committee approved the study (2012/2058-31/3) and the review of medical charts (2015/1958-2). The Swedish Ethical Review Authority waived the need for informed consent for accessing pseudonymized register-based data (2022/01946-02 and 2022/06863-2).

Between 11 February 2014 and 1 March 2016, a randomized block method was used to assign 201,000 individuals born 1954–1956 without prior CRC diagnosis to once-only primary colonoscopy, two rounds of FIT 2 years apart (FIT×2) or a usual care control arm with no organized program of screening activity (controls). All controls were intended for use in the separate comparisons of primary colonoscopy versus control and of FIT×2 versus control. Masking was not possible due to the nature of the trial. A list of all eligible individuals within each randomization block, defined by year of randomization, region of residence and sex, was obtained to randomly allocate individuals to the three arms. The target number of randomized individuals within the strata was determined based on the distribution of sex and county among 60-year-old individuals in Sweden (excluding the counties that did not participate in SCREESCO) in 2012. Because of low participation in the primary colonoscopy arm, an additional 77,280 individuals were randomized to primary colonoscopy or control between 30 May 2017 and 25 May 2018. We call the subgroup of controls randomized in 2014–2016 (120,600 controls) ‘FIT×2 controls' because they are appropriate for use in the comparison against FIT×2 (also randomized in 2014–2016). All 186,840 controls were available for comparison against primary colonoscopy (randomized 2014–2018).

All invitees in the primary colonoscopy and FIT×2 arms were sent a letter describing the study and a leaflet about CRC and screening. A reminder was sent after 8 weeks. No contact was made with individuals allocated to the control arm. In the primary colonoscopy arm, a second letter offered a scheduled colonoscopy or, if more convenient, a telephone appointment to schedule a colonoscopy. Individuals assigned to the FIT×2 arm were sent a set of kits for two stool samples each screening round. One central laboratory performed all FIT analyses using a single OC-Sensor DIANA automated analyzer (Eiken Chemical). A fecal hemoglobin concentration of ≥10 μg g−1 feces in either of the stool samples was deemed positive, triggering a colonoscopy invitation. All individuals in the FIT×2 arm, except those requiring colonoscopy surveillance after adenoma removal or after a CRC diagnosis, were offered a repeat FIT after 2 years, irrespective of participation in the first FIT screening round or the results of the first FIT. Colonoscopies were performed at 33 hospitals by 146 endoscopists, with a background training as gastroenterologists, surgeons or endoscopy nurses17.

Individuals were randomized between 11 February 2014 and 25 May 2018 and subsequently invited to screening. Screening colonoscopies in the primary colonoscopy arm and the FIT×2 arm and FITs in the FIT×2 arm were performed between 2014 and 2020. We, therefore, consider the diagnostic phase of the trial to be between 2014 and 2020.

In Sweden, all citizens have access to public healthcare35. A very small minority of individuals have private healthcare insurance on top of this (only 0.6% of Swedish healthcare is funded through insurance). During the study period, there was no national screening. Screening was performed in the Stockholm-Gotland healthcare region but not in the regions where SCREESCO was performed. In usual care, the main driver of colonoscopies is symptoms. During the study period, FIT has been introduced as an intermediate step in the investigation of symptoms to an increasing extent, where elevated hemoglobin in the fecal sample in a FIT taken because of symptoms triggers a colonoscopy. Individuals who are under surveillance due to increased CRC risk (that is, previous CRC diagnosis, inflammatory bowel disease or hereditary/familial CRC syndromes) may undergo colonoscopy during surveillance. Individuals may also be under surveillance after polypectomy of adenomatous colorectal polyps.

The ultimate primary endpoint of SCREESCO, for which the power and sample size calculations were performed, is CRC mortality (intervention versus control) at 15 years, and it will be reported later with follow-up until 31 December 2030. CRC incidence was listed as a primary endpoint in the study protocol, but this is formally a secondary outcome of the trial, along with an analysis of compliance, and exploratory outcomes include analyses of health economy, of colonoscopy quality and of the microbiome in feces.

The study protocol was amended after new power calculations due to an observed 35% participation in the colonoscopy arm (in Swedish, 10 March 2017; translated to English, 29 April 2021). The list of members of the Scientific Committee was updated.

The study protocol was amended after the Scientific Committee decided on a last date of follow-up based on new power calculations. It was also decided that the previously described interim analysis would not be performed. The list of main publications was updated and so was the list of members of the Scientific Committee. A summary of changes to the study protocol and statistical analysis plan was added. Weblinks under ‘Head Secretariat' were updated.

The statistical analysis plan was amended after new power calculations due to an observed 35% participation in the colonoscopy arm.

The statistical analysis plan was amended on 4 November 2024 after the Scientific Committee decided on a last date of follow-up based on new power calculations. It was also decided that the previously described interim analysis would not be performed. Details and clarifications regarding the initial and modified power calculations were added. The analysis of incidence of CRC was changed and is now based on cumulative incidence curves instead of the log-rank test.

Power calculations were performed for CRC mortality at 15 years alone. The initial study protocol and the current study protocol state, however, that the main research questions of SCREESCO are to investigate (1) if screening has an effect on the mortality from CRC, (2) if screening has an effect on the incidence of CRC and (3) what method should be used in Sweden regarding the effect according to (1) and (2). The Scientific Committee found a need for a timely assessment of baseline findings (diagnosed CRCs and adverse events during the diagnostic phase of the trial) that also includes the control arm (usual care) and diagnoses/events occurring in general (not only those directly related to SCREESCO screening colonoscopies). The present study is, therefore, listed as a planned main study (section 9, study protocol version 3). Note that CRC mortality is not assessed in the present study and that this main outcome of the trial will, instead, be presented in the final report of the trial with follow-up until 31 December 2030.

Note that this study does not constitute the interim analyses mentioned of CRC mortality at 5 years and 10 years of follow-up in the original study protocol and statistical analysis plan. An additional power calculation (statistical analysis plan version 3; Table 3) showed that there would be limited power to detect differences in CRC mortality at 10 years (follow-up until 31 December 2024) or earlier. Based on the calculation, the Scientific Committee decided that interim analyses of CRC mortality should not be performed.

The present study focuses on early CRCs and adverse events during the diagnostic phase and is listed as a planned analysis of the study. It builds upon a previous baseline assessment of screen-detected CRCs and adverse events in screening colonoscopies of SCREESCO17 and can be considered an extended baseline report or a 5-year interim analysis of diagnosed CRCs and adverse events occurring during the intervention phase. It includes extended information from Swedish health registers regarding CRCs diagnosed and adverse events in general in both screening arms and in the control arm during the diagnostic phase of SCREESCO when screening FITs and colonoscopies were performed.

The endoscopy units reported serious adverse events that occurred within 30 days of the colonoscopy. A study nurse, together with A.F., checked the case report forms for completeness or inconsistencies and obtained additional information from the screening units if needed. Subsequent monitoring was, and will be, facilitated by follow-up using healthcare registers.

In the present analysis of the diagnostic phase of SCREESCO, the outcomes were diagnostic yield of screening and usual care, in terms of CRC diagnoses (overall and by stage), and adverse events (cardiovascular and gastrointestinal). We also assessed death from any cause as a measure of overall health and a potential harm of screening.

In the present study, individuals were followed from randomization (2014–2018) until positive outcome in the corresponding analysis (CRC diagnosis or adverse event, respectively), emigration, death or end of the diagnostic phase (31 December 2020), whichever occurred first, through linkage between the Cancer Register, the Patient Register, the Total Population Register, the Cause of Death Register and the SCREESCO database.

Data on date of and stage at CRC diagnosis were extracted from the Swedish Cancer Register, to which registration is mandated by law29. Additional data on CRC stage were obtained from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Register that, during 2008–2015, had a completeness of 98.5% for colon cancer and 98.8% for rectal cancer36. We defined CRC according to relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes registered in the Swedish Cancer Register. We used any of the following ICD 10th revision (ICD-10) codes for CRC: C18 (except C181), C19 and C20. We also required at least one of the following SNOMED version 3 (SNOMED/3; morphology code ICD-0/3) codes registered at the same time as the CRC: 81403 (adenocarcinoma), 82113 (tubular adenocarcinoma), 82133 (serrated adenocarcinoma), 82203 (adenocarcinoma in familial polyposis), 82433 (goblet cell adenocarcinoma), 82613 (adenocarcinoma arising from villous adenoma), 82633 (adenocarcinoma arising from tubulovillous adenoma), 84803 (mucinous adenocarcinoma) and 84903 (signet ring cell carcinoma/poorly cohesive carcinoma); or SNOMED/2 (SNOMEDO10; morphology code ICD-0/2): 81403 (tubular, villous or serrated adenocarcinoma), 82113 (tubular adenocarcinoma), 82203 (goblet cell adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma in familial polyposis), 84803 (goblet cell or mucinous adenocarcinoma) and 84903 (signet ring cell carcinoma/poorly cohesive carcinoma). We additionally included CRCs registered in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register36.

The date of CRC diagnosis was defined as the first date of a CRC diagnosis in either of the two registries. Medical charts for individuals with CRC registered in SCREESCO, individuals who after a screening colonoscopy required further investigation or treatment (for example, computed tomography scan) and individuals whose polyp samples were sent to pathology were reviewed to assess the correctness of the CRC diagnosis and to extract additional information on stage. CRCs were considered screen detected if detected at colonoscopy (primary or secondary after a positive FIT) performed within SCREESCO.

Data on stage of CRCs detected at screening colonoscopy within SCREESCO were extracted from the SCREESCO database. Data on stage were also extracted separately for all individuals with a CRC diagnosis in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register and/or the Swedish Cancer Register. We allowed for some administrative lag and included all entries in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register and the Swedish Cancer Register occurring within 90 days from the first date of CRC diagnosis in either of the two registers. The TNM stages were obtained from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register if the CRC was registered there and available (not missing) and, otherwise, from the Swedish Cancer Register if available. The Swedish Colorectal Cancer Quality Register contains both the clinical and pathological TNM, and the pathological TNM was used if available and, otherwise, the clinical TNM. Stage (I–II versus III–IV) was graded similarly to the American Joint Committee on Cancer system, which is based on the TNM classification, with stage I–II if T(any or missing)N0M0, T(0–4)N0M(0/missing) or T(0–1)N(0/missing)M0 and stage III–IV if N1, N2 or M1. Tx was considered as missing T stage and similarly for N stage and M stage. Stage was considered unknown if it did not fulfil any of the above.

Data on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events (events related to colonoscopy—for example, bleedings and injuries) and on colonoscopies registered in an inpatient or outpatient setting were extracted from the Patient Register30. The Patient Register covers all inpatient care in Sweden, and the validity of this register has been found to be high, varying from 85% to 95% among different diseases30. The following ICD-10 codes were used to define gastrointestinal events: K922 (Unspecified gastrointestinal bleeding), S360 (Splenic injury), S365 (Colonic injury), S366 (Rectal injury), T810 (Bleeding iatrogenic) and T812 (Perforation). The following ICD-10 codes were used to define cardiovascular events: I20–I25 (Ischemic heart disease), I26 (Pulmonary embolism), I33 (Acute endocarditis), I46 (Cardiac arrest), I63 (Cerebral infarction), I74 (Peripheral artery embolism) and I81 and I82 (Venous thromboembolism).

Date of death was retrieved from the Cause of Death Register37.

Biological sex (man/woman), year of birth, country of birth (Sweden versus other), region of residence, educational level, Charlson Comorbidity Index, a drug comorbidity index and history of any cardiovascular or gastrointestinal event and type of event (within 10 years prior to randomization) were used to describe individuals by arm. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated based on the Patient Register in the last 10 years before inclusion, and the drug comorbidity index was calculated based on drug prescriptions registered up to 1 year before date of inclusion in the Prescribed Drug Register38,39,40. Country of birth was extracted from the Total Population Register, and educational level and region of residence were extracted from the Swedish Longitudinal Integrated Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market Studies (LISA).

The sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint of CRC mortality. A priori, the study was powered to detect a 17.5% decrease in CRC mortality at 15 years in individuals invited to colonoscopy compared to the control arm and a 15% decrease in individuals invited to FIT compared to the control arm, based on an anticipated 1% cumulative CRC mortality between 60 years and 75 years of age. The original sample size target was 201,000 individuals.

Because of lower participation (35%) in the primary colonoscopy arm than expected (50%), new power calculations were performed to determine the additional number of randomized individuals needed to achieve acceptable power, and two additional age cohorts (born 1957 and 1958) were randomized to primary colonoscopy or control in a ratio of 1:6 (hence the deviation from the initially intended allocation ratio).

In the revised study protocol, we assumed a 15% disease-specific mortality reduction by 15 years of follow-up as a minimal clinically important effect in those invited to FIT×2 compared to the control arm, based on a participation rate of 50%, and a 17.5% disease-specific mortality reduction in those invited to colonoscopy compared to the control arm, based on a 35% participation. To allow these absolute risk reductions to be detected at a two-sided 2.5% significance level with 80% power for the comparison of FIT×2 versus control and 73% power for the comparison of primary colonoscopy versus control, the revised target sample size was 278,280 participants. The significance level was adjusted for two comparisons according to the Bonferroni method. In total, 31,140 individuals were randomized to the primary colonoscopy arm; 60,300 individuals were randomized to the FIT×2 arm; and there were two control groups: 186,840 controls to the primary colonoscopy arm, out of which 120,600 individuals also were controls to the FIT×2 arm (FIT×2 controls).

An additional power analysis was performed to determine when, in calendar time, the main analysis of SCREESCO would be performed because this was not clearly stated in the initial study protocol. The Scientific Committee decided that 31 December 2030 would be the last date of follow-up for the main analysis because power was not expected to meaningfully increase after this date.

In an intention-to-screen analysis, we report the number, proportion and incidence rate per 100,000 person-years of all screen-detected CRCs within SCREESCO and all other CRCs diagnosed in regular clinical practice during the diagnostic phase of SCREESCO, in total and by stage (I–II or III–IV). We similarly report incident cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events diagnosed in regular clinical practice and death from any cause. We compare each intervention arm with the corresponding control arm concerning each of the outcomes using incidence rates and IRRs using Poisson regression models with 95% CIs. Analyses were also performed separately in men and women, and a Poisson regression model with interaction between sex and study arm was used to compare the IRR in men versus the IRR in women under the null hypothesis of no difference (two-sided test of the interaction term). Note that only the FIT×2 controls (individuals randomized 2014–2016, during which individuals could be allocated to FIT×2) were used in the comparison of FIT×2 versus control in this study, whereas all controls (randomized 2014–2018, including the FIT×2 controls) were used in the comparison of primary colonoscopy versus control.

The full follow-up of up to a maximum of almost 7 years was used in the above analyses. In a complementary analysis, we also computed incidence rates and IRRs at each year of follow-up. Individuals were censored if and when they migrated out of Sweden. Individuals were similarly not considered at risk after their date of death. We assessed potential violations of equidispersion for each regression model and computed alternative CIs by use of robust standard errors. Because there were no signs of meaningful underdispersion or overdispersion and results were virtually identical, we did not report these analyses.

In a complementary analysis, we computed competing risk cumulative incidence curves of CRC (overall and by stage) where death from any cause was considered a competing risk.

We report baseline characteristics in participants and non-participants of the intervention arms along with diagnosed CRCs and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events that occurred during the intervention phase. Individuals in the primary colonoscopy arm were considered to be participants if they underwent a screening colonoscopy, and individuals in the FIT×2 arm were considered participants if they returned a FIT in any of the two rounds.

Stata version 13.1 and R version 4.0.2 were used for power calculations. Analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2.

Parkinson's disease is a long term neurological condition that gradually worsens over time. More than one million people in the United States are living with the disorder, and about 90,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Current medications and therapies can ease symptoms, but no treatment has been proven to stop or slow the disease itself.

The condition is closely linked to a drop in dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical messenger that plays a critical role in controlling movement, as well as supporting memory, mood, and other essential functions. As dopamine producing brain cells progressively die off, the brain loses its ability to properly regulate movement. This breakdown leads to the hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's, including tremors, muscle stiffness, and slowed motion.

Researchers at Keck Medicine of USC are now testing a new approach that aims to address this dopamine loss directly. In an early phase clinical trial, doctors are implanting specially engineered stem cells into the brain. These cells are designed to replace damaged neurons and generate dopamine.

"If the brain can once again produce normal levels of dopamine, Parkinson's disease may be slowed down and motor function restored," said Brian Lee, MD, PhD, a neurosurgeon with Keck Medicine and principal investigator of the study.

Reprogrammed Stem Cells Designed to Produce Dopamine

The treatment uses a newer type of lab created stem cell known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Unlike embryonic stem cells, iPSCs are made by taking adult cells, such as those from skin or blood, and reprogramming them back into a versatile state. In this form, they can develop into many different kinds of cells in the body.

"We believe that these iPSCs can reliably mature into dopamine-producing brain cells, and offer the best chance of jump-starting the brain's dopamine production," said Xenos Mason, MD, a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders with Keck Medicine and co-principal investigator of the study.

Brain Implant Procedure and Long Term Monitoring

To deliver the cells, Lee creates a small opening in the skull to reach the brain. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for guidance, he carefully places the stem cells into the basal ganglia, the region responsible for coordinating movement.

After the operation, participants are closely observed for 12-15 months to track changes in symptoms and watch for potential side effects, including dyskinesia -- excess movements -- or infection. Researchers plan to continue following patients and monitoring their condition for up to five years.

"Our ultimate goal is to pioneer a technique that can repair patients' motor function and offer them a better quality of life," said Lee.

Keck Medicine is one of three sites in the United States taking part in the study. The multisite clinical trial includes 12 people with moderate to moderate-severe Parkinson's disease.

The stem cell therapy, known as RNDP-001, is produced by Kenai Therapeutics, a biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for neurological disorders. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has granted the clinical trial, Phase 1 REPLACE™, fast-track designation, which is intended to speed up the development and review process.

Disclosure: Mason has received an honorarium payment from Kenai Therapeutics in the past.

Older adults who live with higher levels of air pollution are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, according to new research led by Yanling Deng of Emory University, U.S.A. The study was published February 17th in the open access journal PLOS Medicine.

Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia and affects roughly 57 million people worldwide. Scientists have long recognized air pollution as a risk factor for Alzheimer's, as well as for chronic conditions such as hypertension, stroke, and depression. Because these conditions are also tied to dementia, researchers have questioned whether polluted air raises Alzheimer's risk indirectly by contributing to those illnesses, or whether it harms the brain more directly. Another possibility was that existing health problems could make the brain more sensitive to pollution.

Large Medicare Study of 27.8 Million Older Adults

To explore these questions, the Emory team analyzed data from more than 27.8 million U.S. Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older between 2000 and 2018. They compared levels of air pollution exposure with new cases of Alzheimer's disease, while carefully considering the presence of other chronic health conditions.

The analysis revealed that people exposed to higher levels of air pollution had a greater likelihood of developing Alzheimer's. The relationship was somewhat stronger among individuals who had previously suffered a stroke. In contrast, hypertension and depression did not meaningfully increase the pollution related risk.

Direct Brain Effects of Fine Particulate Pollution

Taken together, the results indicate that air pollution may raise Alzheimer's risk mainly through direct effects on the brain rather than by triggering other chronic diseases. At the same time, a history of stroke appears to increase vulnerability, suggesting that certain individuals face compounded risks.

The findings also point to cleaner air as a potential strategy for lowering dementia rates and protecting cognitive health in aging populations.

The authors add, "In this large national study of older adults, we found that long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution was associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease, largely through direct effects on the brain rather than through common chronic conditions such as hypertension, stroke, or depression."

"Our findings suggest that individuals with a history of stroke may be particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of air pollution on brain health, highlighting an important intersection between environmental and vascular risk factors."

A sweeping new investigation by the Silent Spring Institute has found dozens of potentially harmful chemicals in widely sold hair extensions, including those made from human hair. The findings represent the most detailed chemical review so far of this largely unregulated beauty product category. Researchers say the results add strong evidence that hair extensions may pose health risks, particularly for black women, who use these products at much higher rates.

The study was published in the American Chemical Society journal Environment & Health and comes at a time of growing concern about the long term health effects of hair extensions. More than 70 percent of black women report wearing hair extensions at least once in the past year, compared with fewer than 10 percent of women from other racial and ethnic groups. Extensions are often worn for cultural expression, personal style, and convenience.

"While prior reports have found some chemicals of concern in hair extensions, there's still much we don't know about their overall chemical makeup. We wanted to get a better picture of the extent of the problem," says lead author Dr. Elissia Franklin, a research scientist at Silent Spring Institute. "This is an industry that has long overlooked the health of black women, who should not have to choose between cultural expression, convenience, and their health."

Chemical Treatments and Limited Ingredient Disclosure

Hair extensions are produced from synthetic fibers or bio-based materials, including human hair. Manufacturers frequently treat these fibers with chemicals to make them flame resistant, waterproof, or antimicrobial.

"Yet, companies rarely disclose the chemicals used to achieve these properties, leaving consumers in the dark about the health risks from prolonged wear," says Franklin. Because the fibers rest directly against the scalp and neck, wearers may experience extended skin contact. When extensions are heated during styling, they can also release chemicals into the air that users may inhale.

How 43 Hair Extension Products Were Tested

To better understand what these products contain, Franklin purchased 43 popular hair extension brands from online retailers and local beauty supply stores. The team grouped the products by fiber type, synthetic (mostly plastic polymers) or bio-based (including human, banana or silk), and documented the claims listed on their packaging. Among the synthetic products, 19 claimed to be flame retardant, three were labeled water resistant, nine advertised heat resistance, and three promoted "green" claims such as "no PVC" or "non-toxic."

Researchers then applied a method known as non-targeted analysis to search for a broad array of chemicals, including substances not typically screened in consumer goods. Using two-dimensional gas chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry, they detected more than 900 chemical signatures, representing both known and previously unidentified compounds. Machine-learning tools compared those signatures with an extensive chemical database, allowing the team to identify 169 chemicals spanning nine major structural classes.

Cancer Linked and Hormone Disrupting Substances Found

The testing uncovered numerous substances associated with cancer, hormone disruption, developmental harm, and immune system effects. These included flame retardants, phthalates, pesticides, styrene, tetrachloroethane, and organotins.

Key findings include:

"We were especially surprised to find organotins," says Franklin. "These are commonly used as heat stabilizers in PVC and have been linked with skin irritation, which is a common complaint among hair extension users." Organotins have also been linked with cancer and hormone disruption.

Growing Calls for Stronger Regulation

The global hair extension market is projected to surpass $14 billion by 2028, with the United States leading in global imports. Given the size of the market and the chemicals detected, Franklin argues that more oversight is needed. "These findings make clear that stronger oversight is urgently needed to protect consumers and push companies to invest in making safer products," she says.

Many of the detected substances are included under Proposition 65, suggesting that hair extensions may warrant clearer warnings and closer regulatory scrutiny.

Efforts to change policy are gaining traction. In New York, lawmakers have introduced legislation that would require manufacturers of synthetic braids and hair extensions to disclose all ingredients. In New Jersey, a bill moving through the legislature would prohibit certain harmful chemicals in synthetic hair products.

At the national level, the Safer Beauty Bill Package, introduced in Congress last year, contains provisions that would direct the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the safety of synthetic braids and hair extensions.

Funding for this project was provided by a Beauty Justice Grant from the Environmental Defense Fund and charitable donations to Silent Spring Institute, including the Institute's Safer Chemicals Program.

The post-apocalypse adds a new setting (the outside world!) and new intrigue (billionaires are always up to something) when Paradise, Hulu's dystopian thriller, returns. Season two brings back the show's flashes of melodrama and frequent pop culture references, emphasizing its complicated characters while also reminding the viewer that this is taking place in a version of our world that's gone very, very sideways.

Season one, which unfolded almost entirely in an underground city created to withstand a global environmental disaster, closed the case on its presidential assassination whodunit—but left plenty of bunker-bound intrigue in its wake.

The main timeline of season two picks up just a few weeks after season one, but once again Paradise—created by This Is Us' Dan Fogelman—relies on frequent flashbacks to bring fresh context and perspective to what we only think we know. A big reason Paradise is so entertaining is the way it constantly subverts expectations, springing surprise twists that in retrospect feel logical rather than random—and revealing over and over that first impressions aren't always what they seem.

It is very carefully plotted, with breadcrumbs of various significance sprinkled across the early episodes, then highlighted in the “previously on” segments that become essential parts of the Paradise viewing experience.

Paradise season two once again runs eight episodes, with the first three arriving together; it's a smart choice since each episode focuses on a different character and entry point into the drama. (io9 was provided with the first seven episodes for the purposes of this spoiler-free review.)

We don't have to wait very long to see how Secret Service agent Xavier Collins (Sterling K. Brown, who brings plenty of gravitas but also looks convincingly like a guy who could kill you with his hands) fared after escaping the bunker. In the course of discovering who killed President Cal Bradford (James Marsden), Xavier uncovered hidden truths about the bunker and its most powerful resident, billionaire Samantha “Sinatra” Redmond (Julianne Nicholson). He also found out his presumed-dead wife, Teri (Enuka Okuma), had survived the disaster and was still somewhere near Atlanta, her last known location—which is exactly where Xavier points the small plane he appropriates from the bunker's stash.

All three of those storylines—Xavier's journey to find Teri, Sinatra's desire to conceal just how deep her well of secrets goes, and Teri's survival struggles after what Paradise calls “the Day”—propel season two. After barely getting any time with Teri in season one, we finally get a chance to see why Xavier thinks she hung the moon, and the show is better for it.

Season two also digs into the turmoil left behind in Liberty Grove, the underground community that even Paradise itself has started calling “Paradise.” After season one's upheavals, the facade of normalcy is poised to crumble anew with every new confrontation.

This includes the tension between Sinatra, recovering from a bullet wound sustained in the season one finale, and her former confidante, Dr. Gabriela Torabi (Sarah Shahi). There's also the increasing distrust that Agent Nicole Robinson (Krys Marshall) feels about Agent Jane Driscoll (Nicole Brydon Bloom), who viewers well know is a vicious killer only pretending to be, as Robinson once pegged her, “Holly Hobbie with a gun.”

As Paradise switches between these separate—yet interlinked, all part of the show's precise design—plotlines, it also makes room for brand-new characters. While fans might be eager to see what happened to Xavier and Sinatra immediately, season two instead spends its entire premiere with a fresh face: Annie (Shailene Woodley), a med school dropout who's just starting to find happiness working as a tour guide at Graceland (another example of interlinking: as we know, Teri's such a big Elvis fan, her daughter with Xavier is named “Presley”) when disaster strikes.

Annie's experiences give us a whole new point of view on the Day as well as the first three years of its devastating aftermath. Since season one was so bunker-focused, the audience was shielded from witnessing the environmental nightmares, including the deep freeze caused by the supervolcano's giant ash cloud. There are also considerable challenges associated with living in a world where an EMP, set off by Bradford to prevent nuclear war, has knocked out all power sources beyond the most primitive.

We immediately care about Annie. She's all alone and would prefer to keep it that way, so we feel her terror when a group of rough-looking men suddenly appears at Graceland's gate. That said, like many of the characters on Paradise, they're not what they seem at first. It's in this way we meet another significant new character: Link, played by Thomas Doherty.

Paradise manages to successfully juggle all these threads because each character has a very clear destination, a very clear motivation, or often both. We don't always know what's driving them at first, but they do, and that helps the pieces of the narrative slot into place. Even the most slippery characters have an inner code—which is not always a moral code, mind you—that they remain loyal to above everything else.

That includes Jane, whose tendencies toward evil are further explored across season two—very necessary, after sort of materializing out of nowhere in season one—and the deeply complex Sinatra, who remains Paradise's most enigmatic character even as we learn more about her.

If you watched the trailer, you heard her say, “It was never just about the bunker,” and that tantalizing statement becomes the rabbit hole that season two plunges into. Strap in, and cringe at some of the music choices if you must—but know you're in for a hell of a ride, as Paradise spins another gripping story about how the end of the world can inspire some of the very best and very worst choices among what's left of humanity.

Paradise returns to Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ on February 23 with a three-episode drop and a weekly rollout thereafter.

Update 2/20/2026 8:40 am PT: We have added Acer's statement to Tom's Hardware below, along with other updates on the situation.

It's not a fun time to be a computing enthusiast in Germany. Besides the high RAM and SSD prices everyone else is experiencing, both Asus and Acer's German websites are completely down due to the companies' recent spat with Nokia over the HEVC codec — meaning customers can't find any downloads or reach support pages for their hardware. (For example, obtaining BIOS updates and drivers.) Computerbase.de first reported the news.

 






It's not just the German websites that are offline; any German user trying to work around the issue by visiting the US version of the websites will also be redirected to a page stating the sites are unreachable. Trying to use a VPN and setting (for example) a U.S. location to reach the German sites doesn't work either. Their only recourse is to use a VPN endpoint outside Germany and visit the non-German websites to find downloads for their wares.

In a further update to the original story, ComputerBase has now confirmed that affected users can obtain drivers for Asus motherboards using the Asus DriverHub; this won't work on notebooks or NUCs, and requires the aforementioned software (the site is still inaccessible). The site has further identified a workaround enabled by visiting Acer's Swiss support website, which is published in German, so it doesn't even require translation.

The origin of this issue is the recent lawsuit from Nokia against both companies over royalties for the HEVC codec. Nokia managed to get a German court to issue an injunction against both makers, blocking them from "offering, placing on the market, using, or importing or possessing such devices in Germany." It's worth noting that Germany is the largest consumer computing market in Europe.

In a public statement, Asus said that "all after-sales services in Germany remain fully operational, and existing customers will continue to receive uninterrupted support in full compliance with the current court order," adding that it is "evaluating and pursuing further legal action to reach a fair resolution as soon as possible".

The fact that the websites are completely down runs counter to this statement. There's no telling if email support has also been taken offline, but you couldn't even find that to begin with. The fact that — at least for Asus — the blocking also affects German users visiting the U.S. website also seems excessive.

In a further response to this story, Acer issued Tom's Hardware with the following statement: "Acer respects the intellectual property of other companies and organizations. In accordance with a ruling by the Munich Regional Court between Nokia and Acer we were required to temporarily suspend our sales activities in Germany for the impacted products. At the same time, we are reviewing additional legal options in order to reach a fair solution as quickly as possible. As long as the litigation is ongoing, we cannot comment on further details. Numerous product categories such as monitors, routers, e‑scooters, and accessories are not impacted by the ruling and remain available."

While it's hard to pin down the exact rationale for a complete geo-block of both German websites and German users, it's simply due to unintended consequences. In theory, all the companies would have to do would be to ensure that their respective German online stores are disabled, and that any other regions' stores no longer ship to Germany, but the block is much broader.

It's also not impossible that the injunction's wording could be overly broad, and the companies are playing on the safe side. In the past, Oppo/OnePlus, Vivo, and Lenovo went through similar situations, but reports indicate that their respective websites weren't completely taken offline.

Lucid Motors is laying off 12% of its workforce in a bid to “improve operational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability,” according to an internal memo that was obtained by TechCrunch. 

Hourly workers on the manufacturing, logistics, and quality teams are not affected by the cuts, according to the memo, which was sent to employees being spared by the layoffs. It's unclear exactly how many workers are being laid off, but it is likely in the hundreds. Lucid Motors reported having 6,800 full-time employees globally at the end of 2024.

“Saying goodbye to colleagues is never easy,” interim CEO Marc Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted by today's actions, and we are providing severance, bonus, continued health benefits, and transition support to help them through this period.” The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The cuts come as the company is in the middle of ramping up production and deliveries of its Gravity SUV. While Lucid Motors struggled with Gravity production and quality issues during the first few months, the company has been able to pick up the pace, and ultimately doubled its 2024 output last year.

The company is also preparing to launch a more affordable mid-size EV later this year that is expected to cost around $50,000. It's collaborating with Uber and autonomous vehicle company Nuro on launching a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area this year, too. The company is scheduled to release its financial results for 2025 next week.

“Importantly, today's actions do not affect our strategy,” Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “Our core priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to focus on the start of production of our Midsize platform. With disciplined execution, we are also focused on further expansion into the robotaxi market, continued ADAS and software development, and growth in sales of Lucid Gravity and Air across existing and new geographies.”

Lucid Motors has now gone almost a full year without a permanent CEO. Peter Rawlinson, who was the company's chief executive and chief technical officer, abruptly resigned on February 25, 2025. Since then, Lucid Motors has seen a significant amount of turnover in its executive ranks, including the loss of its chief engineer, who sued the company in December for wrongful termination and discrimination. (Lucid Motors has called his legal claims “absurd.”)

They don't come cheap, but TG is picking up warranty service, so it's a more sensible option than it looks.

Folks who follow hardware might recall that, right about a year ago, Thermal Grizzly started selling delidded Ryzen 7 9800X3D processors for a small markup. These CPUs are functionally identical to the chips sold by AMD — indeed, they were chips sold by AMD to begin with — except that they've had their Integrated Heatspreaders (IHS) removed. Well, if the Ryzen 7 9800X3D isn't good enough for you anymore, you can now pick up a Ryzen 7 9850X3D with the top popped for a bit extra.

 






It makes more sense than you think, even at the eye-watering prices the company is asking. You pay the cost up-front, and you get the best (or one of the best) gaming CPUs in the world, delidded by Thermal Grizzly's technicians and then verified for correct operation. Once that's verified, they put the whole thing in a box, including the delidded CPU, the removed IHS, and a USB flash drive that includes the testing protocol and a screenshot of the results. It also comes with a microscope image of the delidded processor and a small card describing the delidding results.

With the new addition, Thermal Grizzly is now offering four models of delidded CPUs. That's the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Ryzen 7 9850X3D, and Ryzen 9 9950X3D, and then Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K for those who bleed true blue. They don't come cheap; US pricing listed on the site right now comes out to $794.43 for a 9800X3D, $876.33 for a 9850X3D, and a whopping $1168.83 for the 16-core 9950X3D. Meanwhile, the Intel chip is a bit cheaper at $934.83.

 




Given that AMD and Intel are obviously not going to warranty your modified CPU, Thermal Grizzly itself is taking on the burden of warranty service for the delidded chips. The company warranties the chips for 24 months from the date of purchase, and for the first year, TG will take responsibility for nearly any chip failure that isn't caused by obvious user damage to the CPU. Quite generous, although it also doesn't cover "overclocking beyond the manufacturer's specified values"; a bit peculiar given that we expect most people who delid their CPUs are chasing clocks, not improved thermals or better acoustics.

Thermal Grizzly notes on the product page that the chips are "Optimal for TG Direct-Die cooling solutions," but also specifically remarks that the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is not compatible with its Direct Die frames. The company also notes that the stock heatspreader must "never be used under any circumstances" and that using the original heatspreader will void the warranty offered by Thermal Grizzly. Given that, it's a little odd that the part is included, but I suppose you could turn it into a keychain or something.

For folks who want to get into direct-die cooling, or who simply want the absolute best cooling efficiency, this saves a lot of hassle, but there are absolutely still challenges to be aware of. Oldheads like this nerd in particular will recall the bad old days of the original AMD Athlon, which came bare-die with no heatspreader; it was all too easy to crack those chips when installing a heatsink. That risk is no less salient today with delidded CPUs. Moreover, you've got to make sure that your cooling solution is properly spaced for the lid-less chip; both AMD and Intel use thick heatspreaders that will leave an air gap under their stock heatsinks. Head over to the Thermal Grizzly site if you'd like to ponder the idea of buying a scandalous naked CPU.

Peak XV announced on Friday that it has raised $1.3 billion across new India and Asia-focused funds. The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.

The capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.

Peak XV split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia's portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.

The firm's new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.

Singh said Peak XV is not trying to match rivals dollar-for-dollar, emphasizing that the firm's priority is generating strong returns rather than maximizing assets under management. The firm will continue to size its funds based on where it sees the best opportunity to deliver “high-performing funds,” he said.

He added that Peak XV is still building its presence in the U.S. and is selective about where it competes. “In the U.S. market, we are an underdog — and that's great,” Singh said, adding that the firm is focusing on areas where its experience in software, developer tools, and fintech gives it an edge.

The latest fundraise follows a period of leadership changes at Peak XV, including the recent departures of senior partner Ashish Agrawal and investors Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma. Singh told TechCrunch the firm retains significant experience on its leadership team, noting that five of its seven managing partners have been with Peak XV for more than a decade. The broader Peak XV team includes more than 30 full-time investors, with about a dozen leading investments across its markets.

Peak XV has returned more than $7 billion in cash to investors since inception, Singh said, adding that 35 of its portfolio companies have gone public. He declined to specify distributions since the firm's split from Sequoia Capital. In September 2024, TechCrunch reported that the firm had returned about $1.2 billion in the year.

Ahead of the current raise, Peak XV's prior fund was sized at $2.85 billion in late 2021, before the firm split from Sequoia Capital. That figure was later reduced to about $2.4 billion as part of what Singh described as a disciplined approach to capital. The earlier pool included Peak XV's India growth strategy, and Singh said the firm does not plan to raise a new growth fund until more of that dry powder is deployed.

Singh expects to deploy the new capital primarily into AI, fintech, and consumer startups, while also seeing emerging opportunities in deep tech. The firm has made more than 80 investments in AI startups to date. He added that the U.S.-India ties are becoming increasingly important as more founders in the region build for global markets.

I spend a lot of time reading HN — I wanted something that felt like a proper Mac app: a sidebar for browsing stories, an integrated reader for articles, and comment threading — all in one window. Essentially, I wanted HN to feel like a first-class citizen on macOS, not a website I visit.What it does:- Split-view layout — stories in a sidebar on the left, articles and comments on the right, using the standard macOS NavigationSplitView pattern.- Built-in ad blocking — a precompiled WKContentRuleList blocks 14 major ad networks (DoubleClick, Google Syndication, Criteo, Taboola, Outbrain, Amazon ads, etc.) right in the WebKit layer. No extensions needed. Toggleable in settings.- Pop-up blocking — kills window.open() calls. Also toggleable.- HN account login — full authentication flow (login, account creation, password reset). Session is stored in the macOS Keychain, and cookies are injected into the WebView so you can upvote, comment, and submit stories while staying logged in.- Bookmarks — save stories locally for offline access. Persisted with Codable serialization, searchable and filterable independently.- Search and filtering — powered by the Algolia HN API. Filter by content type (All, Ask, Show, Jobs, Comments), date range (Today, Past Week, Past Month, All Time), and sort by hot or recent.- Scroll progress indicator — a small orange bar at the top tracks your reading progress via JavaScript-to-native messaging.- Auto-updates via Sparkle with EdDSA-signed updates served from GitHub Pages.- Dark mode — respects system appearance with CSS and meta tag injection.Tech details for the curious:The whole app is ~2,050 lines of Swift across 16 files.

I'm probably just a anti-app guy, but I tried it out.First thing I went to do was CMD-F to search for some strings in the comments section.Actually, the real first thing I did, was click on the left-side article preview  on the text that said "1 hr ago | 63 comments" thinking it'd navigate me to the comments.  See, I like my native hyper-links.

Am I missing some core concept here?  Why would I want to browse the web in this app as opposed to a web browser?

reply

I like native apps for things, even link aggregators, because my I want to use my OS's native window management and app management instead of just shoving everything into a browser tab, of which I already have too many. Because then it's just CMD+Tab to Chrome, and then figure out which of the 20+ tabs I'm trying to get to instead of CMD+Tab directly to that specific app.Anyway, just a bit of old man yelling at cloud but I've always disliked the proliferation of "web app all the things." Might as well not even use a desktop OS at this point and just have a full screen browser window and call it a day.

It's just nice to have HN as it's own app instead of just another tab in a single app. Same reason I use mail.app vs. webmail, native music app vs the web player, etc.PWAs also solve the problem, more or less, but it is nice to have something native.

I've been doing this too; at some point I should probably just change the scaling of my desktop as a whole. But I like my high resolution, multiple windows layout too much to do it yet!

This is a good start, but I think a better approach would be to piggyback off of ublock origin's lists. Hopefully less maintenance that way too.

reply

That won't work. uBlock origin is licensed GPLv3 (https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), this code is MIT licensed (https://github.com/IronsideXXVI/Hacker-News).

reply

@IronsideXXVI, are you open to changing to gpl v3? Otherwise, there is probably a decent set of filter lists with an MIT license somewhere. The goal is for you to NOT become a filter list maintainer, and by piggybacking off an already respected set of lists, you'd build user trust in your adblocking.

I don't necessarily have a ready solution to offer, but these are the obstacles preventing someone like me from being able to use apps like this comfortably and safely, especially knowing we are entering a transitional period where new apps are being vibe-coded every day and formal verification has not yet caught up.Even if a given app has had every line of code reviewed by a human, or has well-defined interfaces that allow for sloppier internal code, how do I know that without cracking it open myself or asking an agent to help me audit it?

Fender has been a big name in the audio world for a long time, but even old dogs learn new tricks, and the guitar icon's newest trick is a pair of wireless headphones. For the first time, you can wear Fender on your head instead of slung over your shoulder, thanks to the Mix, a pair of Fender-branded wireless headphones that focus on modularity—the earcups, batteries, and headbands are all replaceable here.

If you notice, I wrote “Fender-branded” headphones, and your alarm bells are going off, let me elaborate: Fender isn't technically making the hardware (that would be a company called Riffsound Pte. Ltd.), though it does have a say in its design. And if your next thought is, “Do I really want a no-name pair of wireless headphones with some Fender branding on them?” I'm right there with you—or, I was before I tried them for myself.

Fender Mix

The modular Fender Mix are a strong start for the iconic guitar brand's first-ever pair of wireless headphones.

Pros

Cons

When I first saw the Fender Mix over a video call last summer, I was immediately intrigued. Fender's focus on modularity made its wireless headphones stand out, but there was one thing in particular that had me interested above the rest: a dongle. The Fender Mix come with a USB-C dongle that you can stick into your phone or another device to achieve lossless, low-latency audio. It's not a novel solution—competitors like Sennheiser's HDB 630 also employ that design—but it is somewhat rare, especially at the Mix's price point. Fender's wireless headphones cost $299 as opposed to the Sennheiser HDB 630's $499.

Why exactly was I so intrigued by a dongle, you ask? Well, because I'm not typically a wire guy, that's why. As much as I love how affordable and hi-fi wired headphones are, how a lot of them look, they're a pain to deal with on the train. Fumbling around with wires is easier at home than it is on the go, which is often when I'm using headphones. Dongles like the one included in the Fender Mix eliminate that pain point in theory and, as I've learned, in practice as well—all while providing a better-than-Bluetooth listening experience.

Trust me when I say that you're going to want to use the Fender Mix's dongle to listen to music. While the headphones sound solid with a standard Bluetooth connection, slotting the dongle into my phone and playing tunes that way moves the needle from solid to legitimately good. The second you're plugged in and the dongle is powered on, the soundstage widens, and things start to feel a lot roomier. I listened to Pavement's “Cut Your Hair” back-to-back, and the whole song had more presence. Snare hits were louder, vocals were more upfront, and the mix of guitars was more evenly spread out, making it easier to pick up on each track. As an added bonus, there's also a volume boost, which makes listening in loud environments easier. The bass profile is fairly pronounced, which isn't my preferred tuning, but if bass is your thing, you'll be pleased here.

It's nice that you don't have to use a dongle, but you're going to want to once you hear the difference.

Don't make the same mistake I did when I first started using the dongle, though. There are different modes that you have to activate in order to use all the features. To get to the lossless mode, you have to long-press the button on the dongle (about 3 seconds) until the light turns red. For low latency, you double-tap the button on the dongle. These wireless headphones also have Auracast, which lets you group audio products together for simultaneous listening, and to activate that feature, you tap the dongle button three times until the light turns purple.

I also tested the dongle's low-latency mode by playing some Fortnite on my laptop and was pleased with the speed. Having tried to use regular Bluetooth wireless earbuds in the past to play, the Fender Mix were leaps and bounds better for making sure I heard every gunshot and footfall on time. I wouldn't replace a gaming headset with the Mix anytime soon, but if you did want to use these headphones in a pinch when you're traveling, they're not a bad option. Yes, most headphones can be used wired in some capacity, but the Fender Mix gives you low-latency audio without wires.

One of the best parts of the dongle is that once you're done using it, you can easily take it out of your phone or another device and put it in the headphones, so you don't lose it. To store the tiny piece of important plastic and metal, just take off the magnetic earcup and place it into its rightful slot. Boom, you're done.

Powering the Fender Mix's sound are what the company is calling 40mm “hyper-efficient graphene drivers,” which definitely hold their own compared to other headphones at this price range, including Nothing's Headphone 1, which also debuted at $299. Ultimately, though, it's the USB-C dongle that provides the real strength here, and that's fine by me since the Fender Mix's sound quality is so good.

Outside of the dongle, the Fender Mix are also highly customizable and repairable. As I mentioned, the earcups are magnetic and can be popped off easily. Luckily, they still feel sturdy when they're attached, though. You can also replace the battery inside the Fender Mix, which is great since batteries are often the first thing to go in headphones. I didn't try to do this myself since I don't have an extra battery, but I did pop it out just to see how easy the whole thing was, and it felt pretty straightforward. Just pull the right earcup off, slide the plastic lid off the battery compartment, and then pull the whole thing out.

If you want to customize the Fender Mix, there are earcups that you can buy. My black unit came with additional tan earcups. Weirdly, Fender didn't share pricing for them. I've reached out to the company and will update this review with pricing info when I have it.

The earcups aren't premium-feeling in any way, but they are comfortable, and it's hard to speak to durability since that type of thing takes many months of use. I did notice some scuffing on the outside of the left earcup after keeping the headphones in my bag for a little over a week, so take that anecdote how you will. Headbands are also replaceable, and though I wasn't provided an additional headband, the process of taking off both earcups (speakers and all) was easy. Just pull them straight from the band with a little force, and you've got everything in neat little pieces.

I wouldn't describe the build quality as feeling premium, nor is the design particularly eye-catching—they're a bit bulky for my taste. The lack of imagination here is easy to forgive in my opinion, considering all of the other unique, thoughtful features that the Fender Mix have going for them.

Buttons are also on the conservative side, but they're responsible for controlling a lot. There are just two buttons on these headphones: a joystick-like button and a longer, flatter button. The joystick button (which can be moved left, right, up, or down) controls things like track skipping, on/off, and adjusting volume (and checking battery levels with a double-press), while the flatter button switches between EQ modes and also ANC modes. I highly recommend taking a look at the manual I've linked here (page 3) to see which button commands do what, because these two pieces of plastic/rubber are responsible for a lot. This is just how it goes when you don't have a companion app.

At the end of the day, the Fender Mix's defining feature is their modularity, and on that front these wireless headphones excel. If you're looking for style, you can always go with Nothing's Headphone 1—those are guaranteed to turn heads on your commute into work.

On top of good sound, the Fender Mix also perform well in two other key departments: active noise-cancellation (ANC) and battery life. I put the Mix through an obligatory subway test and was pleased at the amount of sound that these wireless headphones block out. Even if it was due mostly to the passive effect of the tight-fitting earcups or the ANC, I think most people will be happy with the Mix's sound-blocking acumen. These wireless headphones aren't going to unseat Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) as my favorite ANC headphones, but they're no slouch either.

There is an ambient mode (transparency to hear your surroundings), which is okay, but not mind-blowing. It lets some sound in, but my voice still sounds a little tinny—Apple's AirPods Max still have the best transparency in town. There's also a mode for having ANC and transparency off, which could be useful for extending battery life, but not much else.

While ANC is solid, battery life is actually impressive. Fender advertises up to 52 hours when ANC is activated and up to 100 hours when it's turned off. Having used the Fender Mix on and off for the majority of a 10-hour workday, it seems Fender isn't lying. With ANC mostly on, I started the day at 100% battery, and I finished at 89%. Unfortunately, you can't check the exact battery level on the wireless headphones (using the battery status command via the headphone button only gives you general levels in 25% increments), but I was able to monitor the exact level thanks to a feature in Apple's iOS.

For context, comparable competitors like Nothing's Headphone 1 get up to 35 hours of battery life with ANC on and about 80 hours with ANC off. On the battery front, the Fender Mix is a clear winner.

If there's one thing I can knock Fender for a little bit, it's not being the most feature-rich. While the Mix have ANC, there are no perks like a personalized hearing test or customizable EQ. Those aren't dealbreakers (I'm sure lots of people don't even know those features exist), but as someone who's taken advantage of them in the past, I can attest that they're nice to have.

Instead of adjustable EQ, there are different preset EQ modes: one for music, one for entertainment, and one for voice. I personally didn't notice a huge difference when switching between music and voice EQ modes while listening to a podcast, which is a bummer. I did notice a bit more difference when in the entertainment EQ while streaming Hulu, though—it sounds just a a tad more immersive. To cycle through those, you have to use the Mix's buttons, which is less than ideal, especially because the in-ear voice that tells you which setting you're on is hard to hear over music. I found myself having to turn the music off just to know which preset I was switching to.

Speaking of hard of hearing, calling with the Fender Mix was also less than ideal. While the voice quality is fine, I'm told that the Fender Mix tend to pick up quite a bit of ambient noise, which can be distracting for the person on the other end of the line. I was also calling from my office, which isn't a particularly noisy place. The ambient noise pickup is particularly surprising given the fact that Fender touts a dual-mic design with “ENC,” which is short for environmental noise-cancellation. I suppose if you're in a quiet spot, you may not notice any problems, but be wary of using these wireless headphones while out and about.

In the future, I'd love to see Fender include an app to expand the capabilities of the Mix and give a secondary input method outside of physical controls, but the start is at least solid. The Mix, as I mentioned, do have newer features like Auracast so clearly Fender has its eye on ways to enhance its headphones with software. If you're reading, Fender, take this as a formal invite to expand EQ options!

The Fender Mix are a strong start from a brand just dipping its toes into the wireless headphones game, and the best part is that Fender isn't phoning it in. It's taking modularity seriously with the Mix, which is great for consumers and theoretically better for the environment. On top of that, the included dongle makes what would otherwise be a pretty mid-sounding pair of wireless headphones into good-sounding ones. All of that for $299, coupled with the fact that these wireless headphones also have great battery life and solid ANC, makes the Mix worthy of consideration.

Turns out licensing your name can be more than a gimmick, and Fender is proof. You'll need to wait to order a pair, though; Fender says it plans to open pre-orders “in the next couple of days” when I asked them on Feb. 18.

It's no secret that the electrical grid is aging, but one part stands out from the rest. Transformers haven't changed much since Thomas Edison made his first light bulb. 

Now, a string of startups are working to modernize the transformer, replacing it with modern power electronics that promise to give grid operators more control over how and where electricity flows. 

“It becomes a very powerful device, equivalent to your internet router,” Subhashish Bhattacharya, co-founder and CTO of DG Matrix, told TechCrunch.

Three startups recently raised sizable rounds to scale up production of their solid-state transformer technologies. This week, DG Matrix raised a $60 million Series A and Heron Power raised $140 million in a Series B round. In November, Amperesand raised $80 million to chase after the burgeoning data center market.

Existing transformers are reliable and efficient, but that's about it. They're relatively crude instruments, made largely of copper and iron. They react passively to changes on the grid and are capable of tackling only one task per device.

“An old-school steel, copper, and oil transformer doesn't have any monitoring, doesn't have any control,” Drew Baglino, founder and CEO of Heron Power, told TechCrunch. In instances where electricity surges or a power plant trips offline, that can be a liability.

The devices can incorporate power from a range of difference sources — including traditional power plants, renewables, and batteries — and transform that electricity into either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) at a number of different voltages, allowing them to replace several devices.

For data centers, solid-state transformers offer an appealing alternative, allowing them to shrink the footprint of their power systems while giving them finer control over where and how electricity is directed.

Solid-state transformers poised to arrive at a time when existing transformers are aging and demand for new ones is surging — a classic tech supercycle. Most transformers on the grid today are several decades old, according to the National Laboratory of the Rockies. As demand from data centers, EV chargers, and other parts of the grid rises, the NLR expects the amount of power flowing through transformers to double by 2050.

While data centers are the the first market those companies are chasing, they also have their sights set on the electrical grid, which in the U.S. alone hosts as many as 80 million transformers. 

“All of the distribution transformers are ultimately going to need to be replaced. Over 50% of them are 35 years old. There's a big need for an upgrade,” Baglino said.

Because they're are made from silicon-based materials, they're flexible, controllable, and software-updatable. They're also immune from price fluctuations that rock the copper market.

“Power semiconductors keep getting cheaper. Steel, copper, and oil, unfortunately, is not in that situation,” Baglino said. “Commodity prices can move all over the place, and they generally move up.” 

In an old-style transformer, power flows into the transformer through copper wires wound around one side of an O-shaped iron core. As the electricity flows, it induces a magnetic field in the core. On the other side of the core, the magnetic field induces electricity in another set of copper windings. If the wires wrap around the core more times on the input side than the output side, the voltage decreases on the output side. If the ratio inverts, the output voltage increases.

Solid-state transformers eschew the copper windings in favor of semiconductors, using materials like silicon carbide or gallium nitride to handle frequency conversion. They can come in a range of configurations, with the most comprehensive setup consisting of three basic parts: a rectifier that converts alternating current to direct current, a converter that changes the voltage of the direct current, and an inverter that changes the direct current back into alternating current.

Unlike iron-core transformers, solid-state transformers can handle power that flows in both directions, making them useful in places that need backup power, like data centers. 

In a data center, a solid-state transformer can replace several different pieces of equipment, not just the transformer that steps voltage down from the grid. Every data center uses backup power, which requires a string of devices to bring power into the facility. Solid-state transformers can handle all of those duties in one box.

The technology also allows data centers to more easily integrate so-called behind-the-meter power, where generating capacity is connected directly to the data center, not the grid. Those typically require another set of transformers.

And when coupled with grid-scale batteries, solid-state transformers can eliminate uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), too, freeing up space inside the data center for more racks.

“If you add up the cost of everything we've taken out, we're 60% to 70% of that cost,” Haroon Inam, co-founder and CEO of DG Matrix, told TechCrunch.

DG Matrix has been focusing on its Interport technology, which can route power from multiple sources to multiple loads of differing voltages, a setup the company holds multiple patents on.

Heron Power, meanwhile, is working to transforming medium-voltage power in data centers, solar farms, and grid-scale battery installations. In a data center, it's Heron Link transformers can provide racks with 30 seconds of power while backup sources come online. Altogether, Heron Link occupy 70% less space than existing parts. At a solar farm, Heron Power's transformers can perform the duties of an inverter and a transformer for the same price.

In a head-to-head comparison, solid state transformers still command a cost premium over iron-core transformers. For that reason, they're unlikely to replace the giant humming boxes at grid substations in the very near future. 

But in data centers and at EV charging hubs, where solid-state transformers take the place of several pieces of equipment, they'll start making inroads. 

When they finally hit the grid in bigger numbers, they have the potential to cut down on transmission and distribution costs, one of the biggest contributors to utility bill inflation.

Because today's transformers are passive, unable to react to fluctuations, distribution networks have been built with a significant amount of spare capacity, Baglino said. Solid-state transformers, though, and can respond to changing conditions, allowing grid operators to send more power through the same lines.

“You can actually make the infrastructure more affordable because you're putting more kilowatt-hours through the same poles and wires,” he said. “That's where intelligence, in place of passive mechanical objects that were designed 100 years ago, can make a big difference.”

If there's one bet that will always hit on one of the various “prediction markets” that are now apparently undergirding our economy, it's that America will take the wrong lesson from a crisis. One of the starkest bits of evidence for this truism is what remains changed in our society post-COVID lockdown. Our all-too-brief tastes of government-funded healthcare and meaningful unemployment relief came and went in the blink of an eye. Even as many restaurants have had to begrudgingly relinquish the “al fresco” dining areas they colonized on sidewalks and parking spaces back to the cars and pedestrians, another innovation of the early pandemic is still going frustratingly strong.

During their initial 2020 boom, QR code menus were an annoyance collectively suffered for the sake of public health. But today, long after the mask mandates were lifted and our government stopped even acknowledging the existence of a virus that's still very much around (and, uh… surging again), the QR code menu soldiers on like a barnacle that demands “you WILL pull out your phone on this date.” Despite some landmark victories in the arena of pushing back this and other loathed forms of technology creeping onto our plates, some restaurateurs and the consulting firms they overpay doggedly insist that customers love QR code menus; they just don't know it. Well, new research out of Washington State University posits that consumers want even more screen time baked into their dining experience.

The study, led by Soobin Seo of WSU's Carson College of Business, seems to suggest that restaurants could boost customer interest in and willingness to tell others about their establishment by adding augmented reality (AR) elements to their digital menus. The researchers' findings were published in the January edition of the International Journal of Hospitality Management, an industry scientific journal that has (to its credit) previously published research on the prevalence of method variance bias in research published in the hospitality industry's leading journals, IJHM included.

That said, there's no reason to doubt Seo and her team's work is anything but scientifically rigorous. The paper even notes numerous qualifying limitations to its studies and suggests further research would be prudent before widespread adoption by businesses. In fact, digging into the specifics of the team's methodology reveals several key elements that make it seem we may not necessarily be destined for a future of AR at Arby's after all.

First, the research's focus was entirely on the disclosure of a restaurant's farm-to-table (FTT) supply chain via AR and how that gimmick hypothetically affects a customer's likelihood to visit the restaurant and tell others about it.

A sample size of 243 study participants were shown one of three menu formats—AR, QR, and classic printed—then asked to imagine ordering the menu's signature burger dish and digest information about its many FTT ingredients in their menu's respective format. The participants were then asked about what they gleaned and asked to rate things like their menu's interactivity, their intention to visit the restaurant, and their intention to share what they learned about their imaginary burger with others. While those with the AR menus did indeed score higher when it came to their willingness to visit, remember, and yap about a theoretical restaurant, their average self-selected response was roughly only .5 higher than those with the QR and paper menus.

Additionally, the researchers studied how that same group of participants responded to the introduction of AR info about the FTT ingredients for familiar brands: McDonald's and Panera Bread. The responses indicated that AR menus gave McDonald's more of a bump in “perceived healthiness” than they did for Panera, but the research also noted that this was most likely due to respondents already viewing Panera as the healthier of the two.

“Consumers increasingly want transparency about where their food comes from, but the way that information is presented really matters,” Seo told WSU Insider. “Augmented reality allows restaurants to share that information in a more vivid, interactive, and engaging way.”

That may very well be true, but does vivid, interactive, and engaging info about the farm your Big Mac's tomatoes came from translate to customers opening their wallets, let alone restaurant owners hiring web developers? The Polymarket odds are still leaning “no.”

When Wizards of the Coast started lifting the lid on its Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover set earlier this week, eagle-eyed fans of the heroes in a half-shell noticed that there was something a bit off with the weapon of choice for one of the brothers. Wherever Raphael was depicted in art for the set, his trademark sai were seemingly missing one of the side prongs. But it wasn't a mistake—it's actually a different weapon entirely, and the choice was made by Wizards of the Coast intentionally.

Throughout the TMNT set (and named in a few of the cards), Raph is depicted wielding a pair of jitte rather than sai—a blunt weapon popularized in feudal Japan with a singular hooked tine. But to clear the air, Wizards released a whole blog post explaining the potential confusion to TMNT fans who were unfamiliar with the weapon.

The short answer is twofold: first, the iteration of the Ninja Turtles that star in the Magic set are a unique iteration of the team in their own right, inspired by but distinct from the myriad incarnations of the TMNT universe that have existed over the years, and as well as having their own unique designs, it was decided that another way this new version of the Ninja Turtles could stand out is if some of the teens wielded different weapons. Second? Familial trauma.

Well, kind of. So explains the Wizards of the Coast blog, simply titled “Raphael's Jitte”:

At the core of it all, underneath the cool aliens, ninjutsu, and flying transdimensional bovines, you've got the story of this tight little family trying to bond, argue, and survive in extraordinary circumstances. When we designed the look for our Turtles, we asked, “How do these four American kids relate to each other and the culture their father comes from? What did they learn? What do they cling to? What do they reject?”

When it came to visuals, that relationship was front and center by giving the brothers very similar costuming that was still personalized to communicate little elements of their personality—that's why we very deliberately gave Mikey straps that resemble a backpack (to help make him feel younger than his brothers) and made Raph's mask distinct (to help him visually communicate how he sees himself as an outsider and different from his family).

In the end, we saw Splinter as very traditionally Japanese, following cues from the original Mirage comics and his various animated incarnations. In that light, it made a lot more sense that he would teach his sons how to use more traditional ninja weapons—Leonardo the ninjatō, Donatello the bō, Raphael the jitte, and Michelangelo the kusarigama—but teenagers are rebellious, and each one would express that through their experience growing up in NYC. Leo might internalize a little too much pop culture about Japan and imagine himself a samurai, for example.

In most incarnations of the TMNT, Raphael and Splinter arguably have the closest emotional relationships—they share a lot of anger. Splinter has mastered that rage and hopes to teach his son how to do the same, while Raph desperately wants his father to be proud of him, and his perceived failure of this is a big source of his sibling rivalry with the “golden boy,” Leonardo. You can't just throw that away, but we don't have hours of screentime to explore it, either. So, you think about how you can express these dynamics in visuals and designs.

It was decided, then, that the jitte felt more “traditionally Japanese,” according to Wizards, to match Splinter's heritage, and Raph's choice to continue using it instead of favoring another weapon (while the blog notes that the Magic Mikey was trained with a kusarigama, most cards he's depicted in show him with his usual nunchaku) is meant to convey his respect for his father figure, despite their clashes.

That's a lot of reasoning to explain a single (and, at the end of the day, relatively minor) art design choice in a whole Magic: The Gathering set filled with them. But it at the very least shows that Wizards has put a lot of thinking into its own stamp on the Ninja Turtles… even if it leads to some very silly moments in the set where classic comic art of Raph with his sai has been reused to flavor cards of his new weapon of choice:

It's the thought that counts. The Magic: The Gathering – Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set releases on March 6.

If you haven't already been put off from ever building a PC again, thanks to the skyrocketing prices of PC components, then you may have already noticed the influx of component bundles popping up from retailers that pull together a few pieces of hardware to try to offset the high prices. From bundles that contain almost all the parts for an entire PC build, to smaller combinations of components like today's that pair a motherboard with some valuable memory, it's worth taking a look and seeing if any of these combos may help in getting a new PC build or upgrade off the ground. At Newegg today, for $449, you can pick up the Asus TUF Gaming X870E-Plus WiFi7 motherboard along with 32GB (2x 16GB) of V-Color Manta XSky DDR5 6400MT/s Memory, with the cost of the whole bundle being less than the price for just the RAM alone.

If we take a deeper dive and look at the individual components, we can see that the Asus TUF Gaming X870E-Plus WiFi7 motherboard in the offer has a list price of $349.99 with a current sale price of $329.99. It also comes with a complimentary copy of the latest Resident Evil: Requiem video game, valued at $70. Asus' X870E motherboard comes with an excellent array of features, including four M.2 slots for plenty of storage, WiFi 7 connectivity, 16+2+1 80A power stages, and PCIe 5.0.

The memory included in the combo is V-Color's Manta XSky DDR5, with two paired 16GB sticks of 6400MT/s RAM. The timings of the memory are 32-39-39-10, with a CAS latency of CL32 at 1.4V. The list price of this RAM is $499.99 at Newegg, although there is currently an offer running where you can reduce the price by $70 when using code PDSF285 at checkout, making the price $429.99

This Newegg combo bundle pairs an Asus TUF Gaming X870E-Plus WiFi7 motherboard with 32GB (2x 16GB) of V-Color Manta XSky DDR5 6400MT/s Memory. Perfect to pair with an AMD Ryzen 7000 - 9000 series processor. 

In the current climate of rising memory, storage, and GPU prices, this bundle deal is a pretty solid offering. The price of the Asus motherboard and V-Color RAM, bought separately with their individual discounts, is $759.98, so you are making a chunkier saving by buying them both in the bundle. It's the start of a high-spec PC build. Add an AMD processor, SSD, and a graphics card, and you're on your way to a full build.

In 1994, Russian archaeologists unearthed a tiny cemetery with a grave holding a mummified woman wearing a wig. More than 30 years later, researchers revisited the long-dead body—exposing what appears to be a primitive prosthetic in her jaw.

In a statement, archaeologists at Novosibirsk State University in Russia announced that a recent analysis of a 2,500-year-old skull found that the woman likely received jaw surgery after a serious head injury. The researchers performed a CT scan of the skull, revealing signs of severe physical trauma and, more importantly, remnants of an “elastic material” that would have been a “surgical ligature to stabilize the jaw,” they said.

“The CT scanner acted as a ‘time machine,' providing non-destructive access to anatomical structures,” Vladimir Kanygin, head of the university's Laboratory of Nuclear and Innovative Medicine, said in the translated statement.

The mummy was found on the Ukok Plateau, a region in southern Siberia associated with the Pazyryk culture, a nomadic population from the Iron Age. At the time of excavation, researchers estimated the woman's age at around 25 to 30 years. But that was about it. Only a part of her head was mummified, making it difficult for archaeologists to fully investigate the body. A patch of mummified skin on the skull prevented researchers from studying the skull without disturbing the remains.

The CT scans revealed far more than the researchers expected. The facial injury had destroyed the woman's right temporomandibular joint (TMJ), a small section of the upper jaw near the ear. The severity of the injury suggested that the woman wouldn't have been able to eat or speak.

That was the least surprising part. Further examinations uncovered thin canals drilled into the woman's temporomandibular joint, in addition to a ligament structure that might have been horsehair or animal tendon.

What's more, the woman's teeth on the left side were severely damaged compared to the right, hinting she was mostly chewing with her left teeth, meaning she survived for an extended period after the surgery. New tissues grew inside her mouth, and the prosthetic allowed her to move her jaw to a certain extent.

The team isn't sure what caused the injury, although the woman may have fallen from a horse, considering the nomadic lifestyle of the Pazyryk.

The researchers note that while the new discovery was unexpected, it wasn't “particularly surprising.” Archaeologists knew the Pazyryk people had a nuanced response to injuries and death—the “Siberian Ice Maiden,” a mummy found in a Pazyryk tomb with perfectly preserved tattoos, being a prime example.

The Pazyryk people were also skilled seamstresses, creating sophisticated, lightweight leather coats stitched in fine parallel rows, added Natalia Polosmak, an archaeologist with the Russian Academy of Sciences. These motor skills certainly would have come in handy for surgical operations, she said.

Importantly, the findings further exemplify the Pazyryk culture's deep respect for life, the researchers said. For example, the mummy's burial was considered to be “ordinary” compared to that of the Siberian Ice Maiden, suggesting she may have been of a lower status.

Her injuries would also have left her face distorted. The prosthetic allowed her jaw to move again, but probably with a lot of pain, the researchers noted. Needless to say, that likely curtailed the woman's contributions to her community, which arguably made her a burden in the already harsh conditions the Pazyryk had to weather.

Yet, the archaeological record clearly demonstrates she was properly treated and later buried in a proper coffin of wood—a valuable resource for the region.

“We don't know what her personal value to society consisted of,” Polosmak mused. “In this society, everyone was valued in life simply for their existence and honored after death.”

A new bill proposed in the California State Assembly could potentially require the makers of 3D printers to confirm that they are using algorithms or other technologies to prevent the printing of firearms.

The new bill is AB-2047, and it mostly mimics Washington's HB 2321 and New York Assembly's S9005/A10005, all proposed recently in 2026. However, California goes one step further by "[banning] the sale or transfer of any 3D printer in California unless it appears on a state-maintained roster of approved makes and models."

 






If the bill is passed as is, then by July 2027, the California Department of Justice would be required to publish guidance on certifying 3D printers and their software controls to block the printing of gun parts. The department would accept applications for approval before January 2028, and six months later in July 2028, every company intent on making or selling a 3D printer in California would need to attest that they have met those stanards. That September, the stated would publish a list of authorized makes and models to be updated quarterly.Unauthorized printers would be banned from sale beginning on March 1, 2029.

As with the Washington and New York bills, circumvention of these measures would be made illegal. The California bill specifically states the following:(A) For firmware design, guidance for how vendors are required to demonstrate that their technology will ensure a printer directs potential print jobs to the algorithm before printing can occur.

(B) For integrated preprint software design, guidance for how vendors shall demonstrate that printers will accept print jobs exclusively from a single preprint software and will not accept print jobs from any other preprint software, including from a user seeking to evade a detection algorithm.

Washington's bill, meanwhile, states the measures "cannot be overridden or otherwise defeated by a user with significant technical skill." This could ultimately mean every printer in the state would have a locked bootloader, firmware, and/or slicer.

Adafruit, which sells tools and supplies to makers, points out on its blog that the combination of the three states represents a significant slice of the 3D printing market, for a combined 20% of the U.S.' population, and 24% of the nation's GDP. If all three bills pass, 3D printing vendors could balk at making and maintaining separate product lines for California, Washing, New York state, and the rest of the country.

One of the US government's top scientific research labs is taking steps that could drive away foreign scientists, a shift lawmakers and sources tell WIRED could cost the country valuable expertise and damage the agency's credibility.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) helps determine the frameworks underpinning everything from cybersecurity to semiconductor manufacturing. Some of NIST's recent work includes establishing guidelines for securing AI systems and identifying health concerns with air purifiers and firefighting gloves. Many of the agency's thousands of employees, postdoctoral scientists, contractors, and guest researchers are brought in from around the world for their specialized expertise.

“For weeks now, rumors of draconian new measures have been spreading like wildfire, while my staff's inquiries to NIST have gone unanswered,” Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, wrote in a letter sent to acting NIST director Craig Burkhardt on Thursday. April McClain Delaney, a fellow Democrat on the committee, cosigned the message.

Lofgren wrote that while her staff has heard about multiple rumored changes, what they have confirmed through unnamed sources is that the Trump administration “has begun taking steps to limit the ability of foreign-born researchers to conduct their work at NIST.”

The congressional letter follows a Boulder Reporting Lab article on February 12 that said international graduate students and postdoctoral researchers would be limited to a maximum of three years at NIST going forward, despite many of them needing five to seven years to complete their work.

A NIST employee tells WIRED that some plans to bring on foreign workers through the agency's Professional Research and Experience Program have recently been canceled because of uncertainty about whether they would make it through the new security protocols. The staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, says the agency has yet to widely communicate what the new hurdles will be or why it believes they are justified.

On Thursday, the Colorado Sun reported that “noncitizens” lost after-hours access to a NIST lab last month and could soon be banned from the facility entirely.

Jennifer Huergo, a spokesperson for NIST, tells WIRED that the proposed changes are aimed at protecting US science from theft and abuse, echoing a similar statement issued this week to other media outlets. Huergo declined to comment on who needs to approve the proposal for it to be finalized and when a decision will be made. She also didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers' letter.

Preventing foreign adversaries from stealing valuable American intellectual property has been a bipartisan priority, with NIST among the agencies in recent years to receive Congressional scrutiny about the adequacy of its background checks and security policies. Just last month, Republican lawmakers renewed calls to put restrictions in place preventing Chinese nationals from working at or with national labs run by the Department of Energy.

But Lofgren's letter contends that the rumored restrictions on non-US scientists at NIST goes beyond “what is reasonable and appropriate to protect research security.” The letter demands transparency about new policies by February 26 and a pause on them “until Congress can weigh in on whether these changes are necessary at all.”

The potential loss of research talent at NIST would add to a series of other Trump administration policies that some US tech industry leaders have warned will dismantle the lives of immigrant researchers already living in the US and hamper economic growth. Hiking fees on H-1B tech visas, revoking thousands of student visas, and carrying out legally dubious mass deportations all stand to push people eager to work on science and tech research in the US to go elsewhere instead. The Trump administration has also announced plans to limit post-graduation job training for international students.

Pat Gallagher, who served as the director of NIST from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, says the changes could erode trust in the agency, which has long provided the technical foundations that industry and governments around the world rely on. “What has made NIST special is it is scientifically credible,” he tells WIRED. “Industry, universities, and the global measurement community knew they could work with NIST.”

Like much of the federal government, NIST has been in turmoil for most of the past year. Parts of it were paralyzed for months as rumors of DOGE cuts spread. Ultimately, the agency lost hundreds of its thousands of workers to budget cuts, with further funding pressure to come.

As of a couple of years ago, NIST welcomed 800 researchers on average annually from outside the US to work in its offices and collaborate directly with staff.

Lofgren expressed fear that rumors may be enough to scare away researchers and undermine US competitiveness in vital research. “Our scientific excellence depends upon attracting the best and brightest from around the world,” she wrote in the letter.

For the most sought-after founders, the prestige of a top-tier accelerator is increasingly weighed against giving up a significant ownership stake in their company.

 Ali Partovi, the veteran investor and CEO of venture firm Neo, wants to offer the mentorship and community of one of the most elite accelerator programs — without forcing the best up-and-coming tech leaders to hand over 7% or sometimes 10% of their company before they've even started.

Partovi, who is known for his early investments in Facebook, Cursor, and Kalshi, has just introduced Neo Residency, a new, competitively structured program that combines the firm's now four-year-old accelerator with a track for current college students.

The terms that Neo Residency offers are so founder-friendly as to be “not even comparable to any other accelerator,” Partovi told TechCrunch.

For the cohort of 12 to 15 startups entering the program this summer, Neo will invest $750,000 via an uncapped SAFE — a contract that gives an investor future equity in exchange for money now, with no ceiling on the valuation used to calculate that stake. Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won't receive its equity until the company's next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo's stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm's ownership drops to just 0.75%.

“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.

In comparison, Y Combinator typically takes a fixed 7% of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz's Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.

“We're offering a deal so great that it's appropriate even for founders who are not even considering any other accelerator,” Partovi said.

 The lower equity cost is only part of Neo Residency's appeal.

The founders will work for three months at Neo's offices in San Francisco's Jackson Square district, participate in a two-week bootcamp in the Oregon mountains, and be mentored by about 30 experienced operators, including Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, and Fuzzy Khosrowshahi, CTO of Notion (and the creator of Google Sheets and also Partovi's uncle).

But the program's main draw is its prestige: Seed and Series A investors generally have great respect for founders handpicked by Partovi.

“The one [accelerator] I like right now that has very high signal, and every founder I met there is just wicked smart, is Neo,” Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner of FPV Ventures, said onstage at 2025 TechCrunch Disrupt.

Startups that have gone through the program include Moment, a fintech company that has raised $56 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, and Anterior, a healthcare AI startup backed by NEA and Sequoia.

The Neo Residency will also select five to eight students — either as individuals or small teams — who will receive a $40,000, no-strings-attached grant to take a semester off to work on a project. While there is no requirement to drop out or start a formal company immediately, Partovi said he hopes the students will catch the entrepreneurial bug and, when they eventually launch a startup, turn to Neo for funding.

Neo is keeping the program small and elite: It will cap its two annual cohorts at 20 teams each, consisting of a mix of active startups and student projects.

Why is Neo offering such generous terms? “We have more confidence in our ability to attract and pick out future superstars than ever before,” Partovi said.

His track record suggests that confidence is well-founded. He famously met Cursor co-founder Michael Truell while Truell was still an MIT student and later wrote one of the first checks into the AI coding startup, now valued at nearly $30 billion.

As carbon emissions push Earth's temperature higher and higher, Antarctica is taking the brunt of the impact. This frozen continent is warming nearly twice as fast as the rest of the world, threatening its ecosystems, driving sea level rise, and destabilizing global food chains.

Humanity's choices over the next decade will determine Antarctica's fate, according to a study published Friday in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Science. The researchers, led by Newcastle University glaciology professor Bethan Davies, modeled the best- and worst-case scenarios for the Antarctic Peninsula, the warmest part of the continent. To avoid the worst outcomes, the world needs to advance toward net-zero emissions as quickly as possible.

“It is definitely possible—we can definitely do this,” Davies told Gizmodo. “It means thinking logically about how we power our countries, how we heat our homes, [making] policy decisions about how we live our lifestyles. All of this is manageable and is doable.”

For their study, Davies and her colleagues analyzed CMIP6 climate data. CMIP6 is a coordinated set of standardized simulations from dozens of climate models that allows scientists to predict how Earth's systems will respond to different rates of greenhouse gas emissions while minimizing uncertainty.

The study considers three different scenarios: low emissions, medium-high emissions, and very high emissions. The low-emissions (or best-case) scenario would result in no more than 3.24 degrees Fahrenheit (1.8 degrees Celsius) of global warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100.

This future would spare the Antarctic Peninsula from the worst environmental damage and avoid the most severe global consequences of that damage. Winter sea ice extent would only be slightly less than it is today, and the Peninsula's contributions to sea level rise would amount to just a few millimeters. Glaciers and their supporting ice shelves would remain largely intact.

Unfortunately, that's not the path humanity is currently on. The world is on track for a medium- to medium-high emissions future, in which the global average temperature rises 6.5 degrees F (3.6 degrees C) above pre-industrial levels by 2100.

Under that scenario, temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula would be 6.12 degrees F (3.4 degrees C) warmer than they are today. There would be roughly 19 more days above 32 degrees F (0 degrees C) per year, and more precipitation would fall as rain than snow.

Increased ocean temperatures and upwelling would also accelerate glacial retreat. The Peninsula would also experience more extreme weather events, and native species—such as the Adélie penguin—would be displaced by inhospitable climate conditions.

“The Adélie penguin is a hardy little animal, but it can't tolerate its chicks getting wet,” Davies explained. “What happens when we get rain on the Antarctic Peninsula is you can lose the whole breeding colony—you can lose all the chicks.” She said researchers are already seeing the Peninsula's Adélie population contract as other penguin species move in.

Then there's the very high emissions scenario, in which the global average temperature rises nearly 8 degrees F (4.4 degrees C) above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This would be catastrophic for the Antarctic Peninsula, triggering ice shelf collapse, major sea ice loss, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, and dramatic declines in native species.

The damage would be irreversible, Davies said. While the world isn't currently headed toward that worst-case scenario, it describes what could happen if humanity overshoots emissions targets and fails to curb emissions in the coming decades.

“The risk of that is that even if we then bury all the carbon in the ground and come up with a magic technology to do that, we've already crossed key tipping points on the Antarctic ice sheet, as well as other tipping points globally,” Davies said.

To researchers like Davies who conduct fieldwork on the Antarctic Peninsula, the impact of global warming is already starkly apparent. She has seen ice shelves smattered with meltwater puddles and rainstorms even during the dark winter months. In some cases, researchers have had to abandon field sites because melting has made them too dangerous to access, she said.

“We can think of the Antarctic Peninsula, specifically, as that canary in the coal mine,” Davies said. “It's the warmest part of Antarctica [and] the place where you're seeing the changes happen first.” What happens there will trigger changes across the rest of the continent and the world, she added.

The key takeaway from her team's findings is that it's not too late to change course. If the world acts quickly to curb carbon emissions, Antarctica's future could look very different from the most likely scenario outlined in this study. Humanity's choices over the next decade will be critical to stabilizing this vital region.

I think Github Co-Pilot is most annoying from what I've tried... it's great for finishing off a task that's half done where the structure is laid out, as long as you put blinders keeping it focused on it.  OpenAI and Google's options seem to get things mostly right, but do some really goofy wrong things from my own experiences.They all seem to have trouble using state of the art and current libraries by default, even when you explicitly request them.

Is the problem you observed true regardless of the model you picked?

reply

If the default option isn't at least arguably the best option I can't really speak to that.  I would suggest that maybe metrics on a given set of technologies be done and that based on the project in use, that it should choose the best option dynamically by default. Such as C#+MS-SQL vs Node+Postgres vs Python+Matlab+DuckDB.

This coding agent is minimal, and it completely changed how I used models and Claude's cli now feels like extremely slow bloat.I'd not be surprised if you're right in that this is companies / management will prefer to "pay for a complete package" approach for a long while, but power-users should not care for the model providers.I have like 100 lines of code to get me a tmux controls & semaphore_wait extension in the pi harness. That gave me a better orchestration scheme a month ago when I adopted it, than Claude has right now.As far as I can tell, the more you try to train your model on your harness, the worse they get. Bitter lesson #2932.

The reason these LLM tools being good is they can "just do stuff." Anthropic bans third party subscription auth? I'll just have my other tool use Claude Code in tmux. If third party agents can be banned from doing stuff (some advanced always on spyware or whatever), then a large chunk of the promise of AI is dead.Amp just announced today they are dumping IDE integration. Models seem to run better on bare-bones software like Pi, and you can add or remove stuff on the fly because the whole things open source. The software writes itself. Is Microsoft just trying to cram a whole new paradigm in to an old package? Kind of like a computer printer. It will be a big business, but it isn't the future.At scale, the end provider ultimately has to serve the inference -- they need the hardware, data centers & the electricity to power those data centers. Someone like Microsoft can also provide a SLA and price such appropriately. I'll avoid a $200/month customer acquisition cost rant, but one user, running a bunch of sub agents, can spend a ton of money. If you don't own a business or funding source, the way state of the art LLMs are being used today is totally uneconomical (easy $200+ an hour at API prices.)36+ months out, if they overbuild the data centers and the revenue doesn't come in like OpenAI & Anthropic are forecasting, there will be a glut of hardware. If that's the case I'd expect local model usage will scale up too and it will get more difficult for enterprise providers.(Nothing is certain but some things have become a bit more obvious than they were 6 months ago.)

Bloated apps are a material disadvantage. If I'm in a competitive industry that slow down alone can mean failure. The only thing Claude Code has going for it now is the loss making $200 month subsidy. Is there any conceivable GUI overlay that Anthropic or OpenAI can add to make their software better than the current terminal apps? Sure, for certain edge cases, but then why isn't the user building those themselves? 24 months ago we could have said that's too hard, but that isn't the case in 2026.Microsoft added all of this stuff in to Windows, and it's a 5 alarm fire. Stuff that used to be usable is a mess and really slow. Running linux with Claude Code, Codex, or Pi is clearly superior to having a Windows device with neither (if it wasn't possible to run these in Windows; just a hypothetical.)From the business/enterprise perspective - there is no single most important thing, but having an environment that is reliable and predictable is high up there. Monday morning, an the Anthropic API endpoint is down, uh oh! In the longer term, businesses will really want to control both the model and the software that interfaces with it.If the end game is just the same as talking to the Star Trek computer, and competitors are narrowing gaps rather than widening them (e.g. Anthropic and OpenAI releases models minutes from each other now, Chinese frontier models getting closer in capability not further), then it is really hard to see how either company achieves a vertical lock down.We could actually move down the stack, and then the real problem for OpenAI and Anthropic is nVidia. 2030, the data center expansion is bust, nVidia starts selling all of these cards to consumers directly and has a huge financial incentive to make sure the performant local models exist. Everyone in the semiconductor supply chain below nvidia only cares about keeping sales going, so it stops with them.Maybe nvidia is the real winner?Also is it just me or does it now feel like hn comments are just talking to a future LLM?

The advances in the Claude Code harness have been more around workflow automation rather than capability improvements, and truthfully workflows are very user-dependent, so an opinionated harness is only ever going to be "right" for a narrow segment of users, and it's going to annoy a lot of others. This is happening now, but the sub subsidy washes out a lot of the discontent.

There are parallels to the silly Metaverse hype wave from a few years ago. At the time I saw a surprising number of people defending the investment saying it was important for Facebook to control their own platform. Well sure it's beneficial for Facebook to control a platform, but that benefit is purely for the company and if anything it would harm current and future users. Unsurprisingly, the pitch to please think of this giant corporation's needs wasn't a compelling pitch in the end.

This whole game is a bizarre battle.In the future, many companies will have slightly different secret RL sauces. I'd want to use Gemini for documentation, Claude for design, Codex for planning, yada yada ... there will be no generalist take-all model, I just don't believe RL scaling works like that.I'm not convinced that a single company can own the best performing model in all categories, I'm not even sure the economics make it feasible.Good for us, of course.

And that's out of the box. With how comically extensible pi is and how much control it gives you over every aspect of the pipeline, as soon as you start building extensions for your own, personal workflow, Claude Code legimitely feels like a trash app in comparison.I don't care what Anthropic does - I'll keep using pi. If they think they need to ban me for that, then, oh well. I'll just continue to keep using pi. Just no longer with Claude models.

Apple can do those things because they control the hardware device, which has physical distribution, and they lock down the ecosystem. There is no third party app store, and you can't get the Photos app to save to Google Drive.With Claude Code, just export an env variable or use a MITM proxy + some middleware to forward requests to OpenAI instead. It's impossible to have lock in. Also, coding agent CLIs are a commodity.

i've been wondering how anthropic is going to survive long term. If they could build out an infrastructure and services to complete with the hyperscalers but surfaced as a tool for claude to use then maybe. You pay Anthropic $20/user/month for ClaudeCode but also $100k/month to run your applications.

That sounds absurd to me. Committing to not building in advertising is very important and fundamental to me. Asking people who pay for a personal subscription rather than paying by the API call to use that subscription themselves sounds to me like it is. Just clarifying the social compact that was already implied.I WANT to be able to pay a subscription price. Rather like the way I pay for my internet connectivity with a fixed monthly bill. If I had to pay per packet transmitted, I would have to stop and think about it every time I decided to download a large file or watch a movie. Sure, someone with extremely heavy usage might not be able to use a normal consumer internet subscription; but it works fine for my personal use. I like having the option for my AI usage to operate the same way.

If I had to pay per packet transmitted, I would have to stop and think about it every time I decided to download a large file or watch a movie. Sure, someone with extremely heavy usage might not be able to use a normal consumer internet subscription; but it works fine for my personal use. I like having the option for my AI usage to operate the same way.

This statement is plainly wrong.If you boost and praise AI usage, you have to face the real cost.Can't have your cake and eat it, too.

It's kind of like a new restaurant started handing out coupons for "90% off", wanting to attract diners to the restaurant, customers started coming in and ordering bulk meals then immediately packaging them in tupperware containers and taking it home (violating the spirit of the arrangement, even if not the letter of the arrangement), so the restaurant changed the terms on the discount to say "limited to in-store consumption only, not eligible for take-home meals", and instead of still being grateful that they're getting food for 90% off, the cheapskate customers are getting angry that they're no longer allowed to exploit the massive subsidy however they want.

Here, they put limits on the "under-cover" use of the subscription. If they can provide a relatively cheap subscription against the direct API use, this is because they can control the stuff end-to-end, the application running on your system (Claude Code, Claude Desktop) and their systems.As you subscribe to these plans, this is the "contract", you can use only through their tools. If you want full freedom, use the API, with a per token pricing.For me, this is fair.

Except they can't. Their costs are not magically lower when you use claude code vs when you use a third-party client.> For me, this is fair.This is, plain and simple, a tie-in sale of claude code.

I am very curious what is particularly illegal about this. On the sales page nowhere do they actually talk about the API https://claude.com/pricingNow we all know obviously the API is being used because that is how things work, but you are not actually paying a subscription for the API. You are paying for access to Claude Code.Is it also illegal that if you pay for Playstation Plus that you can't play those games on an Xbox?Is it illegal that you can't use third party netflix apps?I really don't want to defend and AI company here but this is perfectly normal. In no other situation would we expect access to the API, the only reason this is considered different is because they also have a different service that gives access to the API. But that is irrelevant.

Anthropic provides an API third-party clients can use. The pro-market position is that the API must be available at every pricing tier, as the benefits from increased competition outweigh the imposed restrictions to business practices. The pro-business position is that Anthropic must be allowed to choose which tiers can use the API, as the benefits from increased freedom outweigh the reduced competition in the market.

reply

Or should every app/service be required to expose documented APIs?

reply

While I do personally disagree with thinking that you should be able to do this when it was never sold in that way, at the end of the day as a customer you can choose if you want to use the product in the way that they are saying or use something else if you don't want to support that model.However the person I was responding too brought up legality which is a very different discussion.

But if that is the service they are making and they are clear about what it is when you sign up... That does not make it illegal.I can see why people think they should be entitled to do this, but it does not align with how they are selling the service or how many other companies sell services. In most situations you don't get unlimited access to the individual components of how a service works (the API), you are expected to use the service (in this case Claude Code) directly.

"Both parties are okay with the terms" is far from being sufficient to make something "legal".Tie-in sales between software and services is not different from price dumping. If any of the Big Tech corporations were from any country that is not the US, the FTC would be doing anything in their power to stop them.

I disagree, in many cases what you are specifically paying for is the combination of the software and the service that are designed to work together. And in many cases do not work independent of eachother.There are countless cases of this, that what you are paying for is a thing that is made up of a piece of software and a serverside component. MMO's (and gaming in general) being a major example of this, but so are many of the apps I pay for subscriptions for on my phone.The actual technical implementation of how it works is irrelevant when it is clear what it is you are paying for.> "Both parties are okay with the terms" is far from being sufficient to make something "legal".True but the opposite is also true, just because you don't like the terms it does not make it illegal.

I will keep my response to this part in particular limited because I have limited understanding of this law. However based on doing a little bit of searching around the law is not as cut and dry as you are presenting it to be. It is possible that Claude code would fall under being fine under that law or no one has gone after them. I honestly don't know and I don't feel like having an argument that it is highly likely both of us don't fully understand the law.That being said I do question how exactly “Claude code” differs from those services as a digital good.> I don't care about Claude Code.

If that was true, then getting equivalent usage of the API without claude.ai and Claude Code should cost less, not more.You can try to find all sorts of explanations for it, at the end of the day is quite simple: they are subsidizing one product in order to grow the market share, and they are doing it at a loss now, because they believe they will make up for it later. I understand the reasoning from a business point of view, but this doesn't mean they are entitled to their profits. I do not understand people that think we simply accept their premise and assume they can screw us over just because they asked and put it on a piece of paper.

You'd have to point me to an authoritative source on that (explicitly saying users are allowed to use their models via private APIs in apps of the user's choosing). If something isn't explicitly provided in the contract, then it can be changed at any point in any way without notice.Honestly, I'm not big on capitalism in general, but I don't understand why people should expect companies to provide things exactly the way they want at exactly the prices they would like to be charged (if at all). That's just not how the world/system works, or should, especially given there are so many alternatives available. If one doesn't like what's happening with some service, then let the wallet do the talking and move to another. Emigration is a far more effective message than complaining.

This is a gross misrepresentation of my argument.I wouldn't be complaining at all if they went up and said "sorry, we are not going to subsidize anyone anymore, so the prices are going up", and I wouldn't be complaining if they came up and said "sorry, using a third party client incurs an extra cost of on our side, so if you want to use that you'd have to pay extra".What I am against is the anti-competitive practice of price discrimination and the tie-in sale of a service. If they are going to play this game, then they better be ready for the case the strategy backfires.

There was a third choice, which was better than both of the ones presented: use any other client that can talk with our API, at whatever usage rate they deemed acceptable. If the "private API" was accessible via OAuth, then it's hardly "private".We can argue all day, when I signed up there was nothing saying that access was exclusive via the tools they provided. They changed the rules not because it was costing them more (or even if does, they are losing money on Pro customers anyway so arguing about that is silly) but because they opened themselves for some valid and fair competition.

The primary offering is access to the models. That's what the subscription is about. They can try as hard as they want to market it as Claude being the product and access to the model being an ancillary service, but to me this is just marketing bs. No one is signing-up for Claude because their website is nicer, or because of Claude Code.

reply

Yes, that agreement is there, with the condition that their app is used. That's option B. And I'd think it fairly obvious that if one has to go to extraordinary lengths to gain access, like finding a key under a mat, or needing to login with an official client to gain access to a token for an unofficial client, then - implicitly - it's highly unlikely that that method of access is part of the agreement. And Anthropic has now made it explicitly clear that no, that access method is not part of the agreement.

And setting this condition is what constitutes a tie-in sale.> if one has to go to extraordinary lengths to gain accessBS! Sorry, there is nothing extraordinary about using an undocumented API.

The laws prohibiting tie-ins don't make it illegal to sell two products that work well together.  That's literally what the laws are designed to make you do -- seperate products into seperate pieces.  The problem tie-in laws were designed to combat was situations like Microsoft making a popular OS then making a mediocre spreadsheet program and pushing the cost of that spreadsheet program into the cost of buying the OS.  That way consumers would go "well it's expensive but I get excel with it so it's ok" and even if someone else made a slightly better spreadsheet they didn't have the chance to convince users because they had to buy it all as one package.Anthropic would be doing something much closer to that if they did what you wanted.  They'd be saying: hey we have this neat Claude code thing you all want to use but you can't buy that without also purchasing third party access. Now some company offering a cheaper/better third party usage product doesn't get the chance to convince you because anthropic forced you to buy that just to get claude code.Ultimately this change unbundled products the opposite of a tie-in.  What is upsetting about it is that it no longer feels to you like you are getting a good deal because you now have to fork over a bunch more cash to keep getting what you want.  But that's not illegal, that's just not offering good value for money.

Look at it this way: the service that you're accessing is really a (primarily desired) side-effect of the software. So re subscriptions, what they're actually providing are the apps (web, desktop, etc), and the apps use their service to aid the fulfillment of their functionality. Those wanting direct access to the internal service can get an API key for that purpose. That's just how their product offering is structured.

Though now, YT-DLP has to use a makeshift JS interpreter and maybe even spawn Chromium down the line.

I don't have a dog in this fight but is this actually true?  If you're using Claude Code they can know that whatever client-side model selection they put into it is active.  So if they can get away with routing 80% of the requests to Haiku and only route to Opus for the requests that really need it, that does give them a cost model where they can rely on lower costs than if a third-party client just routes to Opus for everything.  Even if they aren't doing that sort of thing now, it would be understandable if they wanted to.

reply

They still have the total consumption under their control (*bar prompt caching and other specific optimizations) where in the past they even had different quotas per model, it shouldn't cost them more money, just be a worse/different service I guess

reply

As things are currently, better models mean bigger models that take more storage+RAM+CPU, or just spend more time processing a request. All this translates to higher costs, and may be mitigated by particular configs triggered by knowledge that a given client, providing particular guarantees, is on the other side.

If subsidizing that offering is a good hook to get higher paying API users on board, then some of that cost is a customer aquisition cost, whereas the cost to them of providing the API doesn't have the same proportion that they can justify as a customer acquisition cost.

This sounds like engineering, finance, and legal got together and decided they were in an untenable position if OpenAI started nudging OpenClaw to burn even more tokens on Anthropic (or just never optimize) + continually updated workarounds to using subscription auth. But I'm sure OpenAI would never do something like that...At the end of the day, it's the same 'fixed price plan for variable use on a constrained resource' cellular problem: profitability becomes directly linked to actual average usage.

You can of course use OpenCode or any other project with the API, which is also offered as a separate product. People just don't want to do that because it's not subsidized, ie. more expensive. But the entire reason it's subsidized is that Anthropic can use the data to improve their product.

reply

This is grade A, absolute crap. It's subsidized because everyone else is subsidizing it, and everyone is doing it because they are trying to lock their consumer share.The solution is quite simple. Just get the FTC to forbid tie-in sales so that we don't get the huge corporations using their infinite resources to outlive the competition. Anthropic/Amazon/Google/OpenAI/Facebook can offer any type of service they want, but if the access to the API costs $X when offered standalone, then that is the baseline price for anything that depends on the API to work.

In reality, heavy subscription users are subsidized by light subscription users.

Probably the ToS change was to make it more clear.To be fair, the developer is the one breaking the ToS in the most significant way, breaking boilerplate reverse engineering clauses.But the user also is very aware that they are doing something funny, in order to authenticate, the user is asked to authorize Claude Code, n ot Opencode or OpenClaw, it's clearly a hack and there is no authorization from Anthropic to OpenClaw, and you are not giving Anthropic authorization to give access to OC, the user asks Anthropic to give access to Claude Code, the only reason this works is because OC is pretending to be Claude Code.The bottom line issue is that as a user you are paying for a subscription to a package that includes an expected usage. That package is not metered, but it is given on the condition that you will use it as it is expected to be used, by chatting manually with the chatbot, which results in a reasonable expected token usage. By using a program that programatically calls the chat interface, the token consumption increases beyond what was part of the original deal, and so the price should be different.A similar scenario would be if you go to an all you can eat buffet, you pay for a single person, but then you actually unload an army of little clones that start eating the whole buffet. Technically it was an all you can eat buffet and you paid the price right? Well no, come on, don't play dumb.

It's just price differentiation - they know consumers are price sensitive, and that companies wanting to use their APIs to build products so they can slap AI on their portfolio and get access to AI-related investor money can be milked. On the consumer-facing front, they live off branding and if you're not using claude code, you might not associate the tool with Anthropic, which means losing publicity that drives API sales.

Instead, many, many websites (especially in the music industry) have some sort of funky API that you can only get access to if you have enough online clout. Very few are transparent about what "enough clout" even means or how much it'd cost you, and there's like an entire industry of third-party API resellers that cost like 10x more than if you went straight to the source. But you can't, because you first have to fulfill some arbitrary criteria that you can't even know about ahead of time.It's all very frustrating to deal with.

what if the "product" is a setup of documents that concisely describe the product so that a coding agent can reliable produce it correctly. Then the install process becomes "agent, write and host this application for the user's personal use on their computer". Now all software is for personal use only. Companies released these things and, like Frankenstein, there's a strong possibility they will turn on their creators.

These kinds of business decisions show how these $200.00 subscriptions for their slot/infinite jest machines basically light that $200.00 on fire, and in general how unsustainable these business models are.Can't wait for it all to fail, they'll eventually try to get as many people to pay per token as possible, while somehow getting people to use their verbose antigentic tools that are able to inflate revenue through inefficient context/ouput shenanigans.

I used Claude back when API per token pricing was the only option and it was bad for all the usual reasons pay-per-use sucks compared to flat billing: you're constantly thinking about cost. Like trying to watch a Netflix video with a ticker in the corner counting up the cents you owe them.I don't understand your claim that they want people paying per token - the subscription is the opposite of that, and it also has upsides for them as a business since most people don't saturate the usage limits, and the business gets to stuff a bunch of value-adds on a bundle offering which is generally a more lucrative and enticing consumer pricing model.

I expect some big falls from 10 figure businesses in the next year or two as they realize this is impossible. They've built an industry on the backs of gambling addicts and dopamine feins (I'm generalizing but this is a thing with LLM users (just read vibe coders posts on twitter, they're slot machine users). Ask sports betting operators from back in 2019-2022 how it worked out for them when they tried to give out 1-2k a year to attract new customers, and then realized their customers will switch platforms in an instant they see a new shiny offer. Look up the Fanduel Founders "exit" for an insight into this.They have to eventually stop catering to the slot machine users, which are generally paying for these hugely lossy flat rate subscriptions, and somehow get them used to a different type of payment model, or cater strictly to enterprise... Which also aren't going to tolerate paying 20k a month in tokens per developer, is my guess.... Lots of delicate pricing problems to figure out for all these companies.

On the other hand OpenAI and GitHub Copilot have, as far as I know, explicitly allowed their users to connect to at least some third party tools and use their quotas from there, notably to OpenCode.What is unclear to me is whether they are considering also allowing commercial apps to do that. For instance if I publish a subscription based app and my users pay for the app itself rather than for LLM inference, would that be allowed?

You can't use Claude OAuth tokens for anything. Any solution that exists worked because it pretended/spoofed to be Claude Code. Same for Gemini (Gemini CLI, Antigravity)Codex is the only one that got official blessing to be used in OpenClaw and OpenCode, and even that was against the ToS before they changed their stance on it.

Maybe.First, Anthropic is also trying to manage user satisfaction as well as costs. If OpenCode or whatever burns through your limits faster, are you likely to place the blame on OpenCode?Maybe a good analogy was when DoorDash/GrubHub/Uber Eats/etc signed up restaurants to their system without their permission. When things didn't go well, the customers complained about the restaurants, even though it wasn't their fault, because they chose not to support delivery at scale.Second, flat-rate pricing, unlike API pricing, is the same for cached vs uncached iirc, so even if total token limits are the same, less caching means higher costs.

Claude has gotten a lot of popular media attention in the last few weeks, and the influx of users is constraining compute/memory on an already compute heavy model.
So you get all the suspected "tricks" like quantization, shorter thinking, KV cache optimizations.It feels like the same thing that happened to Gemini 3, and what you can even feel throughout the day (the models seem smartest at 12am).Dario in his interview with dwarkesh last week also lamented the same refrain that other lab leaders have: compute is constrained and there are big tradeoffs in how you allocate it. It feels safe to reason then that they will use any trick they can to free up compute.

What is interesting is that OpenAI and GitHub seem to be taking the opposite approach with Copilot/OpenCode, essentially treating third-party tool access as a feature that increases subscription stickiness. Different bets on whether the LTV of a retained subscriber outweighs the marginal inference cost.Would not be surprised if this converges eventually. Either Anthropic opens up once their margins improve, or OpenAI tightens once they realize the arbitrage is too expensive at scale.

I'm rather certain, though cannot prove it, that buying the same tokens would cost at least 10x more if bought from API. Anecdotally, my cursor team usage was getting to around 700$ / month. After switching to claude code max, I have so far only once hit the 3h limit window on the 100$ sub.What Im thinking is that Anthropic is making loss with users who use it a lot, but there are a lot of users who pay for max, but don't actually use it.With the recent improvements and increase of popularity in projects like OpenClaw, the number of users that are generating loss has probably massively increased.

API limits are infinite but you'd blow through $20 of usage in a maybe 1 hours or less of intense Opus use.The subscription at $20/mo (or $200) allows for vastly more queries than $20 would buy you via API but you are constrained by hourly/weekly limits.The $20/mo sub user will take a lot longer to complete a high token count task (due to start/stop) BUT they will cap their costs.

Their bet is that most people will not fill up 100% of their weekly usage for 4 consecutive weeks of their monthly plan, because they are humans and the limits impede long running tasks during working hours.

Banning third-party tools has nothing to do with rate limits. They're trying to position themselves as the Apple of AI companies -a walled garden. They may soon discover that screwing developers is not a good strategy.They are not 10× better than Codex; on the contrary, in my opinion Codex produces much better code. Even Kimi K2.5 is a very capable model I find on par with Sonnet at least, very close to Opus. Forcing people to use ONLY a broken Claude Code UX with a subscription only ensures they loose advantage they had.

Google AI Pro is like $15/month for practically unlimited Pro requests, each of which take million tokens of context (and then also perform thinking, free Google search for grounding, inline image generation if needed). This includes Gemini CLI, Gemini Code Assist (VS Code), the main chatbot, and a bunch of other vibe-coding projects which have their own rate limits or no rate limits at all.It's crazy to think this is sustainable. It'll be like Xbox Game Pass - start at £5/month to hook people in and before you know it it's £20/month and has nowhere near as many games.

Google has made custom AI chips for 11 years — since 2015 — and inference costs them 2-5x less than it does for every other competitor.The landmark paper that invented the techniques behind ChatGPT, Claude and modern AI was also published by Google scientists 9 years ago.That's probably how they can afford it.

Google already has a huge competitive advantage because they have more data than anyone else, bundle Gemini in each android to siphon even more data, and the android platform. The TPUs truly make me believe there actually could be a sort of monopoly on LLMs in the end, even though there are so many good models with open weights, so little (technical) reasons to create software that only integrates with Gemini, etc.Google will have a lion‘s share of inferring I believe. OpenAI and Claude will have a very hard time fighting this.

My point was simpler: they're almost certainly not losing money on subscriptions because of inference. Inference is relatively cheap. And of course the big cost is training and ongoing R&D.The real issue is the market they're in. They're competing with companies like Kimi and DeepSeek that also spend heavily on R&D but release strong models openly. That means anyone can run inference and customers can use it without paying for bundled research costs.Training frontier models takes months, costs billions, and the model is outdated in six months. I just don't see how a closed, subscription-only model reliably covers that in the long run, especially if you're tightening ecosystem access at the same time.

Anthropic sells two products: a consumer subscription with a UI, and an API with metered pricing. You want the API product at the subscription price. That's not a principled stance about interface freedom, it's just wanting something for less than it costs.The nvim analogy doesn't land either. Nobody's stopping you from writing your own client. You just have to pay API rates for it, because that's the product that matches what you're describing. The subscription subsidises the cost per token by constraining how you use it. Remove the constraint, the economics break. This isn't complicated."I don't give a shit about Anthropic's credit liability," right, but they do, because it's their business. You're not entitled to a flat-rate all-you-can-eat API just because you find metered pricing aesthetically displeasing.

I'm not trying to arbitrage or route around anything, I just want predictable billing to access the model. Maybe the API would be cheaper for me, I don't know. I'm just a normal user, not scheduling an agent army to blast at maximum 24/7.You don't need to explain what Anthropic is selling, I get it, but you're off-base claiming that I'm pretending about editor philosophy as cope. I think Anthropic is where they are today because they have a good model for coding, made popular by software folks who value things like editor choice and customization. Anthropic is free to do as they wish of course, as am I, but I'm displeased with their decision here, and voicing my opinion about it.If usage is truly constrained by the client not the server, I guess I can't argue that, but it still feels bad as an end user. As a consumer, I just want a fair deal and freedom to use what I purchase however I see fit. But that seems harder to find these days, and most businesses seem intent on maximum extraction by any means possible. I might be wrong, but this feels like business move to build a consumer moat by controlling the interface, because consumers don't want the API. It's not in my best interests, which alienates me as a customer.

reply

I didn't set the limits on the plan; change those if it's a problem, not irritate your customer base.

reply

The issue is not that it's limited or unlimited, but rather about expected token usage across a user cohort. When you set a usage limit on something like Claude, or a gym, or a tutoring center, you need to do two things at once; set the limit high enough to attract the aspirations of your intended client base ("oh good this gym lets me go every day of the month if I want to"), but priced accurately enough so that you actually turn a profit on the average usage across most users (you ended up going 20 times the first month, but settled into 15 times a month after).If there was suddenly a drug that you could take that would, while you slept, make your body walk to the gym and workout, so that you could max out that usage, the gym would be entitled to adjust either the pricing, the limit, or prohibit going to the gym while on the drug, given that they can't actually sustain all their members going every day.As a correction, I've done some reading and when I said tragedy of the commons, what would fit better is a "congestion externality in a  club good".

It's more buying a season pass for Disneyland, then getting told you can't park for free if you're entering the park even though free parking is included with the pass. Still not unreasonable, but brings to light the intention of the tool is to force the user into an ecosystem rather.

reply

But 'you can't park even though the ticket includes parking' is not an appropriate analogy because 3rd party use is definitely not intended. They did not 'state one thing' and the 'disallow it'.This is a pretty straight forward case of people using their subscription for 'adjacent' use, and Anthropic being more explicit about it.There's nothing fancy going on here.

You're now misinterpreting my argument and misrepresenting it. I did not, in any way, suggest that Anthropic was "pulling the rug" to its users nor that they were entitled to use their tokens using the API with third parties. Full stop.Of course, third-party API usage wasn't intended to be allowed for consuming subscription tokens. This is exactly what my analogy was structured to explain; a Disneyland season pass isn't intended to be used solely for parking. Anthropic did not intend for subscription tokens to be consumed by third-parties the same way users did not intend to abuse the subscription to derive more value than what was allotted to them. Your analogy missed that last part, which is absolutely crucial to understand.I don't understand how you're making the exact arguments I'm making, then somehow completely misunderstanding what's being said.

I think what they want to achieve here is less "kill openclaw" or similar and more "keep our losses under control in general". And now they have a clear criteria to refer when they take action and a good bisection on whom to act on.In case your usage is high they would block / take action. Because if you have your max subscription and not really losing them money, why should they push you (the monopoly incentive sounds wrong with the current market).

There are many other options too: direct API, other model providers, etc. But Opus is particularly good for "agent with a personality" applications, so it's what thousands of OpenClaw users go with, mostly via the OAuth token, because it's much cheaper than the API.

From a backend perspective, the subscription model creates perverse incentives. Heavy users (like developers running agentic workflows) consume far more compute than casual users, but pay the same price. Third-party tools amplify this asymmetry.Anthropic's move is economically rational but strategically risky. Models are increasingly fungible - Gemini 3.1 and Claude 4.5 produce similar results for most tasks. The lock-in isn't the model; it's the tooling ecosystem.By forcing users onto Claude Code exclusively, they're betting their tooling moat is stronger than competitor models. Given how quickly open-source harnesses like pi have caught up, that's a bold bet.

Also, can you not setup a proxy for the cert and a packet sniffer to watch whatever ClaudeCode is doing with respect to API access? To me, if you have "secret sauce" you have to keep it server side and make the client as dumb as possible. Especially if your client is executes as Javascript.

This could be used to adhere to Claude's TOS while still allowing the user to switch AI companies at a moment's notice.Right now there's limited customizability in this approach, but I think it's not far-fetched to see FAR more integrated solutions in the future if the lock-in trend continues.

(Input-level features like commands get resolved by meta-agent UI before being sent to claude code)- Claude Code must use the tools and skills directly from meta-agent MCP as instructed in the prompt, and because its own tools are permission denied (result: very good UI integration with the meta-agent UI)- This would also work with any other CLI coding agent (Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI etc.) should they start getting ideas of locking users in- If Claude Code rug-pulls subscription quotas, just switch to a competitor instantlyAll it requires is a CLI coding agent with MCP support, and the TOS allowing automatic use of its UI (disallowing that would be massive hypocrisy as the AI companies themselves make computer use agents that allow automatic use of other apps' UI)

Also, why not distribute implementation documentation so claudecode can write OpenCode itself and use your oauth token.  Now you have opencode for personal use, you didn't get it from anywhere your agent created it for you and only you.

They are literally alienating a large percentage of OpenClaw, NanoClaw, PicoClaw, customers because those customers will surely not be willing to pay API pricing, which is at least 6-10x Max Plan pricing (for my usage).This isn't too surprising to me since they probably have a direct competitor to openclaw et al in the works right now, but until then I am cancelling my subscription and porting my nanoclaw fork with mem0 integration to work with OpenAI instead.Thats not a “That'll teach ‘em” statement, it is just my own cost optimization. I am quite fond of Anthropic's coding models and might still subscribe again at the $20 level, but they just priced me out for personal assistant, research, and 90% of my token use case.

in any case Codex is a better SOTA anyways and they let you do this. and if you aren't interested in the best models, Mistral lets you use both Vibe and their API through your vibe subscription api key which is incredible.

Many ways, and they're under no obligation to play fair and tell you which way they're using at any given time. They've said what the rules are, they've said they'll ban you if they catch you.So let's say they enforce it by adding an extra nonstandard challenge-response handshake at the beginning of the exchange, which generates a token which they'll expect on all requests going forward. You decompile the minified JS code, figure out the protocol, try it from your own code but accidentally mess up a small detail (you didn't realize the nonce has a special suffix). Detected. Banned.You'll need a new credit card to open a new account and try again. Better get the protocol right on the first try this time, because debugging is going to get expensive.Let's say you get frustrated and post on Twitter about what you know so far. If you share info, they'll probably see it eventually and change their method. They'll probably change it once a month anyway and see who they catch that way (and presumably add a minimum Claude Code version needed to reach their servers).They've got hundreds of super smart coders and one of the most powerful AI models, they can do this all day.

There are lots of ways they could be doing this.

I'm sure a few people will figure it out, but they won't want to tell anyone lest Anthropic nerf their workaround, so I doubt that exploits of this will become widespread.And if you're Anthropic, that's probably good enough.

The feature allows the LLM to edit the context. For example, you can "compact" just portions of the conversation and replace it with a summary. Anthropic can see that the conversation suddenly doesn't share the same history as previous API calls.In fact, I ported the feature to Claude Code using tweakcc, so it literally _is_ Claude Code. After a couple days they started blocking that with the same message that they send when they block third party tools.

This is the VC funded startup playbook. It has been repeated many times, but maybe for the younger crowd it is new. Start a new service that is relatively permissive, then gradually restrict APIs and permissions. Finally, start throwing in ads and/or making it more expensive to use. Part of the reason is in the beginning they are trying to get as many users as possible and burning VC money. Then once the honey moon is over, they need to make a profit so they cut back on services, nerf stuff, increase prices and start adding ads.

It suggests to me Anthropic is less concerned with the financial impact of letting subscribers use alternative tools and more concerned with creating lock in to their products and subscriptions. It very well might backfire though, I was not considering alternative models yesterday, but today I am actively exploring other options and considering cancelling my sub. I've been using my subscription primarily through pi recently, so if they aren't interested in me as a customer, pretty much everyone else is.

Regarding consumer freedom, I believe software running on user machines should serve the interests of the user, not the company who wrote the software or anyone else for that matter. Trying to force users to run a particular client written by your company violates this principle.Regarding competition, forcing users to run a particular client is a form of anti competitive bundling, a naked attempt to prevent alternative clients from being able to enter the market unless they are able to build a competing backed as well. Such artificial "moats" are great for companies but harmful to consumers.

The markets value recurring subscription revenue at something like 10x “one-off” revenue, Anthropic is leaving a lot of enterprise value on the table with this approach.In practice this approach forces AI apps to pay Anthropic for tokens, and then bill their customers a subscription. Customers could bring their own API key but it's sketchy to put that into every app you want to try, and consumers aren't going to use developer tools. And many categories of free app are simply excluded, which could in aggregate drive a lot more demand for subscriptions.If Anthropic is worried about quota, seems they could set lower caps for third-party subscription usage? Still better than forcing API keys.(Maybe this is purely about displacing other IDE products, rather than a broader market play.)

Look at your token usage of the last 30 days in one of the JSON files generated by Claude Code. Compare that against API costs for Opus. Tell me if they are eating losses or not. I'm not making a point, actually do it and let me know. I was at 1 million. I'm paying 90 EUR/m. That means I'm subsidizing them (paying 3-4 times what it would cost with the API)! And I feel like I'm a pretty heavy user. Although people running it in a loop or using Gas Town will be using much more.

Over 9 days I would have spent roughly $63 dollars on Codex with 11.5M input tokens plus 141M cached input tokens and 1.3M output tokens.That roughly mirrors the $100-200/wk in API spending that drove me to the subscription.  | Category | Tokens | Rate (/1M) | Estimated Cost |

DeepSeek has the tendency to think... a lot!. Without a good harness I can't evaluate it well; time will tell.OpenAI doesn't; it's embedded into the price, I think.Cheap = we can run 10x the workloads, bigger imagination = innovation. Maybe 10 dumb agents in a loop can beat 1 Opus? Haha.

I don't think Anthropic has any desire to be some B2C platform, they want high paying reliable customers (B2B, Enterprise).

Cloud goes on the books as recurring revenue, not one-off; even though it's in principle elastic, in practice if I pay for a VM today I'll usually pay for one tomorrow.(I don't have the numbers but the vast majority of cloud revenue is also going to be pre-committed long-term contracts from enterprises.)> I don't think Anthropic has any desire to be some B2C platformThis is the best line of argument I can see. But still not clear to me why my OP doesn't apply for enterprise, too.Maybe the play is just to force other companies to become MCPs, instead of enabling them to have a direct customer relationship.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

NASA counted down to T-minus 29 seconds during a smooth rehearsal for a historic launch that could send astronauts around the moon for the first time in more than half a century.

The run-through at Launch Complex 39B, at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, was known as a wet dress rehearsal because it involved filling up the propellant tanks on NASA's Space Launch System, a 322-foot-tall rocket that made its debut with 2022's uncrewed Artemis 1 mission.

The only major component that was missing at the launch pad was the crew. NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman, the commander for the Artemis 2 mission, said in a posting to X that he was watching the proceedings from NASA's Launch Control Center.

Once NASA reviews the results of the two-day rehearsal, mission managers will decide whether to give the final go-ahead for the Artemis 2 crew's 10-day trip around the moon and back.

Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for NASA's Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, said the space agency is targeting March 6 for liftoff. “Every night I look at the moon, and I see it, and I get real excited because I can really feel she's calling us,” she told reporters today. “And we're ready.”

This week's simulated countdown provided an opportunity for NASA to check out the Space Launch System rocket, the Orion crew capsule and ground support systems in advance of the actual launch.

An initial rehearsal on Feb. 2 was stopped at roughly T-minus 5 minutes due to a liquid hydrogen leak. Engineers made repairs at the pad, including a replacement of the hydrogen seals, to clear the way for a replay of the rehearsal.

On Thursday night, NASA worked through some communication problems at the pad — and the team dealt with what it called a “booster avionics system voltage anomaly” during the final minutes of the countdown. But the count eventually proceeded as planned to T-minus 33 seconds. At that point the countdown was paused and recycled to T-minus 10 minutes.

It took about an hour to reconfigure the rocket's fueling system for another terminal count. Then NASA's launch team went through an even smoother second countdown and reached the scheduled stopping point at T-minus 29 seconds.

Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, Artemis 2's launch director, said the maximum hydrogen leak rate during fueling was 1.6% — far below NASA's 16% limit. “Really no leakage to speak of,” she said.

John Honeycutt, the chair of Artemis 2's Mission Management Team, had a similarly positive assessment. “Overall it was a good day for us,” he said.

The four crew members for Artemis 2 are due to go into quarantine today. In addition to Wiseman, the crew includes NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Victor Glover, plus Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen. Glaze said the crew was in Florida for this week's rehearsal, but will start their quarantine back in Texas.

Artemis 2's flight plan calls for sending the astronauts on a figure-8 route around the moon and back. The trip will take them as far as 4,600 miles beyond the far side of the moon — farther out than any human has gone before.

Although Artemis 2 will be historic in its own right, the mission's main purpose is to prepare the way for Artemis 3, which aims to land humans on the lunar surface for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972. That mission is officially set for no earlier than mid-2027, but industry experts expect the schedule to slip.

Several companies headquartered in the Seattle area have a significant interest in the Artemis moon program. A facility in Redmond operated by L3Harris (previously known as Aerojet Rocketdyne) builds thrusters for the Orion spacecraft — and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture, based in Kent, is developing a Blue Moon lander that's meant to put Artemis crews on the lunar surface starting in 2030. Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket is expected to send an uncrewed cargo version of its lander to the moon sometime in the next few months.

In the last year, AI agents have become all the rage. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic all launched public-facing agents designed to take on multi-step tasks handed to them by humans. In the last month, an open-source AI agent called OpenClaw took the web by storm thanks to its impressive autonomous capabilities (and major security concerns). But we don't really have a sense of the scale of AI agent operations, and whether all the talk is matched by actual deployment. The MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) set out to fix that with its recently published 2025 AI Agent Index, which provides our first real look at the scale and operations of AI agents in the wild.

Researchers found that interest in AI agents has undoubtedly skyrocketed in the last year or so. Research papers mentioning “AI Agent” or “Agentic AI” in 2025 more than doubled the total from 2020 to 2024 combined, and a McKinsey survey found that 62% of companies reported that their organizations were at least experimenting with AI agents.

With all that interest, the researchers focused on 30 prominent AI agents across three separate categories: chat-based options like ChatGPT Agent and Claude Code; browser-based bots like Perplexity Comet and ChatGPT Atlas; and enterprise options like Microsoft 365 Copilot and ServiceNow Agent. While the researchers didn't provide exact figures on just how many AI agents are deployed across the web, they did offer a considerable amount of insight into how they are operating, which is largely without a safety net.

Just half of the 30 AI agents that got put under the magnifying glass by MIT CSAIL include published safety or trust frameworks, like Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy, OpenAI's Preparedness Framework, or Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. One in three agents has no safety framework documentation whatsoever, and five out of 30 have no compliance standards. That is troubling when you consider that 13 of 30 systems reviewed exhibit frontier levels of agency, meaning they can operate largely without human oversight across extended task sequences. Browser agents in particular tend to operate with significantly higher autonomy. This would include things like Google's recently launched AI “Autobrowse,” which can complete multi-step tasks by navigating different websites and making use of user information to do things like log into sites on your behalf.

One of the troubles with letting agents browse freely and with few guardrails is that their activity is nearly indistinguishable from human behavior, and they do little to dispel any confusion that might occur. The researchers found that 21 out of the 30 agents provide no disclosure to end users or third parties that they are AI agents and not human users. This results in most AI agent activity being mistaken for human traffic. MIT found that just seven agents published stable User-Agent (UA) strings and IP address ranges for verification. Nearly as many explicitly use Chrome-like UA strings and residential/local IP contexts to make their traffic requests appear more human, making it next to impossible for a website to distinguish between authentic traffic and bot behavior.

For some AI agents, that's actually a marketable feature. The researchers found that BrowserUse, an open-source AI agent, sells itself to users by claiming to bypass anti-bot systems to browse “like a human.” More than half of all the bots tested provide no specific documentation about how they handle robots.txt files (text files that are placed in a website's root directory to instruct web crawlers on how they can interact with the site), CAPTCHAs that are meant to authenticate human traffic, or site APIs. Perplexity has even made the case that agents acting on behalf of users shouldn't be subject to scraping restrictions since they function “just like a human assistant.”

The fact that these agents are out in the wild without much protection in place means there is a real threat of exploits. There is a lack of standardization for safety evaluations and disclosures, leaving many agents potentially vulnerable to attacks like prompt injections, in which an AI agent picks up on a hidden malicious prompt that can make it break its safety protocols. Per MIT, nine of 30 agents have no documentation of guardrails against potentially harmful actions. Nearly all of the agents fail to disclose internal safety testing results, and 23 of the 30 offer no third-party testing information on safety.

Just four agents—ChatGPT Agent, OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini 2.5—provided agent-specific system cards, meaning the safety evaluations were tailored to how the agent actually operates, not just the underlying model. But frontier labs like OpenAI and Google offer more documentation on “existential and behavioral alignment risks,” they lack details on the type of security vulnerabilities that may arise during day-to-day activities—a habit that the researchers refer to as “safety washing,” which they describe as publishing high-level safety and ethics frameworks while only selectively disclosing the empirical evidence required to rigorously assess risk.

There has at least been some momentum toward addressing the concerns raised by MIT's researchers. Back in December, OpenAI and Anthropic (among others) joined forces, announcing a foundation to create a development standard for AI agents. But the AI Agent Index shows just how wide the transparency gap is when it comes to agentic AI operation. AI agents are flooding the web and workplace, functioning with a shocking amount of autonomy and minimal oversight. There's little to indicate at the moment that safety will catch up to scale any time soon.

The Seattle Seahawks have been officially for sale for a day, but the speculation about who could be the next owner of the team has been in high gear for years. National media personalities are now playing catch-up.

“The Rich Eisen Show” on ESPN / Disney+ weighed in Thursday (above) with a flurry of Seattle-connected names who could step in to buy the NFL franchise — some serious and some not so much.

Eisen said that the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen bought the team for about $140 million and change in 1997, and that while he's not an investor, Eisen knows the 2026 price tag “is gonna be more than that.”

The show's mock consulting firm — RES Consulting — then started throwing out names: actors Rainn Wilson, Adam Ray, Joel McHale and Jeffrey Dean Morgan; rockers Eddie Vedder and Jerry Cantrell; hip-hop stars Sir Mix-a-Lot and Macklemore; Kraken co-owner and Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer; and even Bill Nye the Science Guy.

But Eisen listed Bellevue, Wash.-based ex-Microsoft CEO and Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer as perhaps the most legitimate billionaire name on their speculative list. Ballmer, with a net worth of $141 billion, could buy the whole NFL, said one of the show's sidekicks.

“He could be the guy at the end of the day,” Eisen said.

There's a belief in league circles that Jeff Bezos will not be in play for the team, says Mike Florio of NBC's “Pro Football Talk,” reiterating that while the Amazon founder lived in Seattle for 30 years, he's now an East Coast guy down in Miami.

“We'll see, because obviously if he wants it he's gonna get it,” Florio said of Bezos in a nod to his $231 billion net worth.

The bigger possibility, according to Florio, is that there's a tech billionaire out there “that we don't know about, who's gonna show up with the biggest bag of money.”

Florio said the team's valuation, whether it's $6 billion, $7 billion, $11 billion or more, doesn't matter. It's about what someone is willing to pay to be part of the exclusive NFL owners club.

“I'll be surprised if it's less than 9 [billion], I won't be surprised if it's more than 10,” he said.

A concern for Seahawks fans, Florio says, is that a new owner comes in, and despite the turnkey and move-in ready appearance of the championship team, that owner will want to put his or her stamp on things.

“If I'm a Seahawks fan I want someone who just stays out of the way,” Florio said, “and gives the team all the resources that it needs.”

New insights into spontaneous coronary artery dissection – a devastating cause of heart attacks in young, healthy patients – were presented today at the EAPCI Summit 2026. The summit is a new event organised by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), an association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an emergency condition in which an inner layer of a coronary artery tears away from the outer layer. Blood collects in the space between the layers, causing a haematoma that reduces blood flow and can lead to a heart attack (myocardial infarction [MI]). Most patients affected by SCAD are healthy women with few traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.

SCAD was considered rare but awareness of the condition is growing. SCAD still remains under-diagnosed and under-studied with few, if any, randomised trials conducted to define the most appropriate treatment approach. The mechanisms responsible for MIs after SCAD are very different from MIs caused by atherosclerosis and yet they are often treated in the same way. We created a national prospective registry to understand more about SCAD, treatment practices and outcomes, and to fill a gap in knowledge about patients from Eastern European countries."

Professor Svetlana Apostolović, study presenter, University Clinical Center Nis, Serbia

This analysis of the Serbian SCAD Registry included 123 patients who attended 14 centres specialising in interventional cardiology from November 2021 to November 2024. In total, 27 patients were retrospectively studied and 96 were prospectively studied. Intracoronary imaging techniques were used to establish the SCAD diagnosis in 26.0% of patients.

The majority were female (85.4%) and the mean age was 47.5 years. In total, 6.7% of patients were pregnant or in the postpartum period, while 36.2% were menopausal. The most frequent risk factors were hypertension (49.6%) and dyslipidaemia (46.3%). Where known, the most common precipitating factors were mental stress (38.5%) and physical stress (10.7%).

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 41.5% of patients, which involved stent implantation in 28.5% of all patients. Medical therapy alone was received by 58.5%. Overall, more than half of patients received dual antiplatelet therapy (58.5%) and low-molecular weight heparin (56.9%).

During hospitalization, 23.6% of patients experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE: recurrent MI, hemodynamic instability, malignant arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, unplanned revascularisation or a cerebrovascular event) and 8.1% of all patients died.

In the 30 days after hospitalization, 18.1% of patients experienced MACE and 0.8% died. Independent predictors for MACE included stent implantation (p=0.010) and depression (p=0.008).

Full resolution of SCAD was observed in 62.2% of patients after 30 days.

Professor Apostolović summed up the findings: "SCAD was most common in non-pregnant young women and menopausal women, with intracoronary imaging found to be particularly useful in enabling accurate diagnosis. SCAD often resolved fully and stent implantation was not beneficial in the majority of patients. Careful observation alongside beta-blockers, blood-pressure lowering medication, cardiac rehabilitation and psychological support may improve outcomes and reduce the impact on patients' daily lives, but more studies and trials are needed."

Further insights regarding epidemiology, presentation, management and outcomes will be provided by the ESC's ongoing large, multinational SCAD registry.

Researchers at the University of Seville have analyzed alterations in the cerebral cortex in people suffering from psychosis. Their findings show that psychosis does not follow a single trajectory, but rather its evolution depends on a complex interaction between brain development, symptoms, cognition and treatment. The authors therefore emphasize the need to adopt more personalised approaches that take individual differences into account in order to better understand the disease and optimize long-term therapeutic strategies.

Psychosis is a set of symptoms—such as hallucinations and delusions—that are common in schizophrenia and involve a loss of contact with reality. From their first manifestation, known as the first psychotic episode, these symptoms can appear and evolve in very different ways between individuals, thus making schizophrenia a particularly complex disorder.

The results of the study show that, at the time of the first episode, people with psychosis present a reduction in cortical volume, which is particularly marked in regions with a high density of serotonin and dopamine receptors, key neurotransmitters in both the pathophysiology of psychosis and the mechanism of action of antipsychotics. The data also suggest that both neurons and other brain cells involved in inflammatory and immunological processes may play an important role in the disease.

These structural differences tend to diminish during treatment, thereby suggesting that the rate of brain deterioration is attenuated by clinical intervention. However, more marked differences persist in people who receive higher doses of antipsychotic medication over time. This does not necessarily imply that the medication causes volume loss, but rather that those patients with more severe symptoms often require higher doses.

The study also confirms that these patients show cognitive impairments from very early stages. Throughout follow-up, many individuals experienced improvement in both symptoms and cognition, thus suggesting that clinical stabilisation may be accompanied by partial recovery of these functions. However, this improvement is less pronounced in those who require higher-dose treatments.

In the study led by Claudio Alemán Morillo and Rafael Romero García at the Neuroimaging and Brain Networks Laboratory of the University of Seville, and published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, magnetic resonance images were acquired to calculate the volume of different regions of the cerebral cortex in 357 patients with schizophrenia and 195 controls.

One of the most relevant aspects of the study is that the participants were evaluated over a period of ten years, thereby allowing an analysis of how the brain changes in the long term and how these changes are related to clinical symptoms and cognitive performance, including possible difficulties in attention, memory, or processing speed. In addition, the study applies a percentile-based analysis for the first time. Just as percentiles are used in paediatrics to identify deviations in weight or height, they can now be used to detect whether certain brain regions have atypical volumes.

On February 17, 2026, Lizette Rivera did not clock in for her regular shift in the ICU at West Anaheim Medical Center in Anaheim, California. Instead, she joined her colleagues on the picket line. It's a decision that the registered nurse (RN) doesn't take lightly.

“Nobody ever wants to strike,” Rivera said. “It's something that we try to avoid at all costs…we always hope that we can settle something before having to strike.”

Nurses have been bargaining with West Anaheim Medical Center for a year with no resolution to their concerns about patient care, safe staffing, and retention and recruitment, leaving RNs feeling like a strike was their only option.

“[Unsafe staffing levels] means that patients aren't always getting optimal care,” Rivera said. “Appropriate staffing, competitive wages, and competitive benefits would make nurses feel acknowledged, make them feel…appreciated and make them want to stay for the long term and build a career.”

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Future of Nurse Unions Report 2025 found that:

Rivera is not alone on the picket lines. In January of this year, 30,000 nurses walked off the job at Kaiser Permanente facilities in California and Hawaii and 15,000 nurses went on strike in New York City. Low wages and high turnover have been pervasive issues, leading to unsafe staffing levels and concerns about patient safety in the nurse's view. In fact, 68.3% of nurses reported that there were not enough staff and 77.3% cited workloads that were unsafe for patients.

Rivera received 6 weeks of training when she joined one of the highest-admitting units at West Anaheim Medical Center in 2024. Within 5 months, she was promoted to charge nurse and started training other nurses — and she was still a recent nursing school graduate.

“It's not an appropriate assignment,” she said. “Having competitive wages and benefits would allow us to retain our nurses rather than have them come in, get minimal experience, and move on to hospitals with better options.”

The impact of low wages, high turnover, and unsafe staffing levels are visible at the bedside and have been linked to poor patient outcomes, including higher risk for preventable infections, falls, and deaths, according to Linda H Aiken, PhD, RN, professor and founding director at the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. These issues are at the root of nursing strikes.

“Nurses don't strike unless they believe their patients are unsafe,” said Aiken. “And they strike as a last resort.”

Despite persistent concerns, only two states — California and Oregon — have enacted minimum nurse staffing requirements. Aiken noted that the lack of policy guardrails in other states allows unsafe staffing levels to persist and is among the reasons that nurses continue to strike.

The nurses at West Anaheim Medical Center went on strike in August 2025. The walkout was an effort to secure a contract that addressed high turnover, and included improved efforts to attract and retain nursing staff, and required strict adherence to nurse-to-patient ratio requirements.

“We didn't want to strike,” Rivera added. “We were on strike for 1 day to show [the hospital] that we care and we want the attention from management to take us seriously.”

Hospital systems have called nursing strikes “unnecessary [and] disruptive” and referred to the RNs requests as “extreme economic demands” that put patients at risk. But RNs do think about how strikes affect their patients; awareness of care disruptions is among the reasons that nursing strikes tend to be time-limited, according to Aiken.

“Nurses only strike when it's absolutely necessary, and they try to keep the time out to a minimum,” Aiken told Medscape Medical News.

In New York, nurses at Montefiore, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Mount Sinai Morningside and West were on strike for four weeks before reaching a tentative agreement. Nurses at NewYork-Presbyterian rejected a proposal because the hospital did not agree to safe staffing protections and remain on the picket lines.

The 2026 strike at the West Anaheim Medical Center was scheduled to last for 3 days. Rivera hopes that the scheduled strike forces hospital leadership to deliver a suitable contract that addresses RN concerns.

“We are there for our patients…to give the best care that we can,” she said. “We care about the outcomes and [the hospital] puts us in situations where we feel undervalued.”

New contract agreements might mean an end to a strike, but RNs could end up back on the picket lines in the future.

Aiken points to hospital consolidation and corporatization as factors that influence wages, benefits, and staffing, leading to higher patient-to-nurse ratios, unsafe staffing levels, increased burnout, and lower job satisfaction.

“Because hospitals are more and more part of these large organizations and…people further and further away from patient care and further and further away from the communities where the care is taking place are making decisions about their staffing levels with pretty disastrous consequences,” she added.

Union contracts have become one of the few mechanisms to negotiate staffing language in the absence of statewide mandates. Strikes might be inevitable if hospitals refuse to negotiate agreements that reflect changing economic factors and refuse to listen to nurses on the front lines of patient care.

“Nurses are striking because we don't really have any standards,” Aiken said. “What we've reverted to is relying on unions where they exist [and] unions are providing the only guardrail…through their periodic renegotiations of contracts that involve staffing.”

Preliminary results from an Italian registry describe the risk profile of women experiencing acute coronary syndromes and provide insights to improve management. These findings were presented today at the EAPCI Summit 2026, a new event organized by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), an association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

Ischaemic heart disease is a common condition in which the coronary arteries become narrowed due to the build-up of fatty material. Acute manifestations of ischaemic heart disease – called acute coronary syndromes (ACS) – include angina and heart attacks (myocardial infarction [MI]).

ACS shows important differences between men and women. Evidence suggests that although fewer women develop ACS than men, women are at greater risk of dying than men in the same age group.

As explained by Doctor Francesca Napoli from IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, more needs to be done to understand ACS and its effective treatment in women: "There is underrepresentation of women with ACS in clinical trials, despite cardiovascular disease being a leading cause of mortality." She continued: "The Gender, Diversity and Inclusion–Acute Coronary Syndromes (GEDI–ACS) registry is the first multicentre, prospective Italian registry dedicated to studying ACS in women. We aim to integrate clinical, sex-specific, socioeconomic, psychosocial, biochemical and molecular data to capture a multidimensional perspective and ultimately advance more accurate diagnosis, equitable management and improved outcomes for women with ACS."

The study is enrolling 100 consecutive women presenting with ACS (ST-segment elevation MI [STEMI], non-ST-segment elevation MI [NSTEMI]) or unstable angina) across multiple centres in Northern and Southern Italy: IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan), AOU Federico II Naples (Naples), Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Milan) and Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico (Milan), ensuring the inclusion of patients from different geographic, socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.

Clinical data from the first 68 patients were presented at the EAPCI Summit. The median age of the study population was 68 years and 7.4% were non-Caucasian. Most women (85.3%) had low health literacy.

Cardiovascular risk factors were frequently observed: 83.6% had dyslipidaemia, 77.9% had hypertension and 50.0% had a history of smoking. In total, 32.3% reported miscarriage and 16.2% reported premature menopause. Autoimmune diseases were present in 32.2% of patients, while 16.2% had a history of cancer and almost half (42.6%) experienced anxiety/depression.

For most patients, ACS (86.0%) was the first manifestation of cardiovascular disease, with chest pain (88.2%) the main symptom. The type of ACS was STEMI in 38.2% of women, NSTEMI in 36.8% and unstable angina in 25.0%. Over one-third (38.2%) had MI with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), a condition that occurs when patients have a heart attack without evidence of major blockages to the coronary arteries. 

Outcomes were favourable – no deaths, strokes or reinfarctions occurred during the first 30 days. Recurrent chest pain was experienced by 11.3% of patients.

Doctor Napoli discussed the implications: "ACS often represented the first cardiovascular event. The common coexistence of ACS with noncardiac comorbidities, miscarriage and premature menopause provide insights into how we may be able to tailor preventive approaches. MINOCA was also a frequent finding and yet the best way to treat it is still unknown. The high levels of anxiety/depression and poor health literacy we found are important considerations as we try to support women with ACS more effectively to enhance recovery."

The registry will continue with additional enrolment and follow-up. We will also combine clinical findings with genetic and molecular data to deepen our understanding of disease mechanisms and contribute to more precise and inclusive approaches to ACS care in women."

A new research paper was published in Volume 18 of Aging-US on February 8, 2026, titled "Single-cell transcriptomics reveal intrinsic and systemic T cell aging in COVID-19 and HIV."

In this study, co-first authors Alan Tomusiak from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the University of Southern California, and Sierra Lore from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the University of Copenhagen, together with corresponding author Eric Verdin from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, developed a new single-cell transcriptomic clock called T immune cell transcriptomic clock (Tictock) to measure aging in specific immune cells. 

Immune aging increases susceptibility to infection, cancer, and chronic inflammatory disease. Most aging clocks, used to measure it, rely on bulk measurements from mixed cell populations. As a result, they cannot determine whether age-related signals reflect shifts in cell proportions or true molecular aging within defined immune cells.

To address this limitation, the research team used single-cell RNA sequencing, a method that measures gene expression in individual cells. They analyzed nearly two million immune cells from the blood of healthy adults to develop Tictock. This tool integrates automated classification of six canonical T cell subsets with cell-type specific age prediction models. This design enables the separation of systemic aging, reflected by changes in cell proportions, from intrinsic aging, which occurs within individual cells.

When the team applied Tictock to patients with acute COVID-19, they found two clear effects. First, COVID-19 altered T cell composition, including significant reductions in naïve CD8 and naïve CD4 T cells. Second, the infection increased the biological age of naïve CD8 T cells. In people living with HIV who were receiving long-term antiretroviral therapy, T cell proportions remained largely stable. However, naïve CD8 T cells still showed signs of accelerated aging.

The study also uncovered shared biological pathways linked to immune aging. Many of the genes that predicted age were involved in ribosomes, the structures that help cells produce proteins. The researchers also observed that older immune cells often had shorter average transcript lengths, a feature previously linked to aging. These findings suggest that changes in protein production and gene regulation play an important role in immune decline.

"Gene Ontology enrichment of 209 genes shared across six clock models identified common pathways including the cytosolic small ribosomal subunit, TNF receptor binding, and cytosolic ribosome components."

Overall, Tictock was designed to measure relative aging within defined T cell populations rather than overall biological aging. By distinguishing systemic from cell-intrinsic immune aging, it provides a clearer understanding of how viral infections such as COVID-19 and HIV reshape immune function. This approach enables the study of immune aging at single-cell resolution and may support improved immune risk assessment in clinical and research settings.

The Hebrew University of Jerusalem is proud to announce the establishment of the Sally Einstein Brain Research Program, made possible by a ₪1,000,000 (USD $300,930) grant from the Sim Einstein Research Foundation, Inc.

The university extends its warmest congratulations to Dr. Or Shemesh and his team at the Hebrew University School of Pharmacy on receiving this prestigious award. Their two-year research project, titled "The Infectious Etiology of Brain Disease," will pioneer a cross-disciplinary approach to understanding how pathogens contribute to some of the world's most challenging neurological conditions.

The Shemesh Lab will investigate the role of infectious agents in a broad spectrum of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, PANDAS & PANS, ALS, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. While these conditions are often studied in isolation, Dr. Shemesh's team aims to identify shared pathways and pathogens that may drive brain pathology across all of them.

"We are thrilled to receive this support, which allows us to compare disease mechanisms across seemingly different conditions," said Dr. Or Shemesh. "By uncovering the 'common denominator' pathogens that trigger brain inflammation and degeneration, as well as identifying disease-specific pathogens that may define a unique cranio-biome for each neurological disorder, we are taking the first step toward developing innovative treatments that could halt disease progression."

The grant was provided by the Sim Einstein Research Foundation, Inc. and is part of the global Alzheimer's Pathobiome Initiative (AlzPI) consortium, co-founded and led by Nikki Schultek of the Pathobiome Research Center at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. Dr. Shemesh and his team have been members of AlzPI for many years to accelerate our understanding of infectious drivers of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases through global, multidisciplinary collaboration.

A team of researchers led by Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons has been awarded an up to two-year $8.7 million contract from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to create genetic tests to speed the diagnosis of patients born with defects in the lymphatic system.

"Discovering genes that cause lymphatic anomalies and using this information to create new clinical tests will not only accelerate the diagnosis of patients, but will also lead to improved treatments and, most importantly, save lives," says Carrie Shawber, PhD, associate professor of reproductive sciences at VP&S and principal investigator of the CLARUM (Comprehensive Lymphatic Anomaly Revealing and Understanding Genomics) project. 

CLARUM includes collaborators at Arkansas Children's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, the Broad Institute, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), City St. George's University of London, and NYU Langone Health. 

The funding is provided by the ARPA-H LIGHT (Lymphatic Imaging, Genomics, and pHenotyping Technologies) program, which aims to illuminate the unseen aspects of the lymphatic system through novel diagnostic approaches and significantly improve patient care and outcomes by gaining a deeper understanding of its critical role in health.

Most people have heard about their lymph nodes, which are often inflamed during infections, but are less familiar with the rest of their lymphatic system. 

Sometimes called the "forgotten circulation," the lymphatic system is a network of vessels, ducts, and nodes that moves fluid throughout the body, ensuring that tissues maintain normal fluid levels and that fats, hormones, and immune cells reach their destinations. The lymphatic system also prevents organ damage and promotes organ regeneration. 

Defects in the lymphatic system can disturb the flow of this liquid (called lymph) and cause a variety of serious health problems, from trouble breathing caused by swelling around the lungs to increased vulnerability to severe infections.

Approximately one in every 3,500 babies is born with a lymphatic defect and often requires intensive care soon after birth. Many people with lymphatic anomalies die from sepsis because they cannot mount an immune response to infections.

Severe lifelong consequences from the defects continue to accumulate as the patients age.

In many cases of lymphatic anomalies, the lymphatic system continues to grow abnormally, affecting every organ. "The growth damages the organs and eventually causes organ failure, particularly in the spleen, heart, and lungs," says Shawber. 

Lymphatic diseases are often confused with other conditions, and it can take years for some patients to receive the correct diagnosis.

Diagnosis can be sped up by looking for genetic mutations that are known to cause lymphatic diseases. But many genetic causes are yet to be identified, and most cases cannot be attributed to a known genetic cause. Genetic diagnosis is also limited to a few specialized centers in the U.S., primarily in large urban hospitals.

The goal of CLARUM is to develop new genetic tests that can identify more cases of congenital lymphatic disease and can be requested by doctors' offices across the country.

"A problem with genetic testing today is that patients in rural America don't have access to these tests, and so they're not diagnosed or treated appropriately," Shawber says. "Because of limited access to testing, it's thought that we may be missing almost 80% of patients."

Shawber expects that the CLARUM team will find 15 or more new genetic mutations that cause lymphatic disease and increase the predictive value of genetic testing.

Today, about 20-30% of patients with lymphatic anomalies caused by specific mutations may be helped by treatments that target those mutations. 

"Since the first genes that cause lymphatic disease were identified about a decade ago, three therapies have been identified and those patients are responding very well to the treatments and seeing significant improvements in their quality of life," says Shawber. "Genetics research has changed the landscape of treatment for lymphatic anomalies, but it hasn't gone far enough yet to help the majority of patients. So there is a desperate need to identify more genes."

Congenital lymphatic anomalies are rare, and no single medical center sees enough cases to permit robust gene discovery. CLARUM brings together six academic medical centers that will combine forces to look for genes in 2,000 patients.

Columbia and CHOP will develop, in parallel, two comprehensive genetic panels to screen specimens generated by standard clinical care. 

The other parts of project will focus on increasing the diagnostic yield of these genetic panels by identifying novel mutations in known and unknown genes. 

Arkansas Children's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Columbia, and City St. George's University of London will contribute unique cases, and Broad will apply its advanced genetic bioinformatic pipeline to identify novel genes.

Another challenge is that most mutations identified to date are variants of uncertain significance (VUS), lacking sufficient evidence that they cause disease. NYU Langone, City St. George's, and Columbia will develop cell- and zebrafish-based models to rapidly screen VUS's to determine if they are disease-causing. 

The Columbia team will also work with collaborators at Broad on developing a robust and reproducible method to detect mosaic mutations before birth, which may prevent fetuses with cystic lymphatic malformations from being treated prior to receiving a genetic diagnosis with potentially ineffective therapies that carry the risk of side effects. 

CLARUM aims to develop two different genetic tests that will be ready for clinical use within two years. The tests will use common specimens (tissues and lymph-containing fluids) generated from standard care to detect lymphatic anomalies and simultaneously screen for both germline and mosaic mutations in 73 genes associated with primary lymphatic anomalies. The team aims to shorten the time for genetic diagnosis of lymphatic anomalies from years to weeks, which may speed access to FDA-approved therapies that target mutated genes linked to lymphatic anomalies. 

The CHOP and Columbia teams will work closely with their technology ventures programs to commercialize the genetic panels for nationwide clinical use. 

"It's taken decades for us to find and evaluate the mutations that enabled current genetic tests," says Shawber. "With the help of ARPA-H's LIGHT Program, we can make a substantial leap forward."

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can cause certain types of cancer or autoimmune diseases, but how the body controls this common viral infection is largely unknown. Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn (UKB) and the University of Bonn have now identified genetic and non-genetic factors that help the body fight EBV. To do this, they evaluated genome sequencing data, which is actually intended for characterizing the human genome, in a new way. Using the new technique, they were able to estimate the amount of EBV in the blood and find correlations in large health data sets – for example, an increased viral load in people with HIV infections, but also in smokers. There were also indications of new genes that play key roles in EBV immunity. Their findings have now been published in the renowned journal Nature.

Approximately 90 to 95 percent of the global adult population is infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV infection is a risk factor for various types of cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). After infection, which commonly occurs in childhood, EBV remains hidden in certain white blood cells, the B memory cells, for life. The virus is usually inactive in these cells and, in this so-called latency phase, evades removal by the immune system. The virus is reactivated spontaneously, but also as a result of stress, and then switches to an active state. "Despite its high relevance, very little is known about how exactly the immune system controls lifelong EBV infection and how this contributes to the development of diseases such as cancer or autoimmune diseases. This is largely due to a lack of suitable data-for example, large population-based studies such as biobanks lack direct measurements of EBV viral load." says corresponding author Prof. Kerstin Ludwig from the Institute of Human Genetics at the UKB, who is also a member of the ImmunoSenstation3 and the Transdisciplinary Research Areas (TRA) "Life and Health" & "Modeling" at the University of Bonn.

"To overcome these limitations, we established that the amount of EBV in human blood can be estimated using genome sequencing data. Genome sequencing data is actually collected to characterize the human genome – so we have 'repurposed' it a little," says lead author Dr. Axel Schmidt from the Institute of Human Genetics at the UKB. The research team examined genome sequences (GS) from the blood of 486,315 participants in the UK Biobank and 336,123 participants in the All of Us project and found short DNA segments that could be attributed to the EBV genome, so called EBV reads, in 16.2 percent and 21.8 percent of the individuals, respectively. "People in whom such EBV reads are detected have, on average, an increased EBV viral load. We were able to demonstrate this with laboratory tests. Since large biobanks, such as the UK Biobank, have collected genome sequencing data for all participants, we now have a measure with which the EBV viral load can be estimated on a large scale," says Schmidt. "This opens up completely new possibilities for investigating the many questions that still remain on the subject of EBV immunity."

First, the authors investigated which non-genetic factors influence EBV viral load. They were able to show that the number of EBV reads was increased in immunocompromised individuals and also in smokers. Smoking is a risk factor for several EBV-associated diseases, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. "Our data indicate that current smoking in particular increases EBV viral load. Other groups have already shown that current smoking has an influence on the innate immune system. This could therefore be an indication that this interaction also plays a role in EBV control," says Schmidt. Another interesting observation was a correlation between the viral load and the season in which the sample was taken – on average, more EBV sequences were found in winter and fewer in summer.

At the genetic level, the Bonn researchers found a strong association between EBV viral load and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus. This section of our genome contains blueprints for special proteins that help the immune system recognize germs such as viruses or bacteria, making this DNA region a key player in the immune system. In addition to the MHC locus, associations were found in 27 regions of DNA outside the MHC that were largely consistent across both biobanks. Among the genes located in these regions are some with known functions in the immune system that could play a plausible role in controlling EBV viral load, but also a large number of new candidates. Analyses of genetic overlap with EBV-associated diseases also led to new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms involved in MS and identified new diseases for which EBV could be pathophysiologically relevant, such as type 1 diabetes.

Prof. Ludwig sums up: "Our results serve as a basis for understanding EBV immunity, and they also open up avenues for new mechanistic studies and therapeutic approaches for EBV-associated diseases. In a broader sense, our study illustrates how by-products of human genome sequencing data can be used to investigate persistent viral infections."

Institutions involved: In addition to the UKB and the University of Bonn, the University of Tokyo in Japan was also involved in the study.

A pioneering personalized mRNA vaccine study reveals lasting immune responses in triple-negative breast cancer, offering early signals that tailored cancer vaccination may help improve long-term outcomes pending larger trials.

In a recent study published in the journal Nature, researchers evaluated the feasibility, safety, immunogenicity, and long-term clinical outcomes of an individualized neoantigen messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine in patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

TNBC accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases and is associated with a high risk of early recurrence. TNBC lacks expression of estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which limits eligibility for targeted hormonal or HER2-directed therapies. Recurrence risk peaks within the first three years after diagnosis, particularly among high-risk patients.

Advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled the identification of tumor-specific somatic mutations known as neoantigens, which can serve as personalized vaccine targets. mRNA vaccine platforms offer a rapid and adaptable strategy to stimulate immune responses against tumor-specific mutations. However, long-term immune durability and demonstrated clinical benefit remain uncertain, necessitating further investigation into whether personalized vaccination can prevent relapse in high-risk TNBC populations.

This first-in-human exploratory clinical trial enrolled patients with early-stage TNBC within one year of completing standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. All participants had undergone surgery with curative intent. Tumor-specific somatic mutations were identified through next-generation sequencing of resected tumor tissue and selected as individualized vaccine targets.

Personalized vaccines were manufactured by encoding up to 20 patient-specific cancer mutations into two RNA-lipoplex (RNA-LPX) mRNA molecules formulated in liposomal nanoparticles for intravenous administration. This design aimed to enhance antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II pathways to stimulate both cytotoxic and helper T cell responses.

Participants received eight intravenous doses over nine weeks, consisting of six weekly and two biweekly administrations. Three initial patients underwent dose escalation before receiving the target dose of 50 micrograms. Peripheral blood samples were collected at baseline and after vaccination to evaluate immune responses.

Immune responses were assessed using interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays. Additional immunologic analyses included human leukocyte antigen multimer staining, intracellular cytokine profiling, bulk and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing, and transcriptomic phenotyping. Long-term follow-up was conducted to monitor relapse-free survival and to investigate potential immune-escape mechanisms in patients who experienced recurrence.

All 14 evaluable patients generated vaccine-induced or amplified T cell responses against at least one personalized neoantigen. Most individuals mounted responses against multiple mutations, and nine patients developed T cell responses targeting five or more neoantigens, indicating broad immune activation.

High-magnitude immune responses were detected in 86% of patients via ex vivo interferon gamma ELISpot assays, with several individuals demonstrating 2,000 to 4,000 interferon gamma-producing cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Among the evaluated neoantigens, 82.9% elicited measurable immune responses that were not detectable before vaccination. Immunogenic targets arose from insertions, deletions, and single-nucleotide variants.

In patients with sufficient samples for in vitro stimulation assays, 51.8% of tested mutations elicited T cell responses. Among these, 64% were mediated exclusively by cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) positive T cells, 20% by cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and 16% by both CD4 and CD8 T cells. This distribution reflects engagement of helper and cytotoxic T cell compartments, although the trial was not designed to establish a direct causal link between immune responses and clinical outcomes.

Multimer staining confirmed rapid expansion of mutation-specific CD8 positive T cells during vaccination. In certain patients, neoantigen-specific cells constituted up to 17.5% of circulating CD8 positive T cells and persisted for years. In one case, 10.3% of circulating CD8 positive T cells recognized a single mutation at treatment completion, with more than 3% remaining detectable two years later without booster vaccination.

Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that many vaccine-induced T cells differentiated into late-stage cytotoxic effector memory CD45RA-expressing cells capable of rapid tumor cell killing. Concurrently, a subset developed into stem cell-like memory T cells expressing T cell factor 1 and interleukin 7 receptor alpha, markers associated with long-term immune regeneration and potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade.

These findings suggest durable immunologic memory capable of sustained tumor surveillance based on mechanistic observations, though not definitively linked to clinical relapse prevention.

After a median follow-up of 62 months (range, 15 to 80 months), 10 of 14 patients remained relapse-free. One additional patient remained relapse-free until death from unrelated causes. Three patients experienced recurrence.

Among these cases, one patient exhibited the weakest vaccine-induced immune response but subsequently achieved a complete response lasting 15 months following anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy combined with sequential chemotherapy. Another recurrence arose from a genetically distinct primary tumor not represented in the vaccine design. The third case demonstrated tumor immune escape associated with downregulation and loss of MHC class I expression, impairing antigen presentation but not fully neutralizing circulating T cell responses.

This study demonstrates that personalized mRNA neoantigen vaccines are feasible, safe, and highly immunogenic in patients with early-stage TNBC. Vaccination induced long-lasting and functional T cell responses that persisted for years without booster doses. The generation of cytotoxic effector and stem-like memory T cells supports the biological plausibility of sustained immune surveillance.

Although most participants remained relapse-free during extended follow-up, the small sample size and absence of a randomized control group limit definitive conclusions regarding clinical efficacy. Observed immune escape mechanisms highlight the complexity of tumor-immune interactions and underscore the need for combination strategies or refined antigen selection.

Overall, these findings position individualized mRNA neoantigen vaccination as a promising adjuvant strategy in high-risk TNBC. Larger, controlled clinical trials are required to determine its impact on long-term relapse-free survival and overall survival in broader breast cancer populations.

A large, multi-center study recently published online in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (JNCCN) provides new insight into the long-term health effects of contemporary chemotherapy regimens used to treat testicular cancer, highlighting differences in renal function, cardiovascular risk, and the overall burden of chronic health conditions among survivors. It's expected these study findings will be used to inform national follow-up guidelines for cisplatin-treated testicular cancer survivors in the future.

Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men aged 18-39, and modern cisplatin-based chemotherapy cures more than 95% of patients. However, as survival has improved, attention has increasingly shifted to the long-term health consequences faced by testicular cancer survivors who may live for many decades after completing treatment.

In the largest real-world study to date comparing contemporary National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended chemotherapy regimens, researchers evaluated nearly 800 long-term testicular cancer survivors treated at eight major cancer centers in North America. The study assessed a broad range of adverse health outcomes and quantified survivors' cumulative burden of morbidity more than a decade after treatment.

"Our findings show that while today's standard chemotherapy regimens are highly effective at curing testicular cancer, they're associated with meaningful long-term health risks that appear to differ by treatment approach," said Sarah L. Kerns, PhD, MPH, corresponding author and associate professor of radiation oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. "Understanding these differences allows clinicians and patients to make more informed decisions and emphasizes the importance of long-term survivorship care."

The study (https://doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2025.7120) found that testicular cancer survivors treated with four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EPx4) had significantly higher odds of renal impairment, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy compared with those treated with three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEPx3). Nearly 41% of all survivors in the study showed some degree of at least mild renal dysfunction, which was strongly associated with cumulative cisplatin dose.

Importantly, reduced renal function was linked to higher risks of developing hypertension, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease later in life - conditions that can significantly impact long-term quality of life and survival.

"This study demonstrates for the first time that even mild reductions in renal function after chemotherapy can signal elevated later cardiovascular risk in testicular cancer survivors," said Lois B. Travis, MD, ScD, senior author and the Lawrence H. Einhorn Professor of Cancer Research at the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center. "These findings underscore the need for lifelong monitoring of both renal and cardiovascular health in this young survivor population."

Researchers also found that the overall cumulative burden of morbidity - a measure that captures both the number and severity of chronic health conditions - was similar between EPx4 and BEPx3, but significantly worse among survivors who received more intensive regimens. Worse morbidity scores were closely linked to poorer self-reported physical health, reinforcing the clinical relevance of these long-term effects.

Because the health conditions identified in the study are often detectable through routine clinical evaluations, the authors emphasize that many of the risks can be identified early and potentially mitigated through targeted surveillance, lifestyle interventions, and preventive care.

The study was conducted as part of the multi-center Platinum Study and was supported by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.

Can fragments of tumor DNA in the blood predict whether chemotherapy will be effective? Researchers at the Princess Máxima Center investigated this question together with experts from Italy and Slovakia. They focused specifically on young adults with germ cell tumors for whom standard chemotherapy doesn't work well. 

Blood samples from young adults treated at hospitals in Italy and Slovakia were analyzed before and during chemotherapy. The researchers searched these samples for fragments of tumor DNA circulating in the blood. They identified specific changes in the genetic material that came from cancer cells resistant to standard chemotherapy. The team then looked at whether these characteristics were linked with how long the cancer stayed away after treatment in young adults with germ cell tumors. 

The findings are promising: a blood test could potentially help doctors make more personalized decisions about whether initiating this intensive therapy is worthwhile, particularly in what may be the patient's final phase of life. 

Further research is required before this approach can be implemented in clinical practice. The next step is to confirm these findings in a larger group of people, including blood samples from children with germ cell tumors. 

This research was made possible by Stichting Kinderen Kankervrij (KiKa) and the Italian Ministry of Health. 

Germ cells are responsible for the development of sperm in men and eggs in women. The precursor cells of these germ cells can develop into cancer. This happens mainly in boys and young men, both in the testis and in other places in the body. 

In the Netherlands, approximately 30 children are diagnosed with a germ cell tumor each year, as well as around 850 young men with testicular germ cell tumors. Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men aged 15 to 35. In one in ten of these young adults, standard chemotherapy doesn't work well enough. Despite treatment with high-dose chemotherapy, half of this group ultimately dies. 

For this reason, researchers from the Looijenga group at the Máxima Center worked with scientists from the Italian IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori "Dino Amadori" to study biomarkers that could predict clinical response and treatment outcome. In the future, this could help improve the quality of life in the patient's final phase of life. 

The study was published today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. 

Blood samples from 69 patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and 26 patients receiving standard chemotherapy were analyzed using shallow whole genome sequencing. In circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA), the researchers assessed tumor fraction (TF) and copy number alterations (CNAs). These results were compared with an existing biomarker, miR‑371a‑3p. The team then evaluated associations with progression-free survival and overall survival. 

Analysis of cfDNA provides valuable prognostic information in germ cell tumors that do not respond adequately to, or recur after, standard chemotherapy. These minimally invasive biomarkers may refine risk stratification and support decision-making about whether to initiate a final, highly intensive course of chemotherapy in relapsed germ cell tumors. The insights gained could also help identify new targets for the development of less toxic treatments. 

The researchers now plan to validate these results in a larger cohort of adolescents and children with germ cell tumors, within an international collaboration. If the follow-up study confirms the findings, clinicians may be able to use them in practice to determine the most appropriate treatment for patients with germ cell tumors. Researchers will also be able to more effectively explore alternative treatments that are both more effective and associated with fewer side effects.

Club World Cup champions Chelsea could see the second edition of the revamped FIFA tournament staged in their own backyard.

The Club World Cup was the second honour of the BlueCo era but was wildly more lucrative than the first, the Europa Conference League. In total, Chelsea banked around £85m in prize money.

FIFA expanded the tournament to 32 teams for the first quadrennial version in the United States last summer, and reports suggest that they are considering going even bigger in 2029.

World football's governing body is aiming to invite 16 extra teams to the next Club World Cup, as well as loosening the rules on the number of clubs allowed from single nations, potentially allowing more than two Premier League teams to participate.

Is this sustainable? What's Clearlake's masterplan to claw back these losses?

For Chelsea, whose success in the United States after thumping Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final has significantly helped amid anxieties around UEFA's financial rules, that would increase the odds of being at the competition again in 2029. 

Exactly how money-spinning that event will be for participating clubs depends on a number of factors.

For one, the £750m prize money pot for the competition in the summer was largely funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund via an investment in tournament broadcaster DAZN. That led some to accuse FIFA of artificially inflating the value of the deal in exchange for influence from Saudi Arabia, who will host the international World Cup in 2034 and have been mooted as a potential host for 2029 too.

“The 2025 edition was seen as a hustle,” says University of Liverpool football finance lecturer Kieran Maguire, speaking exclusively to the Chelsea Chronicle.

“FIFA are desperate for normalisation and legitimacy on the back of that.”

Could that normalisation and legitimacy from staging the tournament in an established footballing nation, like England? Spain and Morocco are the favourites to stage the Club World Cup in 2029 but, according to The Guardian, FIFA are also mulling the possibility of hosting the tournament in England.

“If it takes place in England, will it sell out with 48 teams? I suspect not,” says Maguire, “but the matches involving Chelsea and three or four teams, as well as those involving Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and so on certainly would. 

“But the issue is when you get Oceania's best team against the second or third best team in Africa, there might be a novelty value, but it won't be much more than that. 

“Would traditional fans turn their noses up? Yes, but I think we underestimate the appeal of England to tourist fans. It then comes down to pricing. As we have seen with FIFA's dynamic pricing, that can work for the organisation, if not for the fans.”

World Cup

Scott McTominay's bicycle kick goal in Scotland's victory over Denmark — a win that saw the nation qualify for their first World Cup in 28 years — has been commemorated with a mural outside Hampden Park.

The 29-year-old scored the first goal of the 4-2 win on November 18, a brilliant overhead effort following a Ben Doak cross after just three minutes.

The victory also featured two more memorable goals with Kieran Tierney's 93rd-minute strike from the edge of the area and Kenny McLean's 98th-minute effort from his own half.

Commissioned by Adidas the mural paying tribute to “one of the greatest ever Scotland goals” was unveiled outside the national team's stadium in Glasgow on Friday.

McTominay's career has continued to soar since he left Manchester United and joined Napoli in the summer of 2024. The midfielder scored 13 goals and provided six assists to help Napoli win the Scudetto last season. He was also named the Serie A Player of the Year for 2025 and finished 18th in the rankings for the 2025 Ballon d'Or award.

The Scot has scored ten goals and provided four assists this campaign in 34 appearances.

Scotland are next in action when they host Japan (March 28) and the Ivory Coast (March 31) in international friendlies. The game against Japan is being played at Hampden Park, while the Ivory Coast fixture is at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium.

After qualifying for the 2026 Men's World Cup in Canada, Mexico, and the USA, their first appearance in the tournament since 1998, they were drawn into Group C alongside Brazil, Haiti, and Morocco. They begin against Haiti at the Boston Stadium on June 14.

President Donald Trump holds a press conference after the Supreme Court decided he does not have legal authority to impose tariffs.

by Grace Bellinghausen

MIAMI, Fla. (CBS12) — Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is set to take the podium at 1 p.m. Friday at Camillus House in Miami, joined by a heavy-hitting lineup of legal officials, victim advocates, and sports organizers.

The event features a prominent coalition of legal and community leaders, including Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez-Rundle, Statewide Prosecutor Brad McVay, and representatives from the FIFA World Cup Miami Host Committee.

The inclusion of Kristi's House CEO, Amanda Altman, and survivor mentor, Gloria Martinez, could highlight a collaborative effort between law enforcement and local advocacy groups to provide a safe environment for the upcoming event.

While the logistics are unclear, it's evident that safety protocols and the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup are the highlights of the conference.

NEW YORK -- The New York and New Jersey World Cup host committee has canceled its fan festival that had been planned to be held at Liberty State Park in Jersey City.

The committee scrapped plans for the weekslong festival that would have been held about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, where the final will be played on July 19.

The FanFest was announced in February 2025 by Tammy Murphy, wife of then-New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and chair of the New York/New Jersey host committee's directors, who said it would be open for all 104 matches of the tournament, which starts June 11.

The committee said in a statement Friday an "expanded network of fan zones and community celebrations across 21 counties in New Jersey will serve as a cornerstone of the region's official fan engagement program."

Mikie Sherrill, Murphy's successor as governor, announced a $5 million initiative Thursday to fund community World Cup initiatives.

Tickets for the FanFest had been put on sale in December.

Plans for a FanFest in New York City's Corona Park in Queens did not move forward. One is now planed for the U.S. Tennis Association's Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens from June 17-28 and a fan village is scheduled for Manhattan's Rockefeller Center from July 4-19.

Fan fests with large video screens have been a part of each World Cup's organization since 2006.

FIFA is running the World Cup itself unlike in the past, when a local organizing committee was in charge of logistics. The host committees are limited to sponsorship agreements in categories not reserved by FIFA.

Legendary Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has rubbished suggestions that Pep Guardiola's eventual departure could lead to the club suffering a similar decline to the one Manchester United experienced when Sir Alex Ferguson retired. According to reports, there is an expectation that Guardiola could step down from his role at the end of this season after 10 years as City coach.

Aguero won five Premier League titles in his decade at City, with three of those coming under Guardiola before the striker left for Barcelona in 2021 and soon after was forced to retire from the game due to a heart condition. Guardiola has led City to six league titles in his nine years as well as landing them their first ever Champions League crown in 2023 when they completed a treble. 

The Athletic has reported that there is a growing expectation that this could be Guardiola's final season in charge of City, which has led them to consider potential successors such as Enzo Maresca. Guardiola, however, has refused to comment on the speculation, insisting he does not know what the future holds for him.

Speaking via Stake, Aguero said: "Pep has repeatedly stated in recent months that he has one more year on his contract, so there's no point in speculating now about whether or not he'll leave at the end of the season."

Aguero scored the most important goal in City's history against Queens Park Rangers in 2012 which delivered City's first league title in 44 years. Roberto Mancini was manager then and Aguero collected his second Premier League crown two years later in Manuel Pellegrini's first season in charge, also lifting the League Cup. And the Argentine does not fear for City's future when the serial-winning boss eventually decides to walk away.

"It's always the case that when such a successful manager leaves, there's some kind of reshuffling," added Aguero, who is City's all-time top scorer with 260 goals in 390 games in all competitions. "But I have a feeling that City will know how to replace him very well when the time comes. A club, an institution like City, a club that has established itself among the elite, is much more than just a great manager. And whoever arrives will have a solid foundation to continue growing."

If this is to be Guardiola's final season with City, he will be determined to go out on a high by winning a seventh Premier League title. And City are edging closer to that goal after cutting the gap on leaders Arsenal to five points with a game in hand. Arsenal have dropped points in their last two games against Brentford and Wolves while City have won their last two league matches, against Liverpool and Fulham. 

Guardiola, however, has insisted he is not discussing the status of the title race with his players as there are still 12 matches left and so much can change from now until the end of the season. He said on Friday: "Newcastle is all I am concerned with. I'm not concerned with the League Cup final with Arsenal until it comes. Now it's Newcastle, rest and after Leeds. I don't know what is going to happen these next 12 games. I didn't speak one second about that with my players.

"Yesterday and the day before it was Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle. I didn't talk about the position or the table. I could not care less. It's 12 games. Ask me this question with two or three games and I will answer but 12 games left is an eternity. That is the only truth I have.

"They were nine points [in front] because we had a game in hand. When everybody has the same fixtures, and after we have the differences. Many things are going to happen until the end of the season. 70 per cent of the players are new so they don't have that experience of these kind of situations. Experience is win tomorrow."

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Kirsty Coventry says the organisation will investigate if IOC member Gianni Infantino breached the terms of its charter when attending the inaugural meeting of The Board of Peace, which was established by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Infantino, the president of football's world governing body FIFA, appeared at the meeting in Washington D.C. on Thursday, flanked by politicans and sporting a red hat with ‘USA' on the front and the numbers ‘45-47' — a reference to Trump's non-consecutive presidencies.

Infantino also used the occasion to announce that FIFA had signed what he described as “a landmark partnership ⁠agreement” with The Board of Peace, which was meeting primarily to discuss plans to rebuild Gaza.

“I wasn't aware of that, that we had an IOC member front and centre,” Coventry told a press conference during Winter Olympic Games in Milan-Cortina, when asked about the hat and Infantino's presence.

“Now that you guys (journalists) made us aware of it we will go back and have a look at it. The IOC Charter is very clear what it expects of its members. We will go and research into the alleged signing of documents.”

The IOC's charter states that members must act independently of political and commercial interests, and cannot accept “from governments, organisations, or other parties, any mandate or instructions liable to interfere with the freedom of their action and vote”.

“I think from the IOC's point of view we will continue to be politically neutral,” Coventry added. “That's the only way for us as an organisation to ensure that we allow for there to be fairness on the field of play. That's what we will continue to do as we walk into the future.”

Infantino has allied himself closely with Trump since the latter's return to office in January 2025, and in December awarded him the inaugral ‘FIFA Peace Prize' at the World Cup draw in Washington, D.C.

In November, Infantino was accused of a “clear violation” of FIFA's own statutes on neutrality by Miguel Maduro — a former chairman of FIFA's Governance Committee — after appearing to endorse Trump's political agenda. The Swiss had said during a speech in Miami that “we should all support what he (Trump) is doing”.

The following month, FairSquare — a a non-profit organisation and advocacy group — made an official complaint to FIFA's Ethics Committee, alleging “repeated breaches” of FIFA's duty of political neutrality by Infantino.

All four of the alleged breaches outlined by FairSquare related to Infantino's relationship with Trump, including the decision to award him FIFA's Peace Prize.

FIFA wants to build 50 mini-pitches near schools and residential areas in Gaza, five full-size pitches across multiple districts, a state-of-the-art FIFA academy ⁠and a new 20,000-seat national stadium in the territory, the governing body said.

Roughly four months and 120 miles away from the Los Angeles-area stadium, where he will likely make his World Cup debut, Matt Freese was staying in the moment. In that particular moment, it was probably just as easy said as it was done – there were fire pits and palm trees in his line of sight, he and his New York City FC teammates trading one of the East coast's most brutal winters in recent memory for comfortable days in Palm Springs with a week and change left to go until their MLS season opener at the LA Galaxy.

It is a perfect place to settle back into the rhythms of professional soccer, but far from the only pocket of North America where the cadence is shifting. A new MLS season finally begins on Saturday, one that will keep a wide range of people busy, each of them saddled with a variety of tasks, all of it in the shadow of this summer's World Cup. The world's biggest sporting event returns to the continent for the first time since 1994, the circumstances and spotlight as different as it gets from the last time around. MLS' decision makers will have their hands full with capitalizing on an event that rarely comes to their shores, all while hoping the arrival of global superstars like Lionel Messi and Son Heung-min creates meaningful momentum along the way. They will balance those tasks with implementing the finishing touches on their switch to a fall-to-spring calendar that will be complete next year, a move that brings them in alignment with many of the sport's top leagues.

For a selection of players, though, the timing is more pressing. The start of the MLS season marks a final chance to impress national team coaches before roster selections are due in late spring, a feeling that is especially pertinent for American players. Since taking charge in October 2024, U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has picked frequently from MLS' talent pool and is slated to bring a healthy number of players from the domestic league to a World Cup on home soil. The odds of earning a role that only comes around every four years naturally vary from player to player, but they share both a common goal and the unique balancing act of club and country responsibilities in a World Cup year. In some sense, the two tasks go hand in hand.

"[I'm] incredibly grateful for that opportunity," Freese said about his reps with the USMNT before pivoting, "and really, really just focused on staying as present as possible and doing as well as I can and improving every day so that I can pay them back for that trust they've shown in me."

Freese was a regular fixture with NYCFC before he received his first call-up to the national team last January and did not earn his first cap until June, his rise up the USMNT's goalkeeper depth chart hard to predict. It happened all at once, though – successive starts en route to the Concacaf Gold Cup final and some penalty heroics along the way mean the job has been his ever since, a quick turn of events. If it has felt like a whirlwind, the 27-year-old does not show any signs of it.

"I think a lot more opportunity presented itself and a lot more minutes but it wasn't necessarily unexpected because I had been training for that and working for that moment, so that when it came, because I had faith that it would come, just to be ready for it," Freese said. "It happened quickly, but it was what I had been working for and what I had been preparing for and so no, I didn't do too much reflecting on that or anything like that in the offseason."

Heading into his eighth MLS season and his fourth as a regular starter, the new campaign will be his first with a World Cup on the horizon, which comes with a new workload – but not with new priorities in the offseason. He did not have a specialized training regimen during the winter and instead stuck to familiar patterns, including a chance to unwind after the 2025 campaign came to a close. 

"I think it would be a mistake to change the way I prepare for a season just because of the potential of such a big moment in the middle of it," he said. "The first 10 days of every offseason for me and many of the guys is really just absolutely no soccer conversations, nothing – no soccer-watching, soccer playing, no working out, nothing. Either you go on vacation or you just hang out. I had been on the road – I think I was in a hotel like 170 days last year, so I didn't really want to travel. I just chilled at home in my apartment, I saw friends. I just tried to keep it as low-key as possible because I wanted the reset to be refreshing rather than tiring."

The way his season ended, with a 5-1 defeat at Inter Miami a week before the Florida side won their first MLS Cup, keeps him just as motivated to perform for NYCFC as a chance of impressing during his first World Cup does.

"I want to win a trophy," he admitted. "I look at our new sporting director, Todd [Dunivant, a four-time MLS Cup-winning player], and he has so many trophies in his cabinet and when I heard about him and quickly read up on him when he was named the sporting director, my first thought was, 'Oh my god, he has so many trophies and accomplishments,' and that example kind of shows how trophies live forever and that really just your name or your team's name in history so that is, on the club side, a massive, massive goal from me this year."

Freese's ambitions are lofty, which only reinforces his need to stay focused on what's directly in front of him.

"I'm a pretty old-fashioned, stay in the moment-esque guy," he said. "I don't use my phone a lot. I really try to just avoid the distractions that come with being a professional athlete in the 21st century and two more things. I meditate a lot. I don't sleep in the room with my phone in it. I like to be really just ingrained in what is currently and presently happening, and what currently is presently happening is I'm in preseason with my team and trying to just focus on my team and spend time with them and gel off the field and on the field and FaceTime my loved ones back home when I can."

Getting too far ahead of himself is not his style, joking that he will reflect on his career when he's 40 and retired. It is not the only thing he's saving for a conversation a decade and change from now.

"It's a long story," he said apologetically in reference to a remark about penalty kicks "being his thing" during last summer's Gold Cup. "I don't really want to get into it. Sorry … That's another thing, when I'm 40, I'll talk about it."

While Freese is likely to be a headliner on a list of MLS players who will be World Cup-bound in the summertime, the league's 30 clubs are full of players who will take a very different approach to the upcoming tournament. There's Cade Cowell, a one-time U.S. youth international who is the New York Red Bulls' marquee signing ahead of a rebuilding season. Reminders of the senior national team are all around him, even if he has not been in camp for roughly two years – the World Cup is top of mind for most, while the Red Bulls' new head coach Michael Bradley comes with a decorated USMNT pedigree of his own.

"I think every American player, it's still a goal to be on the World Cup [roster] and last year, I didn't get a chance to go to any camps," he said. "I know the window's tight, but it's in God's hands and whatever happens, I'm going to work my hardest to get there … When you're in the camps it's a very, very good culture. Everyone is very nice. It's very, very fun. I do miss it and it'll definitely be back."

Pochettino's project to cast a wide net with his player pool means players like Cowell still hope for a World Cup roster spot, even if there are only 26 to go around every four years, the dream at least providing "motivation to keep [going]," in the player's words. Pochettino's open-door policy comes with a hint of added incentive for someone like Cowell, a winger hopes to integrate seamlessly into Bradley's version of the Red Bull way that hopes to attack quickly and settle into a defensive shape just as fast.

"I would say help defensively a little bit more, I can always do that," he said. "Every attacker doesn't like to do it but it's something we have to do and finishing off plays, whether that's a shot or a cross and just making the right decision once you're in front of goal."

Then there's LAFC captain Hugo Lloris, for whom World Cup experiences are unforgettable – and in the rearview mirror. He captained France to their World Cup triumph in 2018, took part in their run to the final in 2022 and retired from the national team soon after, now in a fully different phase of his career ahead of his third MLS season.

"I'm more relaxed than I used to be," he noted. "I take football in a less intense way, I would say, and that's also one of the reasons I come to discover a new football, a new environment and in a way, I can also enjoy my time with my family so it's a good mix but I still want to compete and I still want to challenge myself but I would say in a different way. It's very different than [what] I used to face in Europe but my motivation is still the same."

He has chosen the route of focusing solely on the club game, no small tasks ahead of him. LAFC, now under the steward of former assistant and new head coach Marc dos Santos, are angling for silverware as they balance the demands of MLS, the Concacaf Champions Cup and the Leagues Cup in 2026.

"I think we used to be really good and we developed a strong reputation the way we used to play, especially in transition, using the speed and the pace from offensive players," Lloris said. "I think today we want to keep this strength but at the same time, we want to get more control of games so we try to be more in possession, try to occupy our opponents' field in a better way, so by bringing more discipline in terms of positions with and without the ball. Also, we want to keep something that we used to do well the last two years, the way we used to press the opponent, we want to keep the same philosophy but I think we just want to become more dominant and manage games in a way we really want and it doesn't matter who we are facing, who is the opponent, we just want to play in the same way."

Lloris' World Cup days are behind him but as he contemplates at age 39 if this will be his final season as a professional, he embodies the multi-pronged approach many in North America have taken with this summer's tournament in mind. The ex-France international is an ambassador for soccer in a country that's still learning to embrace it, choosing to carry out his duties by sharing his experiences with players and other club staff eager to integrate any lessons in their day-to-day.

"For me, it's very simple," he said about his objectives for the year ahead. "It's to keep enjoying football, the competition. There is no limit. I'm also here to share my experience in football so I have this responsibility to lead the youngest players in a roster. I'm here to help but the main thing is to keep enjoying my football. I know that I don't see further than next year and I don't want to see it so I just enjoy day by day."

He is, at times, an influential observer of soccer's grip on the U.S., boasting the expertise to know what a successful run for the USMNT could mean for the sport's future in the country. Lloris, though, feels that things are already trending in the right direction.

"I really see a development," he said. "I see my girls competing, playing soccer [at school] and I see parents, I will say, dedicated to the game and I think it's coming. It's growing in terms of popularity. It's growing in terms of demand and I think for the American national team, it's also a big challenge ahead of them because they [have a] responsibility, they are the face of soccer in the U.S. and they have to perform and show a great identity towards their fans but I'm quite comfortable about the future of soccer. I'm sure it will continue to grow in the U.S."

Who else will join Zoey Deutch and Emily Bader on Netflix‘s “The 99'ers,” the streamer's drama about the 1999 US Women's National Soccer team?  Deadline reports that Emilia Jones and Alessandro Nivola are the latest to join the cast.  Jones will play US team member Julie Foudy in the film, while Nivola is Tony DiCicco, the team's head coach from 1994-1999.

Nicole Kassell directs “The 99'ers,” based on Jeré Longman‘s 2000 book “The Girls Of Summer: The U.S. Women's Soccer Team And How It Changed The World.”  For those who don't remember, the 1999 US Women's National Soccer Team won the World Cup Final against all odds, claiming victory on a dramatic penalty kick against China.

Deutch will play soccer executive Marla Messing in the film, while Bader plays soccer star Mia Hamm.  Katie Lovejoy, Dana Stevens, and Peter Hedges co-write the film, with Jill Mazursky and Jamee Decio original writers on the project.

Producers on the “The 99'ers” include Liza Chazin via 3Dot Productions, Hayley Stool and Ross Greenburg, with Messing, Mazursky, and Krista Smith on board as executive producers.

Jones is fresh off Brad Ingelsby‘s HBO drama “Task,” as well as Edgar Wright‘s “The Running Man.”  Other upcoming projects for the actress include A24‘s Anthony Bourdain biopic “Tony” opposite Dominic Sessa.

As for Nivola, he's coming off a hot couple of years that include pivotal roles in “The Brutalist,” “The Room Next Door,” and “Downtown Abbey: The Grand Finale.”  He also starred in the Apple TV+ series “The Big Cigar,” and currently stars in the FX limited series “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette” as fashion designer Calvin Klein.

Expect “The 99'ers” to premiere on Netflix in 2027, but a late 2026 release isn't far-fetched.

US soccer fans are furious over a major World Cup fan fest in New Jersey being axed.

The event was set to take place in the shadows of MetLife Stadium, which will host the final on July 19.

But the massive World Cup fan fest that was planned for Liberty State Park in Jersey City was stunningly ditched on Thursday.

The event was scheduled to take place from June 11 through July 19.

But New Jersey scrapped the plans and instead revealed it will launch a $5 million community initiative to spread the soccer festivities around the state.

“From fan zones to neighborhood watch parties to street fairs, we are investing in the communities and small businesses that make New Jersey extraordinary,” Gov. Mikie Sherrill wrote in an X post.

The money will go towards major fan zones and community watch parties, and festivals.

Fans have shared their disappointment over the fan fest decision.

“As a JC resident, this is devastating news,” one wrote on X.

“that's terrible. this is a great location for a fanfest,” another said.

“PLEASE TELL ME THIS A JOKE,” a third added.

A spokesperson for Jersey City shared a statement following the cancellation reveal.

“The Governor made the right call. It became increasingly clear that there was no workable, cost-effective way to manage the influx of tens of thousands of fans into Liberty State Park, while maintaining access to the members of the Jersey City community,” wrote communications director Nathaniel Styer.

The fan fest cancellation decision came just four months before the start of the World Cup.

Tickets at the cost of $10 had been on sale to fans before the axing.

Those fans who had purchased tickets will receive refunds, per multiple reports.

Thursday's announcement didn't share why the Liberty State Park fan fest was eliminated.

Fan fests with big video screens have been a part of each World Cup's organization since 2006.

“That is going to be the one fan fest, I believe, across the country that is going to be up and running for all games of the World Cup as opposed to just the games that are happening in our region,” Tammy Murphy, wife of of then New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and chair of the New York/New Jersey host committee's directors, said previously at the time the fan fest was announced in a press conference.

At the start of 2026, FIFA completed its latest club competition, with Arsenal claiming the inaugural Women's Champions Cup.

FIFA made a major splash on the global club calendar last year by launching a revamped Club World Cup tournament. Chelsea emerged victorious, and FIFA rewarded those involved. The governing body allocated a total prize fund of $1 billion to generate early interest in the tournament but initially failed to attract significant commercial support. 

Broadcasters appeared disinterested until the world soccer federation was rescued by DAZN's $1 billion acquisition of global media rights to the tournament, supported by funding from Saudi Arabia.

In 2026, FIFA again turned to DAZN for media rights coverage of the Women's Champions Cup, with the OTT platform offering a global free-to-air feed to fans worldwide, supporting FIFA's goal of building excitement and viewership for its newest event. Unlike the men's Club World Cup, however, FIFA excluded DAZN's global coverage in the four home markets of participating teams. 

This led to agreements with Sky Sports in the UK, CazéTV in Brazil, and TelevisaUnivision in the United States. No domestic broadcaster was officially announced in Morocco. The rights process highlighted broader hesitation in the global market, with limited interest in FIFA's latest tournament addition, and partners announced only 13 days before the tournament began in England.

From a sponsorship perspective, the new tournament can again be linked to broader market challenges. The Champions Cup announced its first tournament-focused deal—naming Kynisca as its presenting partner—on 22 January 2026. The tournament's initial partnerships grew to only three deals by the start of the competition. Visa continued its commitment to women's soccer by joining the competition's portfolio. 

The financial services brand has built a long-term strategy around supporting women's soccer since 2018, when it became the first-ever sole sponsor of UEFA women's soccer, and again with FIFA in 2021. The third partner added to the Champions Cup was Aramco, a brand with a complicated relationship with women's soccer. 

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

In 2024, more than 100 women's soccer players wrote an open letter to FIFA urging it to end its partnership with the Saudi Arabia-based energy company. The estimated annual revenue from these deals to FIFA is $2.25 million.

The Champions Cup tournament staged its final four matches in London in 2026. Both semi-finals were played on the same day at Brentford Community Stadium, with the third-place playoff and the final held at Emirates Stadium. Attendance peaked at the final between Arsenal and Corinthians, with 25,031 spectators. 

While it is important for marquee matches to be played at the biggest and best stadiums available, the final drew only a 41.2% capacity crowd at the Emirates. This level of unused capacity is particularly notable given the recent success of the Arsenal Women's team in attracting the highest regular-season audiences in the Women's Super League. 

Attendance at the final was below Arsenal's average attendance in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season (34,110), with all matches played at the Emirates Stadium. The team drew a season-high of 56,700 for its match against Tottenham Hotspur, highlighting the potential to attract more fans to Arsenal matches in North London.

As with last year's men's FIFA Club World Cup, FIFA invested significant revenue in its prize funds to help drive interest and competitiveness among participating teams. The 2026 Champions Cup paid out $3.95 million across the six teams involved (including the two teams that did not reach the semi-finals of the competition in London). 

Of this total, $2.3 million was awarded to the inaugural champions, Arsenal. To illustrate the tournament's financial appeal, Arsenal earned just €500,000 ($590,000) for winning the 2024/25 UEFA Women's Champions League title.

Although the Champions Cup is a much smaller tournament in terms of matches, teams, and dates, its prize fund pales in comparison with FIFA's investment in its new men's tournament in 2025. The FIFA Club World Cup paid the champions, Chelsea, £85 million ($115.5 million). Meanwhile, all 32 competing clubs were guaranteed £28 million ($38 million) from the participation fee alone.

FIFA plans to launch a women's version of the Club World Cup in 2028, which is expected to feature 16 teams from around the world. To match the men's investment, FIFA would need to invest $500 million in the 2028 tournament. However, history suggests this is unlikely, as a gap remains on the path toward true equality in global soccer.

Although the new Women's Club World Cup is still two years away, FIFA has faced criticism over the proposed addition to the calendar. The criticism has focused on the suggested January 2028 dates. Clubs have raised concerns about the potential impact on domestic scheduling, with the proposed window expected to affect up to five rounds of matches in the Women's Super League. 

Despite all the initial lack of interest in its new tournaments, it appears FIFA is sticking by its greater investment in club soccer. Despite initial reservations with these tournaments, commercial streams will likely grow for FIFA as the tournaments build their status and popularity within the global soccer community. 

For FIFA, its greater involvement is about long-term success in boosting revenue streams outside the FIFA World Cup every four years.

Lionel Messi receiving MLS' MVP award Megan Briggs / Getty Images

A new Major League Soccer season is nearly here, and I'm already dialed in.

MLS involves some of the best players in the world, from Lionel Messi to Son Heung-min, and this season will be monumental in preparing some of them for the biggest competition of their lives, the 2026 FIFA World Cup co-hosted on U.S. soil.

The emotions, excitement and intrigue around soccer will be at an all-time high thanks to the summer tournament. You can already feel that steady build-up.

This MLS season will be the last to feature a February-to-December format, with the league aligning with a European calendar in 2027. As players focus on starting their MLS seasons strong, most will keep one eye on the World Cup. Hopefully, the league and its players will continue to ride that momentum into MLS Cup at the end of the year.

I have a lot of confidence in what we're going to see this season. Expect high-quality play and some intriguing and important MLS storylines to watch out for as we inch closer to opening day this weekend.

All the shine will be on Inter Miami. The 2025 MLS Cup champions are opening a brand-new stadium. They made key additions to their roster in the offseason. The club is clearly trying to maximize what it can do when Lionel Messi is still on the pitch, which is the absolute right thing to do.

After winning the MLS Cup, and with Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba retiring, the club used the offseason to bring in players who make the team even more prolific. They signed Dayne St. Clair, the reigning MLS goalkeeper of the year, and Micael, a standout center back. It also brought in Germán Berterame, a $15 million forward who will enhance Miami's already dangerous attack. There's also Sergio Reguilón, who could play a massive role on the back line if healthy.

In his second year on the touchline, Javier Mascherano managed squad rotation superbly across multiple competitions, a crucial improvement from the previous year's postseason stumble.

Mascherano's boldest decisions came at the most decisive stage, trusting budding Argentine Matteo Silvetti over Luis Suárez, a move that worked to perfection. But success has only raised expectations.

This is a club you need to watch, because as good as it was last year, it strengthened some of its weaknesses, and Messi is still Messi. The Argentine captain will also be motivated to be at his best heading into what is expected to be his last World Cup.

Can Inter Miami keep up that same pace, continue to be the shining light in MLS, and perhaps land a historic treble of Supporters' Shield, MLS Cup and the Concacaf Champions Cup?

Those factors are going to be a constant narrative throughout the year.

A lot has been made of Son Heung-min coming into the league and taking it by storm – and then there's the partnership he has since formed with LAFC teammate Denis Bouanga. They have a great understanding of one another, and that is so key in this league – they score free kicks, run at you one-v-one, and can create in the attacking third. So, what more can they do?

LAFC has become known as such a transition team – where it's very good at the counterattack, but in terms of keeping possession and pinning teams back, it struggles. Teams have realized the way to beat LAFC is by denying them space and then countering.

LAFC must figure out how to adapt from what former head coach Steve Cherundolo had them doing for so long. New coach Marc Dos Santos has a lot to prove after failing in Vancouver, and this hire was a safe in-house choice. Son and Bouanga make LAFC so dangerous, but what does that midfield composition look like? That's something I will be looking out for from the real contenders to Inter Miami coming out of the Western Conference.

Tata Martino is back at Atlanta United, a team he turned into a championship side with Miguel Almirón and Josef Martínez, and that's exciting to see. Martino can get them back to being a competitive team that's in the mix for MLS Cup. The first target needs to be making a strong playoff run and putting themselves into the contender category.

Then there's the New England Revolution and Marko Mitrović. He has done relatively well with U.S. youth national teams, and now gets his first opportunity to shine as a head coach at the professional level. The team has some good bones already, with a solid core.

With the Revs, Mitrović has reinvigorated the squad with youth. There's a lot of potential and quality, and maybe he can now marry that with the experience on the team to build a squad that can compete in the Eastern Conference. That is something I'm really going to watch – and not just because of my history with the club.

One team that isn't being talked about as much as it deserves is Nashville SC.

We're talking about B.J. Callaghan, former interim USMNT manager. He was my assistant head coach while at Philadelphia Union and was always a guy who would work extra with players who needed it. He wasn't afraid to have honest conversations.

Callaghan is a winner. He won the Concacaf Nations League as USMNT interim and, in his first full season in Nashville, lifted the U.S. Open Cup. Mike Jacobs, who's running the front office, has done a tremendous job of capitalizing on available deals in the MLS market, finding hidden bargains — and in the case of this winter, stud playmaker Cristian Espinoza as a free agent — to boost the roster.

Callaghan has also created an identity with this team and given them the confidence to win a trophy. They're a team to be wary of.

Then there's the Chicago Fire. Gregg Berhalter lifted the Fire from the bottom of the league in his first year and more progress may be on the way. His system can be a dream for forwards to play in because they're guaranteed to get opportunities.

Hugo Cuypers (17 goals last season) has shone, while Philip Zinckernagel (15 goals, 15 assists) is technical and underrated. Getting a stadium in Chicago will be a massive step in the right direction, too, so I look forward to seeing them play in their new arena when it's built.

Finally, San Diego FC was sensational in year one. No one expected that, outside of maybe sporting director Tyler Heaps and head coach Mikey Varas. But the second year is always much more difficult.

Much will depend on whether Anders Dreyer (19 goals, 19 assists in 2025) can continue his golden form. This time around, there is a target on his and the team's backs. Responding to that challenge will be the determining factor for the club.

It's the award no team wants, but someone always deserves — the MLS wooden spoon, given to the team that finishes at the bottom of the 30-team league.

It's not the rosiest thing to talk about, but for fan bases and supporters around the country who support those three teams, you're kind of thinking, “What are we doing here? There's not much hope.”

I played for D.C. United, and I want them to be successful, but year after year, the supporters grow increasingly frustrated by what feels like a lack of investment and a clear long-term vision.

All signs point to a battle between D.C. United, Sporting Kansas City, and CF Montréal to avoid the bottom spot, with none of the three having the strength, depth, or difference-makers to move into a loftier place in the table.

Several American players in MLS stand a chance to break into the USMNT's World Cup roster, and it will be an unavoidable factor at the beginning of this new season.

Mauricio Pochettino has proven to the European-based USMNT stars that he doesn't care where you play and that he respects MLS by giving players in the league opportunities. Who's to say that if someone has an incredible start to the season, he wouldn't include them?

We all know that people feel pretty good about Diego Luna, who's 22 and has shown that he has the mentality you would want on a national team, along with the quality. There's also Sebastian Berhalter, who has been fantastic with the opportunities he's received from Pochettino. He keeps getting better, and his set-piece delivery really stood out against Uruguay.

The same can be said of Cristian Roldan, an experienced midfielder in Seattle who Pochettino has already called his “perfect player.” Any potential goalkeeper battle, namely between Matt Freese and Turner, will also take place in MLS, giving the league's opening months a bit more importance from a U.S. perspective.

Vinicius Junior is said to have found Jose Mourinho's response to the racism allegations that he levelled against Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni “repulsive”. Former Real Madrid manager Mourinho spoke with Brazil international Vinicius during an unscheduled break in play at Estadio da Luz. The Portuguese refused to condemn his player afterwards, leading to widespread criticism of the so-called ‘Special One'.

A Champions League knockout phase play-off encounter in Lisbon was brought to a halt early in the second half. Blancos superstar Vinicius opened the scoring when firing into the top corner.

He riled the home support when celebrating by the corner flag, leading to a yellow card being flashed in his direction and tempers in the Benfica to become frayed. Angry words were exchanged before Vinicius returned to his half of the field.

Before the game could be resumed, Prestianni - with his shirt being pulled up over his mouth - said something to Vinicius. The South American raced off towards the match referee and claimed to have been subjected to racist comments. UEFA protocols were then followed over the course of a 10-minute delay.

Benfica expressed their support for Prestianni afterwards, with the Argentine winger saying in a post-match statement: “I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard. I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.”

Vinicius said in a statement of his own - having been backed on the field by club colleague Kylian Mbappe - “Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to show how weak they are. But they have the protection of others who, theoretically, have an obligation to punish them. Nothing that happened today is new in my life or in my team's life. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, it was just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.”

Mourinho spoke with Vinicius at the time of the incident, before receiving a red card himself, and told reporters afterwards: “Regretful for what? I've spoken with both of them. Vinicius says one thing, and Prestianni says another. I don't want to be ‘red'… and I don't want to say that I 100% support Prestianni; but I can't be ‘white' and say that what Vinicius told me is the truth. I can't, I don't know; only that up until the goal, it was a great match.

“I already said it in the flash interview, and I've tried to be more balanced than [Alvaro] Arbeloa and Mbappe. It's not that I want to say Vinicius is a liar and mine is an incredible kid. They've gone down a different path. It happens in so many stadiums, and it's always the same thing… Something's not working. Vinicius scored a fantastic goal. Why didn't he celebrate like Eusebio, Pele, or [Alfredo] Di Stefano? Why didn't he? The game was over with that play.”

Spanish news outlet El Chiringuito claim that Vinicius has been left angered by Mourinho's comments. He cannot understand how his goal celebrations could be considered “provocative” and finds the narrow-mindedness of a vastly-experienced coach to be “repulsive”.

UEFA have opened an investigation into what went on, alongside the Portuguese government, with a verdict expected to be delivered shortly - which could lead to sanctions being handed out.

Mourinho will already be serving a touchline ban when Benfica head to Santiago Bernabeu for their return date with Real next Wednesday. He is likely to be quizzed on the Prestianni incident again before and after that encounter.

Vinicius' stunning strike at Estadio da Luz was the only goal of the game during a keenly-contested first leg, meaning that Real hold a narrow lead as they attempt to secure safe progress into the last-16 of elite European competition.

Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly facing further enforcement action from bailiffs as the legal dispute with Kylian Mbappe takes another bitter turn. Despite a court order demanding over €60 million, a multi-million euro discrepancy remains unpaid, Mbappe insists. The Real Madrid star's legal team is now prepared to seize the remaining funds as the club misses its final deadline.

The high-profile legal fallout between PSG and their former talisman, Mbappe, has escalated following the club's failure to fully comply with a December 2025 court ruling. While the French giants have made significant strides in settling the debt, a €2m shortfall has prompted the player's legal team to threaten a second visit from bailiffs to the club's administrative offices, according to L'Equipe.

The dispute stems from a ruling by the Paris industrial tribunal which ordered PSG to pay a total of €60m to the Madrid forward. This figure covers unpaid wages, signing bonuses and accrued interest from the final months of his tenure in the French capital. Although PSG initially settled the primary €55m sum, they only recently added a further €4m following a physical intervention by enforcement officers, leaving the final balance outstanding.

Despite the pressure, the club maintains that its financial obligations have been met in full, citing technicalities regarding tax and social security. A spokesperson for PSG stated that "all sums due to Mbappe have been paid by the club," explaining that the current discrepancy is simply down to "the amount of employee social security contributions."

This financial tug-of-war has become a matter of public image for the Ligue 1 champions. Reports suggest that PSG are desperately attempting to negotiate a deal with Mbappe to avoid a humiliating court-mandated penalty. The tribunal's judgment included a clause requiring the club to publish the full text of the legal defeat on the home page of their official website for an entire month.

Mbappe's camp has remained firm, showing no intention of waiving the publication requirement or the remaining €2m. This steadfastness has left the PSG hierarchy in a precarious position as they balance their legal defense with the risk of further public embarrassment. The club had until February 19 to file an official appeal against the comprehensive ruling, a deadline that has kept both parties on edge.

The breakdown of the verdict highlights the scale of the financial commitment PSG failed to honour. The court established the France captain's gross reference salary at a staggering €11.8m per month. According to the judgment, the player was entitled to €36.6m gross "as a reminder of the third instalment of the signing bonus," along with a further €3.6m in associated holiday pay.

The industrial tribunal's decision left very little room for interpretation regarding the back-pay owed for the player's final quarter at the club. The court awarded the 26-year-old €17.2m gross "as a reminder of salaries for the months of April, May and June 2024," plus an additional €1.7m in "paid leave" for that same period.

Furthermore, the judge ordered the payment of €1.5m "as an ethics bonus for the months of April, May, and June 2024" and €150,000 in associated holiday pay. To round off the financial blow to the Parisian side, the court also mandated that PSG cover €5,000 in legal costs incurred by the player's legal team during the proceedings.

This series of rulings represents a definitive defeat for the PSG hierarchy, who had previously argued that Mbappe agreed to waive these bonuses when he was sidelined from the squad in 2023. These arguments have consistently failed to hold up under scrutiny, with the industrial tribunal becoming the second independent body to side with the player over the club's management.

As the legal teams continue to squabble in the boardroom, the focus of both parties has returned to the pitch, albeit under the shadow of litigation. Les Parisiens must decide whether to continue challenging the court's decision in a higher court or ultimately settle the balance to avoid further bailiff intervention. On the pitch, PSG are currently trying to reclaim the top spot in Ligue 1 from Lens, who are one point ahead at the top. Luis Enrique's team face Metz at home on Saturday.

For Mbappe, the focus remains on finishing the season strongly with Madrid. Los Blancos currently lead La Liga by two points over Barcelona and face Osasuna on Saturday. After that, they will prepare for the second leg of their Champions League knockout playoff against Benfica next week. However, the French international's legal team is expected to pursue seizure of funds if the €2 million remains unpaid.

For the first time in the 30-year-history of Major League Soccer, the starting World Cup goalkeeper for the U.S. men's national team is expected to come from the domestic league, which kicks off its 2026 season on Saturday.

Think about it. The top American keeper at each World Cup since MLS was founded in 1996 — whether it was Kasey Keller (1998), Brad Friedel (2002), Keller again (2006), Tim Howard (2010 and 2014), or Matt Turner (2022) — always played his club ball overseas, usually in the Premier League.

That's where Turner was employed four years ago, having moved to mighty Arsenal from the New England Revolution a few months before he backstopped the USA to a round-of-16 appearance, which included posting group stage clean sheets against England and Iran.

Matt Turner started at the World Cup in 2022 but may be a backup this summer.  (Photo by Daniel Jefferson/USSF/Getty Images) 

But he then lost the main job to New York City FC's Matt Freese midway through 2025. Turner – who made just 31 appearances for Arsenal, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace over his three seasons in England – returned to the Revs last summer in an effort to boost his chances of manning the USA net in a second consecutive World Cup.

That means MLS will be the stage that Turner and Eastern Conference rival Freese use to prove their case to USA coach Mauricio Pochettino, who will be watching closely. Pochettino will also be getting regular feedback from Toni Jiménez, his longtime goalkeeping coach. 

"Last season, we began a system of watching live MLS games of the goalkeepers on our shortlist, visiting their training facilities to observe practices, and exchanging ideas with their coaching staffs, including the head coach and goalkeeping coach," Jiménez told me earlier this week. "We're going to use a similar process for this upcoming season."

Jiménez will be a busy man. The shortlist he mentioned includes several other U.S.-based goalkeepers, too. It's entirely possible — and perhaps even likely — that all three keepers who are eventually named to Pochettino's final 26-man World Cup roster in May will be MLS players.

Presumed third-string keeper Patrick Schulte of the Columbus Crew has been called up consistently since Pochettino was appointed to succeed Gregg Berhalter back in September 2024. Schulte, a 2023 MLS Cup winner who started for Team USA (composed of mostly the under-23 team) at the 2024 Paris Olympics, has three senior caps.

- 2026 World Cup: USA's Roster Projection: Who Makes The Cut?

Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati) was included in two of Pochettino's final three camps of 2025. Chris Brady (Chicago Fire), was in the one camp last fall and served as the third string behind Freese and Turner during the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. Brady and Celentano are both uncapped, as is Jonathan Klinsmann, the only World Cup roster candidate who has played consistently in Europe this season. Klinsmann (the son of former USA manager Jürgen Klinsmann) starts for Cesena in Italy's second tier.

So while U.S. assistants Jesus Perez and Miguel D'Agostino have crisscrossed Europe all winter keeping tabs on top American field players like Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, much of Jimenez's focus has been on this side of the Atlantic.

"There is communication between myself and several of their goalkeeping coaches, as well as the goalkeepers themselves," said Jiménez, who worked with the likes of French World Cup winner Hugo Lloris at Tottenham and Costa Rican legend Keylor Navas at PSG.  "These communications, notifications, and updates are always shared with the rest of the national team coaching staff."

He knows what Pochettino is looking for.

"The first thing we evaluate is whether they have the qualities to operate within Mauricio's playing principles," Jimienz added. "The goalkeeper must establish a connection with the team to contribute to both defensive and offensive play. This defines the profile of the goalkeeper we need."

With that keeper in MLS, look for Jiménez at a stadium near you in the weeks and months ahead.

"I'll be traveling two weeks before the March training camp and will be able to attend a series of games and training sessions," he said. "And I'll be conducting another tour between March and May as we consider the final roster selections for the World Cup."

The striker battle got even more interesting on Monday, when Haji Wright's hat trick against Middlesbrough leapfrogged Coventry over their English Championship rivals and back to the top of the Premier League promotion race. It heated up further midweek. Here's who's trending up and down right now:

In Monaco's biggest game of 2025-26 so far, Balogun scored twice against PSG  in the Ligue 1 rivals' UEFA Champions League knockout round playoff first leg. Although Monaco went on to lose 3-2, it was a big-time performance from the 24-year-old, who now has 10 goals in 30 games across all competitions this season.

Lyon keeps winning and the Alabama-born Tessmann keeps starting. Last weekend, the former Clemson University football recruit logged 90 minutes for the fourth consecutive Ligue 1 contest, all of them wins.

Luciano Spalletti wasn't kidding when he said that the outrageously versatile McKennie is good enough to play as a striker — Juventus' manager backed up those words by deploying the Texan up top in Juve's Champions League playoff opener against Turkish behemoth Galatasaray in Istanbul. McKennie responded by setting up Teun Koopmeiners with a perfectly weighted assist. The best spell in McKennie's already-career season continues; the 27-year-old has two goals and three assists in his  last four Champions League and Serie A games this month.

Through no fault of his own, could Pepi actually miss out on a second straight World Cup roster? The Texas native and former FC Dallas standout has been injured most of this season and won't return from his broken arm until next month. This is all while Balogun, Wright and Derby County's Patrick Agyemang are all scoring goals for their clubs. The popular assumption is that Pochettino will take three dedicated strikers to the World Cup. Could he bring four? Wright can also play on the wing after all, and the USA will need goals this summer. If not, Pochettino will have a hard decision to on who gets cut.

It's been more than a month now since Reyna has been on the field for ‘Gladbach, and the club has been worryingly coy about what's keeping the oft-injured 23-year-old attacker on the shelf. Time is clearly running out for Reyna to be ready for the March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal, if not the World Cup itself.

Has Tillman lost his spot at Leverkusen? Or is he just nursing a minor injury? The silky German-born playmaker had been in the lineup for 10 of the club's last 11 Bundesliga games before coming off the bench last weekend against St. Pauli (and USMNT teammate James Sands). Tillman was a second half sub again on Wednesday, entering after the scoring was over in a 2-0 win over Olympiacos in Athens.

Clubs who did not play are to get solidarity payments

No formula determined for dividing the money

Frustration is growing among clubs globally at the extended wait for £185m of solidarity payments promised by Fifa on the back of last summer's Club World Cup.

Clubs that did not participate in the tournament were promised a share of the sum, designed to ensure a proportion of the event's funding was distributed throughout the football pyramid. If shared equally it would amount to about £50,000 for every top-flight club in the world but, more than seven months after the Club World Cup's conclusion, there is no sign of the money and no timescale for its distribution. The Guardian understands Fifa is yet to determine how the money will be allocated.

There is no suggestion that the windfall will go unpaid but clubs in smaller leagues are growing particularly impatient. The £740m set aside as prize money is understood to have been released; the winners, Chelsea, are thought to have earned about £84m. In comparison the solidarity sum may seem a drop in the ocean but the cash injection would make a significant difference to those in less glamorous settings.

An executive from one of Europe's smaller leagues told the Guardian there had been no clear answers about when their clubs will be paid despite continued inquiries. In environments where domestic television rights deals are increasingly precarious, and in certain cases nonexistent, a five-figure windfall has the potential to be a lifeline.

Numerous clubs, including some on other continents, have painted a similar picture. In Europe there is a perception that Fifa has dragged its feet on reaching a final formula for the payments' distribution. On some occasions Fifa is believed to have postponed meetings on the topic. Fifa has been in dialogue for several months with the powerful European Football Clubs body, which reached an agreement last year for about 13% of Club World Cup revenue to be reserved for solidarity payments. In some quarters there is sympathy for Fifa, acknowledging the complexity and political sensitivity of the task.

One sticking point is that no formula has been determined for dividing the £185m between the six confederations, who were represented at the Club World Cup to wildly differing extents. In practice, clubs are highly unlikely to receive identical amounts. Additionally, most confederations do not have a mechanism for distributing such payments. Uefa has experience of handing out solidarity funds to clubs that do not qualify for the league phase of European club competitions and is likely to employ a similar formula when the final sums are known.

Fifa sources said they were in regular discussions with the confederations and clubs about how the money will be distributed, and that they wanted all stakeholders to benefit from what they regard as successful tournament.

A source from the Union of European Clubs (UEC), which represents more than 140 non-elite clubs around Europe, said none of its members had received any information about when payments might be received. “UEC as an organisation has not heard anything and no member clubs we have consulted with have heard anything either,” they said.

The last-minute nature of Fifa's funding deal for the Club World Cup is unlikely to have helped the process to run quickly. It was only in March, three months before the tournament, that the prize money and solidarity pots were agreed. That followed the £787m agreement with the Saudi-backed streaming platform Dazn, reached in December 2024, to air all the competition's games free of charge.

Fifa was contacted for comment.

Lawrence will welcome the Algerian men's national soccer team, serving as its official base camp for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Lawrence 2026 announced in a press release Thursday that the North African team will use Lawrence as its home base for the World Cup. The Algerian national team will play in the fifth FIFA World Cup in its history, with its last appearance coming in 2026. The team will train at Rock Chalk Park, according to Jason Booker, deputy athletic director for the University of Kansas.

Ruth DeWitt, director of community relations for Explore Lawrence, the city's convention and visitors bureau, said Lawrence has been preparing to welcome visitors for the past year and a half, and she is happy the players, staff, family and fans of the Algerian men's team will use the city as its “home away from home” this summer.

“We all join in saying, ‘Welcome home, Algeria,'” DeWitt said.

Lawrence had long been aiming to get a national team to choose the city as a base camp. As the Journal-World reported, Lawrence was included in FIFA's official list as a potential base camp in June 2024, with plans that teams would train at the University of Kansas's Rock Chalk Park and stay at the Oread Hotel, 1200 Oread Ave.

In January 2025, a Unified Command structure was formalized for Douglas County organizations to coordinate preparations for the tournament. It formed Lawrence 2026 as part of its efforts to bring together individuals and organizations from across Douglas County to address logistics for an influx of thousands of visitors drawn by the base camp and the nearby matches.

Booker said he and KU Athletics were thrilled with the various partners helping organize the effort to bring a national team to Lawrence and Rock Chalk Park, which he said many countries visiting the region scouting base camps called a “world-class facility.” The Algerian team will train and prepare at the facility during the tournament, and he is excited that KU and Lawrence will be put into the global spotlight.

“This summer offers a tremendous opportunity to showcase the broader university, Lawrence, Douglas County and our surrounding region,” Booker said. “I am very appreciative of the tremendous collaboration across all parties to make this a reality.”

Algeria is one of four countries that will use the greater Kansas City area as their home base for the World Cup. The Netherlands, England and Argentina had previously announced their national teams will use facilities around the region during their stay in the tournament, which will take place from June 11 to July 19 across multiple cities in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Algeria is one of the four teams in Group J, which features the reigning World Cup winners Argentina, Austria and Jordan. Algeria is scheduled to play two matches at Arrowhead Stadium during the group stage: the first match against Argentina on June 16 at 8 p.m., and the final game of group stage play on June 27 at 9 p.m. In between those matches, Algeria will play against Jordan at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on June 22.

Lawrence 2026 said now that Algeria has chosen the city as a base camp, the group will “zero in on the particular needs ­- linguistic, cultural and otherwise — of fans and players” in its preparations.

Jessica Pegula improved to 5-0 against Amanda Anisimova, and advanced to her 21st career final, after coming from a set and a break down to win their Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships semifinal.

No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula pulled off a comeback from 6-1, 3-1 down to maintain her perfect record against No. 2 seed Amanda Anisimova, advancing to the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships final 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 in 2 hours and 2 minutes.

Pegula now leads her head-to-head against Anisimova 5-0, backing up her wins in the 2020 Western & Southern Open second round, 2024 Charleston second round, 2024 Toronto final and last month's Australian Open quarterfinals. Three of Pegula's five wins have come in three sets.

The 31-year-old booked her spot in her 21st career final on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, and 10th at WTA 1000 level or above. She is a three-time WTA 1000 champion (Guadalajara 2022, Montreal 2023 and Toronto 2024), a four-time WTA 1000 runner-up (Madrid 2022, Cincinnati 2024, Miami 2025, Wuhan 2025), and was also a finalist at the 2023 WTA Finals Cancun and 2024 US Open.

Pegula will face either No. 3 seed Coco Gauff or No. 7 seed Elina Svitolina as she bids to lift the Dubai trophy for the first time. She leads her head-to-head against Gauff 5-3 (including 3-1 on outdoor hard courts) and against Svitolina 5-3 (including 5-2 on outdoor hard courts).

Pegula can usually be relied upon for concise and accurate match analysis as soon as her on-court interviews. This time, even she seemed mystified.

"At the start of the third, it was 1-1," she said. "I just looked at my coach and I was like, 'I'm just happy I'm still even here right now.' She was playing some incredible tennis, and I just came out a little slow. And when you come out slow against Amanda, she can really just wipe you off the court, which is what she was doing.

"I held on to my serve there in the second set. I just kept telling myself that. I had some break points in the first set, even though it was convincingly the other way, and I knew I could get some break points back. That's really all I was focusing on."

Indeed, there was no single, dramatic turning point. Pegula clawed her way back into the match gradually -- it was the work of the whole set, game by game. To break it down further, here are the key moments:

Even though Pegula hadn't fully turned the scoreboard in her favour at this point, her tactics were beginning to wrest the match away from Anisimova's first-strike territory. Pegula was beginning to draw overhead errors with sky-high defensive lobs, and disrupt Anisimova's timing with defensive slices. She levelled again at 4-4 -- and this time, ran away with the momentum. From 4-3 down, Pegula won seven of the next eight games to go up 4-1 in the third set.

"I was running a lot," Pegula said in her press conference. "I knew I had to use my legs, get my feet under me ... get my feet under and stay in the points because she was hitting a really big ball. I was just having trouble, like, starting the points.

"I had to really make it a little physical there for a while. Then obviously at the end when I gained that momentum, it felt like there was a little bit of a lull in the energy where she was maybe, I don't know, a little tired. It was definitely mental and physical at the end."

The end result was a turnaround in Anisimova's fortunes -- just 24 hours earlier, she had pulled off a comeback of her own, defeating Mirra Andreeva 2-5, 7-5, 7-6(4) from 6-2, 2-0 down.

Pegula modestly claimed bafflement on this front, too.

"It's a really tough matchup," she said. "It's not like we have easy matches. We have battles every single time."

But her pundit's hat soon came out, and her analysis was again on point.

"I do think that I'm able to take some time away from her," she said. "I'm able to hit a low, flat ball, and not let her set up and go for her big shots, which is what she's good at. I try to utilize that the best I can and then mix in some variety, change things up. We had a lot of cat-and-mouse points, and they mostly went my way. So that was good."

And even if Pegula isn't taking it for granted, her perfect history against Anisimova is a reminder that, even when the scoreline's against her, she's never out of the match.

"I'm sure it helps me," she said in her press conference. "I'm not sure what she's thinking about. I think I know that I can turn matches around.

"I know what I can do to kind of bother her game. I just felt like I couldn't quite get into that yet as the first set went. I feel like I just need to get to that part where I'm starting to bother her with my strategy and what I'm doing. She was doing a very good job of not letting me get there ... Once I dug in, maybe she lost her timing a little bit, I was able to take my opportunity to do what I know probably bothers her."

Jessica Pegula improved to 5-0 against Amanda Anisimova, and advanced to her 21st career final, after coming from a set and a break down to win their Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships semifinal.

Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten are beginning to turn the tide in their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry with Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, following a composed championship-match victory at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open on Friday.

The third-seeded Heliovaara and Patten completed a spotless run to the ATP 500 title in Doha with a 6-3, 6-3 win over the top-seeded defending champions. Also winners in Adelaide, they became the second team to win multiple titles this season, joining Montpellier and Dallas champions Theo Arribage and Albano Olivetti.

After losing their first four meetings against Cash and Glasspool, Heliovaara and Patten have now reduced the deficit to 2-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. They also defeated the top seeds in the ATP Masters 1000 final in Paris in October.

“We finished the end of 2025 really strong and just to keep that form in 2026, it's been a dream six months for us,” said Heliovaara, who won his maiden Nitto ATP Finals trophy with Patten in November. “With Henry, it's always lovely to play. I had my family here in Doha this week — my wife and two kids — so it's always special to travel with them.”

Heliovaara and Patten saved all seven break points they faced in the 69-minute final, according to Infosys ATP Stats. They are now up eight spots to No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings, continuing their strong start to the season.

Learner Tien was not ready for his Delray Beach Open to come to an end.

The 20-year-old was two points from defeat against defending champion Miomir Kecmanovic — who served for the match at 5-4 in the deciding set — but rallied for a 6-4, 6-7(4), 7-6(5) victory and a place in the quarter-finals.

“I just kept believing,” Tien said in his on-court interview. “I got broken on kind of a bad game at four all, but just tried to put that behind me as best I could, and just made him beat me.”

Kecmanovic showed no signs of nerves when he served for the match, hammering away from the baseline and putting consistent pressure on the home favourite. But Tien played great defence, turning into a brick wall at the most critical moment.

Once the reigning Next Gen ATP Finals champion retrieved the break, he was able to surge to the finish line and take a 2-1 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“I got a little lucky. I think luck always plays a little bit of a role,” Tien said. “But I think just fighting, just staying in there every point, and really making him close me out, I think [that] just paid off.”

Tien is fresh off a run to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, where he beat a former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Daniil Medvedev, and pushed Alexander Zverev to a fourth-set tie-break. The lefty will next take on Frances Tiafoe, who won the first ATP Tour title of his career in Delray Beach in 2018.

"I played him in the first round of the [US] Open a few years ago. Obviously he's a totally different player," Tiafoe said. "I'm excited to get up and play him. It's funny how things turn. Now I'm the underdog in that match, so I'm happy to get out there and play against him."

The eighth-seeded Tiafoe clawed past qualifier Zachary Svajda 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 to reach his first quarter-final since July of last year.

"I'm just happy to be competing. It feels good competing," Tiafoe said. "It's nice to put some matches together. Happy I get to play another match tomorrow. It's going to be another tough opponent, so excited to get out there and compete."





Top seed Taylor Fritz also battled through a tough test, eliminating #NextGenATP Spaniard Rafael Jodar 7-6(4), 6-4 in the last match of the day. The home favourite hit 15 aces and saved two of the three break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Fritz has shown good form since returning to the United States, advancing to the Dallas semi-finals last week. The 2023 and 2024 Delray Beach champion will continue his title chase against close friend Tommy Paul, a 7-6(11), 6-3 winner against lucky loser Adam Walton.

Cicak argued to Alcaraz that she had reset the clock only after the Spaniard had walked to the back of the court to retrieve his towel.The two continued to debate the issue during the changeover, with Alcaraz requesting in vain that the violation be canceled.“I can't invent more time,” explained Cicak.Alcaraz went on to lose the first set to Khachanov in a tiebreaker, but ultimately advanced in three sets, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-3, shaking hands with Cicak at the match's conclusion.

“Whenever you guys were cheering for Alex, I pretended it was my name,” said the American after the match.ByDavid KanePublished Feb 19, 2026 copy_link

Coco Gauff employed a classic strategy to deal with an enthusiastic crowd at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Thursday, most of whom there to support Gauff's opponent Alexandra Eala.“I had a similar match at French Open last year so I brought that mindset today,” Gauff explained on court after defeating Eala, 6-0, 6-2. “Whenever you guys were cheering for Alex, I was pretending it was my name. I think that it helped me a lot!“If you can't beat ‘em, you've got to join them,” the American added with a laugh.This bit of reverse psychology has become popular for taking on tough crowds over the years, most notably from 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, who often found himself up against fan favorites like Roger Federer.“I have to say, it's great to be on a crowded court,” said Gauff, who hailed Eala's exploding fanbase as “great for tennis” ahead of their Dubai quarterfinal. “I've played this tournament for many years and to see the stadium full means a lot.”

Eala has been one of the Hologic WTA Tour's biggest breakout stars since her run to the Miami Open semifinals last spring. The Rafael Nadal Academy alum brings full crowds to nearly all of her matches, creating a standing-room only environment in her first round at the Australian Open back in January.“I'd like to thank Alex for bringing a new demographic to the sport. I really appreciate it,” Gauff continued. “I think it's great. I know sometimes it's tough when you're playing against a ‘home' crowd, but I think that it's great for the sport, so keep being enthusiastic and keep rooting for your player.”The 20-year-old was looking to make her second WTA 1000 semifinal against Gauff, a former doubles partner at the 2025 Internazionali BNL d'Italia, having ousted former Dubai champion Jasmine Paolini in the second round on Tuesday and backing that win up against Sorana Cirstea in the Round of 16.

But the Filipina sensation was up against an on-fire Gauff, who stormed through the first 10 games of their first singles encounter. Eala finally got on the board but was unable to create opportunities on Gauff's sometimes-shaky serve. Winning 77% of points on her first serve, Gauff was able to apply consistent pressure on return, converting six of nine break points across the 67-minute clash.Into her second Dubai semifinal, Gauff shook off an early stumble to her Middle East swing when she lost early at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open last week and recovered from the brink of defeat against Elise Mertens in the previous round.Awaiting Gauff in the semifinals is arematch of her Australian Open quarterfinal against Elina Svitolina. A former champion in Dubai, Svitolina dropped just three games to Gauff in Melbourne and will rallied from a set down to defeat lucky loser Antonia Ruzic in the final last-eight match of the evening.

After winning an epic quarterfinal against defending champion Mirra Andreeva at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Thursday, Amanda Anisimova couldn't stop thinking about her opponent.After seeing Andreeva come back from 5-3 down in the third to force a winner-take-all tiebreaker, Anisimova confessed she was almost in tears. But when Andreeva's final backhand went long to hand Anisimova the hard-fought  2-6, 7-5, 7-6(4) win, the 18-year-old could hardly contain the emotions of seeing her chance to become the first woman since Elina Svitolina in 2017-18 to win Dubai in back-to-back years end.She doubled over with her hands on her knees, and after hugging it out with Anisimova, left the court teary-eyed. And in her on-court interview, the American offered a metaphorical shoulder to cry on."It was such a tough battle, and I thought we played incredible tennis," Anisimova, who has been open about her own mental health struggles, said. "Seeing Mirra down like that, it's understandable. We both fought so hard today, and it made me emotional seeing her like that. She was playing so well, she's the defending champion and I feel like we both won on the court today. These type of matches, it's always tough that someone has to lose at the end of the day."In her press conference, Anisimova expanded on what she said on court, saying that Andreeva is doing "all the right things" despite the dramatic defeat, and two earlier-than-expected exits from her last two events following a title at the Adelaide International.

Q. You seemed really touched by when she broke down at the end. Can you talk about that moment.AMANDA ANISIMOVA: Yeah, made me like really emotional because I feel like we both sort of felt that way throughout the match probably because it was such a roller coaster, so up and down. Despite whichever way it was going, I feel like we were both fighting with everything we had and trying our best.Yeah, it's not easy to see someone that gives their all and then to react like that. It made me really sad for her. In my mind, I was just, like, thinking if she keeps playing like this, there's a title around the corner for her. Obviously she's going to have a great year. She seems to be doing all the right things. Yeah, not easy to be a defending champion. But I feel like she did an amazing job.Yeah, that's kind of why I felt like that. I mean, there will be many more matches for us to come, I'm sure.For a spot in the final, Anisimova will face No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula, who topped No. 12 seed and defending finalist Clara Tauson in another three-set quarterfinal. Anisimova will hope for some revenge after losing in two sets to Pegula in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open.

"I feel like that feels like such a long time ago for me because every week we have a lot going on. There's so many practices, so many matches," Anisimova said."I'm feeling, like, a lot better, like I said, every single day here. I feel like I've been going into the right direction. I'm really happy with the things I'm working on and the progress I've been making since I finished Australia. I'm excited at the end of the day. It's another challenge for me, another opportunity for me to learn more about myself and my game and see how things have changed since that match that I played at Australia."Overall, I mean, [there's] nothing that I can really lose at the end of the day.

Losses have been rare for Jannik Sinner in recent years. That is why when the Italian does fall short, it grabs plenty of people's attention.

Jakub Mensik, last year's Miami champion, upset the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 Thursday in the Qatar ExxonMobil Open quarter-finals. This was straight off the back of a semi-final defeat to Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open.

It had been a year and a half since Sinner lost before the final at two consecutive tournaments. It last happened in 2024 at Wimbledon and at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Montreal (both quarter-finals).

Sinner is now 138-14 since the start of the 2024 season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, giving him an astonishing 90.8 winning percentage during that period. For context, Novak Djokovic owns the best tour-level winning percentage on record at 83.3 per cent.

Since Sinner lost in the Montreal quarter-finals in 2024, he has played 19 tournaments and made the final in 15 of them, lifting 10 trophies. His five championship-match defeats came against Carlos Alcaraz.

So while Sinner has now lost in consecutive events before the final, that speaks to his consistency in recent years. Mensik will play Arthur Fils Friday for a place in the Doha final.

In 2026, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the daily deluge of stupidity. There's the White House and its malicious megaphone of mindlessness; the generative AI advocates and their pushy, pathetic ploys; the Major League Baseball owners and their dedication to self-destruction. So much of it would be laughable if it wasn't also ruinous, which makes the whole endeavor that much more exhausting. 

The luckiest among us endure these quotidian absurdities indirectly, via news stories and social media feeds, their consequences delayed until sometime in the future. But for the good folks cruelly targeted by ICE and the skilled workers inexcusably pushed out by bots, I can only imagine it feels like being trapped in a vice of vacuity, where an unbearable pressure of preposterous origins grows tighter with every lie accepted as truth, every known fraudster anointed as a power broker, and every imagined reality treated as if it exists within the bounds of reason.

HBO's “Portobello” elicits the same feeling. Marco Bellocchio‘s six-episode Italian-language drama is a living nightmare of the past that doubles as an agonizing manifestation of the present — a potent reminder that widespread stupidity isn't confined to a single time or place.

 










In telling the true story of Enzo Tortura — a beloved Italian TV host (played here by Fabrizio Gifuni) who, in 1985, was baselessly convicted of peddling cocaine for the mafia — “Portobello” plays out chronologically, starting with an hour-plus appreciation of Enzo's biggest success: the Italian variety program of the same name. Airing on Rai 2 (Radio Television Italy), “Portobello” features segments with inventors, musicians, and a pet parrot. Auditions include a woman who can cry on cue, clowns looking to start a circus for the elderly, and an illusionist specializing in building a house of cards (the latter of which “Portobello” returns to as a blunt, insufficient metaphor for Enzo's precarious court case). 

“What's wrong with feel-good stories?” Enzo poses to a reporter. “I'm not asking you, [but] I'd like to ask all these snobs, all these people who judge my show as provincial tear-jerking fluff.” The fluff, after all, is selling: Ratings are sky-high, and the network wants to renew “Portobello” for an extended run. 

But outside the comforting confines of a TV set, the government is cracking down on crime — or they're trying to. The Camorra criminal organization is responsible for hundreds of murders across Italy, and the citizens are fed up. Just as they want to escape into a feel-good show every night, they want arrests, convictions, and security every day — the perfect conditions for paranoia to run rampant. 

 










Giovanni Pandico (played by Lino Musella, who HBO subscribers may recognize from “Gomorrah” and “My Brilliant Friend”) sees the dominos start to fall first-hand. Sentenced to multiple life sentences for multiple murders, the low-level Camorra member fancies himself as someone well above his station. He wants nothing more than to be taken seriously, to be respected, to be valued. But he isn't a serious person, he's too cruel to respect, and he contributes nothing of value. His claim to fame is serving as a typist for a Camorra boss nicknamed “The Professor,” but facts don't matter to Giovanni. Not when he can feel like a big man by making up his own stories, his own history, his own reality.

Despite his character's transparency, Musella's performance is mesmerizing. He so firmly believes his own lies — and so clearly enjoys telling them — that you can't wait to see what he'll come up with next. For the first hour, it's unclear why “Portobello” is bouncing between Giovanni the prisoner and Enzo the TV star (played by Fabrizio Gifuni). Their stories have zero overlap. How could they? One is a serial killer, the other an Italian Mr. Rogers. 

But Giovanni watches “Portobello,” too, and he builds a grudge against Enzo for insults and slights that exist solely in his head. Watching his resentment build is hilarious up until the moment it's taken seriously. By the time Giovanni gets the chance to sour Enzo's good name, there's no question that he'll seize it. The only question is why anyone would listen, especially when his lies extend to the absurd. “Yes, he's involved, too,” the man known as “The Lunatic” tells the cops. “Even the parrot's involved?” they reply. “Affirmative,” he says. 

 










And they believe him. From there, the series largely lives in Enzo's head, stretching his increasingly infuriated perspective to a nearly intolerable degree. At first, Enzo is merely annoyed. He knows the charges against him aren't true and believes the lack of evidence will clear his name. But even without proof, the only truth the authorities recognize stems from unfounded accusations, and Enzo is soon embroiled in a scandal where the burden of proof is reversed. 

The convicted criminals accusing him of dealing drugs aren't expected to prove their claims. Instead, Enzo is expected to prove that their claims can't be true. It would be like if you walked into a police station and said, “This man killed my brother,” and they threw the man in jail without even asking if you had a brother to begin with. 

Understandably, Enzo's irritation morphs into disbelief, his disbelief curdles into anger, and his anger nearly consumes him. Whether it does (or did, given the series is based on Tortura's memoir) is a question “Portobello” wisely leaves hanging. Just as there's no obvious escape for Enzo — no mistake he could've avoided or opportunity he failed to grasp — there's no obvious fix for us, either. The only answer to stupidity is enlightenment, and when enlightenment is ignored, someone is bound to suffer.

 










At times in “Portobello,” it feels like that “someone” is us. The series' middle stretch contains plenty of redundancies, especially in the courtroom scenes, and witnessing so much needless torment is tough to endure when it exists off-screen, too. Whereas the original variety show was a delightful escape during a difficult time, HBO's “Portobello” doubles down on that difficulty. Warnings about considering con-men and their bad-faith contentions are important, of course, they're just also all too familiar. 

“Portobello” premieres Friday, February 20 on HBO Max.

If the philosophy of Guillermo del Toro‘s take on “Frankenstein” can be summed up in one line, it comes at the point in del Toro‘s film where Jacob Elordi's creature says to his creator, Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac), “I'm not something, I'm someone.” Long before the line was enshrined as a tag line on Netflix billboards and posters promoting “Frankenstein,” the film's makers looked to it as a guiding principle for their work.

That's particularly true of the Academy Award-nominated sound team that was tasked with bringing Frankenstein's creature — not monster in del Toro's empathetic vision — to life. “We plotted a path dramatically through the movie, where he would go from being the something that we meet at the beginning and turn into someone at the end,” supervising sound editor Nathan Robitaille told IndieWire.

 








Related Stories ‘Strip Law' Review: Adam Scott's Chaotic Animated Netflix Series Is as Deliriously Distracting as Sin City ‘Zootopia 2': The Pawbert Twist, Andy Samberg, and the Big Last Minute Fix 

That meant blending Elordi's voice (both from production sound and extensive ADR work) with various animal noises and other sounds in a carefully calibrated balance that shifted throughout the film to subtly chart the creature's developing humanity. Working out of Sound Dogs in Toronto, Robitaille collaborated with Company 3 re-recording mixer Christian Cooke to create layer upon layer of tracks that used sound as a storytelling and character-building tool

When we first meet the creature, he's presented essentially as Victor Frankenstein sees him, as an animalistic being. Appropriately, the “Frankenstein” sound team was at their most aggressive in these early moments. “In the beginning, we don't know who this is or where it came from,” Cooke said. “That gave us more leeway to add sound effects layers to his exertions. But as we realize who he is, we dial those sounds down because we want his own persona to come through, as opposed to embellishing it.”

 










The creature's journey from animal to man is more subtle than a straightforward erasure of the animal sounds, as Robitaille wanted the shift to feel natural and subliminal. “Chris had everything under a fader so he could creep the creature sounds in when he wanted to without it becoming really noticeable,” Robitaille said. “It would have been inelegant if he were just a normal man all the time and then the monster came out every time he roared.”

Indeed, even though Elordi sounds more human as the film progresses, del Toro told the sound department he wanted the actor's voice to have a low growl in his chest for the duration of the movie. To achieve that, supervising sound editor Nelson Ferreira recorded Elordi's ADR at a high resolution of 96K to enable Robitaille to push and distort the voice without adding artifacts. “We were hesitant to alter Jacob's voice too much because it's really rich and full,” Robitaille said. “He had a lot to offer before we did anything, so we wanted to stay hands-off for as much of the movie as possible.”

Using the high-res ADR and production sound mixer Greg Chapman's recordings of Elordi's performance, Robitaille gave Cooke and re-recording mixer Brad Zoern two different subsonic booster tracks to utilize. “ One was just a straight octave down pitch of Jacob's voice that was then run through a low-end plug-in, just to give it that subsonic synthesis,” Robitaille said, noting that he also created a booster track consisting of a number of animal roars tailored to Elordi's performance. “That way Chris always had two options for where he was going to reach for those subsonic frequencies, just to add a bit of warmth where he felt like it was necessary.”

 










Many of the animal sounds that blended together to form the creature's sound were chosen because of how they came across as extensions of Elordi's natural speaking voice. “Surprisingly, horses worked really well,” Robitaille said. “There was a lot of horse vocalization in the supplementary layers. There was also a rack of animal sweeteners: snarls at the end of a rolled ‘r,' or a whimper we'd put in under a flinch.” Although the animals were selected for their complementary qualities in relation to Elordi's voice, the range of species utilized was broad enough to include everything from raccoons to a rhinoceros.

“We threw the whole zoo at him,” Robitaille said, reiterating that at the end of the day, preserving and showcasing Elordi's performance was the primary goal. “Chris did a brilliant job of tapering it back and tucking the sounds in to make sure that Jacob was there more than anything else, because his performance was breathtaking. And Jacob was an absolute soldier through the whole process. He traveled the world carrying his prosthetic teeth with him for all the last-minute ADR sessions he had with Nelson. The raw ingredients they created were incredible, and we just hung a lot of embellishment on it.”

Hindsight? Hell of a drug. That's the lesson former CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Michael Lynton learned the very hard way more than a decade ago, and seems to only be coming fully to grips with now. The impetus: a Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy. 

Let's backtrack a bit. Lynton has a new memoir, “From Mistakes to Meaning: Owning Your Past So It Doesn't Own You” co-written with Joshua L. Steiner” hitting shelves next week, and a generous (and revelatory) chunk of it was excerpted in the Wall St. Journal on Thursday (via Variety). The excerpt, published on the WSJ website with the very intriguing headline “I Wanted to Fit In With Hollywood's Cool Kids. So I Made the Biggest Mistake of My Career,” details the thinking behind Lynton's choice to greenlight “The Interview” and the absolutely bonkers fallout that followed.

More than a decade on, the details still astonish. The 2014 comedy, directed by Rogen and Evan Goldberg from a script by Dan Sterling, follows a pair of journalists (Rogen and Franco) who book an interview with (very real!) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (played by Randall Park) and are soon recruited by the CIA to assassinate him during their visit. So far, so good.

But once the North Korean government caught wind of the picture, they threatened action against the United States if Sony released the film. Sony responded by delaying the film's theatrical release from October 10 to December 25, and reportedly re-edited the film to make it more palatable to North Korea. No dice.

In November of that year, Sony's computer systems were hacked by the so-called “Guardians of Peace” (a cybercrime group allegedly connected to the North Korean government). The now-infamous Sony Hack exposed scads of embarrassing internal communications, from producer Scott Rudin referring to Angelina Jolie as “a minimally talented spoiled brat” to emails in which then-Sony co-chairperson Amy Pascal and Rudin wrote about President Barack Obama in racist terms (Pascal ultimately resigned).

The group also threatened terrorist attacks on theaters showing the film, which led to major theater chains opting not to screen the film. Sony released it for online digital rental and purchase on December 24, 2014, followed by a limited theatrical release at selected theaters the following day. The film made $40 million in digital rentals, plus an additional $12.3 million worldwide in box office ticket sales, but the true cost of it was incalculable. 

In 2024, Rogen also reflected on the fallout. “At the time, it was really bad and really catastrophic,” Rogen recalled while appearing on the Hawk vs. Wolf podcast. “People we knew were getting fired from it. The head of the studio [Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal] was essentially fired from it. It really caused seismic shifts in Hollywood at the time and I think how business was done in some ways.”

 










In his book, Lynton writes, “I considered myself a coolheaded executive until I made a choice that severely damaged my company and colleagues — all because I wanted to fit into Hollywood's creative community — unleashing one of the worst cyberattacks in corporate history. It exposed the confidential emails of insiders and put my own family at risk.”

Lynton's excerpt then takes readers through the basic outline of the scandal, noting that “almost immediately the FBI opened an investigation, and evidence suggested that the North Korean government likely led this attack as retribution and to quash the release of a film called ‘The Interview.' … Eight months later, after it became clear that the North Koreans had hacked Sony, and after the studio had lost its relationships with many of its most important stars — including Will Smith, Adam Sandler and Angelina Jolie — I spoke to President Obama about the whole incident. Unsurprisingly, he asked the right question: ‘What were you thinking when you made killing the leader of a hostile foreign nation a plot point? Of course that was a mistake.' The mistake? My decision to greenlight a project on the fly.”

Lynton then writes about his background and what sounds a bit like a serious case of imposter syndrome once he reached the upper echelons of Hollywood, adding that he “once went to the home of Bryan Lourd, a powerful CAA agent, for his annual Oscar party. Daniel Craig, Leonardo DiCaprio and Sandra Bullock were all having a great time — drinking, laughing, singing. George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon stood in a tight circle, talking. I had seen Clooney at the studio that week and went up to join the conversation. While polite, they made clear that I simply did not belong. I was at the top of the heap in the movie business and still felt that I was watching from a folding chair in [his small hometown]. Perhaps that's what left me so vulnerable and explains why, when I found myself deciding on a Seth Rogen project, I made the biggest mistake of my career.”

 










For Lynton, the choice to greenlight the project was born of both his need to feel cool in the industry and beat back Universal Studios, which had an existing relationship with Rogen. Of the film's first Sony table-read, he wrote, “Walking into the room, I immediately felt energized and simultaneously completely out of place. Although middle-aged, I had not lost the observational skills I'd learned in middle school: I could quickly identify the cool kids and the ones eager for their approval.”

The read was a hit, however, and Lynton adds, “When the reading was over, Amy jumped up and said, ‘Let's make this!' I threw out all of our normal, careful approval processes and found myself agreeing. We rushed into the decision giddy about the project, thrilled to have outflanked our competition at Universal Studios and, alas, oblivious to the potential ramifications.”

The excerpt goes on to cover the ensuing weeks and months of Lynton's life as the scandal and hack unfolded, both professionally and personally, and details Lynton's own emotional takeaways from the whole ordeal. “Now I have come to believe that the whole affair neither began with that ill-fated table read nor ended with my buried feelings. It ultimately came down to a basic human truth: our desire to belong leads us all to weigh heavily the opinions of others,” he wrote. 

 










Hollywood? Probably not the best place for those feelings.

Editor-In-Chief


UPDATED: Grey's Anatomy has lost one of its own. Eric Dane, one of the venerable ABC medical drama's most popular cast members, died Feb. 19 at the age of 53 after battle with ALS.


	The series is expected to pay tribute to the actor in the upcoming episode next week when Grey's returns after a break.


	Introduced as a guest star in Season 2, Dane became a series regular the following season, playing the beloved character of Mark Sloan aka “McSteamy.” He remained on the show until the Season 9 premiere when Mark, along with Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), died as a result of the plane crash in the Season 8 finale. The characters' presence has remained on the show, as Seattle Grace Mercy West was subsequently renamed Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in their memory.

	Longtime Grey's cast member Kim Raver, who spent three seasons on the show with Dane, remembered the late actor on Instagram.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Eric was a light,” she wrote next to an episodic image of the two of them on Grey's and a red carpet photo of her, Dane and his wife Rebecca Gayheart. “You'd see it effortlessly shine from him on the set of Grey's as well as when he was with Rebecca and the girls. During filming he'd get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you! You will be missed.”


	Fellow veteran Grey's Anatomy cast member Kevin McKidd, who co-starred alongside Dane for four seasons, posted a photo of Dane from his time on the show with the caption, “Rest In Peace Buddy…”

	











	Similarly, original cast member James Pickens Jr., who was on Grey's for Dane's entire tenure, posted a tribute photo with the message “Rest In Peace.”


	Another OG Grey's star, Patrick Dempsey, opted to honor his former colleague by posting a clip from Dane's September video in support of ALS research, in which he says, “I'm Eric. An actor, a father and now a person living with ALS.”


	Dempsey shared memories about Dane, including his final days, on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show Friday morning.


	“He was bedridden and it was very hard for him to swallow, so the quality of his life was deteriorating so rapidly,” Dempsey said. “He was the funniest man – he was such a joy to work with and I want to just remember him in that spirit because any time he was on set, he brought so much fun to it.


Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes, speaking on behalf of her company Shondaland, which produces the show, called Dane “a beloved member of the Shondaland and Grey's Anatomy families.”


	“He was truly a gifted actor whose portrayal of Dr. Mark Sloan left an indelible mark on the series and on audiences around the world,” she wrote in a post next to photos of her and Dane through the years. “We are grateful for the artistry, spirit, friendship and humanity he shared with us for so many years. Our hearts are with his family, loved ones, and all who were touched by his work.”


	Shondaland posted a moving “Celebrating Eric Dane” montage of some of his most memorable moments on Grey's, which you can see below.


	ABC and 20th Television, the studio behind Grey's Anatomy, issued a joint statement Thursday night.


	“We are deeply saddened by the loss of Eric Dane,” the companies said. “His remarkable talent and unforgettable presence on Grey's Anatomy left a lasting impact on audiences around the world, and his courage and grace during his battle with ALS inspired so many. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as the many fans whose lives were touched by his work.”


	Dane and Leigh returned during the pandemic-themed 2020-21 season as part of the beach-themed dream sequences while Covid-stricken Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) was in a coma. Fittingly, it was Mark and Meredith's sister Lexie who ultimately convinced her to fight and choose life, with her coming out of the coma shortly thereafter. 


	In a touching moment from Dane's 2021 return to Grey's Anatomy, Mark addresses in one scene what he misses about being alive and he mentions his daughter Sofia, sharing that he talks to her all the time.


	In an interview with Deadline about his guest appearance, Dane, himself the father of two young daughters, elaborated on Mark's conversations with his daughter from beyond. “Whether she's listening to me or not, you always have somebody looking over you,” he said.

Craig Erwich, who oversees Hulu and ABC programming, also discusses what's next for 'The Descendants' and 'Zombies,' and reveals a new series from the 'Bluey' creator.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Craig Erwich, the president of Disney Television Group, serves many platforms. Soon, he'll serve a new master in Josh D'Amaro, the latest board-selected CEO to succeed Bob Iger. Even during this period of great change at Disney, which also includes technology shifts toward vertical video and gen-AI, the ins and outs of running Hulu and ABC won't change much for Erwich.


	In a wide-ranging interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Erwich discussed those modern-day transformations within a company that celebrated its 100th birthday more than two years ago. There was also much to celebrate, and we talked about those things too. Hulu's Tell Me Lies just finished its massive breakout third and final season, reaching its largest-ever audience with its series finale. Mere days ago, the last-ever episode reached 3.5 million viewers in its first day on Disney+ and Hulu, according to internal Disney data, an increase of 70 percent from the season three premiere.

	With a surge like that, more Tell Me Lies would be a no-brainer. Erwich told THR that there have been some discussions of a spinoff series with creator Meaghan Oppenheimer, who has an overall deal at 20th Television, but first they're doing “a completely new series” together about “family dynamics.”


	“We're excited work with Meaghan again,” Erwich said. “I think she's incredibly talented at telling stories about complicated relationships.”

	











	There was more new business to announce as well, like Bluey creator Joe Brumm's first foray into adult animation with a Hulu adaptation of the TikTok and Instagram shorts Deano. A new Zombies movie is being readied for summer 2027, Erwich confirmed, and there will be no rest for the undead: Erwich told THR that a new “Worlds Collide” concert tour with The Descendants and Zombies casts is readying, and this time, the Camp Rock (3) rockers are hitting the road with the other franchises' stars.


	Read THR‘s wide-ranging Q&A with Erwich below.


	***


Let's start at the literal top, the CEO change. You know Dana Walden well, but what is your working relationship with Josh D'Amaro like? How do you expect your job to change under the new regime?


	I think we're just incredibly lucky to have two, I mean, truly exceptional leaders in Josh and Dana. Both of them are just massive supporters of the talent and the power of great storytelling and creativity. And I think they both know that that's what drives the entire company. So, I think everyone's in a really good place. We had a great town hall couple weeks ago where it just felt like the company was in really, really good shape. It was, it was quite an optimistic beat — and it's kind of continued forward.


Josh comes from Parks, so I don't know this answer: Is he more of a TV or a movie guy?


	I've seen him at the Oscars. [Both laugh] We'll invite him to the Emmys this year. I know that he's a fan of just great storytelling and creativity — it obviously shows up at the parks.

	











Tell Me Lies has been a real standout performer and the latest proof-of-concept of YA TV. What are your future plans for the genre?


	Well, coming-of-age stories, as we call them — or as we talk about them — is less of an age group of an audience and more of a time of people's lives that everybody remembers. So there's just endless fodder for storytelling, whether it's people going back to relive their youth or experience their lives in a different way. And it's always obviously a pivotal moment for people, and we're telling these stories in multiple different ways, with, I would say, honestly, multiple tones. So we have everything from Tell Me Lies, which is about toxic relationships in college, to a new show coming out called Phony, which is really almost Freaks and Geeks with a genre bend to it. You know, you don't just come of age in high school — you continue to come of age, specifically in that period after college. Then we kind of have the queen or the king as it was of the rom-com, Mindy Kaling, who's just completed a show for us called Not Suitable for Work, which is really about coming of age in the workplace and navigating that time of your life. 


	And then we have some really, I would say, classic takes on it. One of our big launches this summer for Disney+ will be Coven Academy, which is a bunch of young girls in a genre setting — but that one is also specifically geared for young audiences in 2026. We designed these episodes to be in 15-minute bursts because we know how people are watching. These things are meant not just on the [TV] screen, but on mobile. It's got a propulsive beat to it. It's not just the subject matter, but the form of storytelling, that feels really relevant.

	











	The form has to continue to evolve to be relevant. We just launched Locker Diaries, which is a vertical video series where meet characters of our franchises — The Descendants, Phineas and Ferb — as they roam the halls of high school. This one came to be great because we were talking about vertical video, and it was asked in a meeting, “What else is vertical?” And someone said, “A locker.” And so you have a show told through the point of view of the locker.


The lockers shorts are a really clever way for Disney to do vertical video. Do you see vertical video being a large part of Disney's streaming future? Or is it a passing fad to be used sparingly?


	What we're about is fandom — it's really the through line of everything we do. Dana talks about this all the time. A view is a single view, but fans come back multiple times for experiences. So I think vertical video can be a lever towards that, or one thing that can provide a more immersive experience and a deeper fan experience around the show that they love, but that will also complement with things we do, like video podcasts … or concert tours, which we just did around The Descendants and Zombies — that comes out [on Disney+ on) Friday. So we're really trying to enable the fans to go deep and champion these shows. You have to put a lot of assets towards that, and that's the strategy that drives — whether it's a vertical video or podcast or concert tours or social assets.

	











One of the reasons Josh got the big chair, I imagine, was not just his work with the parks, but the Disney experiences that come to you — concerts, Disney on Ice, cruises, the Dancing With the Stars tour — what a competitive advantage.


	I mean, we create really deep experiences beyond a first watch. Again, whether it's the tour or you go to Disneyland and you see, Spidey and Bluey and Mickey, which, you know, are three of the top five preschool shows that you're not just watching, but then you're interacting with it. It's something that we do, I think, better than anybody. Obviously, it's an honor to work at Disney. There's an incredible legacy here, but we really talk a lot about eventizing our legacy, So it was just, for instance, the 20th anniversary of High School Musical. So as appropriate, we really celebrated that with social and media and events for the fans. And you saw the uplift of High School Musical on Disney+ just really spike. It gave a relevancy and a recency to a movie that's now 20 years old. 


	It's the same thing for the Muppets, which we (re-launched) two weeks ago. It's one of the crown jewels of the Disney company. People have such deep memories and affection for the original franchise as part of their childhood, as something they want to share with their kids. And we really put up a classic version of it that created conversation. It has Sabrina Carpenter, who is among the most original contemporary artists. Suddenly that felt like a moment in 2026 that also was celebrating a moment from when the show first came out. 

	











	I think the one we're really excited about is we have this Hannah Montana special coming up, which is a beloved character and a beloved part of the Disney library that still performs really well on Disney+. We put that trailer out and within 24 hours it had like 127 million views. So you can continue to inject relevancy and recency and, most importantly, an event around these classic shows, because there's new viewers coming in all the time, or people just want to go back and experience it again.


I like when these stars return to whatever kids show first made them famous because they often spent so much time and energy trying to break away from that image. Is it hard to get “Disney stars” to return to the thing that made them a Disney star?


	I know for Hannah Montana, Miley has just such a deep connection to her fans. And I think this anniversary is really meaningful, not just to her, but to that generation. And you know else is a Hannah Montana fan is Alex Cooper, and so Alex Cooper is going to host it.


You have a number of ABC legacy shows in Malcolm in the Middle and Scrubs returning for more than a special, but a season or maybe more. It's a shortcut to awareness, but risky in terms of the legacy of the original series.


	Well, there has to be a reason to do it. It has to be done with a very contemporary nod that honors the original spirit of it.


	We went through a similar thing this past summer on King of the Hill, which is a beloved show. And you know when the show came out, I just think the fans were so excited and happy and maybe even relieved that we not just did an honor to what the show was, but we really did a very clever update of it that just felt as relevant as the original one. Greg (Daniels) and Mike (Judge) and Sal (Patterson) really threaded the needle on that. I mean, the reviews were just incredible. The old audience … kind of came back in droves because the show had something to say.

	











Not just a cash grab.


	Yes, yes. No cynicism around these things.


My older daughter would kick me if I didn't ask what's next for Zombies and The Descendants.


	Well, these what we call, internally, Disney Channel Original Movies around music are something that we do that no other company can do, and that's a key part of our strategy. The Descendants and Zombies are really kind of the the the true bar. That's really where the bar is on things. So we have a new Descendants coming out. There will be another Zombies this summer. We're going to do another tour that will also include Camp Rock, which we're really excited about because we have the next generation of Camp Rockers coming out this summer in our new Camp Rock. These movies that combine music, they're incredible way to discover new talent. And they are things the whole family can watch together, you know, is a very important part of our strategy.


Do you see a near-ish future where the number of scripted shows on ABC increases given how much viewing shows like Abbott Elementary and The Rookie drive on Hulu?


	One of the things that we're extraordinarily proud of at Disney is how we've been able to master the interplay between ABC and Hulu. We have these two places where people can access one show and we've proven over and over again that it aggregates a bigger audience, it doesn't cannibalize it. So there's a massive opportunity there that we continue to reap the success of. You take a look at High Potential, which is one of the top shows on television and streaming, and the phenomenon of that is borne out by the relationship between ABC and Hulu and that strategy.

	











	If you kind of look at the ratings between High Potential and a show like (CBS') Matlock — on linear, they're somewhat close. It depends on the week. But then when you add in the Hulu part of it — the robust streaming platform that our shows go to — it just laps the competition. And that's where you see the success of shows like High Potential, Will Trent, Abbott Elementary… Hulu allows us also to build those audiences who are catching up on the show later, and then they come in and can join it live. 


	What's happened with The Rookie I think has almost been under reported. This is a show that, in its ninth season is, on an hour's basis, one of the top rated shows on streaming week in and week out. It's become this massive phenomenon and fan favorite among teens who are kind of discovering it for themselves. So this ability to bring audiences up to speed on Hulu, it just provides a great opportunity. And ABC is a great launchpad. To the extent that we can do more, we will do more. I'm really excited about RJ Decker, that's coming out next month. We talked about Scrubs, which I think is the perfect example of a show that's built for broadcast and streaming, as is Abbott.


Everyone loves Bluey, everyone watches Bluey. It's a great title to have on Disney+, but it's not your show. Is it better to have the biggest show via license, or would you consider Spidey & His Amazing Friends, which you own, the greater success for Disney?


	I mean, they're both important. Bluey, which was the number one show on streaming, provides massive engagement for our streaming platform. It provides a show that people kind of check in on a daily basis. We're really proud to be in business with (Bluey creator) Joe Brumm. As matter of fact, we just greenlit a new show that Joe is executive producing called Deano, which is his take on what will ultimately be an adult animation show. And the circulation of Bluey then allows us to launch other shows, like our new Iron Man show, yeah, or the new preschool version of Avengers. Spidey is obviously the Grand Slam because it's a show that not only starts to rival Bluey in engagement, but it's also a show that we can then take people through that character's journey — everything from preschool to the parks to toys to consumer products. And that's when you can take a look at the case study of Spidey or Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. That's that Disney flywheel thing they talk about where that is truly what our competitive advantage is in this industry.

	











I want to go back to Tell Me Lies because it has been your most recent breakout hit. It's rare for a show to grow this much, this long into its existence. Did you see this success coming with season three?


	Well, let me start with— from day one, we loved the show and believed in it. The first episode of season one did not come out of the box gangbusters. It was a slow build. It required word of mouth. I think we understood who the audience was, and we built experiences for them. So we seeded TikTok clips, videos for people to share — that helps spread the word — and, you know, the podcast around the show. I do think one of the things that helped is we cast (Tell Me Lies star) Grace (Van Patten) in The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox, which introduced her to a wider audience. And that's very much, you know, a page from the Disney playbook. You know, (president of Disney Branded Television) Ayo Davis does this in our kids and family efforts. 


	Malachi Barton, who I'm sure your daughter knows who started in Zombies and is now in Camp Rock 3, he's been introduced into our tentpole releases and is now in Coven Academy. It's the same tactics that led Dancing With the Stars to be up year over year — getting (Hulu's) The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives women on Dancing with the Stars. 


	[Tell Me Lies] is up 150 percent (in viewers, season three vs. season one), which is pretty unheard of. But also it's so addictive, which is, I think— at the core of every great original that we do here, it's not that you just can't stop watching this show, you cannot stop talking about. And if you can empower the conversation and bring that community of fans together and give them the materials to kind of evangelize on your behalf, but just also to interact with it, it's pretty special.

	











One way Disney+ may soon allow fans to interact with their favorite IP is through UGC gen-AI — how do you see the use of AI on Disney+ actually playing out?


	Look, our jobs are to protect our creators and our IP. That said, AI, it is a tool that our productions are using and exploring. The key is that any use of it has to be human led. So if you look at Percy Jackson, for instance, Tyson, who was the new character we introduced this year— AI was utilized with Tyson, the cyclops character, but that was a creative decision used in the post production process.


It feels appropriate to end with one more Tell Me Lies question. Given the massive surge in popularity, have there been discussions about a spinoff?


	Yes, we've definitely discussed what another Tell Me Lies might look like with a new set of characters. Meaghan has some initial notions but she also has an original take on family dynamics that's a completely new series. We're excited work with Meaghan again. I think she's incredibly talented at telling stories about complicated relationships.

	The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Donald Trump did not have the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, a rebuff of the president's central economic policy. 


	The court, in a 6-3 opinion (read it here), ruled that the president lacked the justification to impose the tariffs during peacetime.


	Trump had invoked his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs, but the high court ruled that the law did not give him the ability to do so without congressional approval.


	“The President asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. “In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The court found that the Trump administration's interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act unconvincing, concluding that their argument extrapolates sweeping authority from individual words in the law.


	Roberts wrote: “We claim no special competence in matters of economics or foreign affairs. We claim only, as we must, the limited role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution. Fulfilling that role, we hold that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.”


Read the Supreme Court tariff decision.


	Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on overseas movie and TV production, and his authority to do so was in doubt even before Friday's decision. He had cited national security when he originally said that he wanted to impose the levies last May.

	Trump's tariffs had upended global trade, leading to countries like Canada to recalibrate their economic partnerships in response to the punitive actions. The president had reached frameworks of deals with a number of countries, though in many cases the details remained to be worked out.


	The president had insisted that other countries ultimately paid the tariffs, even while many economists insisted that consumers of the imports in the United States ultimately would pay.


	It's unclear what happens to the tens of billions collected from the new tariffs that Trump imposed since taking office. The U.S. collected $264 billion from tariffs last year, per Factcheck.org, more than three times the previous year.

	In a dissenting opinion, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the majority “says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a ‘mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.”


	California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has challenged the tariffs in a state lawsuit, posted on X, “Issue an immediate refund to all Americans for your illegal tax. Now.”


	When the ruling came down, Trump was addressing state governors at a White House meeting, but the press pool was escorted out of the event.


	Ironically enough, the decision might give a boost to the economy, perhaps easing prices at a time when affordability is front and center in the midterm elections. Trump, though, was expected to try to invoke other authority to keep the tariffs active, but the Supreme Court ruling may foreclose other options as well.


	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement, “Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly. We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.”

As Nelson Mandela Muntz Sr.from the Simpson's would say, “Ha-Ha”

Soooo, do we get a refund? I want my money back

So much winning

If the Supreme Court decision does help the economy, Trump will take the credit. Mark my words.

There it is. The people have burn the brunt of the far-reaching tariff costs, and it is not wartime. Ergo, it has been a widespread tax on Americans. Only Congress can pass tax laws. 

This is basic Econ 101. It should never have had to go to the Supreme Court but as this president thinks he's a ruler, not a president, once again, here we are.

	In the not too distant future, somewhere in time and space, Mike Nelson and his robot pals Tom Servo and Crow T Robot will return to the Satellite of Love and once again riff on cheesy movies. If this reads like gibberish, you are not familiar with Mystery Science Theater 3000, which originated on a Minneapolis UHF channel in 1988, and ran for seven seasons on Comedy Central, and three on the Sci Fi channel before vanishing for 18 years and re-emerging on Netflix in 2017.


	The cast and crew changed a lot over the years, but the premise remained the same: A man and two robots are trapped in space and forced to watch bad movies by evil overloads. Their silhouettes are seen in the corner of the screen, but they occasionally leave the theater for brief comedy routines. 


Mystery Science Theater 3000 creator Joel Hodgson was the original host, but he left in season 5 and was replaced by Mike Nelson, the show's head writer. When the show came back in 2017, Hodgson was onboard as producer, but he assembled an entirely new crew, led by comedian Jonah Ray. 

	











	The revival fizzled out after three seasons, and the show truly seemed dead, until earlier this month when word hit that Hodgson had sold MST3K to Radial Entertainment, and they were reviving it with Mike Nelson as host, Kevin Murphy (Tom Servo seasons 2-10), and Bill Corbett (Crow T. Robot seasons 8-10). That trio has spent the past 20 years working at RiffTrax, an audio-only riffing enterprise that has taken on over 550 movies. (You simply start the audio file when the movie begins, and they provide the commentary.) 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The new season of MST3K is called Mystery Science Theater 3000: The RiffTrax Experiments. As of now, only four movies are slated, including the 1978 Roger Corman/David Carradine film Deathsport. And in one episode, OG MST3K cast members Frank Conniff and Trace Beaulieu — who have their own riffing company The Mads — will make guest appearances. A Kickstarter was set up to raise funds for the productions, and so far it's raised nearly $2 million.

	All of this news is a lot for longtime MST3K fans (or Misties, if you will) to process. We hopped on a Zoom with Nelson to hear how it all came together, and what we can expect going forward. 


You last hosted the show in 1999. That's a long time ago. Did you think it was over forever when the show went off the air back then?Pretty much. I remember at the time being really naive and just going like, “Well, these things happen. We had a good run. What are you going to do?” And everyone else was really sad. So, I didn't really think of it. That's how dumb I was. I just didn't think of it that much.


I'm sure your 20 years at RiffTrax has been very satisfying because you made something that no one can cancel. You own it.It is true. I was in Minnesota [when MST3K went off the air] and I was doing freelance writing, and all of a sudden I realized, “Hey, there's not a lot of freelance writing out there. I better own something.” I thought about doing this RiffTrax thing and I teamed up with David G. Martin, who's still our CEO and is shepherding this. We just did it on a “let's try it and see what happens” basis, and obviously it worked out and it's been a gratifying 20 years.


It's brilliant in its simplicity. No one can stop you riffing, say, Star Wars or Titanic. There are no rights issues.That is pretty nice. I mean, I've done a lot of stuff with executives. My gag about it is that an executive will come in and go, “Pretty good. I like a lot about it. Why don't you throw a monkey in there.” Then they just leave the room and you got to go, “What does that mean?” And then the next executive goes in, “I like everything except the monkey. So get a monkey in there, but take the monkey out.” And you're like, “How do you do that?” “You'll figure it out. You're the talent.” So to have 20 years of not having any of that, we're spoiled.

They first brought back MST3K in 2017. Kevin and Bill both made guest appearances. Did they ask you at any point?As I recall, they did. I'm sure they did. My standard answer back then was like, “I really got to do this RiffTrax thing right now.” I also remember, even with live shows I would have to demur and just go, “I can't.” Also, when you're raising children, now my children are full-grown, but back then you're like, “I don't know, man, I got a kid hanging on my ankle.”

	











As a fan of the show, I had mixed feelings about the first revival. I was happy it was back, but a whole new cast all at once was tough to swallow.Yeah, I wondered about that for people. I remember at the time when Joel was the host and then I took over, I got some really, really personal hate mail. I hadn't really thought of it. I was always there. I was on set all the time, so it didn't really mean anything to me. And then all of a sudden, now I'm in their living room, and they don't like me.


The changes were very gradual back then. You were the new host, but it was same Tom Servo, the same Crow, same Gypsy. This was an entirely new cast all at once.Sure. Yeah.


They were on Netflix for two seasons but i was never a long-term home. Netflix rarely lets a show go for very long.I've never been part of the Netflix universe, but from what I hear, and this is hearsay, take it or leave it, is that they're very closed about that. You just walk in one day, and we're all fired. That is a phenomenon even on networks too, where it's kind of like working at a restaurant. You walk in one day and the doors are chained.


They did one more season that was entirely supported by fans. But that wasn't a long-term plan either. You need some sort of production company backing you.Yeah. I'm sure that's part of it. How many times as a fan can you open your wallet? I don't know.


This new era was a pretty big surprise to the fans. How did you first hear about the possibility of Joel selling the show and you guys being called back in?It was really gradual. It was like, “Would you, in any universe, be interested?” And then it's like, “Well, yes, would I like to own a unicorn? I mean. I guess so. Let me think about it.” And then you're going about your day a couple months later and it's, “Well, there's a possibility. What do you think about this?” And I was like, “I don't know. In a theoretical world, maybe, I guess.” So it was sort of gradual.


Did you feel any hesitation? You've been doing your own thing for 20 years. It's pretty established at this point.Probably a little. I think all three of us felt a little bit like you're saying, “We've got our lane, and it's been a while.” And then I think we gradually started to remember, “Man, we had so much fun doing this. Wouldn't it be fun to be a grown person holding a puppet, Kevin?” 


How did it get to the place where it's at now where it's going to be shot again in Minneapolis with the old sets and everything?Kevin Murphy had produced for us before. It was him doing a lot of legwork with people we knew from the past. Most people we're still in touch with. It's like, “We're thinking we're going to do this, would you be interested?” And it's gratifying to get a yes from people. 

	











	I thought it was a really joyful thing to be able to live your life in a way that when you contact people from the past, they don't go, “Yeah, no, I don't want to do that.” Everyone was pretty happy about it. And we shot that little video for the Kickstarter, and a lot of the old crew came back.


When does production start? What's the timeline?We have to wait to see what happens with the Kickstarter, but production will follow pretty much on the heels of it and we'll try to get going on it and get them in the can, as they say.


How is it going to be broadcast?I think we'll deliver them all on our RiffTrax platform, being the RiffTrax experiments. People are kind of used to that, and I think they'll just get them there. There's talk of doing one of them as a live show with Fathom, which would be fun.


I'm sure it's going to be surreal to put the jumpsuit back on, have the puppets next to you again, and be back in this universe you've been out of for 27 years.When we did the shoot, the puppets came out of these cases. It was this weird thing of like, “I've been to the moon and now here's the moon rock that you picked up.” It was a surreal feeling, but it was also very joyful to see people scrambling around again. 


At the end of the series, Mike had escaped the Satellite of Love and was back on earth, watching a movie on a couch with Tom and Crow. Are you going to be back up in space for the new series?The fiction is sort of TBD. We don't really know. For most of us involved in it, we don't have a lot of preciousness about the actual fiction. It's space. You can do whatever you want.


Will Gypsy be back?Again, TBD. It's hard to say. I think we said goodbye to Gypsy in our final episode. Someone reminded me of that. I was like, “I don't remember what we did.” She went to work somewhere.


You announced Deathsport as one of the first movies. What drew you to that one?There was a lot of talk about the movies that we were going to do. And we're still deciding that. Luckily, Deathsport is one of them that we're able to get the rights to. But over the years at RiffTrax, a real attachment to David Carradine has formed for whatever reason. This is the one where he has a loincloth.


How did Frank Conniff and Trace Beaulieu get involved?Trace is in our general area, and we've kept in touch with him and always been friendly with him. We are always aware that they were doing the Mads, and have been sort of, as they say, friends of RiffTrax. So that was an easy lift. And Frank, I saw him a couple months back. He had moved back to Minnesota from New York. It was like Old Home Week. It was good to see him again. So it's a little bit easier to do rather than to say, “Hey Frank, can we send a car to pick you up in your Manhattan apartment and bring you to Minneapolis?”

	











Why just four episodes?I think everyone thought that was a good starting place production-wise. Because one of the things about MST that's far different from RiffTrax is that RiffTrax is much easier to produce since it's just audio. MST is like spinning plates. When you start putting puppets under the lights and things like that, they tend to catch fire. It is harder and it's unknown in a way that we're not used to. Four was just like, “What do we feel comfortable committing to and what do we feel comfortable actually producing?”


It's a crazy echo of history that you're again replacing Joel 30 years later.It is odd, and then oddly comfortable. When I first stepped aboard as host, people would say, “Why you?” I'd go, “Well, I was the head writer and I was always there on set. If they just left the camera on, you'd see me there anyway all the time. So it seemed natural.” So in the same way, this seems natural.


Are you in touch with Joel? Might he guest at some point?I haven't been in touch with him. I don't think so. I don't think there's any plans for it because I think he's out of the game, at least that's our understanding.


If the four go well, might you make a lot more?We're leaving that open. If we were so lucky, we probably would. We're going to be at a rental studio. If we don't ruin it, and if people want us to do it, I think everyone is open to it. But we have our old cameraman and art director. They were like, “I'm retired, man, I don't want to do this.” They're chopping wood in their cabin and we're like, “Come on, man, one more job.”


I want to briefly ask about some of the old movies. Manos: The Hands of Fate fascinates so many people. What is it about that movie that makes it stand out above all the others?That is a hard one for me to understand. That was very polarizing even at the time. Frank Conniff and I used to sit in the room and screen together. He was like, “Oh, this one's great.” And I'm like, “I hate that one so much. There's no way we're going to do it.” And then we showed it to everyone else and it was half-and-half, people just going, “I just don't ever want to see that again.” And the other half going, “This is so good.”


	There's just something about it. It's like that Tommy Wiseau and The Room. You can't explain why some people are like, “I cannot believe you would sit and watch this once, let alone 300 times.”


I find Manos captivating. It's like this weird form of outsider art, people making a movie that don't know anything about the craft of filmmaking.Yeah, I think it has that same feeling of, “Where did this get made? Who did this? Why?” You want to know everything about it. With almost every movie we do, we speculate about them. And then we do research and find out we're right. With Manos, we were like, “This seems like it was made by a fertilizer salesman from San Antonio.” And then it's like, “This was made by a fertilizer salesman in San Antonio. Okay. All right.”

	











Who is a worse director: Ed Wood or Coleman Francis?Oh, I think Coleman Francis is worse than Ed Wood. In terms of just technical things, I feel like Ed Wood at least tried to capture the stuff on film. And Coleman Francis is like, “We got it. Who cares?”

Paramount has cleared a 10-day waiting period after responding to a second request for information from the DOJ around its unsolicited offer for Warner Bros. Discovery. 


	The company said today that the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act means “there is no statutory impediment in the U.S. to closing” the acquisition. Paramount, unusually, had moved on regulatory approvals without a deal in hand so there is nothing, in fact, to close on. WBD has agreed to a sale of its assets to Netflix.


	In a statement, David Hyman, Netflix's Chief Legal Officer, objected to Par's characterization. “Paramount Skydance continues to mislead stockholders and distract from the facts. The facts are that routine HSR milestones do not signal DOJ approval nor that any decision has been made. They have not secured approvals needed to close and they are a long way from doing so.”

	











	Netflix representatives have been warning investors not to confuse the expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period with regulatory clearance, citing examples where DOJ investigations have continued, per a note from analyst firm Guggenheim this week. Last year, Bill Rinner, then a top DOJ antitrust official, warned of mistakenly believing “that expiration of the statutory waiting period constitutes ‘clearance' or ‘approval' of a transaction.”

	Netflix is in the process of responding to the DOJ's second request for information, which will be followed by a 30-day waiting period. Deadline understands that the waiting period for all-cash offers like Paramount's is shorter. Paramount's chief legal officer is Makan Delrahim, who led the Justice Department's Antitrust Division in Donald Trump's first term.


	Par has launched a hostile tender offer for $30 a share in cash for all of WBD. The Netflix deal is a mix of cash and stock pegged at $27.75 for Warner Bros. streaming and studio assets. WBD has repeatedly rejected the overtures of the David Ellison company but this past Tuesday the two began seven days of talks giving Paramount an opportunity to address the WBD board's concerns over its latest offer. Most observers believe Paramount will need to pony up more cash.

	











	Warner Bros. has set a March 20 date for shareholders to vote on the deal with Netflix and on setting the process of spinning out Discovery Global.


	The DOJ can still chose to sue to block a deal at any stage. Along with the WBD stockholders and the DOJ, Netflix or Paramount would both require clearances from regulators around the world. The transactions have raised a host of questions and flurries of protest from lawmakers, unions and industry players. 


	Senate Democrats have threatened an investigation of Paramount as they fired off a letter to CEO David Ellison, seeking information on the company's contacts with the Trump administration and the president himself over its attempts acquire WBD.

How about this: neither Netflix or Paramount get to buy Warn Bros. Shut the deals down.

You buy it then 😂

WB is the one that needs buying.

They wouldn't be on sale of they didn't need to be.

Corruption. I hope EU, UK will kill his chances. As well as Democrats will investinge and grill him when they got back in power.

Cool…. but when is Ellison going to testify?

You can't really be a serious contender for a big deal like that if Paramount Skydance's leader doesn't testify about various things like Sarandos already did.

Is David afraid of the questions or something?

He won't have advance notice of those that's for sure.

A love story, with Sam Claflin and Simone Ashley attached; a Dusty Springfield project; and a film driven by music by Bastille's Dan Smith and To Kill a King's Ralph Pelleymounter feature on the slate of the longtime Quentin Tarantino collaborator and sync powerhouse.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Hollywood producer and long-time Quentin Tarantino collaborator Shannon McIntosh (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Hateful Eight) has struck a deal with Universal Music Group U.K.'s Globe business for a slate of music-driven feature films.


	Led by president Marc Robinson, the London-based Globe has been expanding into the U.S. and looking beyond its traditional sync business. McIntosh's McIntosh Films has now partnered with the Globe Originals arm on what the two companies described as “a bold slate of music-driven feature films.”

	The firms, which previously partnered on Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, said they were “in active development on a slate,” mentioning several projects. Falling, written and directed by BAFTA-winning filmmaker Dominic Savage, has Simone Ashley,  Evan Peters and  Sam Claflin attached and is described as “a modern-day love story developed in close collaboration with acclaimed music producer and composer  Marius de Vries.”Dusty vs Dusty, a new twist on the biopic, will explore identity, artistry and self-creation, with two actors set to portray Dusty Springfield, with producer Kate Driver attached. The project is the brainchild of Sophie Edelstein  and is co-written by  Emma-Jane Unsworth.And Annie Oakley Hanging, called a “fully music-driven feature ” and “a rebellious love story set in the wild American frontier,” will feature an original soundtrack created by Dan Smith, songwriter and lead singer of Bastille, and  Ralph Pelleymounter, songwriter and lead singer of To Kill a King.

	The projects “bring together Globe Originals' access to world-class artists, composers and music catalogue with McIntosh Films' track record in distinctive cinema,” the partners said. Globe Originals' mission is to develop films with music as the creative engine, “opening opportunities for artists in new avenues.”


	“These are films where music isn't ornamental — it's structural,” McIntosh emphasized. “Globe Originals creates an extraordinary bridge between artists and filmmakers, and this slate reflects a shared ambition to make cinema that feels emotionally and culturally alive.” Said Marc Robinson, president, Globe Originals: “There is huge opportunity to bring together the worlds of music and film — and this partnership is designed to do just that. Working with Shannon and McIntosh Films allows us to develop projects where artists, filmmakers and composers collaborate from the very beginning to create truly special audio and visual experiences.”

The legendary U.S. skier celebrated her third gold medal by nodding to a track from "The Life of a Showgirl."


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Mikaela Shiffrin's story of redemption is one of the greatest tales of Olympic glory at this year's Winter Games in Italy. The celebrated athlete with the most World Cup wins of any alpine skier in history, man or woman, locked down an elusive third gold medal this week when she won in the slalom, an emotional milestone she dedicated to her beloved dad, who passed away six years ago.

	In addition to some well-deserved champagne and her first ever espresso martini, the GOAT skier commemorated the moment by posting a pic from her winning run on Wednesday (Feb. 18) on Instagram along with a quote from Taylor Swift‘s The Life of a Showgirl track “Ruin the Friendship.” The song about regrets and risks not taken features the line “My advice is always ruin the friendship,” which Shiffrin included in the caption, catching the eye of fellow champion Swift.


	In the comments, Swift responded “HISTORIC,” along with three golden medal emoji. The quote was apt considering that after her win — her first medal since scoring a silver in the combined at the 2018 games in Pyeongchang following an 0-8 string of loses at the Winter Games — Shiffrin talked about pushing away the criticism and keeping her eyes on the prize. 


	“It's been so long that I've felt tired of questions that don't feel like they line up with the reality of our sport,” she said after scoring gold. “And in order to do this today, I kind of needed to accept the possibility that those questions would keep coming. It was like, just don't resist it. Just live in my own moment.”

	











	Later, Shiffrin reposted the image on her Story, along with a snippet of the song and, a few slides later, another repost of the original image with her shocked response to the Swift shoutout, which read, “Ummmm,” followed by a series of starstruck and welling eyes emoji. 


	It's not the first time Shiffrin has fangirled about Swift. She and her U.S. Ski teammates attended a Denver Eras Tour show in July 2023. Swift has also been busy from afar supporting the American athletes, narrating a promo video introducing the U.S. figure skaters — glorious gold medal winner Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito — and sending a message of support to all the athletes before last week's opening ceremony.


	She also got into the conversation after gold medal winning skier Breezy Johnson got engaged on the slopes at the games, where fiancé Connor Watkins was waiting at the finish line of the Super-G race with an engagement ring in a wooden box engraved with one of Johnson's favorite Swift lyrics. 


	The engraving from Swift's The Tortured Poets Department song “The Alchemy” read: “Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?” Swift, as she does, responded with a quote from another lyric from the song in the replies, writing, “Where's the trophy? He just comes running over to me,” along with “CONGRATULATIONS!” And now, it seems, according to Johnson, the singer is absolutely invited to the wedding, if she can make it. Gold all around.

“Strip Law,” like the ideal Las Vegas experience, flies by in a blur. I mean that mostly as a compliment, considering creator Cullen Crawford's animated series — about a stodgy attorney who, to better serve his debased Sin City clientele, reinvents himself as a courtroom showman — aspires to be little more than a pleasing distraction. 

Sure, given the state of things, it could function as an allegory for America: The same outrageous, all-consuming ruckus that once made The Strip a no-brains-allowed vacation destination has spread beyond the desert oasis to sports bars and living rooms across the country. Now that citizens can stare dumbfounded into the same distracting bright lights (and gambling gateways) via ever-present screens, the whole of the United States has essentially transformed into the hellscape once confined to Nevada's southern tip.

But Netflix‘s original comedy (produced by Underground and Titmouse Inc.) isn't interested in allegories. Not really. It's interested in spectacle, absurdity, and laughs, and it's invested in holding your attention, despite ample temptations elsewhere. Over the course of its 10-episode first season, it does just enough to earn all four, making it an odd little success for anyone in need of an escape.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






To its credit, “Strip Law” wastes no time setting expectations. Clocking in under 40 seconds, the opening title sequence tells you everything you need to know as it races through an introduction to the show's (slightly) heightened setting. A night out in Vegas. Glowing sign after glowing sign. There's the Canadian nightclub, “Calgary Calgary,” a hot dog stand in Old Vegas named “Ye Olde Hotte Dogue,” and a local grocer called “SeXXXual Grocery Store” (complete with a picture of suggestive plums and a sign with just the words, “Big Melons”). Ads are everywhere, whether it's a billboard for Circumcisions by Elvis (“Let the King do his thing”) or Carrot Bottom Live (a topless carrot — there's no torso — with two orange sticks for legs and a disturbing butt primed for the juicer).

Even the cast is introduced via marketing posters. Lincoln Gumb (voiced by Adam Scott) and Sheila Flambe (Janelle James) share a banner looming over a seedy streetcorner, a fitting overture for an odd couple whose unique attributes complement each other perfectly. Gumb, the son of a heralded local attorney, knows the ins and outs of the law well, but his monotone presentation flat-lines in front of a judge and jury. He needs a little pizzazz, a little style, a little showmanship to connect with a city that's grown accustomed to 24/7 entertainment.

 










Enter Sheila, a street magician blackballed by the local boys club who wows Lincoln with her tips-only act. “I've got my mom's lawyer smarts,” Lincoln says. “You've got her razzle-matazzle.” Together, they can book clients and win cases within the… unique environs of a Vegas courtroom. (One judge doles out damages with a Dr. Evil impression. Another gets beheaded with a guillotine.) It's a crazy gambit for a crazy world, and it just might work!

OK, not always, but the premise and setting form a sturdy-enough foundation for the madness to come. With more than a wink toward its TV genre — the pilot is titled “Finally, a Show About Lawyers” and the finale is deranged “Franklin & Bash” fan-fiction (or anti-fan fiction?) — “Strip Law” knows it's the ridiculous cousin to “Night Court” and “Ally McBeal.” But rather than let meta references guide the plot, the half-hour sitcom takes off on wild tangents that are easy to get lost in, even when that's not the main intention.

Everything contributes to the show's unrelenting pace, which is overwhelming no matter how closely you track the shenanigans. A little more time and attention toward character development could help viewers form a connection with the cast (who, led by voice-acting MVPs James and Stephen Root, do a bang-up job elevating the farce and landing their punchlines). Plus, seeding stories with personal growth needn't get in the way of “Strip Law's” modus operandi of nonstop chaos — in an ungrounded animated sitcom, they don't even have to age, let alone change. We just need something substantial to hold onto amid all the swirling sands.

 










Still, an unchecked imagination has its own charms. When the “Strip Law” title brightens the top of a taxi cab to close its credits sequence, the ad's tagline states, “Proudly made by real, non-computer human beings.” As much is clear in the vivid animation, layered jokes, and peculiar fixations — an endearing combination that heightens what could've been a forgettable series.

While I'm sure artificial intelligence can churn out something as eerily repulsive as Episode 6's haunting spoof of The California Raisins — Nevada Grown Dates, whose hyper-sexualized artistic rendering and regular presence on local TV is credited for Vegas residents' “near-constant state of aggressive horniness” — it wouldn't know to go there in the first place, and it definitely wouldn't find the humor Crawford & Co. lace into the freakishly indelible parody. 

Just like the city it satirizes, “Strip Law” works just fine, so long as you're ready for the trip.

“Strip Law” premieres Friday, February 20 on Netflix. All 10 episodes will be released at once.

	The Supreme Court struck down large swaths of President Donald Trump's international tariff agenda on Friday, severely curtailing one of the president's signature second-term policy projects. 


	In a 6-3 ruling, the court determined that Trump and his administration had exceeded their tariff powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA,) a 1977 law that allows the president to regulate certain aspects of international trade during a declared national emergency. The court did not prescribe any requirements or methods through which the administration would be forced to roll back the hundreds of punitive tariffs it has imposed on trade partners around the globe, but made abundantly clear that Trump was operating outside of the law in doing so. 


	“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion released by the court. “In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”

	











	“The Government reads IEEPA to give the President power to unilaterally impose unbounded tariffs and change them at will. That view would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy,” Roberts added. “It is also telling that in IEEPA's half century of existence, no President has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.” 


	Roberts pointed to Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, which bestows the power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,” directly in the hands of Congress. 


	“We claim no special competence in matters of economics or foreign affairs,” Roberts added. “We claim only, as we must, the limited role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution. Fulfilling that role, we hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.”

	Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed during his first term, agreed that Congress needed to authorize Trump's tariffs. “Most major decisions affecting the rights and responsibilities of the American people (including the duty to pay taxes and tariffs) are funneled through the legislative process for a reason,” he wrote in his concurring opinion. “The deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the Nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people's elected representatives, not just that of one faction or man. There, deliberation tempers impulse, and compromise hammers disagreements into workable solutions.”

	











	Trump was reportedly told of the decision while meeting with governors at the White House, and called it a “disgrace.”


	Trump announced a sweeping tariff package at a White House event last April, imposing a series of steep import taxes on nations around the world. The president has continued to use tariffs or the threat of tariffs to bully other nations into complying with his demands. Economists have widely bashed Trump's tariff policy, which effectively amounts to a tax on American consumers. “This is a win for the wallets of every American consumer,” Senate Minority Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in response to the ruling.

	Trump has continued to defend the tariffs, however, and seemed confident on Thursday that the Supreme Court would rule in his favor. “Without tariffs, what would you do? You know what? Everybody would be bankrupt, the whole country would be bankrupt,” he said at an event in Georgia. “I've been waiting [for this decision] forever. The language is clear that I have the right to do it as president.”


	The Supreme Court disagrees.

	More details have come to light regarding Shia LaBeouf‘s recent arrest in New Orleans, in which he was charged with two counts of simple battery after hitting two people.


	The actor was celebrating Mardi Gras at a bar in the French Quarter earlier this week, when a fight broke out after police say he was accused of “causing a disturbance.”


	According to a New Orleans police report obtained by The Associated Press, LaBeouf also shouted homophobic slurs at the people he was fighting with, yelling, “These f–––––s put me in jail,” and said he's a Catholic. A representative for the actor did not immediately return a request for comment. 


	The report stated that LaBeouf, 39, “became irate and aggressive throughout the night” and hit multiple people with a closed fist at the Royal Street Inn & R Bar, near the historic French Quarter.

	Jeffrey Damnit, who police identified as Jeffrey Klein in the incident report, said he was one of the people struck by LaBeouf. “He hit me, he connected a few times with punches, he pushed me a few times,” Damnit claimed. He said he was wearing eye makeup and lipstick at the time and that he believes his appearance motivated LaBeouf's attack.

	











	“That's just somehow something that set him off, angered him and gave him a direction for his anger,” said Damnit. “This guy wants me to be dead because I wear makeup. It's a screwed up thing.” He alleged the actor had pushed him from behind earlier in the night, yelling homophobic slurs and threatening his life.

	











	According to AP, a video shows a shirtless LaBeouf shoving one person to the ground and striking another individual in the face, which a police report states caused his “nose to possibly dislocate.” 


	In another video recorded by Damnit, LaBeouf reportedly faces the camera and appears to mouth a homophobic slur while police detain him. The police report stated he continued to repeat the slur throughout the arrest.

	Following his arrest, police took LaBeouf to the hospital, where he was treated for unknown injuries. He was arrested and charged upon his release. Hours after being released from jail, LaBeouf was back out on the streets of New Orleans. At night, he was seen dancing on the street with what appeared to be his arrest papers hanging from his mouth. 


	Prior to the various reports citing LaBeouf's behavior in New Orleans, three production sources told Rolling Stone that the actor's increasingly erratic behavior sparked concern on the set of his upcoming film, The Rooster Prince, last fall. “He was completely wild,” one production member said. “I don't think he's stable. I don't know that he's been stable for a while.”

At the Berlin Film Festival, the Oscar-nominated director of 'It Was Just an Accident' declined his long-delayed Golden Bear and put the focus on Iranians killed and detained in a brutal crackdown.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Oscar-nominated Iranian director Jafar Panahi (It Was Just an Accident) used a rare public appearance at the Berlin Film Festival to denounce what he described as an “unbelievable crime” unfolding in his home country, as independent filmmakers mounted a parallel campaign to spotlight artists killed and detained in a sweeping crackdown by the Islamic Republic.


	In an on-stage discussion with The Hollywood Reporter's European Bureau Chief Scott Roxborough in Berlin on Thursday, Panahi said the festival wanted to retroactively present him with the Berlinale Golden Bear honor he won in 2015 for Taxi [the director, under a travel ban at the time, was unable to attend in person]. He said he declined, wanting to keep attention fixed on the Iranian regime's violent repression of protestors, which has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.

	“They wanted to give me the Golden Bear I had won for Taxi, and I refused it, because of the situation in Iran,” Panahi said. “An unbelievable crime has happened. Mass murder has happened. People are not even allowed to mourn their loved ones…The regime is forcing them into these acts. People do not want violence. They avoid violence. It is the regime that forces violence upon them.”


	Panahi has long resisted the label of political filmmaker, even as his work and his life have been shaped by the state's response to dissent. The current moment, he suggested, has made silence impossible.


	“Artists do not want to be politically active by themselves. It is the regimes and governments that force them into political engagement,” he said. “Artists try to avoid being politically active, but socially engaged artists cannot stay silent about what happens in society. That is why so many artists, actors and actresses, and superstars have stood with the people of Iran and now face consequences. We have many artists in prison — documentary filmmakers as well. During previous protests and demonstrations, filmmakers were arrested. When an artist is silent, they are complicit in violence.”

	











	Panahi's It Was Just an Accident, was written after the director spent seven months in Iran's notorious Evin Prison and was inspired by the stories of the political prisoners he met inside. The film follows a group of former prisoners who kidnap the man they believe to be their torturer, debating whether to kill or forgive him.


	“I did not know I wanted to make a film about this,” Panahi said. “But when I left prison, when the doors opened and I walked out and looked back at the huge walls behind me, I thought about those still inside. It became a weight on my shoulders. After weeks and months, it grew heavier, and I decided to make a film about them.”


	To render that world authentically, he enlisted several of his fellow inmates, including political activist Mehdi Mahmoudian, to co-write the screenplay. Mahmoudian was recently re-arrested for condemning the actions of Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei and is currently out on bail. 


	“Mehdi Mahmoudian has spent nearly a quarter of his life in prison. He had more contact with people inside than anyone else. He knew the torturers very well — how they think, what their ideology is. That was a great help to me.”


	In December, while touring with It Was Just an Accident outside Iran, Panahi was sentenced, in abstentia, to a year in prison and another travel ban, for  “propaganda activities” against the government. He said following the Oscars — It Was Just an Accident is nominated for best international feature and best original screenplay — he will return to Iran. 

	











	“Half of my existence is in Iran — my family, my mother, my sister, my brother, my son, my friends, and the society I work for. If I did not return, I would betray what I believe. As a socially engaged filmmaker, my duty is to stand with the people I belong to. A doctor can save lives anywhere. But my cinema exists there. I must go back and make films there. That is the right thing to do. I will return, 100 percent, because of who I am and because of my beliefs.”


	His remarks in Berlin unfolded alongside a coordinated effort by the Iranian Independent Filmmakers Association (IIFMA) to draw attention to artists killed and detained in the latest wave of repression. The association, founded in 2023 in the wake of the Woman Life Freedom movement, returned to the Berlinale with a stand, a panel and a flashmob on Potsdamer Platz.


	At a panel in Berlin, IIFMA board member Mahshid Zamani screened footage compiled from social media and material sent directly from Iran documenting the Jan. 8 and 9 crackdown.


	“Each frame captures the courage, hope and longing that define the Iranian spirit while also shedding light on the brutal realities imposed by a repressive, fanatic, Islamic, terrorist regime,” he said. “Tens of artists were murdered while bravely standing up for their beliefs in the uprising of January 8 and 9.”


	Zamani then read aloud the names of musicians, filmmakers, actors and other arts professionals confirmed killed or detained, asking the audience to applaud each one. Later, IIFMA members staged a flashmob reenacting rows of body bags in Berlin's festival district in commemoration.

	











	According to IIFMA, the following arts and culture professionals have been killed:


	Ahmad Abbasi – filmmakerShokoufeh Abdi – photographerMelika Dastyab – musicianPouya Faragardi – musicianShabnam Ferdowsi – puppeteer, graphic designerJavad Ganji – filmmakerSorena Golgoun – musicianYaser Modir-Rousta – musicianSanam Pourbabaei – musicianSahba Rashtian – painter and animation directorFoad Safayi – musicianMehdi Salahshour – sculptorZohre Shamaeizade – script supervisor and voice actorMohammed “Shahou” Shirazi – singerMostafa Rabeti – filmmakerReyhaneh Yousefi – actorAmir-Ali Zarei – musician, art student

Stephen Colbert opened The Late Show by celebrating the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, noting that “finally someone, anyone” was being held accountable for their actions. 


	“Let's hear it for British justice,” Colbert said to cheers from the late-night show audience. “Which is better than American justice because it comes with frilly wigs.”


	Mountbatten-Windsor, the British royal formerly known as Prince Andrew before being stripped of his titles by his brother King Charles, was arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The arrest is related to recent revelations in the Epstein files that suggest Mountbatten-Windsor sent trade reports to Jeffrey Epstein in 2010, not to ongoing allegations of sexual misconduct.


	“Technically this arrest isn't about any charges of pedophilia,” Colbert noted. “U.K. authorities busted Andrew for ‘misconduct in public office.' Which is defined as ‘seriously willful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities of the public office held.' Which is not only not illegal in the United States, it was Trump's campaign slogan.”

	Colbert then recounted how “back here in the colonies” Donald Trump held the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace. “Which is kind of like the UN except instead of passing binding resolutions, you pass a greasy bag of money to Donald Trump,” Colbert quipped. 


	He noted that a seat on the board costs $1 billion in cash. “So the board works kind of like a strip club,” Colbert added. “Cash only and Donald Trump will never leave.” 

	











	Later in his monologue, Colbert recounted Barack Obama's recent comments about how aliens are real. When asked about the comments, Trump replied, “I don't know if they're real or not.” Before showing a photo of Trump with Epstein, Colbert remarked, “While Trump never talks about meeting aliens, we do know he's had close encounters with predators.”


	Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his titles by King Charles III in October following revelations about his relationship with Epstein. Earlier this month, the British monarch forced his brother to vacate his longtime home at Royal Lodge near Windsor Castle.

	The former prince has continually denied any wrongdoing; however, he was mentioned and pictured several times in the 3 million-plus pages of documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice recently. One of the mentions of Mountbatten-Windsor is a photograph of him with a woman who appears to be Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with him as a teenager.


	Giuffre was one of Epstein's most prominent accusers and also filed a high-profile sexual-assault lawsuit against Andrew, which was settled in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide last April.

	Her family released a statement following Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest. “At last, today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” her siblings said in a statement. “On behalf of our sister, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, we extend our gratitude to the U.K.'s Thames Valley Police for their investigation, and the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you.”


	While other countries are taking the Epstein scandal seriously, the U.S. has been mostly unaffected. The latest tranche of Epstein files released by the Justice Department has sent shockwaves through the international community. Foreign governments, businesses, universities, and cultural institutions are investigating those with ties to the notorious sex criminal. Powerful figures around the world have been forced to step down from influential positions amid revelations that they were a part of Epstein's network. Meanwhile Trump — a longtime friend of Epstein's whose name allegedly appears in the files over a million times — and other figures working within or tied to his administration seem to not only hang above the fray, but enjoy the protection of the American justice system.

The Boss' beef with the Trump administration is cooking.  


													By
												

	Lars Brandle



	The United States simply isn't big enough for two bosses. That's one takeaway from a new missive from the White House, which has dismissed Bruce Springsteen as a “loser” with “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and an atrophying brain, doing so by way of a statement.


	With the announcement that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will head back out on the Land of Hope and Dreams American tour, the White House is chiming in. Only this time, the titles of several choice Springsteen work are woven in for added effect.

	











	“When this loser Springsteen comes back home to his own City of Ruins in his head, he'll realize his Glory Days are behind him and his fans have left him Out in the Street, putting him in a Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out because he has a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his brain,” reads the message from White House comms director Steven Cheung, issued to Politico.


Billboard has reached out to Springsteen for comment.


	The iconic rocker had laid into the Trump administration in January with his anti-ICE song, “Streets of Minneapolis,” inspired by what the Rock Hall-inducted singer called the “state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis” in a statement at the time.


	Specifically, the song called out the killings of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti, both 37, who were gunned down in Minneapolis by immigration enforcement troops in the midst of the so-called Operation Metro Surge enforcement action that has seen thousands of border patrol and ICE agents descend on the city.

	











Springsteen found himself back at No. 1 with “Streets of Minneapolis,” which debuted atop Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart dated Feb. 7. It was the highest selling song in the United States for the week, even with it being available for just two days of the tracking cycle.


	The White House had words at the time, one of which was to snub Springsteen as “irrelevant.”


	Springsteen is many things, but a “loser” — as the administration has referred to him — isn't one of them. Across a 40 year-plus career, the rocker has collected 20 Grammys, won an Oscar and a Tony, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, received a Kennedy Center Honor and, in November 2016, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And his album sales are north of 150 million, reps say.


	After 129 shows, the Springsteen and E Street Band 2023-25 tour grossed $729.7 million and sold 4.9 million tickets, according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, for the biggest result of his career.


	The rock legend embarks on his 20-date arena outing at Minneapolis' Target Center on March 31, and ends with one stadium show on May 27 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.


	“We are living through dark, disturbing and dangerous times, but do not despair — the cavalry is coming!” said Springsteen in a statement Tuesday (Feb. 17) when announcing the forthcoming tour.


	He added, “We will be rocking your town in celebration and in defense of America — American democracy, American freedom, our American Constitution and our sacred American dream — all of which are under attack by our wannabe king and his rogue government in Washington, D.C. Everyone, regardless of where you stand or what you believe in, is welcome — so come on out and join the United Free Republic of E Street Nation for an American spring of Rock n' Rebellion! I'll see you there!”

The 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Euphoria' actor died at age 53 following a battle with ALS.


							By

Senior Editor, Digital


	Following the death of Eric Dane, Sam Levinson, Ashton Kutcher, Nina Dobrev, Alyssa Milano, Kevin McKidd, James Pickens Jr., Michael Grassi, Selma Blair and Alexander Ludwig are among those in Hollywood paying tribute to the actor.


	Dane, known for his role as plastic surgeon Mark Sloan, aka “McSteamy,” in Grey's Anatomy, Cal Jacobs in Euphoria and commanding officer Tom Chandler in The Last Ship, died Thursday afternoon at age 53 following a battle with ALS. He initially revealed publicly in April 2025 that he had been diagnosed with the rare degenerative disease.

	“He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world,” his reps shared in a statement. “Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time.”


	Levinson, the creator of Euphoria, said in a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter, “I'm heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend Eric. Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric's family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing.”

	











	The official Instagram account for Euphoria and HBO Max wrote in a joint post, “We are deeply saddened by the news of Eric Dane's passing. He was incredibly talented and HBO was fortunate to have worked with him on three seasons of Euphoria. Our thoughts are with his loved ones during this difficult time.”


	McKidd, who played Dr. Owen Hunt on Grey's Anatomy, wrote on his Instagram Story, “Rest in Peace Buddy.”


	Pickens Jr., who also worked with Dane on Grey's Anatomy, playing Dr. Richard Webber, wrote on Instagram, “Rest in Peace.” Sarah Drew, who played Dr. April Kepner, also shared a similar message on her Instagram Story.


	ABC and 20th Television released a joint statement, which reads, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of Eric Dane. His remarkable talent and unforgettable presence on Grey's Anatomy left a lasting impact on audiences around the world, and his courage and grace during his battle with ALS inspired so many. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as the many fans whose lives were touched by his work.”


	Milano, who worked alongside Dane on Charmed, shared in a tribute, “I can't stop seeing that spark in Eric's eye right before he'd say something that would either make you spit out your drink or rethink your entire perspective. He had a razor-sharp sense of humor. He loved the absurdity of things. He loved catching people off guard.”


	“And when it came to his daughters and Rebecca, everything in him softened. He carried them with him even in rooms where they weren't present. You could see it in the way his voice changed when he said their names. A breathtakingly beautiful family,” Milano continued. “The spark. The mischief. The tenderness he kept guarded but never totally hidden.”

	











	Dobrev, who starred in 2022's Redeeming Love with Dane, wrote in a tribute on her Instagram Story, “Heartbroken to hear about the passing of Eric. He was warm, generous, prepared, and so passionate about what he did. He led with kindness and made everyone on our set feel seen. ALS is a cruel and unforgiving disease. May his memory inspire more research, awareness, and progress toward a cure. He will be deeply missed. Sending love and heartfelt condolensces to his family.” 


	Grassi, the creator of Brilliant Minds, shared in a statement, “Eric was a TV icon who lit up our screens for decades and it was the greatest honor of my career to work with him. Not only was he a tremendous talent, he was also generous, kind and brave. I'm thinking about his family and loved ones today. He will be missed.” Dane guest-starred in a second-season episode centered on ALS.


	DeMane Davis, producing director and executive producer of Brilliant Minds, also shared a statement. “Watching Eric Dane do what he loved — act in his final role on Brilliant Minds — was an honor. He adored being on set, cracking jokes in-between takes. Our crew and cast loved him. It was an gift to witness his talent, determination and joy,” Davis said. 


	Ludwig, who starred in 2024's Bad Boys: Ride or Die with Dane, wrote on his Instagram Story, “Ugh this hurts so much. Will miss you Eric and loved our time together. You were a joy to work with.”


	Blair, who appeared with Dane in an episode of Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane in 2000, shared a video of the sitcom on Instagram and wrote, “I love you. And yours.”

	











	Travis Van Winkle, the actor's Last Ship co-star, wrote on his Instagram Story: “I learned so much from Eric. He was a great man. I'm sad to see him go in this way. I'm sending love to his family. Thanks for the memories my friend.”

The actress explained her decision on the “Broad Ideas” podcast last November, saying that by calling off their divorce, she hoped to teach their daughters, Billie, 15, and Georgia, 13, to be there for their family even “when times are at their worst.”

“We tell them, ‘We show up for people no matter what. He is our family. He is your father,'” Gayheart shared.

The mom of two also said that throughout Dane's diagnosis and navigating their relationship, her main focus was on the girls' well-being and that they felt “taken care of” even though “things are hard and sad and bad.”

The former couple wed in 2004 and after 13 years of marriage, the “Jawbreaker” star filed for divorce in 2018. 

Last March, they called off their divorce after seven years of separation. One month later, the “Grey's Anatomy” star went public with his ALS diagnosis. 

During the November interview, Gayheart, 54, also detailed their “super complicated” dynamic and admitted that she wasn't sure if she was handling the situation “the wrong way or right way” by withdrawing the filing.

“I'm just showing up and trying to be there for [my kids]. I guess time will tell,” she said.

In a vulnerable essay for The Cut published last December, Gayheart said her and Dane's “love may not be romantic, but it's a familial love.”

She also clarified that the two “haven't lived in the same home for eight years.”

Gayheart addressed that they both have had romantic relationships with other people — she's been linked to billionaire Peter Morton and he dated filmmaker Janell Shirtcliff last June — but they regularly see each other for family gatherings.

“This year, the girls and I have spent a lot of time at Eric's house, which is about a 12-minute drive away from our home,” the essay continued. “We have a lot of meals together. We do a lot of drop-by visits — well, I don't just drop by. I always call and say, ‘I'm coming up the hill' or ‘I'm dropping Georgia off.'”

Dane passed away on Thursday, 10 months after announcing his ALS diagnosis. He was 53 years old.

Dane's family shared in a statement to People, “With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS.”

“Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight,” the statement continued. “He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always.”

	Following the news of Eric Dane‘s death, fans, costars, and Hollywood peers of the veteran actor have shared tributes in remembrance of his work and fight against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Sam Levinson, Alyssa Milano, Maria Shriver, Ashton Kutcher, and more honored Dane in heartfelt messages.


	Dane died at the age of 53, just 10 months after he shared his diagnosis with the public. “Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight,” his family said in a statement. “He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always.” 


	In a statement to Variety, Euphoria creator Sam Levinson, wrote, “I'm heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend Eric. Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric's family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing.” Dane starred in the HBO drama, delivering one of the most menacing portrayals as the father of Nate Jacobs (played by Jacob Elordi).

	











	Milano, who worked with Dane on the WB series Charmed, shared an Instagram photo of the actor alongside his wife, Rebecca Gayheart, and their two daughters. “I can't stop seeing that spark in Eric's eye right before he'd say something that would either make you spit out your drink or rethink your entire perspective,” she wrote in the caption. “And when it came to his daughters and Rebecca, everything in him softened. He carried them with him even in rooms where they weren't present. You could see it in the way his voice changed when he said their names. A breathtakingly beautiful family. The spark. The mischief. The tenderness he kept guarded but never totally hidden.” Milano added, “My heart is with the people who were lucky enough to be his home.”

	Maria Shriver, whose publishing imprint, The Open Field, is set to publish a memoir written by Dane, titled Book of Days: A Memoir in Moments, said that she was “heartbroken by this devastating news.” She continued, “He was so heroic the way he handled his diagnosis. He used his voice to let the world know what it was like living with ALS.” Shriver said the actor told her he wanted his family to “know how much he loved them, and he wanted to leave them a story they could be proud of.” She added, “Godspeed, Eric. It was an honor to know you, and we will honor your story.”

	In his own post, Ashton Kutcher, wrote on X: “The Franklin strip fanatics fantasy football league will miss Mr. Eric Dane. We know you'll be watching from the booth. Miss you, buddy. Let's keep fighting the fight to solve ALS.”


	Paul Walter Hauser, who featured alongside Dane in the 2023 crime thriller Americana, shared a photo of the two together and said, “We tried to book gigs, we tried to laugh at the pain and we tried to stay sober. I'm glad we got to play together in Americana. I love you, man. I wish we had more time. Enjoy the arms of Father God. I'll see you again”


	John Stamos wrote in a tribute, “RIP, Buddy. Me and @realericdane played brothers years ago in a beautiful movie called, Wedding Wars. Good guy. Too soon.”

A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms, just like the novellas on which it is based, derives its narrative strength by being told entirely from the perspective of Ser Duncan The Tall (Peter Claffey). Gone are the location jumps and gnarled ensembles that pack full hours of Game Of Thrones and House Of The Dragon. This series appreciates the virtues of smallness, that intimacy can reveal a world far more nimbly than scale. One half hour from the eyes of Ser Dunk is all there is and all there needs to be.

This creative direction has its obstacles: On the page, we read Dunk's thoughts, know his memories as they spring to mind, and infer from those he represses the parts of his life he'd rather not dwell on. On the screen, the showrunner and this episode's co-writer, Ira Parker, must externalize these thoughts and memories in live action, just in case some viewers may have missed all the finer nuances that add up to the great wonder that is Ser Dunk The Lunk.

“In The Name Of The Mother,” the penultimate episode in Parker's agreeably earthy and entertaining debut season, begins and ends with the fateful Trial Of Seven, in which Ser Dunk faces his accuser, Prince Aerion “Brightflame” Targaryen (Finn Bennett), who just one night before tormented an innocent puppeteer and paid for it with a few fists and feet to his royal personage. Aerion rallies his father, Prince Maekar (Sam Spruell), the three Kingsguard who attended his family at the Ashford Meadow tourney, his drunkard brother Daeron (Henry Ashton), and the treacherous Ser Steffon Fossoway (Edward Ashley) to fight against Dunk—who, as we saw last week, had a much tougher time rallying heroes to his cause than the realm's royal house. 

Yet true company arrives, thanks to his squire, Aegon “Egg” Targaryen (Dexter Soll Ansell). He brings Sers Baratheon (Daniel Ings), Beesbury (Danny Collins), Hardyng (Ross Anderson), and Rhysling (William Houston) to fight under Dunk's star-lit standard, joining brave Raymun Fossoway (Shaun Thomas), who offered his sword in service to Dunk and was anointed in the mud. Rounding out Dunk's six champions—to the tourney audience's confusion and/or awe—is Prince Baelor “Breakspear” Targaryen (Bertie Carvel), who declares for Dunk in an act of chivalry so enormous that it could only end in doom. Remember: In Westeros, virtue has a half-life of hours.

It's a thematic point that perhaps explains why this week's episode, so named for a knight's vow to protect the innocent (and a rallying cry for Ser Arlan Of Pennytree, as it happens), takes the added measure of flashing back to a fateful day in Dunk's past just before judgment comes crashing into his present. It's a risky creative choice to pause ser's trial at its most dramatic moment just to show us how Dunk learned how to fight dirty in, as George R.R. Martin's prose puts it, “the shadowy wynds and crooked alleys” of King's Landing, where Dunk grew up. With thorough detail, we're shown what compels Dunk to gather strength enough to beat Prince Aerion, twenty minutes of screentime to express this one line from the novella: “[Aerion] could vanquish Ser Duncan The Tall, but not Dunk Of Flea Bottom.” 

And so, with a swing of Aerion's morningstar, Dunk is sent into a brief, muddy sleep, remembering his last days as a thief in King's Landing. We see him, roughly thirteen years ago, scavenging steel and leather from the fallen knights and renegades upon the Redgrass Field, where the last battle of the first Blackfyre Rebellion was decided. (You'll recall some of its finer details were discussed in song by Egg during “The Squire.”) It was there that Princes Baelor and Maekar formed the hammer and anvil that smashed Daemon I Blackfyre's forces and secured King Daeron's rule for a while longer—now a graveyard and primary source of income for Dunk (Bamber Todd) and Rafe (Chloe Lea). “We'll all be plundering that tomb for a dragon's age,” a fence grumbles to the kids when they bring him their findings. 

They're not just scraping for food; Rafe wants to ferry Dunk across the Narrow Sea for a fresh start in the Free Cities. Their chances of making this lateral move dim in the narrow causeways of Flea Bottom, where drunks and thieves like City Watchman Alester (Edward Davis) bully lowborn like Dunk and Rafe for sport. It's impressive how foul and claustrophobic this part of Flea Bottom looks: Men scream as surgery is done on them in the open; women weep in corners; people stagger into each other, leaving themselves vulnerable to pickpocketing or, as Rafe later learns to Dunk's woe, a strategically thrust dagger. Even the one place Dunk and Rafe find relative peace is below the streets, lower in the world still. 

“What if this is the best there is?” wee Dunk asks his companion, who responds: “That would be quite sad.” Even at this late hour, it's a neat bit of groundwork for Dunk's world philosophy, why protecting people with his size and strength matters to him, and why Ser Arlan (Danny Webb), for all his failings, appealed to him so. “You want a family?” Rafe says. “Go out there and get a family.” We know he does, and now we have the additional knowledge that his found families—made with Ser Arlan and, one day, with Egg—are built on her memory.

Was this time out worthwhile? It depends on your point of view. For those who want literal world-building where this series otherwise takes a subtler approach, “In The Name Of The Mother” provides us the first glimpse at the Blackfyre Rebellion—or at least its aftermath. Considering how little of this Westerosi history was mapped out when Martin wrote The Hedge Knight, filling these gaps brings welcome heft and history. This episode should serve future seasons exploring the many complex Targaryen rifts and the lingering revolts spawned from them. It also reiterates a pervasive theme in this franchise, courtesy of Rafe's quick tale of fellow roughs Pudding and Cedric: Payment for past wrongs always comes with compound interest—if not now, then when one least expects it. “No one forgets shit,” she says. “You hurt someone, they hurt you back.” 

For folks here to see some rock-'em-sock-'em knighttime action, still amped up from Prince Baelor's declaration for all that is just and good last week, this pause will chafe. Everything we learn from this flashback is already present in the series: Dunk seeks family where he can; he was taught to soften his edges for those he cares about; he can be provoked to violence by unchecked cruelty. We've seen all this, know all this. This late into the series, it feels like padding. Still, it's well-directed, well-written padding, rife with narrative echoing: Ser Alran blorfs before protecting Dunk, just as Dunk blorfs before standing up to Prince Aerion; and wee Dunk hoists Ser Arlan's penny-hilted sword just as Egg takes it for practice years later. These added textures of Dunk's origin are appreciated, but at this defining moment? They scrape the nerves of folks spoiling to see the outcome of Dunks' Trial Of Seven. 

Which brings us back to the present, where Dunk rallies with the few commanding words from Ser Arlan we've yet to hear: “Get up.” Up is where Dunk goes, though not without effort (that lance through his side meekened him even before he was unhorsed). The scope of this fight, fittingly, leans on subjectivity instead of choreography. Here, Dunk's point of view is severely diminished by that narrow slit in his helm, and later, one of his eyes is closed shut, so we miss the peripheral thrills one might expect from this fracas (such as Ser Lyonel laughing his way through Maekar's defenses, the Fossoway cousins letting off long-fermenting steam between them, etc). We do see the only moment that counts: Prince Aerion dropping his dragon's facade under Dunk's relentless pummelling, yielding his accusations before all in Ashford Meadow. (Had he not thrown in the towel, would Dunk have risked killing a prince?) 

What we don't see is Maekar's blow to his older brother's head, which crushes Baelor's helm and removes another good man from the realm—one whose life might have changed much for Westeros had it not ended here. The man called “Breakspear” for trouncing the traitor Daemon Blackfyre's armies on the Redgrass Field, who ruled in the name of Daeron “The Good” and would have made a fair and just king himself, dies in service to a hedge knight who reminded him what justice looks like when those who swore to uphold it remember their vows. What might the realm have looked like under the rule of Baelor, second in line to the Iron Throne? We'll never know. In Westeros, much as it is in life, few good deeds go unpunished.

Just two months before actor Eric Dane died on February 19, 2026, the “Grey's Anatomy” and “Euphoria” alum announced he was writing his memoir, titled “Book of Days: A Memoir in Moments.”

Dane, who was 53 at the time of his death, chose to work on his memoir with journalist Maria Shriver's publishing imprint at Penguin Random House, The Open Field. 

According to the book announcement on December 8, Dane wanted to write about the moments in his life that “have meant the most,” including his daughters' births, his first day on the “Grey's Anatomy” set, the day he decided to get sober, how and when he was diagnosed with ALS, “and that hopeful day in the future when ALS is finally cured.”

It's not clear how far along Dane was with his writing, but in a beautiful tribute hours after his death, Shriver said that she is still committed to telling his story. 

It's not clear how far along Dane was with his writing, but in a beautiful tribute hours after his death, Shriver said that she is still committed to telling his story. Hours after his death on February 19, Shriver posted a photo of him on social media and wrote that his death would not keep her imprint from publishing his book. 

“I'm heartbroken by this devastating news about Eric Dane,” she wrote. “What a tragedy. He was so heroic the way he handled his diagnosis. He used his voice to let the world know what it was like living with ALS.”

Shriver continued, “I was honored he chose my publishing imprint to publish his memoir. He told me he wanted his family to know how much he loved them, and he wanted to leave them a story they could be proud of. My love goes out to his family, and to all those battling this cruel disease, as well as all those caring for somone battling it.”

She then confirmed the memoir will not die with him, writing, “Godspeed, Eric. It was an honor to know you, and we will honor your story. ♥️”

When Dane and Shriver announced their publishing partnership in December, she posted on social media how grateful she was that Dane chose to work on his 2026 book with her and her team, writing, “It is indeed an honor to publish @realericdane's new memoir about his account of being diagnosed with ALS and how he is dealing with it.” 

“I'm so humbled and honored that he chose @openfieldbooks to publish his important story,” Shriver continued, calling it “an imprint known for publishing bestselling books that rise above the noise and move humanity forward.”

“I cannot wait for the world to read his story and learn more about his intention and his goals,” she wrote before adding, “Thank you for entrusting me with your story, Eric!”

In a statement about the book to People when it was first announced, Dane said, “I wake up every morning, and I'm immediately reminded that this is real — this illness, this challenge and that's exactly why I'm writing this book.”

Dane added, “I want to capture the moments that shaped me — the beautiful days, the hard ones, the ones I never took for granted — so that if nothing else, people who read it will remember what it means to live with heart. If sharing this helps someone find meaning in their own days, then my story is worth telling.”

Senior Editor, Digital


	Following the death of Eric Dane, Sam Levinson, Shonda Rhimes, Sharon Stone, Ashton Kutcher, Nina Dobrev, Alyssa Milano, Kevin McKidd, James Pickens Jr., Michael Grassi, Selma Blair and Alexander Ludwig are among those in Hollywood paying tribute to the actor.


	Dane, known for his role as plastic surgeon Mark Sloan, aka “McSteamy,” in Grey's Anatomy, Cal Jacobs in Euphoria and commanding officer Tom Chandler in The Last Ship, died Thursday afternoon at age 53 following a battle with ALS. He initially revealed publicly in April 2025 that he had been diagnosed with the rare degenerative disease.

	“He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world,” his reps shared in a statement. “Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time.”


	Levinson, the creator of Euphoria, said in a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter, “I'm heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend Eric. Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric's family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing.”

	











	The official Instagram account for Euphoria and HBO Max wrote in a joint post, “We are deeply saddened by the news of Eric Dane's passing. He was incredibly talented and HBO was fortunate to have worked with him on three seasons of Euphoria. Our thoughts are with his loved ones during this difficult time.”


	Sharon Stone, who joined the upcoming season of Euphoria, posted a tribute on Instagram, “Losing you is losing a treasure my friend. Your spirit lives on in all of us who love you. Godspeed.” 


Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes shared a statement paying tribute to Danes with The Hollywood Reporter, “Eric Dane was a beloved member of the Shondaland and Grey's Anatomy families. He was truly a gifted actor whose portrayal of Dr. Mark Sloan left an indelible mark on the series and on audiences around the world.”She continued, “We are grateful for the artistry, spirit, friendship and humanity he shared with us for so many years. Our hearts are with his family, loved ones, and all who were touched by his work.” 


	McKidd, who played Dr. Owen Hunt on Grey's Anatomy, wrote on his Instagram Story, “Rest in Peace Buddy.”


	Pickens Jr., who also worked with Dane on Grey's Anatomy, playing Dr. Richard Webber, wrote on Instagram, “Rest in Peace.” Sarah Drew, who played Dr. April Kepner, also shared a similar message on her Instagram Story.


	ABC and 20th Television released a joint statement, which reads, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of Eric Dane. His remarkable talent and unforgettable presence on Grey's Anatomy left a lasting impact on audiences around the world, and his courage and grace during his battle with ALS inspired so many. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as the many fans whose lives were touched by his work.”


	Milano, who worked alongside Dane on Charmed, shared in a tribute, “I can't stop seeing that spark in Eric's eye right before he'd say something that would either make you spit out your drink or rethink your entire perspective. He had a razor-sharp sense of humor. He loved the absurdity of things. He loved catching people off guard.”

	











	“And when it came to his daughters and Rebecca, everything in him softened. He carried them with him even in rooms where they weren't present. You could see it in the way his voice changed when he said their names. A breathtakingly beautiful family,” Milano continued. “The spark. The mischief. The tenderness he kept guarded but never totally hidden.”


	Dobrev, who starred in 2022's Redeeming Love with Dane, wrote in a tribute on her Instagram Story, “Heartbroken to hear about the passing of Eric. He was warm, generous, prepared, and so passionate about what he did. He led with kindness and made everyone on our set feel seen. ALS is a cruel and unforgiving disease. May his memory inspire more research, awareness, and progress toward a cure. He will be deeply missed. Sending love and heartfelt condolensces to his family.” 


	Grassi, the creator of Brilliant Minds, shared in a statement, “Eric was a TV icon who lit up our screens for decades and it was the greatest honor of my career to work with him. Not only was he a tremendous talent, he was also generous, kind and brave. I'm thinking about his family and loved ones today. He will be missed.” Dane guest-starred in a second-season episode centered on ALS.


	DeMane Davis, producing director and executive producer of Brilliant Minds, also shared a statement. “Watching Eric Dane do what he loved — act in his final role on Brilliant Minds — was an honor. He adored being on set, cracking jokes in-between takes. Our crew and cast loved him. It was an gift to witness his talent, determination and joy,” Davis said. 

	











	Ludwig, who starred in 2024's Bad Boys: Ride or Die with Dane, wrote on his Instagram Story, “Ugh this hurts so much. Will miss you Eric and loved our time together. You were a joy to work with.”


	Blair, who appeared with Dane in an episode of Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane in 2000, shared a video of the sitcom on Instagram and wrote, “I love you. And yours.”


	Travis Van Winkle, the actor's Last Ship co-star, wrote on his Instagram Story: “I learned so much from Eric. He was a great man. I'm sad to see him go in this way. I'm sending love to his family. Thanks for the memories my friend.”

And a reminder after watching the HBO true-crime doc: "Meth messes with your head."


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Beyond its ponies and bourbon, Louisville, Kentucky, is not all glitter balls and glamour.


	The birthplace of the disco ball — locally called “glitter balls” — is also the tragic death place of Jamie Carroll. The hairdresser and drag performer was brutally murdered in 2010 by either Joey Banis or Jeffrey Mundt, depending on whom you believe. In HBO‘s two-part true-crime doc Murder in Glitterball City the former lovers point fingers at each other for the crime — only one, Banis, is currently in prison, even though both participated in the basement burial of Carroll following a wild night of sex, drugs and slaughter.

	The separate trials — due to the he said-he said accusations, since Banis and Mundt could not be tried as co-defendants — as well as the two-part documentary series from Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato hinge on a “confession” video self-recorded by Banis. In a motel room, seemingly holding Mundt at gun point, Banis admits to the murder and absolves his partner of any wrongdoing.


	It might be an open-and-shut case if not for the minutes-earlier footage that sees Mundt basically scripting the entire spiel for Banis. It appears Mundt is the one in control of the situation. So why would Banis play along? For starters, Bailey and Barbato say, crystal meth is a helluva drug.


	“I think it was all part of this drug-fueled haze. It was a strategic, transactional act that Joey was making. It was all part of the confusion of the dynamics of this relationship. [Mundt] is saying [Banis] did it and [the confession] is real, and [Banis] was crazy,” Barbato told The Hollywood Reporter. “And [Banis] is saying, I [confessed] because [Mundt] asked me to do this — he demanded I do this for whatever reason.”

	











	The defendants both said they feared one another. Regardless, the “confession” tape was used to convict Banis on a murder charge, and saved Mundt from the same fate.


	“They were both on trial for the same crime, and yet, just wrapping your head around how the outcome was completely different is very — it's kind of bizarre,” Bailey said.


	Beyond the tape, Banis and Mundt were very different in their presentation. Mundt speaks intelligently (though condescendingly, as numerous doc participants point out) and sports a clean-cut, corporate look. On the other end, Banis sports a blue mohawk, piercings and landing-strip soul patch.


	But appearances are often deceiving — especially in Glitterball City.


	“You're in Old Louisville, which is this haunted neighborhood where people dress up, pretending to be characters from the past and ghosts and things,” Bailey said. “Meth messes with your head, but [the setting] also messes with your head: Which dimension are we in?”


Murder in Glitterball City is more sympathetic to Banis, who participates from prison and has what Bailey calls a “slim” possibility of being granted an appeal, compared to Mundt. Barbato said they repeatedly “tried until very late in the process” to get in touch with Mundt for the doc, but “it was radio silence” on his end.


	Though their doc takes a side, Bailey and Barbato aren't necessarily all #JusticeForBanis — they want justice for Carroll, which in their eyes includes Mundt behind bars as well. The way they see it is, regardless of who wielded the knife and discharged the gun, anyone who buries a body in the basement and continues on with their lives for months on end — even if at times feeling under duress — should be behind bars.

	











	Mundt is not unfindable, and despite double jeopardy laws, there is still probably a way to put him where Bailey and Barbato feel he belongs. That's not the only goal, however, for Murder in Glitterball City.


	Bailey says it's important they use their platform to not allow society to dismiss murders in the LBGTQ community, which he says especially happens when the victim is involved in illicit acts.


	“As queer filmmakers, what happened to Jamie and the way that maybe people look at drug dealers and drag queens, or trans or people who are engaged in illegal activity like drug dealing… the goal, our goal, was to tell the story as fully as we could,” he said.


Murder in Glitterball City, from World of Wonder Productions, premiered both episodes back to back on Thursday, Feb. 19 beginning at 8 p.m. on HBO. Both parts will be available to stream on HBO Max.

Eric Dane fought a brave battle against ALS until his passing at age 53. Before he passed, the “Grey's Anatomy” star joined the Target ALS Board of Directors.

In December 2025, Target ALS shared in a joint Instagram post with Dane that the beloved actor had joined their Board of Directors. 

“We're proud to share an important announcement: Eric Dane (@realericdane) has joined the Target ALS Board of Directors, deepening his commitment to accelerating ALS research and driving meaningful change for the ALS community,” the non-profit announced on December 18.

The statement continued, “Diagnosed in 2024, Eric has become a powerful advocate for progress, lending his voice to our ‘Ending ALS Starts With You' campaign and even portraying a character living with ALS on NBC's ‘Brilliant Minds' to raise awareness. His decision to join our Board reflects the same relentless spirit he brings to his personal journey.”

“Eric's voice and leadership will add a vital new perspective to this diverse and dedicated group,” Target ALS continued. “We're honored to welcome Eric to the Board as we work together to accelerate discovery and change what it means to receive an ALS diagnosis.”

At the time, the “Euphoria” star released a statement saying, “This disease takes something from me every day. But I won't let it take my spirit. Target ALS embodies that spirit, and that's why I'm joinging the Board…This community deserves effective treatments, and I want to do my part to deliver them.”

Dane passed away on Thursday, February 19, his family confirmed in a statement to People.

“With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS,” the statement read. “He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world. Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time.”

Dane—who first announced his ALS diagnosis in April 2025—leaves behind a wife, actress Rebecca Gayheart, and two daughters, Billie and Georgia.

Few movies of recent vintage have had a longer or bumpier road to getting made than Mars, the first (and reportedly last) full feature-length movie from cult sketch comedy group The Whitest Kids U' Know. Originally conceived back in 2012—shortly after the group's IFC sketch series went off the air—the film has faced numerous hardships to getting made, none more obvious, or seemingly insurmountable, than the death of the group's co-founder, Trevor Moore, in 2021. Now, though, the animated movie is finally gearing up to get a limited run in theaters and a wide release on physical media and VOD, complete with a trailer that starts with a close-up of a character very clearly modeled on, and played by, Moore. (Who completed his voice work for the film several years ago.)

﻿

Mars had a debut at the Tribeca Film Festival back in 2024, although reviews for the film seemed fairly mixed. (If more positive than the response to the previous film that Moore made with fellow WKUK Zach Cregger, 2009's widely excoriated Miss March.) Featuring voice performancess from Moore, Cregger, Sam Brown, Timmy Williams, and Darren Trumeter—with the group having crowdfunded the film personally—the movie was directed by Sevan Najarian, and focuses on a guy who wins a trip to Mars from an eccentric Richard Branson-esque billionaire (Moore). 

The group is currently gearing up to tour Mars with Q&As at Alamo Drafthouses in locations across the country. (Would the film be getting quite this treatment if Cregger hadn't become one of the biggest names in horror over the last several years, courtesy of Barbarian and Weapons? Hard to say, although the Whitest Kids U' Know fanbase has remained both faithful and extremely vocal in the decade-plus since the show went off the air.) Mars is slated to release on BluRay on March 10.

Longtime Hallmark actress and director Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe underwent a double (or bilateral) mastectomy on February 19, 2026 — the second major step in her treatment plan for stage 3 breast cancer. 

An update on Lowe's condition had not been made public by the evening of her operation, but a double mastectomy can take many hours and may require several nights in the hospital, per the Cleveland Clinic. 

On the morning of Lowe's surgery, her Hallmark bestie, “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” co-star Kristin Booth, posted a black-and-white sketch of a woman's torso in her Instagram Stories and wrote, “My dearest friend @officialcrystallowe is currently undergoing a double mastectomy. All positive energy and prayers are welcome. Thank you.” 

Lowe, 45, first revealed her cancer diagnosis to fans in October 2025 as she was beginning four months of chemotherapy treatments. She's documented her journey on social media and insisted on working throughout her infusions, from directing a movie remotely from her cancer center to filming a new project in between the end of chemo and her surgery. 

Lowe has leaned on her family for support, including husband Miko Tomasevich and their two young kids. But she has also shared repeatedly how grateful she's been for the love from her Hallmark family, from friends bringing food or driving her to chemo to the Hallmark Media team purchasing a new victory bell for her cancer center. Lowe got choked up while becoming the first one to ring it after her final chemo infusion in January. 

On the day before her surgery, Lowe posted a video from her car and admitted, “There are so many emotions, I can't even wrap my brain around it.” In the caption of her post, she wrote that “every time I'm onto the next adventure it feels so scary.” 

The “Shifting Gears” director previously shared that she'd undergo a double mastectomy on February 19 to remove the tumor and all surrounding tissue in her right breast. Her left breast will also be removed to decrease the chance of recurrence and to help her eventual reconstruction with implants look symmetrical.

In a video post on February 10, Lowe told her Instagram followers, “I'm not gonna lie, I am, like, so sad to lose my boobs and also so happy to get rid of this cancer and actually get a pathology report so I actually know what's going on.”

After a mastectomy, pathologists closely examine a tumor and the tissue around it to determine if all of the cancer was removed with “clear margins,” according to the Mayo Clinic. It can take up to a week for results and for next steps to be determined, but Lowe has already said her team anticipates her needing radiation post-surgery.

Bad Bunny and Gabriela Berlingeri were spotted out together after reigniting their romance.

The “DtMF” hitmaker was pictured stepping out with Berlingeri in São Paulo, Brazil on Wednesday for dinner. 

The Super Bowl halftime performer went casual in blue jeans and sunglasses paired with a beige ball cap, while Berlingeri rocked a copper floor length dress with a thigh high slit.

The jewelry designer carried a cropped denim jacket while walking alongside the singer, who carried a large checkered bag.

Last Thursday, the Puerto Rican musical phenomenon, 31, was spotted on an early Valentine's Day dinner date with Berlingeri, 32, in Buenos Aires. 

Photos obtained by Page Six showed the “Yo Perreo Sola” rapper going incognito outside the restaurant in a checkered face mask, ball cap, and blue hoodie.

Berlingeri followed behind him, walking alongside a restaurant staffer, and wore a brown leather jacket with matching pants for the dinner date.

For that outing, the musician — whose given name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasion — stopped to shake hands with several young fans as Berlingeri waited nearby in a vehicle. 

The pair became the target of reconciliation rumors after Berlingeri attended the Super Bowl, where the “Tití Me Preguntó,” singer headed up the halftime show on Feb. 8.

The duo previously dated off and on from 2017 to 2022.

He also famously dated “The Kardashians” star Kendall Jenner, 30, for nearly a year before their split in December 2023 — though they briefly reconciled in May 2024 before splitting again.

Through it all, the Grammy winner has remained famously tight-lipped about his relationships. 

“They don't know how you feel, they don't know how you live, they don't know anything, and I really don't want them to know,” he told Vanity Fair in 2023, referencing fan interest in his love life. 

“I'm not really interested in clarifying anything because I have no commitment to clarify anything to anyone. I am clear and my friend Jomar … and my mother is clear. They are the only ones to whom I have to clarify anything.”

Supernatural is among the very few shows to reach 15 seasons, and among genre shows, it's outlasted everyone. As the Winchester brothers, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles were at the forefront of almost every episode, but they weren't alone. With them all the way from the humble beginnings, trying to find the demon who killed their mother, to the very end, when they battle God, is the 1967 Chevy Impala: Baby.  

Through thick and thin, possessions, ghosts, wendigos, angels, and the Devil himself, Dean's Impala was right there, which is why, when it took center stage in 2011's “Baby.” When fans heard an entire episode would be shot inside the Impala, they didn't know quite what to expect, but the crew of Supernatural turned the old “bottle episode” gimmick into one of the best of the show's entire run. 

From the moment “Baby” starts, you know it's going to be a different type of episode. The usual recap begins in 1967 with footage of a Chevy plant assembling Impalas. It quickly jumps forward to the present, as Dean and Sam give it a good wash before a road trip to investigate another case, and that's when you notice every single camera shot is from the perspective of Baby. This leads to some unique angles over the dash and into the side mirrors, and then later on, an overhead shot from the roof of the car as the boys settle in for the night. 

Every single inch of the Impala helps ground the Supernatural episode right when the series was starting to go off the rails. Granted, “grounded” is a bit of a stretch for an episode in which the term “were-pire” is used. The real monster of the episode, a Nachzeher, feels like a throwback to the early seasons, and how it's finally defeated, through a series of small payoffs to the various passengers in Baby during the episode, is classic Supernatural. 

The meat of the episode, Sam and Dean going on a road trip together, also gives the brothers time to reconnect and establish their relationship. For years, it was the bedrock of the series, but over 10 seasons, a lot went unsaid, and a gulf began to form between the two as fans had to endure more and more episodes that split them up, or worse, put them at odds. In “Baby,” the two get a chance to sit, talk, and reconnect. It's a quiet scene with the camera going from one close-up to the other, but it's what helps make the episode so good, especially for longtime fans who relish every moment with the pair. 

As much as the dramatic side of their relationship helps drive Supernatural forward, there's also the complete goofball side to each of the brothers, and to the actors behind the roles. Goofs and bloopers from the series get more views than the dramatic moments on social media. Dean popping in Bob Seger's “Night Moves” and then singing along is one of those moments that makes fans wonder if Jensen did it between takes and they wrote it in, because it's exactly the type of offbeat, corny humor and brotherly chemistry the stars showed on screen for over a decade. 

“Baby” was an immediate hit when it aired, nailing the sweet spot of “monster of the week,” classic Supernatural chemistry, and a few nods to the final major story arc of the series. Bottle episodes are usually done as a cost-cutting measure, such as on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. or Stargate SG-1, but the unique hook of filming entirely in and around a car makes “Baby” look and feel different from every other episode. The talented production crew turned a budget-saving gimmick into a wildly inventive new way to frame, shoot, and present a show that had been airing for over a decade. 

Supernatural may have outlasted the story it was trying to tell, but for any show to run for 15 seasons and develop a fervent fan base that, years after its conclusion, is still going strong. “Baby” is a perfect example of why the show became a hit and how self-imposed restrictions can lead to new levels of creative genius.

It's a show for mature audiences and not intended for anyone under 17. They must be accompanied by a parent or guardian over 21 years of age, and photo ID is required for them.

                                        President Donald Trump on Thursday night announced that he is ordering the Pentagon and other US departments and agencies to identify and release government files related to extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Hours earlier, Trump accused former US president Barack Obama of revealing classified information on the issue.                 

Issued on: 20/02/2026 - 10:11Modified: 20/02/2026 - 10:33

US President Donald Trump said Thursday he is ordering federal agencies to begin "identifying and releasing" government files related to UFOs and aliens, a move sought for decades by some Americans.

"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs)," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

While he did not specify whether classified documents would be released to the public, Trump added that the files should include "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters".

Earlier in the day the Republican president claimed that one of his Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama, had revealed "classified" information in his recent viral podcast remarks about the existence of extraterrestrial life.

"They're real, but I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in... Area 51," Obama told host Brian Tyler Cohen, referring to the top-secret US military facility in Nevada at the heart of many UFO conspiracy theories.

"There's no underground facility. Unless, there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."

Asked on Thursday about the comments, Trump told reporters that Obama "gave classified information, he is not supposed to be doing that".

The president did not specify what part of Obama's remarks were classified, but claimed "he made a big mistake".

For his own beliefs about aliens, Trump, 79, said "I don't know if they are real or not."

No evidence has been produced of intelligent life beyond Earth.

Interest in UFOs and UAP has been renewed in recent years as the US government probed numerous reports of seemingly supernatural aircraft, amid worries that adversaries could be testing highly advanced technologies.

In March 2024, the Pentagon released a report saying it had no proof that UAP were alien technology, with many suspicious sightings turning out to be merely weather balloons, spy planes, satellites and other normal activity.

US President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to "begin the process of identifying and releasing" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. 

Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said "aliens are real" on a podcast last week. 

"He's not supposed to be doing that," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: "He made a big mistake."

Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: "Well, I don't know if they're real or not."

Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. 

"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51," Obama said. 

"There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."

After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. 

In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: "I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!" 

Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire "lightning" round of questions on the podcast.

There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.

For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and "doesn't have an opinion on it". 

Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that "based on the tremendous interest shown" he will seek the release of files "related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters".

The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a secret Pentagon programme to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.

In 2022, Congress held the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter - setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.

The following year, a US House of Representatives panel on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was "no evidence" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects.

US President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to "begin the process of identifying and releasing" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. 

Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said "aliens are real" on a podcast last week. 

"He's not supposed to be doing that," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: "He made a big mistake."

Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: "Well, I don't know if they're real or not."

Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. 

"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51," Obama said. 

"There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."

After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. 

In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: "I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!" 

Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire "lightning" round of questions on the podcast.

There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.

For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and "doesn't have an opinion on it". 

Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that "based on the tremendous interest shown" he will seek the release of files "related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters".

The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a secret Pentagon programme to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.

In 2022, Congress held the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter - setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.

The following year, a US House of Representatives panel on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was "no evidence" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects. 

A second US aircraft carrier appears to be heading towards the Middle East as Washington increases its pressure on Iran.

A charity says it has been inudated with applications to adopt the dog after it was tied to the baggage sizer at a ticket counter.

President Donald Trump said Thursday that he was directing agencies to release files pertaining to “alien and extraterrestrial life.”

Trump wrote on Truth Social that “based on the tremendous interest shown,” he would be directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and officials at other relevant agencies “to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.”

Trump's announcement comes after former President Barack Obama said in a podcast interview that aliens were real, later clarifying that he meant “the odds are good there's life out there.” Obama added in his clarification that he had seen “no evidence” of alien existence during his time in office. 

Obama was answering a series of questions during a "lightning round" of the podcast interview, when he was asked whether aliens were real.

"They're real," Obama said, "but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."

The podcaster, Brian Tyler Cohen, then asked Obama what was the first question he had wanted answered when he took office.

"Where are the aliens?" Obama responded.

Trump, asked by a reporter about Obama's remarks Thursday, said Obama had given classified information.

“He's not supposed to be doing that,” Trump added.

Following a 2024 hearing, the Pentagon said it received hundreds of reports on UAPs and 21 that merited “further analysis” because of “anomalous characteristics and/or behaviors” — but found no evidence of extraterrestrial activity. 

Responding to Trump's directive Thursday night, Hegseth posted a screenshot of Trump's post with an alien emoji and a saluting emoji.

Some lawmakers reacted to Trump's announcement Thursday. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said in an interview on Fox News, "If he's going to release all of the X-Files, I think that could be a bipartisan thing," referring to the 1990s television show about FBI agents investigating — among other things — government conspiracies about aliens, which Fetterman said he "grew up watching."

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., thanked Trump, writing: "Looks like we are about to have a ton of hearings on this :)!"

President Trump on Thursday directed his administration to release files on UFOs and any "alien and extraterrestrial life," an issue that has drawn decades of public fascination — and spawned more than a few wild theories.   

In a Truth Social post, the president told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agency heads "to begin the process of identifying and releasing" any relevant files. 

Mr. Trump also called for the release of "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters." 

It's not clear what files on UFOs might be released — or what information they might contain. The Pentagon has tracked reports of what it calls unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, for decades. But the military said in a 2024 report there's no evidence that any government investigation into UAPs has confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life.

Mr. Trump's announcement came just days after one of his predecessors, former President Barack Obama, made waves by telling a podcaster that aliens are real. He later clarified that he never saw evidence of contact between humans and extraterrestrial life during his time in the White House, and he primarily believes that extraterrestrial life is real because "statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there."  

Asked Thursday about Obama's comments, Mr. Trump told reporters he isn't sure whether or not aliens exist, but added that the former president "made a big mistake" and "gave classified information." 

"I may get him out of trouble by declassifying," Mr. Trump said.

Public interest in UAPs has grown in recent years. Pilots and military service members have reported spotting hundreds of unexplained objects in the sky, leading some lawmakers to press the Pentagon to investigate the phenomena and determine whether they pose a threat to safety or national security.  

Last year, one House Republican released a whistleblower video of a U.S. missile striking an unidentified glowing orb in the sky and bouncing off it. And in another case, a former Navy pilot told "60 Minutes" about frequent sightings of strange, fast-moving objects in restricted airspace.

A large number of UAP reports can be explained by birds, balloons, drones, satellites and other everyday phenomena, according to the military's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. But many cases remain unresolved. 

"It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology," the office said in a 2024 report. The office also noted that it has "no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries."

President Trump on Thursday directed his administration to release files on UFOs and any "alien and extraterrestrial life," an issue that has drawn decades of public fascination — and spawned more than a few wild theories.   

In a Truth Social post, the president told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agency heads "to begin the process of identifying and releasing" any relevant files. 

Mr. Trump also called for the release of "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters." 

It's not clear what files on UFOs might be released — or what information they might contain. The Pentagon has tracked reports of what it calls unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, for decades. But the military said in a 2024 report there's no evidence that any government investigation into UAPs has confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life.

Mr. Trump's announcement came just days after one of his predecessors, former President Barack Obama, made waves by telling a podcaster that aliens are real. He later clarified that he never saw evidence of contact between humans and extraterrestrial life during his time in the White House, and he primarily believes that extraterrestrial life is real because "statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there."  

Asked Thursday about Obama's comments, Mr. Trump told reporters he isn't sure whether or not aliens exist, but added that the former president "made a big mistake" and "gave classified information." 

"I may get him out of trouble by declassifying," Mr. Trump said.

Public interest in UAPs has grown in recent years. Pilots and military service members have reported spotting hundreds of unexplained objects in the sky, leading some lawmakers to press the Pentagon to investigate the phenomena and determine whether they pose a threat to safety or national security.  

Last year, one House Republican released a whistleblower video of a U.S. missile striking an unidentified glowing orb in the sky and bouncing off it. And in another case, a former Navy pilot told "60 Minutes" about frequent sightings of strange, fast-moving objects in restricted airspace.

A large number of UAP reports can be explained by birds, balloons, drones, satellites and other everyday phenomena, according to the military's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. But many cases remain unresolved. 

"It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology," the office said in a 2024 report. The office also noted that it has "no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries."
