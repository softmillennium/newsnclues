                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kylian Mbappe bagged a brilliant hat-trick to mark a fine night's work for Real Madrid in the Champions League as they saw off FC Kairat, 5-0. Madrid almost conceded within 15 seconds. The home side went straight down the other end from the kickoff, with Dastan Satpaev's tame header falling into the relieved gloves of Thibaut Courtois. That seemed to wake the European giants up. The following 20 minutes was a flurry of shots and chances from Madrid. Franco Mastantuono chased down a looping clearance. And Los Blancos grew into it from there. He added two more to complete his hat-trick, providing two lovely finishes to put the result beyond doubt. Eduardo Camavinga's header sealed things for good late on and Brahim Diaz followed on to make it five. GOAL rates Real Madrid's players from Ortalyq Stadıon...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions of people signed up for FIFA World Cup tickets via the Visa Presale Draw in early September. Fast forward to the end of the month and Sept. 29 -- Monday -- was the first day that randomly-selected applicants would be notified to give them a day and time to buy available tickets. Well, plenty of you likely did not receive an email notification on Monday or Tuesday ... yet. We talked it over with the powers that be, and FIFA officials assured us that you're not being ghosted if you haven't received word about tickets. In fact, emails will be going out over the next couple weeks, telling people 48 hours ahead of their scheduled day and time they'll be slotted for buying tickets. By the end of this first phase, everyone who didn't get selected will get an email confirming their rejection. The good news is that another phase of applications is opening at the end of October and it will be for everyone -- not just Visa cardholders. FIFA will open its own resale process at the end of all phases, so there won't be any other secondary markets selling tickets. In the first 24 hours, 1.5 million people had signed up. The top 10 countries, in order of demand, were rounded out by Germany, England, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Spain and Italy. “These are not only outstanding figures, but also a strong statement,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. From Canada, Mexico and the United States to countries big and small across every continent, fans are proving once again that the passion for football truly unites, as they are looking forward to attending matches in all three host nations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SoccerToday features original articles with exclusive interviews plus influential columnists covering youth and professional soccer, coaching, nutrition, and the wonderful soccer life. This is more than pro-female coaches symbolic announcement: this effort builds a visible pathway for women in coaching to raise their license level, earning capacity and overall value. “WAGS is privileged to sponsor our first-ever All-Female National B Course, advancing our mission to empower and support female coaches in their educational journey,” said Kerry Diederich, WAGS Executive Director. WAGS: With more than 50 years of history, WAGS is one of the oldest organizations in the U.S. dedicated to advancing soccer opportunities for girls and women. It has already pioneered all-female courses (such as its National C License cohorts) and coach education paths. USCSA: Launched in 2024, the Consortium is a network of state soccer associations aimed at aligning resources, scaling operations, and promoting growth. Today it comprises 16 US Youth Soccer state associations and claims representation over some 900,000 players. “As we continually work to enable coaches to acquire and further develop knowledge, and skills, we recognized the importance of empowering more female coaches to gain further coaching qualifications,” said Evan Dabby, USCSA President and CEO of New Jersey Youth Soccer. “Through this collaboration with Women and Girls in Soccer (WAGS), enabled by the significant support from US Soccer, our goal is to expand upon that ambition to create more opportunities for women in the sport.” New Jersey Youth Soccer is a founding member of the United States Consortium of Soccer Associations, which was founded in early 2024 with a vision to create a highly functioning network of state associations focused on growing soccer participation. The National B License Course runs for six months and follows a blended learning format. It includes two in-person meetings and, on average, one virtual meeting per week. The in-person sessions emphasize small group activities and individualized field work. To qualify, coaches must be at least 18 years of age, old a U.S. Soccer C license for at least one (1) year and have three (3) or more years of coaching experience (any level) plus have access to a team playing 11v11 (U13+) for the duration of the course. As you probably already know, Jill Elis is the former U.S. Women's National Team Head Coach and the 2x FIFA Women's World Cup Champion Head Coach.

Further, we encourage you to visit WAGS online and follow them on social media: @wagsinsoccer The United States Consortium of State Associations (USCSA) is a game-changer in the soccer ecosystem, currently representing 16 USYS State Associations and more than 900,000+ players. Working in collaboration with U.S. Soccer and US Youth Soccer, the USCSA's mission is to maximize and unlock the true potential of state associations by creating a highly functioning network of state associations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sydney Schmidt is on her way to compete against the best young soccer talent on the planet. A repeat Florida High School Athletic Association champion with St. Johns Country Day School and the Times-Union's All-First Coast girls soccer player of the year in 2023-24, Schmidt is among 21 players selected to represent the United States under head coach Katie Schoepfer. In the group stage, the United States will face Ecuador at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 18; China at 12 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 21; and Norway at 9 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 24. All of the American group games are set for the Football Academy Mohammed VI Stadium in Sale, near Rabat. The group stage, if the United States women advance, would begin on Oct. 28. The Americans finished third at the most recent U-17 Women's World Cup, which North Korea won. Schmidt, who is committed to Florida State for the 2026 class but competes alongside professionals in the Gainbridge Super League under a youth academy contract that preserves her NCAA eligibility, made her first league start on Sept. 28 against Carolina Ascent FC. She becomes the first Jacksonville-area player to represent the national team at the U-17 Women's World Cup since Fleming Island's Lia Godfrey in 2016. Current locals in the full national team are Mandy McGlynn (Sandalwood High School) and Avery Patterson (Bolles School). Sporting Jax captain Sophie Jones also appeared on a United States roster for the U-17 Women's World Cup in Uruguay in 2018.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the United States Men's National Team last convened in early September, manager Mauricio Pochettino proclaimed that it would be his final opportunity to experiment with new players. The presumption was that each camp moving forward leading up to the 2026 World Cup would involve a core group of players, all of whom stand a realistic chance of making Pochettino's final roster. The problem, however, is that with the next set of friendlies taking place on October 10th and October 14th, some of those core players are currently out dealing with injuries. Gio Reyna and Ricardo Pepi recently returned to their respective club's lineups after missing time with injuries only to once again find themselves in the physio's office. Reyna missed out on last weekend's match for Borussia Monchengladbach thanks to a thigh injury while Pepi was forced off after just 32 minutes in PSV Eindhoven's latest match due to what the club called a “minor strain in his upper leg.” “These guys are becoming what I would say is unreliable,” said Donovan. Whether it was down to injury or lack of minutes with his club team, Reyna has played just 21 minutes for the U.S. in 2025 while Pepi hasn't appeared for the national team in nearly a year after suffering a knee injury in January. A rash of additional injuries to American players left Donovan wondering if there is more that can be done on an individual level to help stay fit. And I also took care of myself, right? Again, not looking for a pat on the back, but that is part of being a professional and being able to play at the highest level.” “I could go to the club and get stuff, but four days a week at home before bed, I was getting a massage. Mauricio Pochettino is expected to name his squad later this week for the team's upcoming October friendlies against Ecuador and Australia.

Johnson started her journey to the U-17 World Cup in January with a call-up to the team's training camp where she was one of four players called back after participating in the 2024 U-17 World Cup. In late March and early April of this year, Johnson received a second call-up, this time for the FIFA U-17 qualifiers against Trinidad & Tobago, Honduras and El Salvador. Johnson scored a team-high four goals to help the U.S. qualify for the World Cup: one against Trinidad and Tobago; a goal and assist against Honduras; and a brace against El Salvador. In 2024, Johnson made three starts in six appearances for the Stars and Stripes. Johnson signed with the Chicago Stars in January of 2025 and made her professional debut March 14 against the Orlando Pride. This season in the National Women's Soccer League, the forward has made 14 appearances for a total of 146 minutes. Johnson received her first professional start against Palmeiras in the Teal Rising Cup July 15. The team will then face China PR Tuesday, Oct. 21 (Noon ET / 5 p.m. local) and finish Group C play against Norway on Friday, Oct. 24 (9 a.m. All three of the US' Group C games will be played at the Football Academy Mohammed VI (Pitch 3) in Sale, which is just outside of the capital of Rabat. The 24 countries are divided into six groups of four teams each. This year's tournament marks the first of what will now be an annual competition with the next first editions being held in Morocco. The tournament will run from October 17 to November 8. Tickets are available now at chicagostars.com/tickets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the recent 5-2 defeat at the hands of Atletico Madrid, it must be admitted that Real Madrid were one of Spain's best-performing teams in the month of September. The Spanish giants secured three wins in four La Liga matches, including Espanyol and Levante. While Kylian Mbappe was the obvious protagonist for Los Blancos during this period, another player who showcased his talents pretty well this month is Arda Guler, who has now been rewarded for his efforts. In light of his excellent performances in the month of September, La Liga has confirmed that Arda Guler has won the U-23 Player of the Month award. The Turkish international has enjoyed a stellar September, having been involved in no less than two goals and two assists in four matches. Guler, in fact, was involved in both goals during Real Madrid's defeat to Atletico Madrid. Xabi Alonso, in fact, admitted that he made a mistake by subbing him off in the game. However, the key highlight for the former Fenerbahce starlet this month was his goal against Real Sociedad, as he wriggled his way around the defence before a nice interplay with Kylian Mbappe. Overall, this season, Guler has racked up eight competitive appearances, during which he has racked up three goals and three assists. This has led to Guler becoming a key component in Xabi's creative setup and the youngster will hope the momentum continues as Real Madrid gear up for a clash against Kairat Almaty this midweek.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Gray scoring at the Club World Cup (Photo by Alex Grimm/Getty Images) Out of the 130 different players who scored at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, there were World Cup champions like Thomas Müller, Antoine Griezmann, and Sergio Ramos, all-time great strikers like Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappé, and Harry Kane, and Ballon d'Or winners like Lionel Messi and Ousmane Dembélé. Only one, however, was an amateur footballer: Christian Gray. Born in the Gisborne Region of New Zealand, Gray grew up in the shadow of two national sporting icons. Gray took after his father by playing as a center back at Wellington College before launching his senior career with Waitakere United in 2016. We probably have a few of the same characteristics as center backs – he was quite good in the air and scored a lot of headers from set-pieces. He played in the amateur National League his whole career in addition to working full time and playing for New Zealand.” Gray bounced around from Waitakere United to Hamilton Wanderers to Birkenhead United before eventually joining Eastern Suburbs in 2019, where he established himself as a regular in the middle of defense and made 46 appearances. Since being founded in 2004 following the inception of the New Zealand Football Championship, Auckland City have established himself as a heavyweight at the national and regional level, winning 10 New Zealand Football Championships, including last year's edition. As opposed to New Zealand's only two professional clubs (Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix), who play in the Australian league, Auckland City are an amateur side that compete in the domestic league and has consequently been allowed to form a chokehold on the OFC Champions League – the premier men's club football competition in Oceania. They've won a whopping 13 OFC Champions League titles, including the last four, and as such, they've also played in more FIFA Club World Cups (12) than any other team in world football, coming away with a bronze medal in the 2014 edition against all odds. Auckland City have been at the top of the domestic league for about 20 years now, they have a proud and successful history. They already had quite a strong legacy of National League and Oceania titles before I had joined the club four years ago, which is why I was so excited to join them. He was an unused substitute on February 1, 2023 when Auckland lost 3-0 to Egyptian heavyweights Al Ahly in the first round in Morocco. 10 months later, Gray was given the start against Saudi powerhouse Al-Ittihad, which featured ex-Premier League icons N'Golo Kanté and Fabinho in midfield and Karim Benzema, who was one year removed from winning the Ballon d'Or. Gray delivered an impressive account of himself against Benzema, making two clearances and two tackles and completing six out of eight long balls, but he was unable to prevent Auckland from losing 3-0 in Saudi Arabia. And this month, his Auckland side lost 3-0 at Egyptian behemoths Pyramids in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup. Once a mid-season tournament featuring seven teams from six different continents, FIFA decided to expand the Club World Cup to 32 teams and hold the inaugural edition in the United States between June 14 and July 13, 2025. Some of Auckland's players missed out on a chance to participate in the Club World Cup after failing to secure annual leave from their day job, whereas some had to take unpaid leave from their job. There is a cap of 150 New Zealand dollars ($86 USD) per week for amateur footballers in New Zealand covering basic expenses such as gym membership; some players simply couldn't afford to take the financial risks to play against three of the biggest teams in world football: Bayern Munich, Benfica, and Boca Juniors. “The whole organization is obviously unique in that we juggle a lot of commitments, it's not just football for us. I've had a few problems like knee injuries and vertigo, I've missed a lot of football over the past four years. There were moments where I was unsure if I'd even feature at this Club World Cup, so the way it worked out was pretty special.” With nothing left to play for in their third match, Auckland manager Paul Posa decided to hand Gray a start in central defense against Argentine powerhouse Boca Juniors. All signs pointed to Auckland suffering yet another humiliating beatdown in Nashville. After all, Auckland had lost each of their last eight matches in the Club World Cup, and unlike Boca, who were fighting for second place in the group and a trip to the knockout round, Auckland were already eliminated. Whereas Boca boasted a team featuring battle-hardened veterans like Agustín Marchesín and Luis Advíncula, scintillating youngsters like Carlos Palacios and Exequiel Zeballos, and one of the greatest strikers of his generation in Edinson Cavani, Auckland boasted a team of real estate agents, Coca-Cola sale representatives, and sundry professions. They didn't take it for granted, leveling the scoring in the 52nd minute as Jerson Lagos whipped in a corner kick for Gray who, despite being tightly marked by Rodrigo Battaglia, managed to steady himself and fire a bullet header into the back of the net. Gray excelled at the back both on and off the ball, completing 11 out of 15 passes, blocking a shot, and making 12 clearances as Auckland prevailed with a historic 1-1 stalemate. “I won't forget that moment, it's the best moment of my career, and it'll be something that this group will talk about for years to come, but I think it's taken a while to properly sink in. It's interesting, because we all came back from the tournament and went straight to our normal lives, we had deadlines to meet. After returning to New Zealand as a Kiwi hero, Gray went back to his day job of working as a Physical Education and Health Teacher at Auckland Grammar School and Mt. Every day, he wakes up at 5 a.m. and coaches his junior side from 6:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., before teaching his classes from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. He will then enjoy a brief slice of freedom until going to training (3-4 times a week) from 5:45 to 8:30 before returning home, and on top of that, he's got to squeeze in online lectures as he studies for a graduate diploma. At 28 years of age, Christian Gray has already followed in his father's footsteps by excelling as a center back in New Zealand's premier football league, but he hasn't yet been able to replicate his father in representing the New Zealand national team. Out of the 24 players who were called up for this month's Soccer Ashes matches against Australia, all of them were playing at the professional level. But whilst Gray is comfortable in his multifaceted role as a teacher/coach/player, he is holding out hope of making it as a professional footballer and playing for the All Whites. “I haven't played professionally before, and these days if you want to play for the national team, you need to be playing professionally. There's still something in me that wants to see how good I can be if I commit 100% to it and pursue a football career.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One new high-profile media outlet, Kickback Soccer Media, has teamed up with Bluesky and joined a growing group of independent outlets spearheading coverage of the game in the US in this potentially pivotal moment. Some of this new approach is by design: there is no better way to engage with soccer fans and provide the kind of coverage they want than by immersing a media outlet in that culture, and reporting on that as much as the games and the sport itself. Domestic American soccer has struggled to get a foothold in the country's national and mainstream media. When national outlets do cover soccer, they are more likely to cover soccer stories from the English Premier League or elsewhere in Europe, thousands of miles away, than they are to cover the game locally. As a result, domestic soccer coverage has always originated from other channels. The interest and participation has always been there and is increasingly so, but in the past, those more mainstream outlets might have done one story on an MLS team every few months and then complained that no one reads them and took that as evidence that no one is interested. It needs to be built over time, and from the right place. “The media activity in this country has largely vacillated between the rights holders and the momentary interest of various other outlets that lasts around a World Cup, or a tent pole even, but I think a couple of things have shifted,” says Kickback co-founder and CEO John Parker. The two aforementioned fansites themselves emerged from a more mainstream media company, SB Nation (Vox Media), that gave up on domestic soccer and ditched all of its MLS outlets in 2023, but both have thrived and become more successful since going it alone. By providing thoughtful, knowledgeable, respectful, and considered coverage, these outlets, using a new media model, will become the destination for U.S.-based fans looking for coverage of the world's most popular sport in the coming years. “At Soccerwise, we don't pretend these are silly or little things, we value what happens post a Seattle Miami game, or post the Nashville Philly game, the same way that someone who's covering Chelsea or Manchester United would value their coverage,” says David Gass, who founded and hosts the Soccerwise podcast, and is the chief media officer and co-founder at Kickback. One of the things I think that a lot of people who have tried to sell soccer in America have done is belittle their own product at times by overvaluing external products or trying to legitimize it by connecting it to external things. “I just did an interview about college soccer, and the University of Maryland has a supporters group that has bounced for 30 plus years because they value themselves, they put a good product on the field, and they make it feel like it matters. “If you do that, people can engage with it. I think that's one of those things that soccer has struggled a lot with, but is one of the things I think we're really primed to help provide fans.” There is more evidence of this in Tuesday's announcement that Kickback will partner with the Philadelphia Union and the United States national team supporters' group, American Outlaws, to provide free tickets for fans who are looking to experience a soccer match for the first time. “As a business, I think we have approached the industry with a very 2025 and beyond lens, and that is one of our advantages,” says Parker. “There are so many great people in this industry who have been susceptible to all the vacillation I referenced before. So part of our rallying cry, part of the reason we exist, is that in this conversation with our seven or eight people who feature across our media ecosystem, and the people are behind the scenes building all of this, was that question of ‘how do we create something that can be our legacy, a place that we can build for years to come, versus just being a gun for hire for the [World Cup] next year?' As well as finding new ways to reach fans through modern media, many independent organizations have also found a more palatable and helpful social media outlet. Bluesky is emerging as the social media platform of choice for creators, writers, and journalists. Unlike others in the sphere, its algorithm does not suppress posts that share links to work published elsewhere. This has meant a better experience for fans and creators alike, one that is driven by sharing and discussion, rather than a race to the bottom built around outrage or engagement based solely on numbers rather than interaction and connection. “I think the way in which we give people lots of control and granularity around their moderation means that you can actually have conversations on Bluesky. You can have disagreements as well, which is great, and they don't necessarily explode into these crazy arguments. “I think we really build around depth of engagement and conversation, and because we have people who have come to us for that purpose, I think we offer really unique engagement in that regard. “We want to be a place where it is as much about celebration of the culture as opposed to the commercialization of it.” Major outlets like The Guardian have already abandoned X (formerly Twitter) and moved all their social media properties across to Bluesky. This could also improve the second-screen experience of soccer and create links between everyone involved, as Twitter once did. “The connection with Bluesky has been really big for us,” says Gass. “It feels like it's brought back some of the online engagement that Twitter had in its heyday, especially in soccer, where people can be physically disconnected. “Online has been such a powerful source for soccer fandom in America, and so I think we are using those avenues to constantly get feedback from people saying, ‘this is what we want, this is what we like, this is what we're looking for. Though most of this is still focused on the World Cup, Kickback knows that it will be around after the tournament, simply because many of those involved have that aforementioned dedication. “For us, after 2026, there's not a question of did we do well enough, it's a question of how do we build from this to the next thing?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jurgen Klopp has doubled down on his criticism of the Club World Cup by reiterating his belief that the tournament is putting players at greater risk of injury. The former Liverpool manager, who is now the global head of soccer for Red Bull, has always been vocal in his opinion that the football calendar is over-saturated. He is concerned about player welfare and believes the push towards more fixtures is based solely on greed. His opinion saw some backlash, with ex-Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger and Bulgarian football legend Hristo Stoichkov among those to push back. Meanwhile, Sky Sports News reporter Kaveh Solhekol went viral after passionately defending the Club World Cup and telling Klopp he doesn't have to watch it. In an interview with The Athletic, Klopp has stuck to his guns. “Did I read this morning that Chelsea have an injury crisis? Maybe they would have had injuries (anyway),” he said. “My expertise is I know how much you can expect from football players. I don't doubt it was a great tournament. But at one point we have to take care of the few people this game would not exist without: the players. “There's no solution besides stopping organising new tournaments in the summer break. You wouldn't do this in any other part of life. Imagine you put the best artist out every night until they fall down and then we say sorry, he lost focus…” Klopp is backed up by the Professional Footballers Association, who have warned that players could go on strike if their worries about burnout are not taken seriously. It comes after a report by FIFPRO, the world players' union, showed none of the teams at this summer's Club World Cup had the recommended 28 days' rest period. As Liverpool manager, Klopp frequently made headlines for clashing with broadcasters for scheduling his side to play early kick-offs on Saturdays after European away days in mid-week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>September 30 – World players' union FIFPRO has once again raised the issues of player workload and welfare ahead of next summer's World Cup as the organisation continues to await talks with FIFA. FIFA launched the maiden edition of its expanded Club World Cup this summer, but FIFPRO's study showed that the off-seasons and pre-seasons of Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich were all heavily altered because of the competition. Players did not get the recommended 28-day summer rest period. On top of that, the Club World Cup saw matches played in extreme heat, a scenario that may be repeated at next year's 48-team World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada. “You've got the perfect storm of how not to treat a human,” said FIFPRO consultant Dr. Darren Burgess. “You've got players playing a large number of games, followed by fewer than the recommended off-season days and preseason days, followed by a large number of games again. The risk to player health is clearly rising.” FIFA then claimed a “consensus” was reached for mandatory rest periods. “We have informal discussions on a regular basis on different levels, technical levels, be that medical or any other department,” said Alex Phillips, FIFPRO's Secretary General. “But nothing major or specific with regards to the World Cup next year. We are doing the same with others, not just FIFA. to try and help them to either reschedule the matches or if not, at least implement better protocols and mitigating measures as happened in the Club World Cup.” Contact the writer of this story, Samindra Kunti, at moc.l1759230501labto1759230501ofdlr1759230501owedi1759230501sni@i1759230501tnuk.1759230501ardni1759230501mas1759230501</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With qualifiers underway, FIFA has sanctioned a former host nation in a ruling that could jeopardize its chances of making it to the competition. On Monday, FIFA's Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the South African Football Association for fielding an ineligible player in March's World Cup qualifier against Lesotho. As a result, FIFA has ruled the match a 3-0 forfeit loss, stripping South Africa of three crucial points and denting its goal difference. The federation was also fined 10,000 Swiss francs (about $12,500), while Mokoena received only a warning. The sanction dealt a major blow to South Africa, which has now dropped behind Benin at the top of Group C. Both teams have 14 points from 10 matches, but Benin holds a narrow advantage on goal difference. Nigeria and Rwanda sit three points back, keeping the group wide open.
