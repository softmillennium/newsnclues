                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, and founded in 2019, BMNR is now predominantly a "financial holding company" with an ambitious core strategy: to aggressively accumulate Ethereum and become the world's largest ETH treasury, aiming to acquire 5% of its total circulating supply. BMNR's emergence as an Ethereum treasury titan mirrors MicroStrategy's successful Bitcoin accumulation playbook, drawing significant attention from investors seeking exposure to the burgeoning digital asset economy. As of September 28, 2025, the company reported substantial crypto and cash holdings of $11.6 billion, including 2,650,900 ETH tokens (valued at approximately $4,141 per ETH), 192 Bitcoin, and $436 million in unencumbered cash. The company's relevance is further amplified by high-profile investor backing from institutions like ARK's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund (Peter Thiel holds a 9.1% stake), and Bill Miller III. Chairman Tom Lee of Fundstrat is a vocal proponent, advocating for Ethereum as a foundational technology for both Wall Street and artificial intelligence. BMNR's stock boasts high liquidity, frequently ranking among the most traded in the U.S., making it an attractive, regulated vehicle for institutional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum. While Nasdaq classifies BMNR as a large-cap growth stock in Computer Services, its primary driver of value is now its digital asset accumulation. BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR) has a dynamic history marked by significant strategic evolution. Incorporated in 2019, the company was initially known by several names, including Sandy Springs Holdings Inc. and Renewable Energy Solution Systems, Sandy Springs, RESS Merger, before establishing its identity as a blockchain technology firm. An early foray into cryptocurrency treasury management saw the company purchase 100 Bitcoin for its treasury in June 2025, funded through a common stock offering. BMNR fundamentally shifted its core corporate strategy from a primary focus on Bitcoin mining to the aggressive accumulation of Ether (ETH). This strategic pivot was met with immediate investor enthusiasm, causing BMNR's stock price to surge over 50% in a single day on July 1, 2025. Following this monumental shift, BitMine rapidly achieved several key milestones in its ETH accumulation: These rapid acquisitions, funded through various capital-raising transactions, have attracted significant support from prominent institutional investors, solidifying BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc.'s position as a leading entity in the cryptocurrency landscape. As of September 30, 2025, BMNR Corp.'s business model has significantly evolved, with a primary strategic focus on its "Ethereum treasury strategy" while maintaining its historical roots in Bitcoin mining. This is primarily funded through capital raising transactions, such as stock offerings, which are then used to purchase significant amounts of ETH. Alongside this, the company continues to engage in digital asset mining and related services. It also retains a classification within the Computer Services industry for its blockchain technology and digital asset mining operations. BMNR Corp. (BMNR) has exhibited an exceptionally volatile but ultimately highly positive stock performance over the past year, largely driven by its strategic pivot to an Ethereum treasury model. While longer-term data shows more modest gains, recent movements underscore a company undergoing rapid transformation and deeply intertwined with the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency. The trailing twelve months (TTM) total return CAGR was 332.86%. The stock closed at $53.22 on September 29, 2025, having traded within a 52-week range of $0.0964 to $161.00. While positive, these figures indicate that the most substantial growth has been concentrated in the recent year, suggesting a less consistent upward trajectory in earlier years. BMNR experienced a significant downturn, falling 88.0% from a high of $3.74 in March 2022 to $0.45 in May 2023, reflecting the broader "crypto winter," before recovering exponentially. This long-term perspective highlights that the company's recent explosive growth is a relatively new phenomenon, contrasting with a history of lower, though still positive, average annual returns. As of September 30, 2025, BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR) presents a complex financial profile, marked by rapid revenue growth, persistent unprofitability, and a valuation heavily influenced by its substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Profit Margins: BMNR is currently operating at a loss, as reflected in its negative profitability metrics:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although the market for NFTs has cooled off from its heyday several years ago, digital goods are still a hot commodity. This summer, the Ninth Circuit recognized that such goods are more than mere ephemera: they are “goods” under the Lanham Act to which trademark law applies. Yuga Labs sued artist Ryder Ripps and his collaborator for creating a nearly identical NFT collection using the same images and branding. While the court ultimately reversed summary judgment on trademark infringement due to unresolved questions about consumer confusion, it made a clear and consequential finding: NFTs are trademarkable goods. The court's reasoning wasn't limited to NFTs as a niche art form. The court reasoned that although NFTs are intangible, they are bought and sold in curated online marketplaces, functioning as commercial goods. The court distinguished NFTs from earlier cases involving intangible content embedded in physical goods (like video cassettes or karaoke tracks). The intangible elements of goods like video cassettes represented ideas or creative works that were not protectable by trademark law. That difference was key to the court's conclusion. Tellingly, the court quoted a recent Supreme Court case, stating that “we are mindful that when we apply ‘established legal rules to the ‘totally new problems'' of emerging technologies, our task is “not to ‘embarrass the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper thinks that one day retailers will only accept bitcoin as a payment. “There will be a moment when all the retailers say ‘I accept bitcoin' and then there will be a moment when retailers will say ‘I only accept bitcoin,” Draper said on Bloomberg Television. Tim Draper's support for bitcoin goes far beyond words. Draper has also backed major crypto firms, like Coinbase and Robinhood Markets, cementing his reputation as one of the sector's most influential investors. In the interview with Bloomberg, Draper acknowledged that for now, bitcoin is primarily being held, not spent — a trend fueled by its consistent value growth, which makes it a favored store of value and a hedge against inflation. He said that eventually, retailers will start accepting bitcoin as a primary payment method. According to a Tuesday SEC filing, the firm has secured $200 million for its eighth fund, with its website hinting at the official launch. Draper Associates, which manages $2 billion in assets, focuses heavily on crypto investments. The timing coincides with a strong crypto market rally. The total cryptocurrency market recently surpassed $4 trillion for the first time, buoyed by congressional legislation regulating stablecoins and Bitcoin surging past $120,000 in recent months. Draper, 67, began his venture capital career in 1985 with a $6 million loan and quickly became known for early investments in companies like Skype, Baidu, Tesla, SpaceX, and Robinhood. Draper has predicted in the past that bitcoin could hit $250,000 — a forecast that, while not yet realized, is seeming more and more likely as Bitcoin sits above $113,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are strong accumulation signs, but it comes with none of the hype. Binance's sender-to-receiver ratio just hit its lowest since early 2024, a sign of growing HODLer behavior. Only 24% of Binance-listed alts are above their 200-day SMA, a pattern linked to accumulation phases. Bitcoin's [BTC] been holding its ground and getting stronger. Even with long-term holders (LTHs) cashing in some profits, BTC barely flinched, resting near $110K through September. But now, Binance's BTC sender-to-receiver ratio just dropped, and only 24% of Binance-listed alts are trading above their 200-day MA. The 1-month MA of Binance's Bitcoin sender-to-receiver ratio just hit its lowest point since early 2024. This metric tracks how many people are sending BTC versus receiving it; and when receivers start to dominate, it indicates accumulation. Spikes in this ratio have so far lined up with market tops. Despite signs of accumulation, September wasn't exactly quiet. But rather than triggering a panic, the market barely flinched. Most of the movement came from coins held between 6 months and 5 years, with the 7-10 year category showing only light activity. That's not what you'd expect during a sell-off. Just 24% of Binance-listed altcoins are trading above their 200-day SMA; a far cry from the kind of levels we see during bull market euphoria. When this number dips close to zero, it's usually been a pretty reliable marker of big accumulation phases. In other words, the smart money may already be shopping. Trading, buying or selling cryptocurrencies should be considered a high-risk investment and every reader is advised to do their own research before making any decisions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Chinese national has been convicted following an international fraud investigation which resulted in what's believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world. The Metropolitan Police says it recovered 61,000 bitcoin worth more than £5bn ($6.7bn) in current prices. Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, pleaded guilty on Monday at Southwark Crown Court of illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. Malaysian national Seng Hok Ling, of Matlock, Derbyshire, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court of entering into a money laundering arrangement on or before 23 April 2024. According to the charge, he had been dealing in cryptocurrency on Qian's behalf, "knowing or suspecting his actions would facilitate the acquisition or control of criminal property by another". Between 2014 and 2017 Qian led a large-scale scam in China which involved cheating more than 128,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets, the Met said in a statement. Qian had been "evading justice" for five years up to her arrest, which required a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met's investigation. "By pleading guilty today, Ms Zhang hopes to bring some comfort to investors who have waited since 2017 for compensation, and to reassure them that the significant rise in cryptocurrency values means there are more than sufficient funds available to repay their losses," said Qian's solicitor Roger Sahota, of Berkeley Square Solicitors. On Tuesday, the Court heard that confiscation proceedings had begun in an effort to retrieve more than £16.2 million from Ling, with the figure to be adjusted to reflect cryptocurrency rates when he is sentenced in November. The changes would also allow some victims to apply for the release of their assets  held in accounts. Qian had help from a Chinese takeaway worker named Jian Wen, who was jailed for six years and eight months last year for her part in the criminal operation. Wen, 44, laundered the proceeds from the scam and moved from living above a restaurant to a "multi-million pound rented house" in north London, said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) earlier this year. She also bought two properties in Dubai worth more than £500,000, the CPS said. The Met said it seized more than £300m worth of bitcoin from Wen. Chinese media outlet Lifeweek reported in 2024 that investors, mostly between 50 and 75 years old, had poured "hundreds of thousands to tens of millions" of yuan into investments promoted by Qian. Some of the victims - including business people, bank employees and members of the judiciary - were reportedly urged to invest with Qian's scheme by friends and family. "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct," said deputy chief Crown prosecutor, Robin Weyell. Monday's conviction marks the "culmination of years of dedicated investigation", which has involved the police and Chinese law enforcement teams, said Will Lyne, the Met's Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command. Qian is being held in custody ahead of sentencing, which will take place on 10 November - as part of a two-day sentencing hearing at which Seng Hok Ling has also been asked to appear. UK Security Minister Dan Jarvis said the conviction sent a "clear signal" that UK wasn't a "safe haven" for criminals. "Money laundering erodes trust, undermines our economy, and fuels the rise of serious organised crime," he said in a statement. Additional reporting by Tony Han, Journalist, BBC Global China Unit. The entrepreneur is sentenced to more than seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. City Hall figures show that crimes resulting in an injury have dropped nearly 12% on last year. Fraudsters placed fake QR codes on signs and machines in eight cark parks in York, the council says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two decisions made by the Securities and Exchange Commission in recent days could unleash a wave of new exchange-traded fund launches, led by crypto ETFs. The regulatory door is now open for a wider range of crypto ETFs beyond existing bitcoin and ethereum funds, which have grown quickly. Digital currencies with smaller but loyal followings could soon be better represented and traded by investors though exchange-traded funds. "Within the next 60 to 90 days, we'll have a dozen or so new crypto-oriented products tracking things like solana or XRP, or the coins that people don't know about that are below bitcoin and ethereum, the ones everybody knows," said ETF expert David Nadig on CNBC's "ETF Edge" on Monday. There are already a handful of solana and XRP ETFs, with relatively low asset bases. The Solana ETF, for example, has $230 million in assets, according to ETFAction.com. The Volatility Shares Trust XRP has roughly $200 million in assets. Crypto-linked investment strategies are also widening in scope beyond straight single-currency spot market trades, such as new bitcoin income ETFs. Crypto "index ETFs" are also launching, among them, Grayscale Investments recently being approved by the SEC to convert a mutual fund to ETF status. The anticipated ETF boom will extend well beyond crypto. Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first asset manager to win this approval. More than 70 fund providers have applications pending and experts expect the rest to follow quickly now that Dimensional has cleared the way. Shelly Antoniewicz, lead ETF researcher and chief economist at mutual fund trade group Investment Company Institute, recently told the "ETF Edge" podcast that in addition to the 70 applications already on file with the SEC, "we've been working with hundreds to be prepared for if and when the SEC exemptive relief is allowed." According to YCharts, there are around 4,100 ETFs, which is more than the amount of individual stocks listed on U.S. markets, but that could increase by as many as 3,000 more ETFs, Nadig told "ETF Edge" back in May when discussing the highly anticipated SEC change. Taking strategies from mutual fund wrappers and making them available in ETFs offers new trading flexibility, but also risks for investors. "It means they're going to be a whole lot of new tickers you've got to worry about," Nadig said on ETF Edge on Monday. "Two big regulatory changes, both of them opening the floodgates on new products for investors," Nadig said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The SEC is exploring a plan to let blockchain-based versions of stocks trade on crypto exchanges, signaling growing support for tokenization. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly developing a plan to allow blockchain-registered versions of stocks to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges — a move that would mark a significant step toward integrating digital asset technology into the traditional financial system. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently described tokenization as an “innovation” the agency should seek to advance, not restrict. Regulators “should be focused on how do we advance innovation in the marketplace,” he said, noting that tokenized assets could improve access to financial markets and reduce costs. Platforms such as Robinhood and Kraken have begun offering tokenized stock products. At the same time, Nasdaq has requested SEC approval for a rule change that would allow it to list tokenized securities on its exchange. Crypto exchange Coinbase is also reportedly seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized equities. Still, the SEC's apparent willingness to embrace blockchain-based equities has drawn pushback from traditional finance companies. In a July note to the agency's Crypto Task Force, Citadel Securities cautioned regulators to ensure that tokenization delivers genuine market benefits rather than exploiting regulatory gaps. “Tokenized securities must achieve success by delivering real innovation and efficiency to market participants, rather than through self-serving regulatory arbitrage,” Citadel wrote. Magazine: Can Robinhood or Kraken's tokenized stocks ever be truly decentralized? While early financial tokenization efforts have focused largely on private credit and US Treasury bonds, stocks are beginning to catch up. Still, their value has nearly doubled over the past 100 days, signaling accelerating adoption. Researchers suggested that, following recent growth, tokenized equities “may be nearing a major inflection point in the broader transition to hybrid finance.” Magazine: Robinhood's tokenized stocks have stirred up a legal hornet's nest Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and gaming industries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sharps Technology (STSS) and Crypto.com announced today a partnership to expand the Solana ecosystem via institutional-grade treasury solutions. The collaboration will utilize Crypto.com's infrastructure to manage and deploy more than $400 million worth of Sharps Technology Solana holdings into a digital asset treasury strategy. The firm is among the largest corporate holders of Solana, with more than 6.8 million SOL in holdings, among giants like Forward Industries. STSS has collaborated with the custody infrastructure to manage its assets, benefiting from an institutional-grade custody platform with competitive pricing. https://t.co/vCNztATkNg and @stsssol partner to strengthen Solana ecosystem growth through institutional treasury solutions. “STSS has an ambitious vision for its digital asset treasury strategy, and we are excited to partner with them to help realize that vision. James Zhang, Strategic Advisor to STSS, confirmed that the company views its treasury strategy as part of its mission to expand an open and efficient financial infrastructure. He highlighted that Crypto.com's platform, hosting over 150 million users, provides them with institutional-grade tools and liquidity to manage their Solana treasury and contribute to the growth of the Solana ecosystem. He acknowledged that collaboration is essential in aligning STSS's long-term corporate strategy with innovation at the forefront of digital finance. After the announcement, STSS stock on NASDAQ is up 2.68%, trading at $6.90, with a day range of $6.40 – $7.09. Crypto.com, founded in 2016, has built its reputation on regulatory compliance, security, and privacy. Its institutional offerings include custody, liquidity services, and execution support for large asset managers. The firm has invited clients interested in custody solutions to submit requests via its portal. STSS core operations lie in the medical and pharmaceutical packaging, while digital asset treasury management adds as a balance sheet strategy. According to Coingecko data, the firm is ranked fourth among the corporate institutions holding SOL with 2 million SOL tokens. Forward Industries, which launched this September as a $1.65 billion Solana-focused asset treasury, has helped Solana increase its gains this year, currently at 32% over the past 12 months: Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital back the fund. Solana's total locked value is currently $11.37 billion on DefiLlama.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These tokens, including the original Punk Strategy token (PUNKSTR), are now available for trading. OpenSea announced on September 30, offering a new way for traders to engage with NFTs. These tokens aim to generate yield by managing assets with automated trading strategies. The ‘flywheel' mechanism is central to this strategy, automatically relisting NFTs at 1.2 times their purchase price. As a result, holders can earn passive income through the appreciation of these NFTs. NFT Strategy tokens have revolutionized how traders view NFTs. These tokens are no longer just collectibles; they now serve as investment instruments. OpenSea's marketplace now hosts multiple NFT Strategy tokens, including PUNKSTR, PUDGYSTR, APESTR, TOADSTR, and BIRBSTR, among others. “PunkStrategy started as an art project, and turned into a whole new token meta,” TokenWorks shared. The project aims to provide a permissionless, safe, and efficient way for users to launch their own NFT Strategy tokens. By creating this model, TokenWorks ensures that value is returned to project creators, who have previously been excluded from royalties. As part of the launch, OpenSea introduced a rewards pool for NFT Strategy tokens. The pool, valued at 20 ETH, is designed to incentivize trading of select tokens. NFT Strategy tokens allow investors to purchase NFTs in a way that offers potential returns. The automated trading system is designed to buy NFTs when their prices drop to a set floor and relist them at a higher value. When these NFTs are sold, the proceeds are used to purchase and burn the tokens, ensuring a continuous cycle of growth. Of this, 8% is directed to an Ethereum treasury, while 1% supports the collection owners through royalties.

With the new service, “businesses can now prefund Visa Direct with stablecoins,” Visa says, though recipients can elect to receive funds in their local currency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The New York Department of Financial Services issued guidance last Wednesday requiring banks engaged in cryptocurrency activities to use blockchain analytics tools, extending expectations first set for crypto firms three years ago to mainstream financial institutions. The directive applies to all state-regulated banking organizations, including foreign bank branches, marking a watershed moment in how regulators approach digital asset oversight. Blockchain analytics refers to software that monitors, traces and assesses activity on public blockchains. The tools screen customer wallets, verify fund sources, detect illicit flows like money laundering or sanctions evasion, and compare customer behavior against risk profiles. NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris made the regulatory logic clear: “As traditional banking institutions expand into virtual currency activities, their compliance functions must adapt, onboarding new tools and technologies to mitigate new and different risks.” The September guidance identified concrete use cases where banks should deploy blockchain analytics: By May 2019, FinCEN issued an advisory highlighting how convertible virtual currencies enabled ransomware, money laundering and sanctions evasion. The inflection came in April 2022, when Harris issued guidance requiring New York-licensed virtual currency businesses to adopt blockchain analytics as best practice for customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and sanctions screening. For crypto firms in New York, on-chain monitoring became a supervisory expectation. Any New York bank engaged in crypto-related activities must now integrate blockchain analytics into core risk management, not as experimental technology, but as fundamental infrastructure. New York has long been the country's most influential financial regulator. Its BitLicense regime, established in 2015, set the first comprehensive rules for digital asset companies. Its enforcement actions shaped compliance norms nationwide, including a $48.5 million penalty against Paxos for AML deficiencies and a $40 million settlement with Block over bitcoin transaction monitoring failures. By extending blockchain analytics requirements to mainstream banks, NYDFS is signaling the direction of national and likely global regulation. FinCEN already views virtual assets as vectors for ransomware and sanctions evasion. For banks with New York operations, state rules often become de facto national standards. Regulators in Europe and Asia watch how New York sets expectations. Blockchain analytics could quickly evolve from state requirement to global compliance baseline. It must integrate with existing KYC, AML and suspicious activity reporting infrastructure. Compliance officers accustomed to traditional transaction monitoring will need training on wallet analysis, mixers, privacy coins and other blockchain-specific risks. Demand for wallet-screening, sanctions checks and real-time monitoring tools will surge as banks close compliance gaps. The market for blockchain intelligence platforms, dominated by firms like Chainalysis, Elliptic and TRM Labs, could expand substantially. Yet the shift also raises questions about privacy, proportionality and competitive intelligence. Continuous blockchain surveillance means banks can track customer transactions across multiple platforms and geographies. Regulators demand transparency, but banks must balance surveillance with customer trust and data protection obligations. Compliance teams need to inventory existing crypto exposures, whether through direct offerings, customer activity or third-party relationships, and map those risks against current monitoring capabilities. Written AML programs must explicitly address blockchain analytics deployment, including which tools will be used, how alerts will be escalated, and how findings integrate with suspicious activity reporting. Compliance staff must understand blockchain-specific typologies: mixers and tumblers that obscure transaction trails, high-risk jurisdictions flagged through IP addresses, wallet addresses linked to sanctioned entities or darknet markets. Many banks will need external expertise to build this capability. For institutions that move decisively, blockchain analytics offers more than regulatory compliance. It provides competitive intelligence on emerging risks and customer behaviors that traditional monitoring misses. For those that delay, the consequences are clear: enforcement actions, reputational damage and loss of regulatory trust in a market where bank supervisors now expect on-chain visibility as standard practice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While stablecoins are less volatile than regular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, they are not, despite their name, inherently stable. Allowing banks to create their own could further destabilise the eurozone's already turbulent economy, and will amplify the impacts of any future market crash. Cryptocurrency, and stablecoins in particular, can be understood as digital casino tokens. The following night you go to Casino B. At the entrance, you realise that you don't have any cash, only the Casino A token. There are two takeaways from this story. First, being able to use the token from Casino A in Casino B is a good thing. Otherwise, you would have needed to go to Casino A, convert the token into a euro, go back to Casino B, and exchange it for a Casino B token. Directly exchanging the tokens reduces transaction costs. If our hypothetical casinos trust one another, it doesn't matter who issues the token – a token from either casino is always worth one euro. Problems arise when casinos start distrusting each other. In our example, the boss in Casino B could have said “you can accept it but at a discount, give him only half a Casino B-token.” They might even say “Casino A? Now, imagine that these tokens are digital instead of physical, and can be sent instantaneously, much like an email. As stated above, 9 eurozone banks are planning to issue a euro stablecoin. We can think of these banks as Casino A in our example. You will be able to go to one of these banks and purchase “their stablecoin” in exchange for one euro – most likely more than one euro (banks will want to earn a fee from it). The main advantage of “their coin” is that you will be able to make transfers instantaneously. A euro stablecoin might seem great, but there is one major condition to maintaining its value: everyone has to trust these particular banks. We know that this isn't always the case – people can quickly lose faith in banks, and banks often don't even trust each other. In a financial crisis, trust can vanish overnight. We don't need to look far into the past for evidence of this. Banks were not sure about the quality of other banks' assets, so they were afraid to lend them money. If they were afraid of lending a bank money, they certainly wouldn't be happy to accept “their coin” without a hefty discount. Champions of stablecoins will undoubtedly argue that we don't need to worry because there will be regulations making sure that the banks have enough assets to back this token. However, history has shown us that the price of assets can unexpectedly decline during a financial crisis. This loss of trust led to the market crash of 2008, but it would have been far worse with stablecoins in the picture. If there had been stablecoins in 2008, holders of Spanish government debt (or subprime MBS) would not only have seen the value of their own assets collapse, but also those of all the people who had decided to place their savings in stablecoins. There are potential benefits to having digital currency. Imagine you have a deposit in the European Central Bank (ECB), and you can use its token to make instantaneous transactions (from buying coffee to transferring it to your daughter studying abroad). Under these circumstances, the choice seems obvious. An official, ECB-backed digital euro is a much better proposition than a consortium of private banks competing to promote their own, inherently unstable, digital coin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tether (CRYPTO: USDT)-backed stablecoin blockchain Plasma (CRYPTO: XPL) has retraced by over 33%, following its 100% price increase after the token launch on Sept. 25. What Happened: Economist Alex Kruger explained that a ~40% drop over two days was driven by profit-taking from recently unlocked non-U.S. initial coin offering participants, with abnormally high funding pointing to continued spot selling. Once this eases, a strong upward move is expected. Trader Altcoin Sherpa noted relentless selling with little rebound, taking a loss on perpetuals but holding spot XPL and targeting $1 as a buy zone. They cautioned that "catching falling knives" is risky, as momentum and supply control often outweigh fundamentals. Trader Lord Durden highlighted that calling a "generational bottom" too early can be misleading. Key bullish triggers include support reclaims, retests, and a 4-hour downtrend breakout. Daily support at $1.11 is crucial, with further levels noted if price falls. Why It Matters: Aave's deposits on the Plasma chain exceeded $6.5 billion since mainnet launch, making it the second-largest Aave deployment within a week. On Sept. 25, Plasma launched its XPL token, introducing a digital bank, Plasma One, and distributing 25 million tokens to pre-depositors, regardless of their investment size. The distribution strategy assures broad and aligned ownership.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What SWIFT's Shared Ledger Means for 24/7 Global Payments, XRP and HBAR. Its messaging rails connect over 11,000 institutions in more than 200 countries, enabling trillions of dollars to move across borders daily. Yet, despite its global reach, the SWIFT system has long faced criticism for being slow, expensive, and limited to the operating hours of participating banks. In contrast to speculation that SWIFT might adopt the XRP Ledger or Hedera Hashgraph for its blockchain transition, the organization has refuted that narrative by selecting Linea, an Ethereum layer-2, for its first major pilot. In September 2025, SWIFT confirmed it is progressing with blockchain integration , testing shared ledger technology to enable real-time, 24/7 cross-border settlement. This development has the potential to reshape international payments by addressing long-standing inefficiencies and positioning SWIFT as a bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain-powered future.

Contrary to popular belief, SWIFT does not move money itself. Funds move through corresponding accounts, often via intermediary banks, before landing in the final destination. This reliance on messaging rather than direct settlement has historically made SWIFT reliable but slow: What has kept SWIFT indispensable is its role as a neutral, global infrastructure. Unlike proprietary payment networks, SWIFT doesn't privilege one currency, bank, or jurisdiction over another. It operates as common rails that all institutions can trust, precisely because it is not owned by any single central bank or private entity. However, the above inefficiencies contrast with the rise of blockchain-based payment systems (via stablecoins, for example), where transfers can settle in minutes, or even seconds, and operate 24/7. Instead of merely sending payment instructions, SWIFT would maintain or interoperate with a distributed ledger that records the actual transactions in near real time. Over 30 global financial institutions (see image below) are collaborating with SWIFT to design a shared digital ledger, with the first use case targeting real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments. While many in the crypto community speculated that SWIFT's blockchain rails might run directly on XRP or other payment-native tokens, the organization's first major pilot is instead being conducted on Linea, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by ConsenSys. In short, SWIFT's move to Linea highlights its intent to remain the neutral backbone of global payments, integrating blockchain while maintaining optionality on which tokens ultimately power liquidity. In short, a shared ledger brings global payments into the internet era: instant, programmable, and always available. By leveraging distributed ledger technology (DLT), SWIFT aims to address many of the long-standing pain points in traditional correspondent banking. Below are some of the potential benefits such a shift could bring: If SWIFT's blockchain rails support such tokenized funds, investors could move capital between banks, funds, and DeFi platforms instantly, with compliance built in. This would blur the line between traditional settlement and on-chain liquidity management. By 2030, if SWIFT's blockchain adoption succeeds, you could see: SWIFT's embrace of blockchain marks a turning point in global finance. By moving beyond messaging to shared ledgers, SWIFT acknowledges that the old model of delayed, costly cross-border payments no longer fits the digital age. Crypto What SWIFT's Cross-Border Retail Payments Scheme Means — Not Trialing XRP? Crypto Why the Fireblocks Network for Payments Could Do What SWIFT and XRP Haven't While SWIFT doesn't move money, it's the critical “plumbing” for global payments. What does it mean for SWIFT to use blockchain? Instead of just sending payment messages, SWIFT plans to use a shared ledger where transactions themselves are recorded and settled in near real time. How would a shared ledger model work in practice? Banks could tokenize balances and settle transfers instantly on-chain. Smart contracts would automate compliance checks, and the ledger could interoperate with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). How does this impact the crypto and digital asset ecosystem? SWIFT's blockchain rails could support regulated stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and real-world assets. This validates the blockchain approach while introducing competition for crypto-native payment networks like RippleNet or Stellar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US SEC just tore down one of crypto's longest-standing hurdles. Analysts say approvals could arrive in days instead of months… A timeline that has already lit up the altcoin market. With Chairman Paul Atkins declaring crypto a top priority, and speculation swirling around $XRP ETFs, sentiment has turned sharply bullish. Crypto ETFs represent far more than a convenient way to buy coins. They're a stamp of legitimacy from Wall Street, opening the gates for pension funds, registered investment advisors, and institutional allocators to funnel billions into digital assets. Now, thanks to new generic listing standards, only an S-1 is required. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas notes how odds are really 100% now, and the SEC could move any day if it wants to accelerate approvals. Combined with the SEC's clear signal that crypto is a ‘priority,' this shift puts altcoins squarely in focus. The next wave of capital won't just chase established names. If ETFs accelerate Bitcoin adoption by drawing in institutional capital, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will amplify what you can actually do with that liquidity. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine, Hyper plans to transform Bitcoin with a high-speed Layer-2, opening the door for instant payments, DeFi applications, and meme coin experimentation – areas the base chain has never been able to support efficiently. The process will be straightforward: you bridge $BTC in, it's minted on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2, and transactions settle back to Bitcoin Layer-1 via zero-knowledge proofs. That means you keep Bitcoin's security while gaining sub-second speed and near-zero fees. In practice, Bitcoin Hyper will make $BTC usable the way $ETH is for smart contracts. If ETFs draw institutions into Bitcoin, Hyper is where retail traders, builders, and meme coin culture will follow. ETF approvals may bring big institutions into Bitcoin and Ethereum, but many retail traders are building their own playground elsewhere – inside Telegram. It will power a full-stack trading bot that lives directly in a Telegram chat, giving you the ability to swap, snipe new launches, set stop-losses, copy trades, and check your portfolio without ever leaving the app. Holding $SNORT will cut trading fees down to 0.85%, lower than major competitors at 1.5%. Its beta tests have also flagged 85% of rugpulls and honeypots, while its instant-sniping tool will let you buy meme tokens the moment a pool goes live. The trading bot market itself is booming, forecast to reach $200B+ by 2035, and bots like Bonk Bot have already proven the appetite on Solana. Snorter blends that same speed with meme coin branding, but beneath the humor is a real piece of trading infrastructure. Join the official Snorter Token presale before it's too late. Fresh data shows Aster handling $66.4B in 24h perps volume, with 30-day totals north of $356B. Token-wise, $ASTER is currently trading around $1.78 with a $2.96B market cap and $1.09B in daily volume. Backing from YZi Labs (ex-Binance Labs) and an open endorsement from former Binance CEO CZ himself – who said Aster competes with Binance, but helps $BNB – only adds weight. For traders priced out of CEXs, $ASTER could become the DEX that absorbs ETF-fueled flows once they filter into DeFi. Buy $ASTER today through MEXC and other leading platforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The partnership aims to build a payment platform that not only uses digital tokens but also connects them with NFTs, opening doors for creative new use cases Their shared goal is to launch a new platform by the first half of 2026. XRPL will power a new payment platform that links unique tokens with NFTs. One of the most exciting ideas being explored is NFTs that double as “digital souvenirs” or discount vouchers for future travel bookings. Now with 28.2 million visitors expected at events like the Osaka World Expo, this system shows real potential for large-scale use. For Tobu Top Tours, it's a new way to engage travelers, while also supporting Japan's fan economy and local communities. Customers could eventually use it for dining, shopping, and regional services, making payments more seamless while also unlocking new possibilities for businesses and local communities. By tying tokens and NFTs together, the project is aiming to deliver more than just faster transactions, it's about creating real-world utility. The initiative represents a departure from traditional NFTs as pure digital art collectibles. Since the introduction of NFT support in 2022 through XLS-20, developers have been able to build features like royalties and anti-spam protection. More recently, DynamicNFTs (XLS-46) have enabled NFTs that can change over time, opening new opportunities in gaming, ticketing, and identity solutions. SBI Ripple Asia and Tobu Top Tours plan to launch the platform in the first half of 2026, aiming to integrate tokens, NFTs, and seamless digital payments. NFTs will work as digital souvenirs or discount vouchers, giving travelers unique perks and interactive ways to engage with destinations and local services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rebranding highlights the company's independent growth and expanded focus on driving TradFi's transition to DeFi These tools make it easy for Web 2.0 asset issuers to access the growing ecosystem on Provenance Blockchain and adopt blockchain technology at scale. More than a dozen issuers are currently building with NU's assistance, including infineo, a life insurance firm with more than $625M in on-chain policies. NU's expanded focus is driven by NUVA (NUVA.finance), a vault marketplace that powers blockchain native institutional-quality financial products that are liquid, composable, transparent, and accessible. Launching Q4, 2025, NUVA users can select from a curated group of high-quality yielding assets while NUVA issuers get access to new distribution channels across multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana and Base. NUVA is supported by NU Digital, a subsidiary of NU and a joint venture with Animoca Brands, the leading Hong Kong based Web3 builder and investor. "During NU's first year of operation, we successfully built world-class digital infrastructure necessary to bring institutional quality assets on-chain," said Anthony Moro, CEO of NU. "Now, with NUVA, we are every asset issuer's one stop, full lifecycle, blockchain solution. The rebranding to NU does a better job of recognizing our more expansive role, and better aligns our family of brands" "The company is innovating in ways that are accretive to Provenance Blockchain, and we at Figure look forward to seeing YLDS and Democratized Prime assets distributed through NUVA, using NU's vault infrastructure." We're pleased with NU's continued progress following their strategic spin out late last year," said June Ou, Executive Director of Provenance Blockchain Foundation. "We look forward to having them as part of the Provenance Blockchain ecosystem to help establish Provenance as the leading platform for financial services." NU powers digital asset issuers with a full lifecycle of blockchain infrastructure support that enables the tokenization and management of real-world assets at scale. From structuring advice and mission-critical APIs and SaaS services, to broad, multi-chain Web3 distribution through the NUVA marketplace, NU is perfectly positioned to help bring trillions of dollars of assets on-chain. NU is a leading developer and integration partner on Provenance Blockchain, the world's largest public Layer 1 blockchain network with over $16 billion in real-world assets total value locked (TVL).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund has overtaken Deribit as the largest venue for BTC$113,273.25 options in an indication of how accreditation and institutional capital is reshaping crypto derivatives trading. The flip comes less than a year after IBIT options went live in November. IBIT, already the world's largest spot bitcoin ETF, with $84 billion in assets, has quickly become a magnet for institutional flows. Its growth cycle is reinforcing liquidity and legitimacy, pulling activity into regulated markets that once sat firmly offshore. But IBIT's surge signals a structural power shift as options once driven by high-leverage offshore venues are increasingly anchored in the U.S. Meanwhile, Checkonchain data shows IBIT ETF's leverage ratio has reached 45%, near all-time highs. This concentration indicates that IBIT and Deribit together command almost 90% of the BTC options market. Combined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025 The token fell from $0.38 to $0.36 over a 23-hour stretch, with heavy resistance at $0.38 and sustained downside momentum signaling bearish sentiment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A broad V-shaped day: Fidelity funds dominated while Ark, Grayscale and Bitwise added; flows bolster risk appetite after weeks of outflows. US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew more than $1 billion in net inflows on Sept. 29, signaling renewed investor confidence after weeks of heavy outflows. The sharp turnaround also came as the broader crypto market sentiment improved and prices staged a notable rebound. Data from SoSoValue shows that Bitcoin ETFs captured $521.95 million in inflows, with Fidelity's FBTC accounting for the bulk of activity. Other major contributors included Ark 21Shares' ARKB, which saw $62.18 million in inflows, Grayscale's BTC and Bitwise's BITB, which contributed approximately $47 million each, and Invesco's BTCO attracted $35.34 million in fresh capital. Notably, BlackRock's IBIT, the dominant Bitcoin ETF, was the only product to register losses, with $46.64 million in outflows. This marked the fund's third day of withdrawals in September. The inflows coincided with a sharp recovery in asset prices, reinforcing the view that institutional demand remains highly sensitive to market signals. Timothy Misir, head of research at BRN, pointed out that Bitcoin climbed back to $114,000, erasing much of the prior week's losses and forming a sharp V-shaped recovery. According to him, BTC investors consistently defended the $110,000 to $111,000 range, creating a sequence of higher lows that strengthened bullish conviction. Misir continued that the resistance lies between $115,000 and $116,300. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.
