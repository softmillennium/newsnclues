                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Along with the model, the company also launched a linked social app called Sora, where users can be able to generate videos of themselves and their friends to share on a TikTok-style algorithmic feed. OpenAI's work on a new social platform was previously reported by Wired. While we haven't been able to test the invite-only app and Sora 2 model ourselves yet, OpenAI has shared impressive examples. OpenAI's public clips depict a beach volleyball game, skateboard tricks, gymnastics routines, and cannonball jumps from a diving board, among others. “Prior video models are overoptimistic — they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. The Sora app comes with an “upload yourself” feature called “cameos,” which allows users to drop themselves into any Sora-generated scenes. This feature also allows users to share their “cameos” with their friends, allowing them to give other users the permission to include their likeness in videos that they generate, including videos of multiple people together. While the Sora social platform is currently invite-only, ChatGPT Pro users should be able to try out the Sora 2 Pro model without an invite. Once videos are generated, they can be shared in a feed within the Sora app, which seems like it'll be similar to TikTok, Instagram Reels, or other short form video feeds. Interestingly, Meta announced just last week that it added a video feed called “Vibes” to its Meta AI app (it's basically all mindless slop). The Sora app also ships with parental controls via ChatGPT, which allow parents to override infinite scroll limits, turn off algorithmic personalization, and manage who can direct message their child. The Sora app will be free at launch, which OpenAI says is “so people can freely explore its capabilities.” The company says that at launch, the only plan for monetization to charge users to generate extra videos in times of high demand. The launch of a social platform will require significant user safety measures from OpenAI, which has struggled with the same issues in ChatGPT.

The thruster is part of a propulsion system that converts concentrated sunlight into heat. Solar thermal propulsion would make Supernova more maneuverable than traditional spacecraft — with the ability to change orbits within hours or days, rather than weeks or months. “With maneuverability becoming a defining advantage in space operations, Supernova is built to give national security and commercial operators the ability to reposition, respond and persist across orbits,” Portal CEO Jeff Thornburg said today in a news release. “This propulsion system unlocks mission tactics and timelines that traditional chemical or electric systems simply can't support.” Supernova's first full-scale demonstration mission is currently scheduled for launch in 2026. Last year, Portal received a commitment of $45 million in funding through the U.S. Air Force's SpaceWERX STRATFI program to support spacecraft development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peter Thiel's Armageddon speaking tour has—like the world—not ended yet. For a full two years now, the billionaire has been on the circuit, spreading his biblically inflected ideas about doomsday through a set of variably and sometimes visibly perplexed interviewers. Depending on who you are, you may find it hilarious, fascinating, insufferable, or horrifying that one of the world's most powerful men is obsessing over a figure from sermons and horror movies. No video cameras recorded the event, and no reporters wrote about it, but I've been able to reconstruct it by talking to people who were there. The venue was a yearly conference of scholars devoted to Thiel's chief intellectual influence, the late French-American theorist René Girard. And from the dais, Thiel delivered a nearly hourlong account of his thoughts on Armageddon—and all the things he believed were “not enough” to prevent it. Our “listless” and “zombie” age, he said, is marked by a growing hostility to innovation, plummeting fertility rates, too much yoga, and a culture mired in the “endless Groundhog Day of the worldwide web.” But in its neurotic desperation to avoid technological Armageddon—the real threats of nuclear war, environmental catastrophe, runaway AI—modern civilization has become susceptible to something even more dangerous: the Antichrist. According to some Christian traditions, the Antichrist is a figure that will unify humanity under one rule before delivering us to the apocalypse. For Thiel, its evil is pretty much synonymous with any attempt to unite the world. “How might such an Antichrist rise to power?” Thiel asked. “By playing on our fears of technology and seducing us into decadence with the Antichrist's slogan: peace and safety.” In other words: It would yoke together a terrified species by promising to rescue it from the apocalypse. By way of illustration, Thiel suggested that the Antichrist might appear in the form of someone like the philosopher Nick Bostrom—an AI doomer who wrote a paper in 2019 proposing to erect an emergency system of global governance, predictive policing, and restrictions on technology. Thiel saw potential Antichrists in a whole zeitgeist of people and institutions “focused single-mindedly on saving us from progress, at any cost.” For reasons grounded in Girardian theory, Thiel believed that such a regime could only—after decades of sickly, pent-up energy—set off an all-out explosion of vicious, civilization-ending violence. And he wasn't sure whether any katechons could hold it off. Thiel—who often has a tendency to stonewall or steamroll his interlocutors—squinted in the speaker's direction, trying to determine exactly who was pushing back. The voice had the rounded vowels and soft Rs of a recognizably Austrian accent and conveyed a quiet, familiar authority. The voice belonged to Wolfgang Palaver, a 64-year old theologian from Innsbruck, Austria, whom Thiel had last seen in 2016, the year they both delivered eulogies at Girard's funeral. Six months later, Thiel delivered his Armageddon lecture again, now at The Catholic University of America. According to a recap posted by one attendee, Thiel's argument was pretty much the same. Except this time Thiel told his listeners how they might personally navigate the slender path between Armageddon and the Antichrist: “Go to church.” Palaver's papers critiqued a lesser-known, theological, and apocalyptic line of Schmitt's thinking—and they seem to have fascinated Thiel ever since the two men first met in 1996. In his recent doomsday lectures and interviews, Thiel's language often mirrors Palaver's scholarship directly, sometimes closely paraphrasing it. (Thiel did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment.) You know you live in strange times when one of the most influential billionaires in the world—an investor who lit the financial fuses on both Facebook and the AI revolution, who cofounded PayPal and Palantir and launched the career of an American vice president—starts dedicating his public appearances primarily to a set of ideas about Armageddon borrowed heavily from a Nazi jurist. But the times have been even weirder for Palaver. A lifelong peace activist, he first wrote about Schmitt's apocalyptic theories in hopes of driving a stake through their heart. Yet for years now, Palaver has watched as his own Girardian take on Schmitt seems to have provided a roadmap not only for Thiel's speaking tour but for his considerable strategic interventions in global politics—from his investments in military tech to his role in shaping the careers of JD Vance and Donald Trump to his support of the National Conservatism movement. If Thiel takes his own thinking seriously, he seems to regard these moves as interventions in the end of human history. For the past year or so, the two men have been in regular touch, meeting together once at Thiel's home and debating with each other over text and email. In August, Palaver even hosted Thiel at the University of Innsbruck for a two-day, closed-door “dress rehearsal” of the billionaire's four-part San Francisco Antichrist lecture series. In an interview with the Austrian news outlet Falter, Palaver said he'd agreed to the event with Thiel “in the hope of getting him to reconsider his positions.” In my own months of conversation with Palaver, he has said he fears that the investor has arrived at a potentially catastrophic interpretation of Schmitt. Palaver has been reluctant to oppose Thiel publicly, and in our conversations he sometimes downplays his own influence and disagreements with the billionaire. Perhaps that's because, as followers of Girard, both men believe that any two figures who oppose each other strongly enough—as Palaver has opposed Schmitt, as Thiel opposes the Antichrist—are bound to mimic each other and become entangled. As Thiel himself has said, “Perhaps if you talk too much about Armageddon, you are secretly pushing the agenda of the Antichrist.” In some ways, Palaver and Thiel have always been mirror images of each other. The landscape of his childhood was idyllic: rolling valleys and meadows, dotted with small churches and boxed in by towering, snow-capped mountain ranges. A key concept for Rene Girard, Thiel's biggest intellectual influence. Scapegoat mechanism: The process by which humans find unity—and relief from mimetic rivalry—in ganging up on one target who gets blamed for all the community's problems. Apocalypse: For some Girardians, the final explosion of violence that will result from unchecked mimetic rivalry in an age of world-killing weaponry. After World War II, Schmitt's vision of the katechon was for a fragmented world of nationalist states, with no global unity. Girard's core insight, Palaver would learn, is that all humans are imitators, beginning with their wants. “Once their natural needs are satisfied, humans desire intensely,” Girard wrote, “but they don't know exactly what they desire.” So people mimic the aspirations of their most impressive neighbors—“thus ensuring for themselves lives of perpetual strife and rivalry with those they simultaneously hate and admire.” According to Girard, this “mimesis”—this relentless copying—builds as it ricochets across relationships. In groups, everyone starts to look alike as they converge on a few models, ape the same desires, and furiously compete for the same objects. And the only reason this “mimetic rivalry” ever fails to break out into omnidirectional warfare is that, at some point, it tends to get channeled into a war of all against one. Via something Girard called the “scapegoat mechanism,” everyone aligns against an unfortunate target who is held responsible for the group's ills. This mechanism is so essential to cultural cohesion, Girard wrote, that scapegoat narratives are the founding myths of every archaic culture. But the arrival of Christianity, Girard believed, marked a turning point in human consciousness—because it revealed, once and for all, that scapegoats are actually innocent and mobs are depraved. With this epiphany, Girard wrote, the old scapegoating rituals instantly started to lose their effectiveness, having been unmasked and discredited. Humanity no longer gets the same relief from collective acts of violence. What awaits us at the end of history, then, is the unchecked, contagious, and ultimately apocalyptic violence of mimetic rivalry. Imitation remains inescapable, but we can choose our models. And the sound path forward, as he saw it, is to mimic Jesus—the one model who will never become a “fascinating rival”—in leading lives of Christian non-violence. Girard's theory almost immediately became a lodestar for the young Palaver, who recognized it as a bridge between his peace activism and theology. “You discover Girard,” Palaver says, “and you suddenly have a perfect tool to criticize all the scapegoaters.” And the young activist already had certain major scapegoaters in his sights. In 1983—the same year as that first class on Girard—the bishop of Innsbruck tried to stop Palaver from rallying a group of young Catholics to join the largest-ever protest against American missiles in Europe. Dismissing Palaver's views as geopolitical naivete, the bishop told him to read a German essay collection called Illusions of Brotherhood: The Necessity of Having Enemies. The book, Palaver realized, was full of references to an idea—coined by Carl Schmitt—that politics is grounded in distinguishing friends from enemies. Reading the book, Palaver realized he was “more or less against every sentence.” He would use Girardian theory against a legal architect of Europe's last great calamity, who was now inspiring the Cold Warriors stoking its next. “Focusing upon Schmitt,” he explained, “meant for me turning against the archenemy of my pacifist attitude.” But Girard himself continued to develop his theories in relative obscurity across the Atlantic, at Stanford University. So it's not surprising that Thiel found himself drawn to Robert Hamerton-Kelly, a cantankerous, theologically conservative Stanford campus minister who once referred to himself as a “bumpkin from South Africa armed with fascist boarding school education.” Hamerton-Kelly taught classes on Western Civilization and, according to the school newspaper, was booed on at least one occasion by anti-Apartheid audiences on campus. And it was through him that Thiel got to know Girard personally. Hamerton-Kelly was one of Girard's closest friends at Stanford and one of mimetic theory's loudest champions in the United States. By Thiel's own admission, his initial attraction to Girard's mimetic thinking was simply contrarian. “It was very much out of temper with the times,” Thiel said in a 2009 interview, “so it had a sort of natural appeal to a somewhat rebellious undergraduate.” Beyond that, Thiel's first impression was that mimetic theory was “crazy.” But at some point, Thiel came to realize that—contrary to Ayn Rand's fantasy of a few heroic, self-determined individualists striding against a backdrop of pale conformists—no one is immune to imitative desire and its frustrations. “From the outside it was a place where everybody wanted to get in,” Thiel would later say. “On the inside, it was a place where everybody wanted to get out.” Then, when he applied to clerk under the conservative US Supreme Court justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, both men turned him down. By his own account, Girard's theory of rivalry was gradually hitting home for the hyper-mimetic Thiel. “As I had this rolling quarter-life crisis in my twenties,” he has said, “there was something about this intense competition and desire to win that I came to question.” On numerous occasions, Thiel has described his investment in Facebook as a wager on the explanatory power of Girardian theory. “I bet on mimesis,” Thiel would later say. Finally, after a brief stint as a derivatives trader at Credit Suisse Group, Thiel headed home to the Bay Area to launch the career in tech that would make him famous. Schmitt's “greatest failure,” Palaver told his audience, “had been to think that Hitler was a katechon able to prevent the coming of a destructive world state.” But Schmitt's katechon, Palaver said, was doomed from the start. “Far too late did Schmitt realize that his support of Hitler was actually serving the Antichrist,” Palaver told the Girardians. Schmitt was correct to warn against “the totalitarian dangers of a unified world,” but the old scapegoating rituals were no longer sustainable. His katechon had been an Antichrist all along. If the old structures for containing violence no longer work, a violent world-ending apocalypse seems all but inevitable. By creating systems that permit violence against scapegoats, one might be able to postpone the far greater violence of the apocalypse. But for Palaver, the only morally acceptable answer was clear. Even if scapegoating could hold off the apocalypse for a time, we should not scapegoat. He ended his paper by quoting Girard's call for “the definitive renunciation of violence.” The “strange new thoughts” Thiel wanted his audience to entertain were, it turned out, largely those of Carl Schmitt. “He was familiar with Schmitt,” Palaver told me, because he knew Schmitt had been important to Leo Strauss, a key intellectual influence among conservatives around the time Thiel was running the Stanford Review. But much of Schmitt's writing, taboo as it was, had never been translated into English. Now here was Palaver's scholarship, bridging the gap between Thiel's interest in conservative political theory and the work of René Girard, and Thiel was eager to discuss it. That day, they joined around 20 other participants for an after-party at Girard's house. “Usually in academia, not many people will eagerly listen,” he said. “ So I was happy to find a conversation partner who was really interested in the topic.” It would be years before Palaver started to realize how much their fascinations with the same subject diverged. The gathering was a small, closed symposium with only eight participants and served as Thiel's self-orchestrated debut as a Girardian intellectual. “Today, mere self-preservation forces all of us to look at the world anew, to think strange new thoughts, and thereby to awaken from that very long and profitable period of intellectual slumber and amnesia that is so misleadingly called the Enlightenment.” The “strange new thoughts” Thiel wanted his audience to entertain were, it turned out, largely those of Carl Schmitt. Where Palaver had been repulsed, Thiel extolled Schmitt's “robust conception of the political,” in which “humans are forced to choose between friends and enemies,” and everything else is delusion. The West, with its fetish for individual rights and procedures, was not. Schmitt, Thiel conjectured, would have responded to 9/11 by calling for a holy crusade against Islam. But the West was instead slipping beyond politics altogether, Thiel seemed to fear, toward the creation of a bland “world-embracing economic and technical organization.” This was Schmitt's nightmare scenario. In such a world, Thiel said, “a representation of reality might appear to replace reality: Instead of violent wars, there could be violent video games; instead of heroic feats, there could be thrilling amusement park rides; instead of serious thought, there could be ‘intrigues of all sorts,' as in a soap opera.” But that counterfeit reality, Thiel argued, would just be the “brief harmony that prefigures the final catastrophe of the Apocalypse”—the harmony, in Schmitt's telling, of the Antichrist. Thiel's discussion of Schmitt didn't mention Hitler or the Nazis once. Then, about halfway through his paper, Thiel switched gears completely. As if having second thoughts, he ruled out Schmitt's “drastic solutions” as “fraught with far too much violence” in an age of nuclear weapons. Then he shifted toward imagining “a way to fortify the modern West” that involved working around democratic institutions via misdirection, hidden meanings, and a lack of transparency—an approach he identified with the theorist Leo Strauss. “A direct path forward is prevented by America's constitutional machinery,” Thiel said. “Still, there are more possibilities for action than first appear.” Strangely for someone so suspicious of global unity, Thiel saw one such possibility for action in the creation of a worldwide surveillance network. “Instead of the United Nations, filled with interminable and inconclusive parliamentary debates that resemble Shakespearean tales told by idiots,” Thiel said, “we should consider … the secret coordination of the world's intelligence services, as the decisive path to a truly global pax Americana.” This surveillance supersystem, Thiel wrote, could act as “a political framework that operates outside the checks and balances of representative democracy as described in high school textbooks.” Sitting down the seminar table from Thiel, Palaver had no idea that Thiel had more than an academic interest in spycraft. Just a year earlier, Thiel had quietly incorporated a new company called Palantir Technologies, where he would spend the next two decades developing some of the most sophisticated surveillance infrastructure in human history. But it would soon land its first major client: the CIA. You feel that he was worried.” After 9/11, Palaver sighs, “I think Thiel's first reaction was: We have to build tools to never again be in a situation where people can sneak into the United States without discovery.” “I bet on mimesis,” Thiel would later say. This would be a world order “based on the equilibrium of several independent large blocs,” as Palaver summarized it in 1996. In Schmitt's multipolar world order, each hegemonic power would have its own distinct “culture, race, language, and national heritage.” The world would be disunified by design. In July of 2019, Thiel went onstage to present a keynote lecture at the inaugural US conference of a new international political force: the National Conservatism movement. Established that year by the Israeli political theorist Yoram Hazony, National Conservatives are opposed to “universalist ideologies” and want to “see a world of independent nations—each pursuing its own national interests and upholding national traditions that are its own—as the only genuine alternative.” In 2021, Thiel was listed among the conference's biggest donors of $50,000 or more. Among the relatively few people associated with National Conservatism who do cite Schmitt openly in their own work are Thiel and Michael Anton, the essayist and sometime Trump administration official. In 2023, Thiel returned to Schmitt's ideas yet again when he gave his first major lecture on the Antichrist before the Girardians in Paris. As Palaver recalls it, Thiel responded that, in fact, he hoped they could discuss the substance of his lecture more deeply. So a year later, at Thiel's invitation, Palaver flew to California to meet with Thiel in his sprawling Los Angeles home. Before he arrived, the theologian was surprised to learn that Thiel had already decided what they would discuss: one of Palaver's old papers critiquing Schmitt. As time went on, Palaver realized that he may have become a major vehicle for his once-taboo archenemy's thought. “Some of those crazy ideas were really presented by myself for the first time,” Palaver says in his somewhat broken English. “And now they are all over the place.” As the National Conservatism movement picked up steam, its members began angling to have a man in the White House by 2024. They pinned their early hopes on Ron DeSantis, but when his campaign fizzled out, all eyes turned toward Ohio senator JD Vance. It's no secret that Vance is largely a product of Thiel—the billionaire has helped architect nearly every professional endeavor of Vance's adult life, including his meteoric political rise. “His theory of mimetic rivalry—that we tend to compete over the things that other people want—spoke directly to some of the pressures I experienced at Yale,” Vance wrote. As Vance put it, “Christ is the scapegoat who reveals our imperfections, and forces us to look at our own flaws rather than blame our society's chosen victims.” In applying this to his own life, Vance focused mainly on his generation's petty online habits in the 2010s. “Mired in the swamp of social media, we identified a scapegoat and digitally pounced,” he wrote. “We were keyboard warriors, unloading on people via Facebook and Twitter, blind to our own problems.” It was a fairly shallow gloss on Girard's theory. But to many Girardians, it suggested Vance knew exactly what he was doing when—two months after Donald Trump selected him as a running mate—the nominee began tweeting that immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating domestic pets. And when, on the campaign trail and in televised debates, he contorted himself to blame nearly every American crisis on immigrants. The mimetic theorist Bernard Perret lambasted Vance and his billionaire mentor in a French political journal, accusing them of “casting a shadow over Girard's legacy.” Within months, several more prominent Girardians followed suit. “It's difficult to claim Girard, who fundamentally believes that violence is linked to exclusion, and at the same time to accuse Haitians of eating dogs,” Girardian scholar Paul Dumouchel told a Canadian newspaper. It's possible that Vance may have genuinely misunderstood the scapegoat mechanism. Or he may have been familiar enough with Girardian mimetic theory to recognize that, while the old sacred rituals might not work perfectly, they aren't entirely broken yet. Collective acts of violence still bind people together somewhat—perhaps enough to win an election. “They now have a single purpose, which is to prevent the scapegoat from harming them by expelling and destroying him.” By February of 2025, Thiel's Armageddon tour had gotten to the point where he was handing out T-shirts that said “Don't Immanentize the Katechon.” (This was a nerdy Thielian play on the anti-utopian quote, “Don't immanentize the eschaton”—meaning don't try to manifest heaven on Earth.) In a recent interview, Thiel was asked whether or not Donald Trump might be the katechon, and he refused to answer. His reticence to name a katechon is a lesson he seems to take directly from Palaver's account of Schmitt and Hitler. “If you identify too much as one thing, that can go very wrong,” Thiel told Cowen. Throughout Thiel's strange circuit as an itinerant preacher, he and Palaver have been in frequent touch. The first time I spoke with Palaver, he'd recently emailed Thiel to express his disgust over JD Vance's speech at the Munich Security Conference, where the vice president called for greater inclusion of nationalist populist parties like Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany. Last summer, I signed up to attend the 35th annual Girardian conference in Rome so I could spend time with Palaver in person. In the days leading up to it, I had dozens of unplanned conversations with mimetic theorists—in between lectures, in the back seats of taxis, and over espressos and cigarettes at tiny Roman cafés. The Girardians are a remarkably welcoming bunch, and many were reasonably eager to express how misrepresented they felt by the media. Certainly, none of the Girardians I spoke with seemed remotely interested in constructing katechons. It's not that they aren't thinking about the apocalypse. There's no way to take Girard's mimetic theory seriously without acknowledging his conclusion: As scapegoating becomes less and less effective, the world begins to fall apart. “Christ allows us to face this reality without sinking into madness,” Girard wrote. Palaver wanted to make sure I understood that he, too, was concerned with scapegoating less—he seemed worried that I might be scapegoating Peter Thiel. “And partly I'm still fighting against Schmitt.” But over the years, Girard had prodded him to see that he was becoming mimetically entangled with his opponent. Less than a month before Douthat spoke with Thiel, I posed the exact same question to Palaver, and it elicited more of a response. Why was Thiel, given his fixation on preventing a one-world state, building surveillance tools that a totalitarian dictator could use to seize power? “There's a tension between those two things, and in some ways he goes along with both of them,” he told me. “What I've observed are traces of deep fear,” he told me. “And if your main thing is seeking protection, you play with fire.” “We have different political views of the world. “That's where I hopefully can have an influence on him,” Palaver says. “In the end, you have to decide: Are you really going to be a Christian in a proper sense?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin Marcus has always had fun building and innovating with the enterprise startups he helped launch. “So every company has always been something that I enjoy doing or find fun in working on. Marcus is a Seattle-area startup veteran who co-founded internet search and directory services company InfoSpace back in 1996, and background check provider Intelius in 2003. With KATforge, Marcus and his family aren't just out to create puzzle games to rival popular offerings such as “Wordle” in what he considers an increasingly saturated market. They're leveraging technology, including AI, to test ideas quickly and to create games that resonate with players in search of something new. The studio's debut title, “Lextris,” is a fast-paced word puzzle that looks a little like if “Tetris” and “Scrabble” were mashed up. Points are scored for longer and more complex words. But he thinks an important piece of engagement is missing from their puzzles — community. The goal with KATforge is to bring people together to solve things that they couldn't necessarily do on their own. By targeting book clubs or retirement communities where people are already gathering together, Marcus sees an opportunity to extend the reach of his games. Team competition, for example, is a feature that could be coming to “Lextris.” The ability to try different ideas and designs has been sped up a great deal by AI and the vibe coding that KATforge is employing for early testing. They used Anthropic's Claude model to build the first version of “Lextris.” After collecting feedback they coded it all for real, with no AI. It's a process they'll repeat in the development of future games. “The ability to rapidly prototype it and put it out and see what happens, that is something we could not have done before, because it would have taken just way too long,” Marcus said. Maybe they'll use that time to be outdoors and exercise. Maybe they'll play more puzzle games and exercise their brains.

During live sporting events, Alexa+ can tell you the score from your favorite team, share player stats, and help you find live events across streaming services like Prime Video, Sling TV, DirecTV, and Fubo. You can also ask for information about a prior game's highlights and commentary. Another feature will let you use Alexa+ to find the right scene in a movie or show, just by asking in natural language voice commands. Meanwhile, the Fire TV software interface will offer improvements in areas like its Channel Guide, Watchlist, Continue Watching row, and live TV and sports discovery features. In 2025 alone, Amazon has launched 250 TVs with its various hardware partners, noted Aidan Marcuss, VP of Fire TV, speaking to press at Amazon's live event in New York. And, to date, customers have purchased nearly 300 million Fire TV devices globally. The new line is said to be 60% brighter than earlier models with double the local dimming zones, and offers brighter white and crisper blacks. It also includes an upgraded processor, Dolby Vision, and HDR 10+ Adaptive technology. The Fire TV 2-Series and 4-Series will also include this auto-adjusting brightness feature, dubbed “Omnisense,” for the first time, as well as something called Dialogue Boost, which will dynamically adjust film and TV audio to make dialogue clearer. Both are 30% faster, due to their new quad-core processor, Amazon told press. The Fire TV Stick 4K Select ($39.99) is designed to be a more affordable 4K streaming stick with HDR 10+ support and is powered by Amazon's new operating system, Vega OS. It will work out of the box with all standard streaming services and will soon support Alexa+ as well as Xbox Gaming and Luna.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a decent reboot to the Kindle lineup, but all of BookTok (that's book fans on TikTok for you boomers) was pretty upset that the Kindle Scribe—Amazon's most expensive e-reader that supports a stylus—didn't get the color screen upgrade. “Until now, this couldn't be done on an E Ink device,” said Amazon hardware chief Panos Panay. He said Amazon reengineered everything, from the display digitizer to the stylus to allow for colors that look accurate. A new “Workspace” stack brings books, files, and notes into one folder. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft doesn't come cheap, though: $630! That's even more expensive than the previous model. It does come with the stylus for free. Preorders start today and availability won't be until “later this year.” The new Kindle Scribe is 5.4mm and weighs 400 grams. Panay described it with his signature descriptions, calling it perfectly balanced, and saying it helps you “stay in your flow,” a phrase he's used many times over the past decade to describe Microsoft Surface products, which he spearheaded. “It just feels like you're writing on paper,” Panay effused. “It's 40% faster on the things that really matter, like page turns and writing.” The new 2025 Kindle Scribe without a color screen, comes in two models: $430 without a front light and $500 with one. The Kindle Scribe without a front light will be available “later this year” and the version without it will come “early next year,” according to Amazon. There's also a new $40 Fire Stick 4K Select with an included remote control. Have fun decoding what's special about each model!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beating Google to the announcement of new smart home devices by a day, Amazon today unveiled a family of new Ring doorbell cameras with “Retinal Vision”—all powered by its more intelligent and conversational Alexa+, of course. Amazon also announced new Blink security cameras with improved video and audio capture. If you haven't been paying attention to camera-equipped home doorbells and smart cameras that infused with AI and computer vision, new Ring cameras can send AI summary notifications that describe what's happening in footage. Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, who rejoined Amazon earlier this year, said with “Retinal Vision,” Ring doorbell cameras will be able to see better in low light and come with 10x enhanced zoom. A feature called “Retinal Tuning” allows Ring's new smart cameras to record even better video with color night vision. “Ring reimagined what the doorbell could be, but it's now redefining what home security should be,” said Amazon hardware chief Panos Panay. The cameras have 2K-resolution video, 4x zoom, color night vision, and improved audio capture with noise cancellation. Then, there's the $100 Blink Arc, a security system with two cameras that cover two high-res video feeds to create a 180-degree panoramic view. Amazon's notetaking e-reader finally gets a color E Ink screen year after the Kindle Colorsoft came out. There's also a new $40 Fire Stick 4K Select with an included remote control. Amazon will pay a $1 billion civil penalty—the largest ever in an FTC rule-violation case—and provide $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. A new report suggests, however, we're likely not going to really know the actor who takes on the 007 mantle. The FTC is claiming that Amazon made cancelling a subscription tough on purpose.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He discovered that despite the sheer number of sales prospecting platforms, selling to the waste management industry is still an offline endeavor. Berg launched CommanderAI in early 2024 as a customer relationship manager (CRM) and sales prospecting platform built for waste management — and other industrial services like dumpster rentals and industrial recyclers — to fill that gap. CommanderAI's software is also better suited to the types of contracts that waste management companies use, he said. These platforms don't have the specific types of data that waste management companies use to find customers, Berg said. Waste management companies sell to small, standalone businesses that might not have an online presence, and to new construction projects that aren't widely advertised. CommanderAI pulls that information for its users using AI. “That's where the AI [large language model] pipeline comes in. All we're here to do is help you sell more efficiently,'” Berg said. We're not here to change your way of doing things. The company's platform is designed to work for haulers with one truck up to enterprise-size businesses, Berg said, and is currently focused on mid-to-large regional players. Currently, the company is finding success with medical and hazardous waste management companies. CommanderAI has just raised a $5 million seed round led by 11 Tribes Ventures with participation from Watchfire Ventures, Gaingels, and Rad Fund. “There are only around 10 active software providers in the entire industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When we first got close to Dot, DoorDash's new delivery robot, we looked right into its big blue, pixelated eyes and gave it a kick. But it's a big, cruel world out there, and delivery robots like Dot will have to face—are already facing, because Dot has just started doing deliveries in metro Phoenix—myriad dangers and challenges. DoorDash showed off the nearly 5-foot-tall robot, studded with cameras and sensors, at an event in San Francisco on Monday. The company says the vehicles are built to travel up to 20 mph on roads, bike lanes, and sidewalks, and can carry up to 30 pounds of cargo—a bunch of pizzas, a mountain of pad thai, or a small grocery order. The vehicle is electric, has a swappable battery, and can travel up to six miles per charge. DoorDash cofounder and DoorDash Labs head Stanley Tang emphasized that the company plans to pursue a “hybrid” model for deliveries going forward—working with human Dashers but also drones and autonomous vehicles. (The company also introduced on Monday a new “Autonomous Delivery Platform” that can dispatch orders between all three.) App-based companies have publicly spoken for years about the money-saving potential of autonomous vehicles. What if robots did all the work, or at least some of it? Still, with today's announcement, DoorDash is throwing its lot into an industry that has faced some choppy waters. Delivery robots were hyped during the onset of the Covid pandemic as a solution to that other very human problem of contagion. Since then, however, Amazon and FedEx abandoned their delivery robot projects; others working on delivery bots have pivoted to software or industrial uses. The companies that remain have mostly focused on smaller deployments on college campuses or a select few cities, and those don't seem to be growing as quickly as hoped. Estonian company Starship Technologies, the biggest one still standing in the delivery robot space, has found a niche operating on mostly university campuses, where streets and sidewalks are wide, well-maintained, and relatively friendly, and where those desperately seeking 2 am pizzas and burritos are at their least price-sensitive. Postmates spinoff Serve Robotics launched in 2017 but has built only 400 robots, according to its most recent financial flings, with goals to build 2,000 by the end of the year. Consider the technical challenge Dot has ahead of it: DoorDash says the robot is built to operate on sidewalks, bike lanes, and roads. That means the software needs to “understand,” predict the movement of, and get around a remarkable number of situations, vehicles, and living things: cars, trucks, school buses, strollers, children's bicycles, aggressive mopeds, motorized wheelchairs, dogs, squirrels, toddlers, people with limps, runners, competitive cyclists. Each Dot can carry 30 pounds of cargo, drive up to 20 mph, and go about six miles on a charge. Still, DoorDash executives say the company has built something that's robust enough to last on the streets and cute enough to look like a good neighbor. Big googly eyes on the front act as headlights and expressive lenses. Tang says the size and heft should discourage people from messing with it. “It's harder to pick up than a sidewalk robot,” he says. DoorDash isn't sharing many details about how Dot's “early access” deliveries in Arizona are going; executives wouldn't say how many Dots exist, how many orders they've completed, how many restaurants are working with Dot, or where Dot will go next. (“We're rapidly adding robots to meet the demand we're seeing while Dot is in early access,” spokesperson Mattie Magdovitz says in an email.) They wouldn't say how much money they're investing in Dot or how big the team working on Dot is, though Tang noted that the company has a “world-class autonomy program with world-class talent.” Dot's success may be determined not by how its performance compares with other robots but by how it compares to humans. Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst with market research firm Forrester, says that customers like app-based delivery because of the convenience—and because it means someone drops off their goods exactly where they want them. But Dot, and other delivery bots, don't climb stairs or open doors or gently place a carton of eggs on the porch. “Why are we trying to get sidewalk robots that nobody asked for?” Kodali says. At the end of the DoorDash event, we asked if we could kick Dot again, for real this time, to test out how robust it was. The DoorDash PR rep said we had to wrap. Ashu Rege, DoorDash Labs' head of autonomy, fixed us with a plaintive look. Update, September 30 at noon: This story was updated to correct an error in citing Dot's mileage. It can travel up to six miles on a full battery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump was suspended from numerous online platforms after he inspired an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed attempt to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. Google, which owns YouTube, has agreed to pay $24.5 million, with $22 million going to Trump and an organization called the Trust for the National Mall, which is covering the cost of a White House ballroom through private funds. If you're wondering why the parties landed on $24.5 million rather than a round number, that's because Google wanted to pay less than Meta, the owner of Facebook, which paid $25 in a similar lawsuit settled earlier this year. Most of Meta's settlement will go to a private foundation that's ostensibly building Trump's future presidential library. X, previously known as Twitter during the Jan 6 insurrection, agreed to pay about $10 million earlier this year over claims that Trump was censored. Trump's YouTube channel was restored in March 2023, and it was used to spread campaign messages and pro-Trump news clips in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. Incredibly, none of these settlements really need to be paid from a strict legal perspective. When X paid out to Trump in February, that set off a domino effect, and the president's lawyers sought to reopen the cases against Meta and YouTube. Trump has been cleaning up with major companies lately, extracting huge payouts from firms that have no real legal obligation to pay him. By all accounts, those companies are making calculated decisions to reduce government pressure on their businesses. Paramount, the parent company of CBS, agreed to pay Trump $16 million over a frivolous claim that 60 Minutes had deceptively edited an interview with Kamala Harris in an attempt to help her with the 2024 election. The settlement happened just before Paramount and Skydance received approval to merge, something late-night host Stephen Colbert characterized as a “bribe.” Colbert's show was later cancelled, and it will end when his contract is up in the spring. Reached for comment Monday, a spokesperson for Google didn't provide an explanation beyond saying they would point us to the settlement “as our response.” Senior police and intel officials in New Zealand had to destroy the illegal guns. In a since-deleted Truth Social post, an AI version of Trump promised every American would soon have access to their very own medbed. The President has reiterated a threat he first made back in May, and once again, without any details as to how such a threat could be acted upon in the first place.</p>

Data center GPUs from Nvidia have become the gold standard for AI training and inference due to their high performance, the use of HBM with extreme bandwidth, fast rack-scale interconnects, and a perfected CUDA software stack. However, as AI becomes more ubiquitous and models are becoming larger (especially at hyperscalers), it makes sense for Nvidia to disaggregate its inference stack and use specialized GPUs to accelerate the context phase of inference, a phase where the model must process millions of input tokens simultaneously to produce the initial output without using expensive and power-hungry GPUs with HBM memory. The shift to GDDR7 provides several benefits, despite delivering significantly lower bandwidth than HBM3E or HBM4; it consumes less power, costs dramatically less per GB, and does not require expensive advanced packaging technology, such as CoWoS, which should ultimately reduce the product's costs and alleviate production bottlenecks. Pascari X200: High-capacity data centers need reliable and comprehensive storage solutions. Built with enterprise workloads in mind, Phison's engineering offers cutting-edge tech that will make your life simpler and more energy efficient. Modern large language models (such as GPT-5, Gemini 2, and Grok 3) are larger, more capable in reasoning, and able to process inputs that were previously impossible, which end-users utilize extensively. Inference in large-scale AI models is increasingly divided into two parts: an initial compute-intensive context phase that processes the input to generate the first output token, and a second phase that generates additional tokens based on the processed context. As models evolve into agentic systems, long-context inference becomes essential for enabling step-by-step reasoning, persistent memory across tasks, coherent multi-turn dialogue, and the ability to plan and revise over extended inputs, as otherwise these capabilities would be limited by context windows. Perhaps the most important factor why long-context inference becomes important is not just because models can do it, but because users need AI to analyze large documents, codebases, or generate long videos. The context phase of inference — where the model reads and encodes the full input before producing any output — is compute-bound and requires extremely high compute throughput to produce 1+ million token context workloads, plenty of memory (but not necessarily plenty of memory bandwidth), and optimized attention mechanisms (which is the model developers' job) to maintain performance across long sequences. Traditional data center GPUs have plenty of onboard HBM memory, and while they can handle such workloads, it is not very efficient to use it for this task. Therefore, Nvidia intends to use Rubin CPX GPUs with 128GB of GDDR7 onboard for the context phase. Traditional data center GPUs — such as the Blackwell Ultra (B300, 288GB HBM3E) or Rubin (288GB HBM4) — handle this efficiently by streaming and updating token sequences in real-time. To address emerging demands, Nvidia has designed specialized hardware — the Rubin CPX GPU — specifically for long-context inference. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The Rubin CPX accelerator card is built on Nvidia's Rubin architecture, delivering up to 30 NVFP4 PetaFLOPS of compute throughput (which is quite a lot, as the 'big' Rubin R100, featuring two chiplets, achieves 50 NVFP4 PetaFLOPS), and it comes with 128GB of GDDR7 memory. The processor also has hardware attention acceleration (which involves additional matrix multiplication hardware), which is crucial for long-context inference without speed drops, as well as hardware support for video encoding and decoding for processing and generating videos. While GDDR7 provides significantly lower bandwidth than HBM3E or HBM4, it consumes less power, costs dramatically less per GB, and does not require expensive advanced packaging technology, such as CoWoS. As a result, not only are Rubin CPX GPUs cheaper than regular Rubin processors, but they also consume significantly less power, which simplifies cooling. The ASIC indeed has 16 graphics processing clusters (GPCs,) allegedly with graphics-specific hardware (e.g., raster back end, texture units), a massive L2 cache, eight 64-bit memory interfaces, PCIe, and display engines. What the chip does not seem to have are interfaces like NVLink, so we can only wonder whether it communicates with its peers only via a PCIe interface. On the one hand, packing plenty of NVFP4-capable FPUs and hardware attention accelerators into a GPU for graphics may not be the most optimal choice from a die size perspective. But on the other hand, taping out two near-reticle-size processors with similar functionality instead of one could be inefficient from a cost, engineering effort, and timing perspective. Just like other rack-scale products from Nvidia, the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX will utilize Nvidia's Quantum-X800 InfiniBand or Spectrum-XGS Ethernet connectivity, paired with ConnectX-9 SuperNICs, for scale-out connectivity. However, it appears that existing Blackwell deployments will not be able to accommodate Rubin CPX trays for optimized inference performance, although the reason for this is unclear. This claim is grounded in the ability of Rubin CPX to reduce inference costs (as Rubin CPX is cheaper and consumes less than full-blown R100) and expand the scope of feasible AI workloads. On the software side, Rubin CPX is fully supported by Nvidia's AI ecosystem, including CUDA, frameworks, tools, and NIM microservices required for deploying production-grade AI solutions. Rubin CPX also supports the Nemotron family of models, designed for enterprise-level multimodal reasoning. Developers of AI models and products will not need to manually partition the first and second inference phases between GPUs to run on Rubin NVL144 CPX rack-scale solutions. Instead, Nvidia proposes using its Dynamo software orchestration layer to intelligently manage and split inference workloads across different types of GPUs in a disaggregated system. When a prompt is received, Dynamo automatically identifies the compute-heavy context phase and assigns it to specialized Rubin CPX GPUs, which are optimized for fast attention and large-scale input processing. Several companies are already planning to integrate Rubin CPX into their AI workflows: With Rubin CPX, these GPUs now get their own accelerators. Optimization of long-context inference processing not only cuts hardware costs and TCO, but also enables high-throughput inference platforms capable of sustaining million-token workloads. Such platforms could enable even more sophisticated AI-assisted software and hardware engineering, as well as full-length video generation and other AI applications that are not feasible today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic is prepared to repurpose conversations users have with its Claude chatbot as training data for its large language models—unless those users opt out. Previously, the company did not train its generative AI models on user chats. “All large language models, like Claude, are trained using large amounts of data,” reads part of Anthropic's blog explaining why the company made this policy change. “Data from real-world interactions provide valuable insights on which responses are most useful and accurate for users.” With more user data thrown into the LLM blender, Anthropic's developers hope to make a better version of their chatbot over time. The change was originally scheduled to take place on September 28 before being bumped back. Existing Claude users may have already encountered a pop-up laying out the changes to Anthropic's terms. All users can toggle conversation training on or off under the Privacy Settings. That means Anthropic is not automatically training its next model on your entire chat history, unless you go back into the archives and reignite an old thread. After the interaction, that old chat is now reopened and fair game for future training. The new privacy policy also arrives with an expansion to Anthropic's data retention policies for those that don't opt out. Anthropic increased the amount of time it holds onto user data from 30 days in most situations to a much more extensive five years, whether or not users allow model training on their conversations. Users who opt out will still be under the 30 day policy. Commercial users, like those licensed through government or educational plans, are not impacted by the change and conversations from those users will not be used as part of the company's model training. Since the privacy policy update includes coding projects as well as chat logs, Anthropic could gather a sizable amount of coding information for training purposes with this switch. Prior to Anthropic updating its privacy policy, Claude was one of the only major chatbots not to use conversations for LLM training automatically. Check out WIRED's full guide to AI training opt-outs for more services where you can request generative AI not be trained on user data. While choosing to opt out of data training is a boon for personal privacy, especially when dealing with chatbot conversations or other one-on-one interactions, it's worth keeping in mind that anything you post publicly online, from social media posts to restaurant reviews, will likely be scraped by some startup as training material for its next giant AI model.

Zhaoxin may not produce the best CPUs for gaming, but the leading Chinese fabless semiconductor enterprise is undoubtedly preparing to unleash a highly impressive server chip. The KH-50000 utilizes Zhaoxin's latest Century Avenue architecture, named after a famous road in Shanghai. The company is fond of naming its architectures after famous locations within Shanghai because, after all, Zhaoxin is a joint venture between VIA Technologies and the Shanghai government. Century Avenue is the current architecture used by the company for its mainstream KaiXian KX-7000 processors; consequently, it is logical for Zhaoxin to align its latest server processors accordingly. Although Century Avenue is an in-house developed architecture by Zhaoxin, speculation suggests that Century Avenue may be a derivation from Centaur Technology's CNS core, prior to the company's split from VIA Technologies in 2021. Zhaoxin utilizes a chiplet design for the KH-50000, similar to AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors, with a greater emphasis on the latter, given the high number of cores. A chiplet design would enable Zhaoxin to push the core boundary on the KH-50000, effectively matching AMD's EPYC 9004 (codenamed Genoa) series that tops out at 96 cores. Zhaoxin has planned two variants of the KH-50000: the flagship 96-core SKU and a more affordable 72-core SKU, both of which lack simultaneous multithreading (SMT). The KH-50000 represents a monumental leap forward for Zhaoxin, as it provides 3X more cores than the company's existing KH-40000. The gargantuan I/O die is centrally positioned on the processor, encircled by four clusters of compute dies. Each cluster contains three compute dies, totaling twelve. Each die incorporates eight cores and 32MB of L3 cache. When assembled, the resulting processor comprises a 96-core configuration with 384MB of L3 cache. The clock speeds on the KH-50000 aren't too shabby and fall in line with what you'd expect from a server chip. The thing with a chiplet design is that Zhaoxin can effectively utilize older process nodes for the KH-50000. For comparison, AMD has historically kept its top EPYC chips around the 300-350W range, and that's with SMT. Nonetheless, the chipmaker has recently pushed the power envelope up to 500W, which is understandable when its EPYC processors are maxing out at 192 cores. Zhaoxin has added Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnect support. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Support for virtualization is also present. This chip meets the security requirements of China's GM/T 0012-2020 cryptographic module standard and complies with the international TPM 2.0 (SPEC 1.59) standard. Notably, it shares dimensions with AMD's Genoa and Bergamo processors, which measure 72 x 75.4 mm and are compatible with the socket SP5. Contrary to AI GPUs, companies in China can still acquire server chips without significant difficulty, albeit potentially at increased costs. Nonetheless, Zhaoxin continues to make considerable progress in the domestic market, and with Chinese authorities firmly committed to utilizing domestically produced technology, the company could achieve success even if the KH-50000 does not rival AMD or Intel's latest server chips.
