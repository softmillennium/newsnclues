                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, the musician released his single “Lemonade,” and announced that he'll drop his third studio album, How Did I Get Here?, on Jan. 23, 2026. Tomlinson worked on the project during a three-week trip to Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, alongside his primary collaborator, Nico Rebscher. “Taking all of the steps I did to get here was important. To lead the album, Tomlinson released his single “Lemonade,” dedicated to a lady who's “so bitter” and “so sweet” at the same time. It had to be big and fun,” Tomlinson added. “To me, ‘Lemonade' really has instant and natural personality. It ended up being the perfect way to begin this chapter.” Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show Will Make History for Being Entirely in Spanish Supreme Court Ethics Issues Trace to John Roberts' ‘Original Sin,' New Book Alleges Body Found in D4vd's Tesla: Cops Explain Lack of Named Suspects, Charges Madonna's Revelation After Coma Led to Reunion With Her Brother Before His Death Tomlinson is also set to host Away From Home Festival in Cooperstown, New York.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicole Kidman is a proud mother of four children. The “Big Little Lies” star shares two daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret, with country singer Keith Urban, whom she separated from in September 2025 after 19 years of marriage. Kidman and Cruise adopted their daughter, Isabella “Bella” Jane, and son, Connor Anthony, in the 1990s, while they were still married. Though the couple split in 2001, Kidman has consistently spoken with warmth and pride about her two older children. “They are generous, kind and hardworking,” she told PEOPLE. “And these are traits that I love to see in my children.” Kidman and Cruise adopted Bella shortly after her birth in Miami on December 22, 1992. Kidman later told Vanity Fair that she had long wanted to be a mother. “And we lost a baby early on, so that was really very traumatic. And that's when we would adopt [our daughter] Bella.” Though she grew up primarily in Beverly Hills, Bella has kept her life fairly private. She studied at Delmar Academy of Make-up and Hair in London before moving into fashion. She once worked for Holmes & Yang, the fashion line created by Katie Holmes and Jeanne Yang, before launching her own label, BKC (Bella Kidman Cruise), in 2018. Although neither Kidman nor Cruise attended the wedding, People reported that Cruise helped pay for the celebration, and a source close to Kidman shared she was “very happy for Bella.” Now 32, Bella continues to showcase her artwork on Instagram. She made headlines in December 2023 after being photographed with Cruise, Connor, and NFL star Derrick Brooks at a Tampa Bay Lightning game — their first public outing together in nearly 15 years. Kidman and Cruise adopted their son Connor shortly after his birth in Florida on January 17, 1995. “But I don't regret that because it got me Bella and Connor and I did have a fantastic marriage for a long period.” By 2013, he was DJing at clubs across the U.S. Today, however, his biggest passion is deep-sea fishing. He has a lot of friends and seems very well-liked.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"That's a beautifully tragic thing because of where we are going to take him." 'Cocaine Quarterback': Gambler Says He Was Dealt Unfair Hand in Amazon's True Crime Docuseries It is clear in a letter to Reece from Edwards that he has lost faith in the individuals who send young men and women to die for their country, either as soldiers or spies. Sometimes all you can do is play your part. “I think that is the call when he calls Reece,” Kitsch says about Edwards thinking he won't make it out of the fight with Iranian soldiers alive. I think he's retrospectively living out a few beats in his life before he knows it may be taken in the next day or two.” In an epic battle scene of one man against hundreds of Iranian soldiers, Edwards fights to exhaustion with the booby-traps, bombs and multiple weapons he has laid out around the property of his country house until he has to retreat into woods where he has more surprises for the enemy soldiers. Edwards gets wounded a few times, but just when viewers think it may be the end for him, his Navy SEAL brothers — led by Reece — sweep in to quickly dispose of the Iranian soldiers closing in on Edwards. Edwards gives the nuclear bearings to his SEAL brothers, but now the former soldier/new black ops agent has revenge on his mind. Edwards and the surviving agents who were part of Haverford's team spread out to Istanbul, Tehran, and Virginia to avenge their fallen comrades. Edwards says those who failed him and the disloyal agents have to be held accountable. “It is about Haverford, but I also think overall it goes with that scene in episode one with the CIA, where he wasn't being told about everything that was happening, and his men were in harm's way without knowing the full story,” Kitsch explains. Ironically, when Haverford walks into his home in Virginia to find Edwards sitting inside waiting for him,  he is somehow able to escape Edwards' punishment of death. Kitsch says there is a good reason why Haverford lives. He continues, “It is also a turn for Ben. Violence has always been the answer up to that point. It's not just fucking walking in and shooting him in the head, and then walking out of the door. It was one of my favorite scenes in the series.” Kitsch, however, says not to expect a reunion or forgiveness between Edwards and his Navy SEAL  brother Hastings anytime soon. “In season one of The Terminal List, I have this line where Ben said something like ‘he actually came through,'” Kitsch says. So I think their relationship is pretty severed, especially the way we ended it on that boat. Maybe we'll figure something else just to get Hopper back in, but I think that relationship, along with a lot of relationships, are been and done that. With Dark Wolf serving as a bridge story for seasons one and two of The Terminal List (the latter is currently in production), Kitsch believes Edwards has nowhere to go but to spiral deeply down the rabbit hole of loneliness and darkness in the spy world if they were to do a second season. “We have a pretty good damn outline,” Kitsch explains of what could come next in the expanding franchise. “Because Ben is so unpredictable, it's been a fun ride just figuring out the next steps. Without giving too much away, I think you are going to see him bottom out. There's a line on the boat [in episode six] where I say to Hopper that I'd rather be brought home in a box than to be doing what you're doing right now.” Instead, viewers will see Edwards go deeper into a world full of lies, intrigue and vengeance alone. “One thing we're proud of is showing the darkness in service, and I think we are going to dive even more into that,” he says. “You are going to see Ben be lonelier than he has ever been, and you are going to see him go into a world where there is no escape anymore, in more of a psychological way. You start to see him break at the end of the finale when he says ‘I belong here [in black ops].' That's a beautifully tragic thing because of where we are going to take him in the world we are creating for him to go into, and what that will look like.” The Terminal List: Dark Wolf is now streaming all episodes on Prime Video.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She won a special election for the seat previously occupied by her father, Democratic Rep. Raúl Grijalva, who died in March after serving over two decades in office. Despite a blowout, uncontested victory — and a precedent of swearing in the winners of special elections almost immediately after their elections — Grijalva still has no idea when she might become an official member of the House. has yet to set a date for Grijalva's swearing in ceremony, and the delay is raising eyebrows. Grijalva has indicated she will sign a discharge petition that would force a floor vote to release government documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case as soon as she's sworn in. To delay her swearing in would further delay the advancement of the petition, and give Republican leadership addition time to apply pressure to the Republican representatives — Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Lauren Boebert (R-Co.), and Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) — who support it. “I can't see another reason,” Grijalva tells Rolling Stone. Precedent establishes that in an uncontested election, there is no procedural rule barring a representative-elect from being sworn in during a pro-forma session. In April, Reps. Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine — both Republicans representing Florida — were sworn in by Johnson during a pro-forma session the day after their special elections. The representative-elect added that she and her team had not heard directly from Johnson's office. “We haven't heard anything from the Speaker's office,” she says. And unfortunately, we first started hearing about any issue through the press, reporters would say, ‘I reached out to the Speaker's office, and this is what I heard back.' So a lot of this is second and third hand information.” Natalie Dormer Won't Promote Show in Which She Plays Sarah Ferguson Over Duchess' Epstein Ties Dem Senator Introduces Bill to End Profiteering by Trump and Lawmakers Late-Night Hosts Joke About Trump's Birthday Card for Epstein: ‘a Picasso of Pervitude' Despite not having a swearing-in ceremony in the books, Grijalva has traveled to Washington, D.C., and is working out of borrowed conference rooms in other members' offices. “I'm hearing from my constituents, ‘When are you able to work? There's no dispute on who won the election, so why can't you get to work?” she adds. Grijalva's new constituents appear to be voiceless — at least until she's sworn in — because of the Trump administration's bungled handling of the Epstein case, and their continued efforts to kill any efforts toward transparency. Earlier this month, Johnson publicly suggested that Trump may have only maintained a relationship with Epstein because he was secretly an FBI informant (Johnson later tried to walk back the claim). Rep. Massie, in particular, has long been calling for transparency, and over the weekend, Rep. Greene, a longtime Trump loyalist, told The New York Times that she does not “work” for the White House and will now bow to their pressure campaigns to sway her.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actress Indya Moore, like many trans people in the U.S., is calling on people in power to stand up for her community's rights. One of the powerful people she's calling out by name is none other than her former boss, Ryan Murphy. In an emotional video posted to her Instagram on Sunday (Sept. 28), Moore — who gained international acclaim for her portrayal of Angel Evangelista in FX's Pose — criticized Murphy for failing to stand up for the trans community in the years since the Emmy Award-winning series ended in 2021. The actress offered her thanks to Murphy and others who “have ever given us jobs” and “allowed us to be able to speak out,” before slamming Murphy for not using his platform to speak up about the ongoing attacks against the trans community by the U.S. government. Who upset you that much, Janet [Mock, writer, director and producer on Pose] really pissed you off that much?” Moore continued, saying that she has been “reprimanded” before for speaking up about “mistreatment” she dealt with on the set of Pose, including her claim that producer Tanase Popa threw potato chips at her on set. She then turned her attention back to Murphy, asking how the influential showrunner could “do something like Pose during Donald Trump's [2016-2020] administration, and then it's like poof, you're gone.” Billboard has reached out to Murphy's representatives for comment. In the nine months of the twice-impeached president's second term thus far, Trump has taken multiple opportunities to discriminate against trans people, including limiting resources for transgender healthcare, eliminating federal recognition of transgender identities, banning trans people from serving in the military and ceasing funding for the national suicide hotline dedicated to helping queer and trans people. Y'all can't make up your mind about how you want to view us, as weak and a target to bully, or as strong and a threat,” she said. Moore thanked those who have stood up for trans people's rights and safety, and urged those watching to keep doing so in the caption of her video, where she also tagged Murphy. We have been copping [sic] for too long,” she wrote. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Directed by Fernando Szurman and written by John Wesley Norton and Ezequiel Martinez Jr., the film centers on an astronaut (Mads Mikkelsen) who crash-lands on an uncharted planet after a catastrophic accident, with only his Quantum AI companion Ami (Diane Kruger) left to aid in his escape. 'The Last Viking' Clip: Mads Mikkelsen Reunites With Director Anders Thomas Jensen In Venice-Bound Dark Comedy Diane Kruger Narrating 'Bluey' In German For First Time The project is produced by Fishcorb, Capstone Studios, and Conch Republic Films, with Andres Sanchez executive-producing. Capstone Global is handling worldwide sales and will be discussing the project with buyers ahead of next month's American Film Market in LA. “Ami is exactly the kind of daring, character-driven genre film that reflects Capstone's commitment to globally resonant storytelling,” said Fall and Trap House producer Christian Mercuri, CEO of Capstone. With Fernando's distinctive vision and a cast of extraordinary talent, this project exemplifies the elevated, high-concept filmmaking we champion.” “What excited me about Ami was the opportunity to tell a profoundly human story through a genre that allows for both scope and intimacy,” added first-time feature filmmaker Szurman, a first AD on movies including Borrego and The Mortimers. “I want to push the boundaries of sci-fi storytelling while grounding it in emotional truth. BAFTA nominee Mikkelsen is well known for movies including Oscar winner Another Round (2020), The Hunt (2013), Casino Royale (2006), Doctor Strange(2016), and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore (2022). Mikkelsen is repped by UTA and Art Management. Kruger is repped by CAA, Untitled Entertainment, UBBA, and Peikoff Mahan Law Office. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

After nearly 20 years of marriage, Kidman and Urban parted ways for good. Keith is said to have moved out of their family home and is staying in his own residence in Nashville. It remains unclear if the ex-couple will get a divorce. She has been fighting to save the marriage.” While many expressed sadness, others couldn't resist pointing fingers. One saddened fan wrote, “Is there absolutely no chance to repair whatever damage has been done? Another chimed in, “I did not see this coming. Always terribly sad when marriages, especially long ones, fall apart.” Someone added, “This is so heartbreaking to hear. I thought sure Nicole had found true love and happiness with Keith.” Another commented, “So sad to hear of their split. They've also just celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary on June 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sylvan Esso are back with a new song, “WDID,” and with it, news of their departure from Spotify. Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn are releasing the single on their own label, Psychic Hotline, and have vowed to cut ties with “a store that, in addition to all its other glaring flaws, directly funds war machines,” as they put it in a statement. Those to follow suit have included Hotline TNT, Godspeed You! Those artists have primarily cited Spotify founder Daniel Ek's investment, through his Prima Materia venture capital firm, in the weapons contractor Helsing. In an apparently unrelated move, the streaming giant announced today that Ek would transition from the role of chief executive officer to executive chair. To that end, with Sylvan Esso being on our own label for the first time, we have decided to remove our music from Spotify. While no solution is perfect, we simply can't continue to put our life's work in a store that, in addition to all its other glaring flaws, directly funds war machines. Sylvan Esso released their last album, No Rules Sandy, in 2022 via Loma Vista.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The star-studded lineup of Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Comedy Festival is still catching heat from peers back in the U.S. After drawing criticism from the likes of Marc Maron and Atsuko Okatsuka, David Cross joined the fray, posting on his website that he was “disgusted, and deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing.” He noted that he “was not offered the gig but it should go without saying that there's not enough money for me to help these depraved, awful people put a ‘fun face' on their crimes against humanity.” Cross lamented that the lineup includes “some of my HEROES!” He wrote, “Now look, some of you folks don't stand for anything so you don't have any credibility to lose, but my god, Dave [Chappelle] and Louie [C.K.] You don't get to talk about it ever again. By now we've all seen the contract you had to sign.” Okatsuka previously posted the Riyadh contract from her own offer for the festival, which included a long list of “censorship rules” forbidding jokes that criticize Saudi Arabia or its royal family. Tim Dillon was dropped from the festival for joking about the country's “slaves” ahead of the event, but he said he'd been offered $375,000 for one performance and other comedians were offered as much as $1.6 million (via NPR). “I don't understand how being rich can make someone such a whore,” Cross wrote in his post. This is truly the definition of ‘blood money'. You might as well do commercials for Lockheed Martin or Zyklon B. Holy shit, I remember the backlash I got for appearing in Alvin and the Chipmunks! You would've thought that I had taken money from a bunch of people responsible for funding Al Qaeda!” In a press release, Human Rights Watch stated that the Riyadh Comedy Festival was an attempt by Saudi Arabia “to deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations.” The org stated that “to avoid contributing to laundering the Saudi government's reputation,” participating comics “should use the comedy festival to publicly urge Saudi authorities to free unjustly detained Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists.” HRW reached out “to the representatives and management of a group of announced participating comedians to request a meeting about Saudi Arabia's human rights crisis,” but didn't hear back. He wrote, “Unless you open your sets with, ‘This is dedicated to all of the widows and widowers and kids orphaned by this bloodthirsty oppressive regime especially from the zany shenanigans on 9/11. then your hypocrisy will never not be noted.” Neko Case embraced grief and disorder for Neon Grey Midnight Green By David Brusie September 24, 2025 | 3:00pm Alien: Earth's Wendy is more like David than Ripley after all By Brian Tallerico September 24, 2025 | 10:00am JEZEBELTexas University System Bans Talking About Trans & Nonbinary Identities PASTETom Waits Broke Out of His Little World On “Downtown Train”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström will take over in the new year. "I'll remain deeply involved in shaping Spotify's future," says Ek. Spotify has announced a major leadership shift set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, with founder and CEO Daniel Ek transitioning to the role of executive chairman, while current co-presidents Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström set to become co-CEOs. This move formalizes a leadership structure that has been in practice since 2023, Spotify said in its announcement Tuesday (Sept. 30), with Söderström and Norström already leading strategic and operational efforts. As executive chairman, Ek will focus on long-term strategy, capital allocation, and regulatory matters, adopting a European-style chairman role that remains actively involved in company direction. “This change simply matches titles to how we already operate,” Ek said. “I'll remain deeply involved in shaping Spotify's future.” Woody Marshall, lead independent director of Spotify's board, expressed strong support for the transition, citing the duo's 15+ years of experience and their role in driving Spotify's success. He also praised Ek's continued involvement, which ensures founder-led strategic guidance. In a joint statement, the incoming co-CEOs said they are excited to lead Spotify into its next chapter. “We bring different experiences and perspectives to the CEO role, but share a strong bias to action,” they said. “With Daniel's ongoing support, we're ready to build the most valuable experience in audio streaming.” The company earlier this morning announced a new multi-year licensing deal with Merlin. He described his new role as his “next mission,” allowing him to focus on broader strategic initiatives while remaining closely connected to the company. In the Spotify of today, all eyes (and ears) are on us. There's not much we do that goes unnoticed. In a small makeshift office on Riddargatan in Stockholm, a few of us set out to solve what felt like an impossible idea: to make every song available instantly, legally, in a product people love. Fast forward almost 20 years, and that “impossible idea” has become a platform used by nearly three-quarters of a billion people around the globe. We've helped reshape an industry that is not only growing again but reaching new heights. I don't often pause to reflect—looking ahead has always been my instinct. So, with full confidence in Gustav and Alex, on January 1, 2026, I will move to Executive Chairman, and they will become our co-CEOs. They will also join our Board of Directors, pending shareholder approval. At Spotify, I've had about nine missions while keeping the same title. In the early days, I assembled furniture and negotiated our first deals. For most of you, very little will change. This reflects a European Chairman setup—more hands-on than the traditional U.S. model. Because Alex and Gustav have clearly demonstrated they're ready to lead. And because you all have stepped up, I can confidently step back from the day-to-day. Together, we've shown the world that Spotify is not only a great product but also a great business—delivering our first full year of profitability in company history. I'll remain deeply involved in the big, defining decisions about our future, partnering with Gustav and Alex as they lead the way forward. A personal note: I'm often asked, “How do we build more Spotifys out of Europe?” That's why I announced my intention to help create more supercompanies—those tackling the biggest challenges of our time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump will receive another payday from a media conglomerate that four years ago attempted to stop the president from inciting violence. $22 million of that sum will go toward a trust for the National Mall, which is handling the construction of Trump's $200 million White House ballroom. YouTube's capitulation aligns with the rest of the tech world, which has abandoned content moderation in recent years, allowing its platforms to fill up with hate speech, AI slop, and misinformation. After being acquired by Elon Musk, hate speech exploded on X, where Musk made drastic cuts to its trust and safety team, allowing the sixth most popular website on Earth to become 4chan. In less than a year, Meta had to change other rules, such as those regarding chatbots flirting with children and spreading medical misinformation. YouTube is far from the only media organization to settle what many consider frivolous First Amendment cases. After Trump sued Disney and Paramount's news organizations, both ABC and CBS paid Trump upwards of $15 million each to settle winnable cases. Meanwhile, social media apps, such as X and Meta, reinstated the president's accounts, hoping he'd return to the flailing social media sites. Mike Rothschild, a journalist focused on conspiracy theories, wrote on Bluesky that this theory has led “many MAGA believers” to refuse medical treatment because they “believe one day Trump or Q or NESARA will release medbed tech that will restore their health in minutes.” Neko Case embraced grief and disorder for Neon Grey Midnight Green By David Brusie September 24, 2025 | 3:00pm Alien: Earth's Wendy is more like David than Ripley after all By Brian Tallerico September 24, 2025 | 10:00am</p>
