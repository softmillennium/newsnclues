                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has issued a new memorandum instructing several agencies within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to aid in arresting and charging people with crimes if they protest or otherwise impede actions taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The memo is similar to one released last week by President Donald Trump, which details how his administration would target individuals deemed to be “Antifa,” following his designation of the nonexistent organization as a “domestic terrorist” group. Like Trump's memo, Bondi's references supposed “riots” in American cities and a shooting at an ICE facility earlier this month, which killed two people who were being detained. Her memo also targets criticism of ICE by lawmakers, signaling that the directive will seek to quell speech rights. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Attorneys, to aid in the arrest and prosecution of individuals acting against ICE's interests. “The Department of Justice will stand strong when federal law enforcement officers are attacked or threatened for doing their sworn duty.” Many of the orders within Bondi's memo are already being carried out, Law Dork's Chris Geidner reported, adding that the document “could be more of a P.R. “The Radical Left's reign of terror in Portland ends now, with President Donald J. Trump mobilizing federal resources to stop Antifa-led hellfire in its tracks,” reads the article, entitled “President Trump Deploys Federal Resources to Crush Violent Radical Left Terrorism in Portland.” Trump “lacks authority” under federal law, the plaintiffs contend, because presidents can only summon troops with the request of governors or in “circumstance of invasion, rebellion, or when federal laws cannot otherwise be executed.” Despite Trump's fearmongering, both the city and state are “stable,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said recently.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, HHS warned dozens of states to drop lessons on transgender health or face millions in funding cuts. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Multiple states are jointly suing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., over new rules restricting what can be taught in sexual education classes, including lessons that acknowledge the existence of transgender people. Last month, the Trump administration threatened to cut funding to states that acknowledge transgender or nonbinary people in their sex ed classes. The funding limitations could affect children's education in places with high teenage birth rates, potentially leading to higher numbers of teen pregnancies. Funding cuts could also limit education for kids who are unhoused or in the foster care system. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. The suit alleges that at least $35 million, perhaps more, could be withheld from sex ed programs within those states. HHS withdrew $12 million in PREP funds after the state refused to change its lesson plans. The lawsuit claims that “HHS's actions directly contradict the statutes creating these programs,” and that “PREP and SRAE require federally funded sexual health education content be ‘medically accurate and complete,' ‘culturally appropriate' or provided in the appropriate ‘cultural context,'” per federal law. By potentially withholding funds over lessons that acknowledge transgender people, the states are “irreparably harm[ed],” the suit continues, adding that they are collectively forced “into an impossible position: lose critical funding for sexual health education programs, or violate federal and state laws requiring medically accurate, non-discriminatory information within those programs.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, a father of four, ‘succumbed to his injuries after being removed from life support' A second person who was shot recently at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Dallas, Texas, has died, according to the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac), which is representing his family. Lulac announced in a news release on Tuesday that Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, 32, had “succumbed to his injuries after being removed from life support following the [24 September] sniper attack on the Dallas Ice facility”. “We had just bought our first home together, and he worked hard every single day to make sure our children had what they needed,” she added. “His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered. The organization said that García-Hernández, who is from Mexico, leaves behind four young children and his wife, who is expecting their fifth child. Gauffeny told NPR over the weekend that her husband worked as a house painter before he was detained. García-Hernández was one of three people shot at the Ice facility. The shooting initially left one detainee dead and two others critically wounded. The third victim, identified in reports as Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, has reportedly been released from the hospital, according to CBS news, citing a Department of Homeland Security official. Texas officials have said that they believe the shooting came after a “high degree of planning” – and noted that an “anti-Ice” shell casing was recovered at the scene. CBS also reported that the Dallas Ice field office is expected to reopen on Tuesday with increased security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Copper prices hit 15-month highs of $10,485 a metric ton last week after Freeport-McMoRan declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine and cut sales forecast from the Indonesian unit for this year and 2026. Freeport's Grasberg operation located in Indonesia suspended operations on September 8 after a deadly mud slide. The world's second-largest copper mine behind Chile's Escondida faces a lengthy damage assessment process and a clear-up while the search for missing workers continues. “The scale of this disruption is very big,” said Albert Mackenzie, a copper analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. This amounts to 2.6% of the 2024 global mine production estimated at around 23 million tons by analysts. Supply losses from Grasberg mean the global copper market is facing a significantly wider deficit of around 400,000 tons in 2025, according to Benchmark Minerals. The disruption has shifted Goldman Sachs' 2025 copper market balance from a projected surplus of 105,000 tons to a deficit of 55,500 tons. The suspension at Grasberg follows other large disruptions this year including Kamoa-Kakula in the Democratic Republic of Congo and El Teniente mine in Chile. This year's mine supply was already expected to come in below every forecast over the past 15 years and this is now exacerbated by unexpected supply disruptions, Bank of America analyst Michael Widmer said in a note. Copper's record high was in May 2024, when it hit $11,104.50 a ton. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the issue of possible US Tomahawk cruise missiles for Ukraine has not been resolved. "I think this is primarily the result of European pressure on Washington, and Washington wants to show that it takes into account the opinions of its allies. He also said he would be surprised if the United States considered Ukraine a responsible state to receive Tomahawks. "The Americans don't supply Tomahawks to everyone. Among Europeans, if I'm not mistaken, they supply them to Spain and the Netherlands; they're somewhat wary of the rest. Lavrov cited remarks by US officials, including Keith Kellogg, the US Presidential Special Envoy for Ukraine, and Vice President JD Vance. He noted that Kellogg has taken a strongly pro-Ukraine stance, even as President Donald Trump has described himself as a mediator who says Ukraine and Russia should resolve issues directly. Kellogg recently advised Ukraine to accept reality and de facto acknowledge that the territory is what it is now, and to stop worrying about it, drawing an analogy about the Baltic states' status during the Soviet era and their later independence. Lavrov said such remarks contrast with Trump's position and indicated that many speakers at the meeting were promoting the Ukrainian agenda. He concluded by saying that the Kremlin is confident that even if Tomahawks are deployed in Ukraine, they will not change the military equation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Africa's ambassador to France has been found dead at the foot of a high-rise hotel in Paris, hours after he was reported missing, prosecutors in the city told CNN. Nkosinathi Emmanuel “Nathi” Mthethwa, was “discovered directly below” a Hyatt Hotel in Paris on Tuesday, according to the prosecutor's office, which added that the envoy had booked a room on the 22nd floor. Mthethwa's wife had reported him missing on Monday, saying she had received a “disturbing message” from him, according to the prosecutor's office. CNN has reached out to the Hyatt Group of hotels and the Hyatt Regency, but has not received any comment. South Africa's foreign ministry confirmed Mthethwa's death “with deep sorrow and profound regret” in a statement on Tuesday, expressing condolences to the ambassador's family. “I have no doubt that his passing is not only a national loss but is also felt within the international diplomatic community,” South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said, according to Tuesday's statement. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa eulogized Mthethwa in a post on social media on Tuesday, writing that the diplomat had “served our nation in diverse capacities during a lifetime that has ended prematurely and traumatically.” Mthethwa, 58, was appointed ambassador to France in December 2023. He had previously served as a member of South Africa's parliament and as minister of sports, arts and culture, according to his embassy profile. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kiev regime is planning to carry out a provocation in Poland with sabotage and reconnaissance groups disguised as Russian and Belarusian special forces, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a statement made available to TASS. It noted that Ukraine is orchestrating "another widely publicized provocation." "According to information obtained by Russia's SVR, the Kiev regime, following its attempts at provocations with unmanned aerial vehicles in Poland and Romania's airspace, continues its efforts to draw European NATO countries into an armed confrontation with Moscow. This time, the scheme will revolve around a sabotage and reconnaissance group allegedly made up of servicemen from Russia and Belarus' special forces," the agency said. "These are the militants from the Freedom of Russia legion (recognized as a terrorist organization and outlawed in Russia - TASS) fighting on the side of Ukraine and the Belarusian Kalinovsky regiment (recognized as a terrorist organization in Belarus - TASS)," the SVR press service said. The SVR added that following the "detection and neutralization" of the sabotage and reconnaissance group by Polish special services, its members plan to talk to the media and "claim responsibility for Russia and Belarus' attempts to destabilize the situation in Poland." "Amid a series of incidents with ‘Russian drone incursions' into European countries, these developments should not leave any doubt among Polish and other European citizens that Moscow and Minsk are behind all hostile actions," the statement said. The SVR press service underlined that the operation, masterminded by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) together with Polish intelligence, may involve simulated attacks on Poland's critical infrastructure facilities "in order to fuel public anger." Kiev expects to provoke European countries into delivering the harshest response to Russia, preferably militarily. Facing certain defeat, the Zelensky regime is prepared, shielded by Europeans, to go all out, even at the cost of sparking a 'major war,'" the statement emphasized.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Photojournalist Amber Bracken says that the Mounties' efforts to deny her bail and keep her in jail is frightening.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press The RCMP wanted a well-known photojournalist kept in custody for months or more after Mounties alleged she assaulted a sheriff following her high-profile arrest at the 2021 Wet'suwet'en pipeline standoff. Supreme Court as part of a civil suit launched by photographer Amber Bracken and The Narwhal media outlet against the RCMP showed how the Mounties tried – and quickly failed – to get Ms. Bracken charged and detained without bail for an incident related to her release from three nights in jail. Ms. Bracken had been arrested in November, 2021, along with 14 others after RCMP moved in to remove protesters blocking access to a Coastal GasLink construction site near Houston, B.C., on Wet'suwet'en territory. Ms. Bracken was arrested inside a cabin where some of the protesters were refusing to leave the pipeline project's so-called exclusion zone, which a special unit of the RCMP was tasked with clearing to make way for work crews. Amber Bracken: Press credentials didn't help me against the RCMP in Wet'suwet'en territory. In the lawsuit, Ms. Bracken and The Narwhal allege RCMP leadership knew she was a journalist and that she should not be arrested for contempt of an injunction as long as she was reporting on matters of public interest and not taking part in unlawful activity. During a civil hearing last Friday, court heard that upon Ms. Bracken's release from the Prince George jail, she got into an altercation with one of the sheriffs who was escorting her out of her cell. CCTV of an alleged assault by Amber Bracken on a sheriff that her lawyer says amounted to Ms. Bracken pushing a finger into the officer's chest. The sheriff in question told police she had become “extremely agitated and struck him in the left shoulder with an aggressive punching/pushing motion." In the documents, the Prince George RCMP list several reasons why Crown counsel should order Ms. Bracken be kept in custody. The RCMP argued that because Ms. Bracken lives in Edmonton, she would be unlikely to return for any future hearings and that her alleged assault of the sheriff “has interfered with the administration of justice.” Should Bracken be released it would place the justice system into disrepute.” Ms. Bracken said after the court hearing last week that the Mounties' efforts to deny her bail and keep her in jail is frightening. “I value my personal freedom and I really wouldn't be a photojournalist if I didn't also value the checks on power that are foundational to a free society,” she said in an interview. “When that reality sinks in – the police would keep me in jail until trial on a charge like this – it's absolutely chilling.” The court heard that hours before she was ultimately released for good, a Prince George detachment staff sergeant called a Crown prosecutor and then that prosecutor called him back 20 minutes later. But the sheriff told police Ms. Bracken had become “extremely agitated and struck him in the left shoulder with an aggressive punching/pushing motion,” according to court records.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exclusive: more than 100 members of Congress warn TPS cancellations will result in significant staff losses that US healthcare facilities will struggle to replace The US healthcare system faces a “perfect storm”, more than 100 members of Congress warn today, as Donald Trump's administration risks exacerbating pressure on its workforce by stripping nearly one million US immigrants of work authorization and legal protection. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) has granted about 570,000 US workers protection from deportation, as their home countries are regarded as dangerous, due to factors like war and natural disaster. Under Trump, the federal government has sought to cancel this status for people from eight countries – Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, and Venezuela – raising concerns about the impact on key sectors of the US workforce. In a letter sent today to senior Trump officials, seen by the Guardian, an array of Democratic lawmakers led by the veteran senator Elizabeth Warren caution that the US healthcare system “cannot withstand yet another blow” after broader cuts since Trump return to office. Signatories of the letter – sent to Kristi Noem, US homeland security secretary; Robert F Kennedy Jr, health and human services secretary; and Lori Chavez-DeRemer, labor secretary – include Warren, senators Chris Van Hollen, Ed Markey, Cory Booker, Tammy Duckworth, andKirsten Gillibrand, as well as ongresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Pramila Jayapal, and Jasmine Crockett. Some 15% of non-citizen healthcare workers originate from nations under temporary protected status. “The TPS terminations, together with the massive cuts to Medicaid from President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), will combine to create a perfect storm for Americans' health care,” the lawmakers write. “While the termination of TPS will remove thousands of health care workers from the workforce, the OBBBA will make deep cuts to Medicaid, force hospital and nursing home closures, and trigger health care workforce layoffs.” “The revocation of TPS belies the claim that they're going after criminals on its face, because everyone who has TPS has undergone rigorous and ongoing background checks,” said Chris Newman, legal director and general counsel for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), told the Guardian. “This is why it's so laughable on its face, that the Trump administration equates TPS with gang activity, because these are all people who have undergone background checks. Newman also represents the family of Kilmar Ábrego García, a father of three in Maryland whom the Trump administration wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March. A federal court later ordered his return to the US. “Fewer nursing and home health professionals also have a ripple effect across the health care system, contributing to discharge backlogs in many other care settings – from post-acute rehabs to hospitals.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian National Guard senior officer and two other service members were killed in a Ukrainian intelligence operation in the North Caucasus on Sept. 27, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said. HUR released footage of the Russian officer being watched from afar, and a subsequent explosion hitting his moving vehicle. Ukraine's intelligence and security services have been linked to a number of assassinations targeting Russian military officers far from the front lines since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Tambukan lies in southwestern Russia, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the Georgian border and about 650 kilometers (400 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine. The North Caucasus is one of Russia's most volatile regions, with a long history of insurgency, radicalism, and ethnic tensions. Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He has previously worked as a news content editor at the media company Newsmatics and is a contributor to Euromaidan Press. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. The evacuation, carried out Sept. 29-30 in coordination with Ukraine's military intelligence, included 48 Ukrainian citizens, as well as nine Palestinian nationals. Ukrenergo's supervisory board fired Zaichenko and three management board members on Sept. 26, just three months after appointing him — prompting questions about potential tensions between the government and the supervisory board or a possible move to seize control of the company. "Sabotage operations are on the rise and we will not risk agents operating under diplomatic cover," Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky wrote on X. According to Russian budget documents, federal spending on police, the National Guard, and other law enforcement and intelligence services is set to rise 13% year-on-year to a record 3.91 trillion rubles ($47 billion). This was one of the reasons why the U.S. lifted sanctions on Belarusian state airline Belavia, U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said. And of course, it will also allow the EU to benefit from this technology," Ursula von der Leyen said. EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos lauded Ukraine for completing the screening "at record speed" in "the most difficult circumstances."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The odds are you're reading this on your phone. You may have come here via social media, the CNN app, an email or a good old-fashioned browser. The chances are you did not open your smartphone with the intention to load this story, but here you are. Studies have found even when we're not using them, if we're in the same room as our smartphone it's affecting our brains. Yet in less than a generation, they have become an indispensable part of our lives. Nevertheless, plenty of people are finding ways to disconnect. Some want a digital detox to boost performance and wellbeing; some are concerned parents; others cite data privacy fears, or are choosing to wall themselves off from the attention economy. At the extreme end, some youths are turning their backs on technology and proudly defining themselves as Luddites. There is a bubbling, and highly invested community of users offering advice online about where to buy “deadstock” (old handsets no longer in production) and detailed specification comparisons of current models, for those with the inclination or the luxury to make the change. The feature phone market remains large according to Yang Wang, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, though it's gradually declining, as more people in developing countries upgrade to smartphones. Last year, around 15% of handsets sold globally were feature phones — nearly 210 million devices, with a value of $3.2 billion, he said. ‘Inconvenient,' ‘retrograde' and more popular than ever: The rise of instax cameras In these and other developed economies, niche manufacturers are creating premium alternatives, catering to a culture shift fuelled by online movements like Bring Back Blackberry, hashtag #BringBackFlipPhones and UK grassroots scheme Smartphone Free Childhood. Kaiwei Tang, cofounder of mobile phone company Light, said the firm sprang from a Google Creative Lab incubator in 2014. He and future business partner Joe Hollier were surrounded by entrepreneurs boasting about their apps' engagement time. “I asked myself,” said Tang, “What about me? “Every free app, every social media platform, every browser, is trying to maximize engagement so they can make money collecting data and categorizing people into different groups so they can sell it to advertisers.” Tang and Hollier resolved to create a phone from the ground up; one that would not show users advertisements, that ensured every interaction had a clear ending, and that would never show you a feed to scroll through endlessly. When Tang pitched the phone to Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturer of iPhones and other smartphones, in 2015, an executive told him even his family might need one. “I want to make it boring,” Tang said of the user experience, which leans into a black and white, text-based display. (The same tactic is employed by Punkt's MP range — some research and a growing body of anecdotal evidence suggests switching to grayscale can reduce screen time.) The Light Phone is looking at adding more tools, like two-factor authentication and contactless payment, and is even exploring integrating an AI assistant. In the spring, Light launched The Light Phone III, and over 100,000 people are using its devices worldwide, said the cofounder, despite Light forgoing paid advertising and retailing for a premium price. Just because a phone is dumb, or has limited features, that doesn't mean it's cheap. Economies of scale mean smaller companies are paying a premium for materials, and working with fewer R&D resources than the likes of Apple or Samsung. Punkt sells around 50,000 units across its range annually, Neby said. “You could obviously get a $5-10 flip phone from Alibaba or Amazon — if that works for you, I'm all for it,” he said. Over in Finland, manufacturer HMD Global is asking the question: Can a company do both? Between 2022 and 2023, its flip phone sales doubled, said head of product marketing Adam Ferguson, leaving HMD to wonder why. “Last time I looked, something like 61 million people have used that hashtag. Alongside its feature phone output, like Light and Punkt, HMD has begun developing smarter devices that hint at a future middle ground in the mobile phone market. A smartphone that starts life as a brick phone, it was designed for children, giving parents the power to unlock functions as their child gets older. It's the product of HMD's Better Phone Project, for which the company spoke to 37,000 children and parents about their relationship with their phones. “This huge thing has been bubbling underneath our industry for a number of years now,” said Ferguson. “People are incredibly discontent with the way devices are set up at the moment and they want change,” he added — particularly parents introducing their children to mobile phones for the first time. “Every family can tailor the experience to a child,” said Ferguson. Its buzzy feature is the Fuse's integration of HarmBlock, which detects nudity on screen. An AI developed by SafeToNet in collaboration with the Internet Watch Foundation, HarmBlock was trained on 22 million instances of inappropriate imagery, said Ferguson. “We've been working with (HarmBlock) for over a year now to embed it deep into the device so that it can't be bypassed,” Ferguson explained. By focusing on younger Gen Z and emerging Gen Alpha users, the Fuse wants to foster a healthier relationship with phones from the get-go. Devices like the Fuse, The Light Phone, and Punkt's first smartphone, the MC02 (which is marketed on its robust privacy and security features) point to a widening — or at least more conscientious — view of what consumers want from their phones. “Once you get to (market) maturity … then it starts to go into more niches,” said Neby, who foresees “more fragmentation” within the smartphone industry. Could the biggest smartphone manufacturers fill those niches and go “dumb” themselves? Reinvention and renewed energy: London Fashion Week enters a new era But there's always the chance the big guns could be swayed by rising consumer demand and start adopting new ideas. Ferguson believes in the case of the Fuse's child-safety functions, there's “money to be made” that could tempt manufacturers to introduce them. “It's not easy to be a dwarf in this field of giants,” said Neby. Though he argued there's a necessity for feature phone businesses like his to exist, and even thrive amid cultural change. “Punkt is not here to become the next Apple. Punkt is here to provide a choice,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"During the war, this technology is of critical importance — to keep hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, and front-line regions connected," Fedorov said on his Telegram channel. There are currently over 50,000 Starlink terminals operating in Ukraine, with more than 29,000 supplied by Poland. The historian-turned-politician, who took a tougher position toward Kyiv than his predecessor, first vetoed the bill in August, demanding stricter rules on benefits for Ukrainians and additional amendments about the border, history, and Ukrainian nationalism. Nawrocki later signed a revised version of the bill, in which the parliament agreed to limit benefits to employed Ukrainians only. As his proposals regarding historical issues were disregarded, the president introduced a bill on Sept. 29 that would make it a crime to disseminate "false claims" about the Volyn massacres, extend the period needed to obtain Polish citizenship, and introduce harsher penalties for illegal border crossings. The Volyn (Volhynian) massacres of 1943-1944 took place in the Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Hardly a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed his “Global Governance Initiative,” Beijing made its intent clear at the most global of forums — that it should, and is qualified to, help shape the world order even as the United States tips more inward under Donald Trump. Li never once mentioned the United States by name. It represents a shift in approach to global affairs that experts say reflects a China that sees itself on the ascent. “Li's speech confirms that China's foreign policy posture today is firmly anchored in the ambition of turning a Western-dominant world order into one that is much more conducive to Chinese interests, values, and leadership,” said Olivia Cheung, lecturer in politics at King's College London. “China's foreign policy today is notably more confident, strategic, and coherent than how it was in 2017, where Beijing's presentation of global governance reform lacked content.” “How could we, when confronted with unscrupulous acts of hegemonism and bullying, remain silent and submissive for fear of might?” the Chinese premier asked. Then, the Chinese premier portrayed China as a desirable answer to such problems — a founding member of the United Nations that has in recent years shared “China's wisdom and solution for navigating global transformations and overcoming pressing challenges.” The Global Governance Initiative, as proposed by Xi in early September, “points the right direction and provides an important pathway for building a more just and equitable global governance system,” Li said. She said Beijing has viewed the global governance system as “dominated by Western powers, especially the United States” and serving their interests in a way that is “often unfair or unrepresentative.” What Beijing is most interested in, Cheung said, is “changing global governance in a way that puts the United Nations front and center” where China can have “a lot more involvement and influences and leverage in how it functions.” Li's speech Friday conveys the impression that Xi's proposition of “forging the common destiny for humankind' is not only an aspiration but ”policy actions that are noble and urgent, with which China uniquely has strong technical competencies to lead,” Cheung told the Associated Press. As the Trump administration imposes steep tariffs, threatens territorial annexations and goes after multilateral institutions, “China seeks to present itself as a key upholder of a postwar order in whose viability the United States seems to be losing confidence”, said Ali Wyne, a senior research and advocacy advisory for U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group. Instead, he said, China appears interested in deepening its influences in certain areas and attempting to legitimize its longstanding contention that new norms are needed to reflect emerging geopolitical trends. The gulf between Beijing's words and its actions is another question. “Premier Li's remarks leaned heavily on multilateral language, but Beijing's track record tells a different story,” Singleton said. He added: “Li's calls for ‘cooperation' and ‘openness' sound constructive, but they're designed to blunt pressure on China's economy and technology sector.” He assured the group that China would “continuously expand market access and increase imports” and provide foreign businesses with “the certainty they need to operate and develop in China,” according to a Chinese government statement.
