                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exercise can help to restore a more normal, well-regulated immune system in people with post-COVID syndrome, according to a gold-standard randomized-controlled trial presented at the European Respiratory Society Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Dr. Daynes told the Congress: "Research suggests that those with post-COVID syndrome are at an increased risk of immune dysregulation where, instead of protecting the body, the immune system can become overactive or misdirected, attacking the body's own healthy cells or reacting strongly to things that are not harmful. "This can lead to ongoing inflammation and symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, and generally feeling unwell, many of which overlap with what people experience in post-COVID syndrome." The trial included a group of 31 patients diagnosed with post-COVID syndrome who had been treated for COVID in hospital. Some of the patients were randomly assigned to take part in an eight-week exercise-based rehabilitation programme which included treadmill walking, cycling and strength training, while other patients were given standard care. Naïve immune cells are important for recognizing and responding to new infections. These are responsible for providing a quick response to any infections that the body has encountered before, which could include COVID. We also found that central and effector memory CD8+T cells improved throughout the body. The team now plan to investigate if these benefits are the same in patients who have not been hospitalized with their initial COVID infection. Dr. Guido Vagheggini from the European Respiratory Society's expert group on respiratory clinical care and physiology, based at Portoferraio, Isola d'Elba, Italy, who was not involved in the research, said: "Post-COVID syndrome effects people of all ages. "This research shows that people with post-COVID syndrome who are able to complete an exercise-based rehabilitation programme may experience benefits in their immune cell function. This could mean they experience fewer symptoms of immune dysfunction such as fatigue and joint pain. They may also be better at fighting COVID and other infections in the future. "The findings are important for patients who fear repeated infections of COVID and provides a potential solution to this concern."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, survival rates remain poor. A key factor behind this resistance is hypoxia-or the shortage of oxygen that develops inside tumors as they grow. Hypoxia not only promotes aggressive cancer behavior but also makes treatments less effective. Now, a new study published online on 12 September 2025, in volume 17, issue 1, in the International Journal of Oral Science, addresses this and uncovers an unexpected answer. The study was led by Distinguished Professor Zhiyuan Zhang and Associate Professor Qin Xu at the Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China, and reports that hypoxia can directly activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-a protein that normally drives cell growth and survival when switched on by external signals. In a remarkable discovery, the team identified a previously unknown long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which they named EUDAL-short for EGFR ubiquitination- and degradation-associated lncRNA. Unlike messenger RNAs that code for proteins, lncRNAs regulate other molecules inside cells. Normally, EGFR is kept under control by a cellular "tagging" system, where helper proteins such as c-Cbl/Grb2 attach small molecular labels that signal it for disposal. EUDAL blocks this step by binding to EGFR and preventing its breakdown. As a result, EGFR remains permanently active, triggering downstream signaling pathways (STAT3/BNIP3; Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) and promoting autophagy-a recycling mechanism that cancer cells hijack to survive chemotherapy. "This noncanonical activation gives tumors a survival advantage and helps explain why many patients do not respond to chemotherapy." They found that oral cancer cells with high EUDAL levels resisted cisplatin, a standard chemotherapy drug. However, when EUDAL was blocked, cancer cells regained their sensitivity to the drug treatment. Tumors rich in EUDAL continued to grow even after cisplatin therapy, but when combined with inhibitors of STAT3 or autophagy, chemotherapy became effective again, significantly reducing tumor size. The team also examined tumor samples from patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy. Those with higher levels of EUDAL, active EGFR, and STAT3 were far more likely to have poor responses, while patients with lower levels responded better to treatment. In practice, measuring EUDAL levels could help predict which patients are unlikely to benefit from standard chemotherapy, allowing doctors to choose alternative or combination strategies." EGFR is a well-known cancer driver and a common target for therapies, but its activation was previously thought to depend on mutations or external growth factors. However, further research is needed before these insights can be translated into clinical practice. Drugs that block EUDAL or its downstream signaling could one day be paired with chemotherapy to outsmart resistant tumors. By revealing how tumors exploit EUDAL to survive, this study exposes a hidden vulnerability in oral cancer. Cutting off this escape route may offer patients a better chance at successful treatment and longer survival. LncRNA EUDAL shapes tumor cell response to hypoxia-induced constitutive EGFR activation and promotes chemoresistance in oral cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tagomics Ltd., a pioneering biomarker discovery and diagnostics company, today announced the publication of a peer-reviewed study in Cell Reports Methods, underpinning its epigenomic profiling technology, Active-Seq, the basis of Tagomics' Activace™  platform. The paper, titled 'Genome-wide profiling of unmodified DNA using methyltransferase-directed tagging and enrichment', built on research from the University of Birmingham, describes Tagomics' enzymatic approach to epigenomic profiling that targets unmethylated DNA for enrichment, and its application to biomarker identification and disease profiling in colorectal cancer patients. Current gold standard approaches for assessing genome-wide DNA methylation levels are poorly suited to the challenge of working in liquid biopsy (blood) samples, limiting the performance of cell-free DNA based diagnostic tests. Addressing these limitations, the paper describes Active-Seq (Azide Click Tagging for In Vitro Epigenomic sequencing), a base conversion-free methodology that does not alter the underlying DNA sequence and provides a scalable and comprehensive solution for the discovery of novel biomarkers in liquid biopsy samples. Activace, built on the Active-Seq technology, is a streamlined workflow that incorporates sequencing library preparation with enrichment of unmethylated DNA. The workflow is compatible with low DNA input quantities, down to one nanogram, and has been optimized for the analysis of DNA methylation in cfDNA derived from liquid biopsy samples. This paper is an important milestone for Tagomics, demonstrating the groundbreaking technology that underpins our Activace and Interlace platforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blood loss and leakage are significant complications that can occur during dialysis treatment. These incidents can be life-threatening for patients and challenging for medical personnel and nephrology nurses. This is where a blood leak detector comes in. It monitors fluid transmission and detects potential leaks. Hemodialysis systems typically feature a blood leak alarm that can recognize even minimal traces of blood in clear fluids. This mechanism helps eliminate waste materials like salts and water. Ensuring proper filtration is essential because blood must not breach the dialysate membrane. Reusing dialyzers—especially after disinfection procedures involving bleach and heat—can weaken the membrane and increase the risk of rupture. Clinical evidence suggests that blood loss during dialysis can lead to severe outcomes such as fainting, low blood pressure, or even cardiac arrest. Additionally, catheter insertion may trigger discomfort in the chest, neck, or shoulder regions, cause pain in the groin or lower abdomen, or result in hemoptysis. An optical sensor in the detector uses a light source to identify red blood cells. Once a specific threshold is reached, it triggers an alarm. This sensor can be adjusted for compatibility with other devices by changing the wavelength used. Based on findings from the American Nephrology Nurses' Association VND survey, nearly half of dialysis patients express concern about the risk of severe blood loss. To address this, several non-invasive blood detection methods—including pad-based, optical, and moisture sensors—have been developed for use in dialysis treatment. One such solution is Introtek's BC1 miniature blood component detector, which features advanced fluid detection capabilities for clear tubing. These devices utilize high-sensitivity detection to reduce the likelihood of false blood leak alerts, which are often caused by factors like air bubbles or system issues stemming from grease accumulation. The Introtek sensor supports targeted clinical uses, such as minimizing blood loss and avoiding fluid contamination during dialysis. Additionally, customers may request tailored design adjustments to suit specific application needs. Introtek sensors utilize a patented pulse-type ultrasonic technology that detects air bubbles, air-in-line, and liquid levels with the highest degree of accuracy and reliability, thereby maintaining an extremely high MTBF. Introtek sensors are not susceptible to the limitations exhibited by continuous wave, capacitive, or load-cell sensors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, with most patients presenting at locally advanced stages. While immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 blockade, have reshaped treatment strategies, only a minority of patients achieve durable benefit. Accurate biomarkers for predicting treatment response remain an urgent unmet need. A multicenter study led by Prof. Shuixing Zhang and Prof. Bin Zhang from the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University enrolled 246 patients with locally advanced NPC treated with immunotherapy. By applying artificial intelligence algorithms, the team extracted and selected optimal radiomic features from medical imaging to construct a predictive model. Results demonstrated that this AI-based radiomics model achieved an AUC of 0.760, significantly outperforming traditional clinical models (AUC 0.559) in predicting treatment response. For prognosis, the optimal model reached a C-index of 0.858, accurately stratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups. Together, this work highlights the promise of radiomics as a powerful, non-invasive tool for precision immunotherapy in NPC. By combining advanced imaging analytics with pathology correlation, the study not only improves predictive accuracy but also bridges radiomic signatures with tumor biology, offering new insights into patient stratification and personalized treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These dietary changes, in turn, reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, especially among men with a high genetic risk, a study conducted at the University of Eastern Finland shows. The T2D-GENE study investigated the effects of group-based and online lifestyle counselling on dietary changes among men living in the eastern part of Finland, and how these changes influenced their risk of type 2 diabetes. The study also examined whether a high genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes has an impact on the benefits gained from dietary changes. Men in the intervention group received lifestyle counselling over a three-year period. The study found that lifestyle counselling delivered in group sessions and through a web portal helped participants adopt healthier dietary habits. Health-promoting dietary choices were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, particularly among individuals carrying a high number of diabetes-associated risk genes. Participants in the intervention group successfully increased their intake of fibre, whole grain products, berries, vegetables, fish and plant-based oils. At the same time, reported consumption of sausages, high-fat cheeses, low-fibre grain products, sweets and butter decreased. Numerous previous studies have shown that type 2 diabetes can be prevented, or at least delayed, through health-promoting lifestyle habits. Group-based and online counselling is more resource-efficient than individual counselling," Doctoral Researcher Ulla Tolonen of the University of Eastern Finland notes and adds: Our new findings show that group-based and online counselling is sufficient to support lifestyle changes among individuals with a high genetic risk of type 2 diabetes." Participants' consumption of individual foods was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, while fiber intake was evaluated both through food records and by measuring plasma alkylresorcinol, which is a biomarker of whole grain intake. All participants had impaired fasting blood glucose at baseline. Tolonen, U., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asking people how much money they would accept to experience pain again can provide a more accurate and comparable measure of pain levels than the familiar 1-10 scale, according to an international research team led by Lancaster University. Published in the journal Social Science & Medicine , the study indicates that people's theoretical willingness to accept money in exchange for enduring pain offers a more reliable way to measure discomfort than conventional 'self-reported' measures of pain levels such as number scales or visual charts. The familiar "rate your pain from one to ten" question is widely used in clinical and research settings, but its limitations are well known. Individuals interpret the scale differently, making it difficult to compare results across people or groups. By contrast, the authors of the study say that putting a price on pain creates a shared frame of reference. Professor Carlos Alós-Ferrer, from Lancaster University Management School explained: "We've all been asked to rate our pain from one to ten—but one person's three might be another's five, and those numbers can shift with experience. Our research proposes a better way: turning pain into money—not to commodify suffering, but to create a scale we can all share. Different people still will put a different price on the same pain, but there is no problem interpreting the question. As a result, measurements are more precise and the shift from low to high levels of pain is clearly reflected in the monetary scale. This makes it useful for clinical trials to study the effectiveness of painkillers and treatments, because participants are randomly assigned to different groups." The authors of the study say that refining pain self-reported measurement is important because inaccurate pain measurements can lead to inadequate pain management for example in an emergency, a reduction in quality of life for those with longer term conditions, as well as imposing a considerable burden on health care systems. For example, more than US $600 billion are spent annually in the USA to treat pain, surpassing the cost of treating heart disease and diabetes. The authors suggest that their method provides a complementary approach to reliably measure experienced pain across individuals and could open the door to future research improving pain measurement and management.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Girls who overeat regularly in the preschool years are more likely to experience anxiety, impulsivity and hyperactivity in adolescence, according to a new study led by researchers at McGill University and the Douglas Research Centre. The study followed more than 2,000 Quebec children using provincial data, tracking eating patterns reported by caregivers in early childhood and assessing mental-health symptoms when participants turned 15. The findings suggest that children's eating patterns can be early signals of mental-health challenges. "Occasional overeating is normal, but if a child frequently overeats, it can be a sign of emotional struggles," said senior author Linda Booij, Professor in McGill's Department of Psychiatry and clinician-scientist at the Douglas Eating Disorders Continuum and Research Centre. In fact, strict control can make things worse and even increase the risk of disordered eating. Instead, parents and caregivers should also pay attention to children's emotional well-being." The differing results for girls and boys may be partly explained by sociocultural factors, Booij said. "It could be that parents may sometimes monitor girls' eating more closely than boys', and restrictive environments could be linked to increased risk of disordered eating later in life. The social context around girls' eating habits may partly explain why overeating is linked with later difficulties for them," she said. The researchers identified three patterns of overeating in young children: about 60 per cent showed no signs of overeating, roughly 14 per cent began overeating early between ages two and four, and about 26 per cent started later, around age four. Girls who started to overeat either early or later on were more likely than were the non-overeaters to report such symptoms as anxiety, hyperactivity and impulsivity at age 15. About one-third of the children were picky eaters in early childhood, and those habits tended to stay the same during their childhood. But unlike overeating, picky eating showed no connection to mental-health struggles in adolescence. While many parents worry about picky eating, Booij says it is often a common developmental phase that, on its own, does not necessarily signal later emotional or behavioral problems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Can a traditional Mayan leafy green help tackle diabetes? A new review examines Chaya's bioactive compounds, animal study findings, and interaction concerns, positioning the plant as a candidate for future complementary treatments. Review: Chaya Leaf: A Promising Approach for Diabetes Management. Medicinal plants have increasingly garnered research attention, as they can be utilized to develop food items and medications for the prevention and management of chronic illnesses. Mexico has a diverse array of plants, with approximately 4,500 species, but only around 5% have been subject to pharmacological evaluation. Chaya is an underexplored plant with numerous health benefits. However, information on bioactive compounds accounting for the health benefits of chaya is lacking. First, they conducted a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scielo, Google Scholar, and Dialnet databases, using relevant search terms. Studies were selected based on relevance to the plant's pharmacological, ethnobotanical, and nutritional aspects. The chaya plant is a domesticated, spineless variant (Cnidoscolus chayamansa) of C. aconitifolius, also known as quelite or tree spinach, and originates from the Mayan regions in the Americas. The stems and leaves of the plant contain proteins, minerals (calcium, phosphorus, sodium, zinc, copper, manganese, magnesium, etc. The plant stands out for its protein content, which exceeds 5%, and contains seven of the nine essential amino acids. Additionally, its crude fiber content also exceeds 2%. Because chaya leaves contain cyanogenic glycosides (notably linamarin), they should be cooked before consumption. The review reports hydrogen cyanide levels well below FDA limits after roughly five minutes of cooking, supporting culinary use when properly prepared. Akt = protein kinase B; FOXO1 = Forkhead box protein O1; G6Pase = glucose-6-phosphatase; GLUT1–4 = glucose transporter 1–4; GLUT 4 = glucose transporter type 4; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor-1; IRS-1 = insulin receptor substrate 1; miR-29 = microRNA-29; PEPCK = phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PI3K = phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Chaya extracts contain flavonoids, such as rutin and quercetin, that may help reduce blood sugar levels. Antioxidants in chaya may enhance insulin sensitivity, which can help manage blood sugar levels. The reduction of oxidative stress by antioxidants may potentially improve beta-cell function, particularly in terms of insulin synthesis. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of methanolic extracts of C. chayamansa on blood sugar levels in diabetic rats. One study tested several doses of the methanolic extract in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. The study found that only the 70 mg/kg dose effectively decreased postprandial blood sugar levels compared to rats treated with glibenclamide, an anti-diabetic medication, while it did not lower fasting glucose like insulin. Another study investigated the effect of combining metformin with black and green teas derived from C. aconitifolius on the health of rats with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study group that consumed both teas, along with metformin, showed improvements in fasting glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, as well as reductions in creatinine, urea, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. A separate rat study observed antagonistic effects when chaya was combined with metformin, with glucose levels remaining high in most groups, highlighting the need to investigate potential drug-herb interactions. Another study evaluated the effects of methanolic extracts of C. aconitifolius leaves in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes. Different doses of the extract reduced blood sugar levels, outperforming chlorpropamide, a commonly used anti-diabetic medication. Two sample fractions showed marked anti-inflammatory effects, surpassing those of the crude extract. Conversely, rice prepared with alache had a GL and GI of 33.74. These data indicated that quelites could serve as beneficial dietary alternatives. Overall, evidence supports the anti-diabetic effects of chaya. Chaya methanolic extracts significantly decrease blood glucose in rats with diabetes, while aqueous extracts additionally improve lipid profiles and overall health. Combining chaya extracts with standard therapies, such as metformin, has shown both beneficial and antagonistic effects, indicating that further research is needed to optimize their use. Overall, Chaya is a promising complementary candidate; however, human clinical trials, dose standardization, extract characterization, and interaction studies are still necessary before routine therapeutic use is recommended.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children lose 8.45 million days of healthy life each year globally due to second hand smoke, according to research presented at the European Respiratory Society Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Children from low socio-economic regions face the biggest impact of breathing second hand smoke, also known as passive smoking. She told the Congress: "Second-hand smoke is a major contributor to preventable illness and death in children and there is no safe exposure level. Young children are especially susceptible because their bodies and lungs are still developing and they have little control over their own environments. "Data from the World Health Organization estimate that second-hand smoke exposure causes 1.2 million premature deaths annually, including approximately 65,000 among children under the age of 15. But we know that many more children will suffer illness caused by other people smoking around them, so we wanted to quantify this problem globally and regionally, to provide evidence for more precise tobacco control policies." In the first global study to examine the impact of second-hand smoke (SHS) on children under 14 years old, Dr Dai and her colleague Miss Ruiying Jin analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease Study [2], a large international project that tracks deaths and illness from major diseases, injuries, and risk factors across the world. In simple terms, one DALY equals one year of healthy life lost (whether from dying too early or living with illness or disability). Looking at data across more than 200 countries and territories, Dr Dai estimated the years lost to second-hand smoke across major disease categories from 1990 to 2021 in children aged 0–14 years. The researchers found that SHS continues to pose a serious health risk to children worldwide, but is particularly problematic in poorer regions, where the rates of disease burden (measured in DALYs) were much higher. Dr Dai explained: "The impact of second-hand smoke on children's respiratory health remains severe, but in some parts of the world, children are suffering even more than in others. Children in lower-SDI regions bear a disproportionate share of this preventable health burden. This likely reflects a combination of factors such as lower public awareness about the dangers of second-hand smoke, more overcrowded and poorly ventilated homes, and weaker tobacco control policies. These conditions may lead to higher exposure for children. Children are losing all these years of healthy life, but this could be prevented if they were protected from other people's smoke," she added. Dr Dai plans to carry out further analyses of SHS-related respiratory disease burden based on age, gender, and other factors, to support more precise and targeted interventions in the near future. Dr Filippos Filippidis, Chair of the European Respiratory Society's tobacco control committee, based at Imperial College, London, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "Around the world, hundreds of millions of people are still smoking and many are being exposed to second-hand smoke. However, the most efficient approach is to reduce smoking across all age groups, which would substantially limit second-hand smoke exposure for children as well. "As tobacco companies intensify marketing of emerging products, such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco, it is also important to explore how these may indirectly affect children's health when they are exposed to second-hand vapors."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For patients with intermediate-risk, localized prostate cancer, radiation therapy delivered in five sessions reduced patient-reported side effects compared to longer courses of radiation, according to results of a large, randomized phase III trial. Patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) reported fewer declines in bowel, urinary and sexual functioning but were more likely to experience a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA). These findings provide important new evidence to help guide treatment decisions for patients with localized prostate cancer, a disease with typically high cure rates and long life expectancy. The results help clarify what patients can expect from shorter versus longer courses of radiation therapy and enable more personalized treatment decisions based on individual priorities." Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in male patients. Roughly 70,000 U.S. adults each year are diagnosed with intermediate-risk disease confined to the prostate, for which radiation therapy is a standard treatment option. More recently, investigators have tested whether SBRT, which delivers higher doses in as few as five sessions, can further shorten the course of therapy while maintaining high cure rates. SBRT uses advanced imaging and treatment planning techniques to target tumors with extreme precision, minimizing radiation exposure to nearby organs such as the bladder and rectum. The approach offers practical advantages, including fewer visits, less travel and lower average costs, but it requires specialized technology and expertise that may not be widely available. The NRG-GU005 trial was designed to test whether SBRT would outperform moderately hypofractionated radiation for both cancer control and patient-reported outcomes. Researchers enrolled 698 patients with previously untreated, intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer across multiple centers internationally from 2017 to 2022. Co-primary endpoints combined clinical measures of disease control with patient-reported outcomes collected via questionnaires administered at baseline, 12 months and 24 months after treatment to track whether patients experienced clinically meaningful declines in bowel, urinary or sexual functioning. Overall urinary quality of life was equivalent between the groups, but urinary incontinence was less common two years after SBRT (declines for 25.9% vs. 34.7% with MH-IMRT, p=0.023). Regarding disease-free survival, 88.6% of patients in the SBRT group were free from disease progression after three years, compared to 92.1% receiving longer courses of radiation. "With treatments involving larger doses per fraction, patients can experience temporary PSA elevations, or 'benign bounces,' that resolve over time. We need five-year follow-up to determine whether these elevations translate into actual disease progression." The GU005 trial used a lower total SBRT dose than other recent studies (36.25 vs. 40 Gy), which Dr. Ellis said may alternatively explain the higher rate of PSA progression. By comparison, the PACE-B trial, reported at ASTRO in 2023, found equivalent cancer control with the higher dose, though with increased bowel side effects. Longer follow-up from GU005 will help clarify whether the lower dose affects long-term outcomes. Local recurrence rates did not differ between the arms (1.2% SBRT vs. 1.0% MH-IMRT at 3 years, p=0.97), and three-year overall survival was equally high at 97% in each group (p=0.62). Dr. Ellis said future research will address SBRT's potential for patients with higher-risk disease and test additional strategies to further reduce side effects while maintaining survival outcomes. "Patients have different priorities and values when it comes to their care," Dr. Ellis noted. Discover how real-time Raman monitoring enhances API control and quality during hot melt extrusion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new study, Yale School of Medicine (YSM) researchers unveiled a novel diagnostic method for detecting leptospiral virulence-modifying (VM) proteins in the blood and urine of hamsters, an advance that could pave the way for early diagnosis of the tropical disease leptospirosis in humans and improved treatment options. Found around the world, leptospirosis affects approximately 1 million people annually, with nearly 60,000 fatalities. Despite the potential of the disease to cause severe illness when left untreated, early diagnosis has been a significant challenge due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic methods. The research, led by Yale's Dr. Joseph M. Vinetz and his team, in collaboration with Luna Bioscience, a company founded by Vinetz to develop vaccines for emerging global infectious diseases, has led to the development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based capture immunoassay. We have long known that leptospirosis severely impacts multiple organ systems, leading to conditions like jaundice, acute kidney injury, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Our discovery of these VM proteins as circulating exotoxins gives us a specific target for both diagnostics and potential therapeutic interventions." Leptospirosis is the first systemic bacterial disease mediated by a toxin - such as tetanus, botulism, or diphtheria - that has the potential for rapid antigen detection by a novel test, he added. The research lays the groundwork for developing rapid, inexpensive diagnostics that can be used in resource-limited settings, where leptospirosis is most prevalent, according to Vinetz, who is also a professor of epidemiology (microbial diseases) at the Yale School of Public Health. The novel diagnostic method holds promise for transforming leptospirosis management globally, he said. "By enabling early detection, health care providers can initiate timely treatments, potentially saving lives and mitigating disease severity," Vinetz said. "Furthermore, understanding the role of VM proteins in disease pathogenesis could lead to new therapeutic targets and vaccine development opportunities."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Queen Mary University of London's School of Biological and Behavioural Sciences, using the simple fission yeast as a model, have shown that new TOR inhibitor rapalink-1 prolongs chronological lifespan. The new study, published in Communications Biology journal by Juhi Kumar, Kristal Ng and Charalampos Rallis, sheds light on how drugs and natural metabolites can influence lifespan through the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway. It is a central regulator of growth and aging fundamental in age-related diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration and is already a major focus of anti-aging and cancer research, with drugs such as rapamycin showing promise in extending healthy lifespan in animals. Unexpectedly, the study revealed a key role for a set of enzymes called agmatinases, which break down the metabolite agmatine into polyamines. These enzymes act as part of a previously unknown "metabolic feedback loop" that keeps TOR activity in check. When agmatinase function was lost, cells grew faster but aged prematurely - highlighting a trade-off between short-term growth and long-term survival. Supplementing yeast with agmatine or putrescine, the compounds linked to this pathway, also promoted longevity and benefited cells under certain conditions. By showing that agmatinases are essential for healthy aging, we've uncovered a new layer of metabolic control over TOR - one that may be conserved in humans. Because agmatine is produced by diet and gut microbes, this work may help explain how nutrition and the microbiome influence aging." Rallis acknowledges that agmatine supplements are available in the market, but stresses: "We should be cautious about consuming agmatine for growth or longevity purposes. Our data indicate the agmatine supplementation can be beneficial for growth only when certain metabolic pathways related to arginine breakdown are intact. In addition, agmatine does not always promote beneficial effects as it can contribute to certain pathologies". The findings have broad implications for healthy aging research, cancer biology, and metabolic disease, pointing to new strategies that combine TOR-targeting drugs with dietary or microbial interventions.
