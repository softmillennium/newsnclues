Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin rides along with immigration enforcement agents as they conduct raids in Chicago on ‘Special Report.' Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office conducted an unprecedented large-scale investigation in Minneapolis this month, focused on those who were committing marriage and asylum fraud. Under a mission known as Operation Twin Shield, officers targeted 1,000 cases, knocking on doors at more than 900 sites to conduct interviews and review immigration criteria. It's the first operation after a new rule finalized earlier this month allowed USCIS to expand its law enforcement duties. In 44 of those cases, the immigrants were referred to ICE or given a notice to appear (NTA) in court. Authorities detained a man believed to be committing immigration fraud. In one example, an immigrant engaged in a sham marriage with an elderly U.S. citizen and subjected the citizen to "elder abuse and exploitation," according to USCIS. Another immigrant admitted to fabricating a death certificate from Kenya for $100 to falsely claim the termination of a marriage — the spouse in question was alive, living in Minneapolis and the mother of five of his children. Other cases included a petitioner who confessed to marriage fraud just hours after swearing under oath that her marriage was legitimate, and another involving an immigrant who had overstayed a visa waiver, was the son of a suspected terrorist, and had previously been denied benefits for fraud. USCIS Director Joseph Edlow described the operation as part of a broader shift in enforcement posture under President Donald Trump. "USCIS is declaring an all-out war on immigration fraud. We will relentlessly pursue everyone involved in undermining the integrity of our immigration system and laws. With help from ICE and the FBI, USCIS' Operation Twin Shield was a tremendous success — hundreds of bad actors will be held accountable," Edlow said. USCIS officers conducted more than 900 site visits in Minneapolis. USCIS said it is the first time the agency has committed resources on this scale to a single geographic area and signaled more such crackdowns could follow. Officials expect the number of NTAs, referrals to ICE and adverse adjudications to increase as investigations continue. Officials emphasized that unlike during the Biden administration, USCIS officers are now empowered to thoroughly vet applicants and aggressively pursue fraud wherever it is encountered. The Minneapolis surge marks the first time USCIS has deployed resources at this scale in a single region, and leadership suggested it could become a model for future crackdowns in other parts of the country. With more administrative investigations still underway, the number of arrests and court referrals is expected to rise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said a shutdown is “probably likely,” casting blame for the looming funding lapse on Democrats. • Defense meeting: During a lengthy speech to senior military leaders, Trump suggested that the military use “dangerous cities as training grounds.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed the end of diversity efforts, said the military will require those in combat jobs to meet the “highest male standard only” and added that drill sergeants can “put their hands on recruits” to motivate them. Some of Trump's false claims were about the military itself. After Thune noted Democrats supported stopgap government funding bills during the Biden administration, Schumer argued Republican leaders didn't negotiate with them before voting on the bill. “It's not working because the leaders wouldn't discuss it with us, as we discussed with Republicans on every single one of these what should be in the bill,” Schumer said. Before beginning his remarks, Schumer took the unusual step of bringing to his lectern a poster board Thune had used to show the percentage of Democratic senators who supported the Biden-era CRs, or continuing resolutions. Schumer continued to argue against the House-passed GOP stopgap. Not once were Democrats asked for what input should be in the bill. President Donald Trump warned Tuesday that his administration can impose significant cuts on the federal workforce and “irreversible” changes if there is a shutdown, dangling the threat of job loss for government employees and other, permanent impacts that might distress Democrats with just hours before a key funding deadline. “We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, referring to Democrats. “He's become very popular recently, because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn't do any other way,” Trump said. In a memo last week, Vought directed federal agencies to prepare plans for mass firings should the government shut down – an effort to ramp up pressure on Democrats but also enact plans he been advocating for for months. Because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits. President Donald Trump on Tuesday called a government shutdown “probably likely,” casting blame for the looming funding lapse on Democrats who he blamed for refusing to back off their demands. “Nothing is inevitable, but I would say it's probably likely,” Trump said from the Oval Office, adding “I didn't see them bend even a little bit.” The pessimistic outlook came after a White House meeting with Democratic congressional leaders ended at an impasse yesterday over Democrats' demands for health care concessions. Hours later, Trump shared a racist, AI-generated video on social media mocking House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, further deepening divisions between the two sides with just hours to go until the October 1 deadline. On Tuesday, Trump took aim at Democrats again, accusing them again without evidence of seeking to “give health care to illegal immigrants.” “Once completed, the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library will be visible for miles into the Atlantic, a bold landmark on Miami's skyline and a lasting tribute to the achievements my father continues to deliver for this nation,” he added. He changed his permanent residence that year to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, in forms filed with the Palm Beach County Circuit Court. “We're going to see what happens,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “I asked the Democrat representatives, ‘What do you think about coming up with a better health care? The president connected the potential for a broader health care deal with an initiative he announced Tuesday designed to lower drug prices, contending that it could ultimately have a significant impact on Americans' health costs. Congressional Republican leaders have so far rejected that demand, insisting that Democrats will take the blame for a shutdown due to begin at midnight. But Trump on Tuesday signaled openness to striking some kind of agreement in the future, criticizing the Affordable Care Act, which is often referred to as Obamacare, as “not good” and speculating that the two sides “might be able to do something” aimed at slashing health care costs. This is about fomenting chaos and terrorizing the people of Chicago and cities across America,” Mayor Brandon Johnson told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.” During a speech to generals in Quantico, Virginia, earlier in the day, President Donald Trump suggested using some of “these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,” which the mayor called “absolutely appalling.” Dozens of Democratic lawmakers just attempted to pressure the House to consider their short-term legislation that would fund the government, as well as address President Donald Trump's rescissions and health care cuts. As Jeffries' members gathered to try to force a vote on their version of a government funding plan, some held signs reading “missing person” with a picture of House Speaker Mike Johnson's face. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries slammed the AI-generated video President Donald Trump posted last night mocking him as racist and criticized House Republicans for being away from Washington. President, the next time you have something to say about me, don't cop out through a racist and fake AI video. When I'm back in the Oval Office, say it to my face. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, speaking on Capitol Hill Trump on Monday shared a video depicting Jeffries wearing a sombrero and a mustache, shortly after he met with the House Democratic leader and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer at the White House to discuss government funding. Jeffries on Tuesday criticized House Republicans for being out of town hours away from the government funding deadline, telling them: “Do your job.” House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN earlier that he hasn't brought his chamber back because “the House has done its work.” “If Chuck Schumer does his work, everything, the machinery of government can continue. But we did our work, so there's no real reason for anybody to be here this week,” he said, noting the House was scheduled to be out this week for the Jewish holidays. Republican and Democratic senators are assigning blame to the leaders of each other's party as Congress inches closer to a government shutdown. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said “this kind of shutdown is a self-inflicted, totally unnecessary, avoidable wound that Donald Trump - not necessarily my Republican colleagues - but Donald Trump is bringing on the American people.” He added  that “we can still avoid it - even in these last hours. Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for tying an extension of expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies to government funding. You don't hold the government hostage over that. Republican Sen. John Kennedy said anticipates OMB Director Russ Vought will use a government shutdown to advance his goals, saying: “My guess is that, knowing Russ Vought as I do, that he is going to take advantage of this to do a lot of the things that he would like to do otherwise.” Asked by CNN if Republicans could bear the blame if the Trump administration moves forward with mass federal layoffs, Kennedy said he believes Americans will determine Democrats' demands are unreasonable, but both parties could be blamed in the end. The truth is, none of us have this, and we all need therapy,” he said. Immigration enforcement operations, including in cities like Chicago — where agents have bolstered their presence — will largely continue in the event of a government shutdown, according to two Homeland Security officials. Most personnel from US Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, both of which fall under the Department of Homeland Security, are considered exempt from furlough, meaning that their activities continue. CNN previously reported if the government shuts down, it's likely that immigration, border security and defense activities funded through the GOP's tax and spending package, which Trump signed into law in July, would continue. 1 provided ample resources to ensure that many core Trump Administration priorities will continue uninterrupted,” the Office of Management and Budget wrote in its memo to agencies about preparing mass layoff plans, referring to the president's domestic agenda package. Asked whom they would blame in the event of a federal shutdown, That hypothetical question offers a snapshot of where opinions stand right now, but doesn't necessarily predict what they might look like if a shutdown actually takes place, particularly as voters tune in more closely. Currently, the poll finds Democratic support for a fight narrowly outweighing opposition, with 47% of Democratic registered voters saying that Democrats should shut down the government if their demands aren't met, and 43% that they should not. Trump's overall approval rating stands at 43% among registered voters, little changed since spring, the poll finds. His approval rating is underwater on his handling of immigration, the economy, managing the federal government, trade with other countries and both the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestinian conflicts, while he breaks roughly even for his handling of crime. The New York Times/Siena poll surveyed 1,313 registered voters selected from a voter file and reached through phone calls or text messages. Interviews were conducted by live telephone interviewers or online. The FBI and Border Patrol conducted a “targeted immigration enforcement operation” early this morning in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago. Two armored vehicles and rental moving trucks were seen as part of the operation. CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for more details. “We're thinking about making it larger because we have so many people, and it's nice to be able to cut people because of merit that aren't really qualified for any reason, a physical reason, a mental reason, you don't have to take them anymore, because you have, you have the pick of the litter, and they all want to be with you,” Trump said. Trump also said he wasn't satisfied with previous people who held high-ranking positions in the military. “I can say that, as opposed to a couple of years ago, when I was talking to rooms where they were desperate to get people and they couldn't get them, what a difference a presidential election can make,” Trump said. President Donald Trump appeared to suggest in his remarks today that the Department of Defense should use “dangerous cities as training grounds” for the military and National Guard. “I told Pete [Hegseth], we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military, because we're going into Chicago very soon, that's a big city with an incompetent governor,” the president said during his remarks to a gathering of top generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia. The president then proceeded to tell a story about watching media coverage of troops being spit on, saying in part the new policy should be “they spit, we hit.” “People are standing, their mouth is this far away from their mouth, and they're spitting at them and they're screaming at them. And that soldier standing there, he wants to knock the hell out of the person, but he's not allowed to do anything,” Trump said. I think so, they spit it's a new thing. Relatedly, Trump then told the generals that if military or police vehicles are hit with bricks or other objects, that officers should “do whatever the hell” they want. Sen. Gary Peters, one of 10 senators in the Democratic caucus who voted for a stopgap bill to keep government open in March, would not say this morning how he plans to vote this time. “You'll see what I'll do in a little bit,” he told CNN. Government funding will lapse at midnight if Republicans don't reach a deal with Democrats to supply the needed votes to pass a stopgap measure. Sen. Maggie Hassan, who also joined Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in declining to block the GOP-led funding plan in March, wouldn't answer when asked whether she would vote for the House-passed bill later in the day. At least seven Democratic votes are needed to advance the bill and avert a shutdown. Democratic leaders say they want changes to health care policy before voting for the bill. Read more on the government shutdown looming over Capitol Hill. President Donald Trump, more than 40 minutes into his speech to military brass, has meandered through several topics, speaking only sporadically from his prepared remarks. At one point, he recalled the moment last month when he ordered two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country's former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. There are 2 N-words, and you can't use either of them.” At another point, Trump declared some warships produced by the military “ugly.” I don't like some of the ships you're doing aesthetically,” he pronounced. A CNN search of other Cabinet-level departments shows that HUD is the only department with this type of message on its website. At HUD, we are working to keep critical services online and support our most vulnerable.” The federal government will shut down at midnight unless Congress reaches a deal on funding. Republicans need at least seven Democrats in the Senate to join them to pass a spending package under the chamber's rules. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told senior military officers to “do the honorable thing and resign” if they did not agree with his views on diversity in the military, the military's past Covid-19 vaccine mandate, or criticisms of transgender individuals. He tallied off things he said generals and admirals were previously told about those topics, saying, “They followed civilian policies set by foolish and reckless political leaders.” “Our job, my job, has been to determine which leaders simply did what they must to answer the prerogatives of civilian leadership, and which leaders are truly invested in the ‘woke' department and therefore incapable of embracing the War Department and executive new lawful orders,” Hegseth said. “But if the words I'm speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign.” Hegseth took the opportunity to criticize retired general officers who have also come under attack by President Donald Trump, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and former commander of US Central Command Gen. Frank McKenzie. “I've never walked into a room so silent,” Trump said to laughs. Military brass, by tradition, put forward a nonpartisan posture. They listened mostly silently earlier to Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth. Trump suggested he'd been forewarned about a quiet crowd. “I was told that, ‘Sir, you won't hear a murmur in the room,'” he said. “I said we had to loosen these guys up a little bit.” He joked that anyone who didn't appreciate his message could leave — and quit.</p>

EXCLUSIVE: Unearthed note cards from the Biden era show the administration detailed the names and photos of high-profile Democrats, such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as lesser-known individuals for then-President Joe Biden to ostensibly reference during live events, documents obtained by Fox News Digital show. Five different "palm cards," which are hand-sized note cards frequently used by politicians for quick reminders or talking points during public events, especially while on the campaign trail, were uncovered amid an investigation of National Archive documents related to the Biden administration's use of an autopen, and obtained by Fox News Digital. Four of the five cards obtained by Fox Digital are stamped with a disclaimer reading, "PRESIDENT HAS SEEN," while a fifth card detailing an ABC News reporter's question to Biden during a press conference did not include that stamp. Fox News Digital reached out to Biden's office for any comment and clarification on the use of the cards but did not immediately receive a reply. Then-President Joe Biden presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in the East Room of the White House, Jan. 4, 2025, in Washington. One of the palm cards obtained by Fox Digital reads "Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients" and was followed by photos and short biographies of the recipients, including a photo of Clinton and a short note detailing she "was the Secretary of State in the Obama-Biden administration." A Biden-era note card showing members of the Pritzker family. A Biden-era "palm card" listing recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, including Hillary Clinton and Denzel Washington. The note also had photos and short bios for lesser known individuals who received the award, including renowned chef José Andrés and businessman and philanthropist David Rubenstein. Another palm card simply reading, "Judicial Confirmations Milestone Speech," showed a photo of Schumer and a separate photo of Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin accompanied by the roles in the Senate, their party and the states they represent. The card included a stamp reading, "PRESIDENT HAS SEEN." Biden celebrated his administration confirming 235 judicial nominees in January in a speech from the State Dining Room and was joined by Schumer and Durbin during the event. Durbin and Schumer also held other public events celebrating the Biden administration's judicial confirmation strides earlier in Biden's Oval Office tenure. Another palm card listed out various family members of Hollywood legend Francis Ford Coppola ahead of the 47th Kennedy Center Honors in December 2024 that honored "The Godfather" director. A fourth palm card was timestamped "Saturday, January 18 Greets," and showed a photo and short bio of White House Historical Association President Stewart McLaurin, as well as another section reading, "Pritzker Family," which displayed a photo of Democratic Illinois Gov. A photo of the palm card also read "PRESIDENT HAS SEEN." It is unclear if Pritzker visited the White House Jan. 18, which fell on a Saturday. The fifth card detailed a question from ABC News' reporter Mary Bruce. A handwritten note on the card states "Question #3." "2024: How do YOU view the path forward? How do YOU think about YOUR place in history?" "Speaker McCarthy/Debt Limit: Depending on what happens with the House vote on the Speaker's debt limit bill tomorrow, do do YOU anticipate moving forwards?" A Fox News Digital review found that the ABC News journalist asked Biden about his re-election effort during a joint press conference with the South Korean president April 26, 2023, in the Rose Garden. Bruce asked, "You recently launched your reelection campaign. You've said questions about your age are ‘legitimate.' And your response is always, ‘Just watch me.' But the country is watching, and recent polling shows that 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, believe you shouldn't run again. Then-President Biden held up a note card during remarks in June of 2023 that included detailed directions such as, "YOU enter the Roosevelt Room and say hello to participants" and "YOU take YOUR seat." Biden's use of palm cards has long been documented, including during the April 2023 press conference with Bruce. Fox News Digital previously reported that Biden flashed a separate card showing the photo, name and name pronunciation of Los Angeles Times journalist Courtney Subramanian, while noting the card was part of "Question #1." Biden also referred to notes when welcoming the Japanese Prime Minister at the White House in April 2024. Biden flashed another palm card showing photos of reporters, accompanied by their outlets and roles, during a joint press conference with the Australian prime minister in October 2023. At his first formal press conference as president in March 2021, Biden was seen handling a card that had statistics and talking points to use. In another image, Biden was consulting a list of preselected reporters along with their photos, Fox Digital previously reported. Politicians long have used palm cards while on the campaign trail. Biden's use of the cards while serving as president added fuel to the fire of concern over his mental acuity, though, including Axios reporting in 2024 that donors were spooked by Biden's reliance on the notes. The White House pointed to President Donald Trump's public events where he routinely takes questions from journalists off the cuff when asked about Trump's potential use of palm cards. "President Trump gives unfettered access to the media and answers every question imaginable, without pre-screening the press questions or collecting reporters' palm cards ahead of time like his incompetent predecessor," White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox Digital Tuesday when approached for comment. "Unlike Joe Biden, President Trump is actually running our country, and he doesn't ever shy away from taking on the fake news to deliver the truth." A Trump White House senior press official said that it "does not prepare any reporter palm cards" and that the team does not "ask for reporters to submit their questions to the president ahead of time." A senior White House press official added to Fox News that the press office "does not prepare any reporter palm cards" and that the team does not "ask for reporters to submit their questions to the president ahead of time." The Biden administration is currently facing scrutiny over the use of an autopen to sign official documents — including for clemency orders, executive orders and other official documents. Since reclaiming the Oval Office, Trump has balked at his predecessor's use of the autopen, claiming Biden's staff allegedly used the pen to sign off on presidential actions unbeknownst to Biden.

One of the three victims killed in Saturday night's mass shooting at a popular North Carolina waterfront restaurant has been identified as Joy Rogers, a newly retired mother of three who had recently moved to Southport after raising her family in California. Her husband, Lennie Rogers, confirmed to WECT News that Joy was among those killed at the American Fish Company. "Joy was a devoted wife to her husband and a loving mother of three," her husband, Lennie Rogers, said in a statement to WECT News. "Born and raised in California, she and her family moved to Southport just a year ago to enjoy their retirement. Joy had a special gift for making people feel seen and welcomed. She was truly a vibrant part of the community and her family, and she will be dearly missed." Living Word Bible Church in North Carolina identified one of the victims in the Sept. 27 waterfront restaurant mass shooting as Joy Rogers. Living Word Bible Church in Winnabow, North Carolina released a statement calling Rogers "a beloved part of our church family—bold in her faith, compassionate toward others, and a constant encouragement. We will miss her deeply, yet we take comfort in knowing she is now in the presence of her Lord and Savior."

(AP Photo/Chris Seward) (Chris Seward/AP Photo) The popular spot is known locally not only as a waterfront bar and restaurant, but also as a filming location for "Safe Haven," the 2013 romantic thriller based on the Nicholas Sparks novel. Investigators allege that 40-year-old Nigel Max Edge positioned himself in a white, center-console boat just off the restaurant's deck before opening fire. At the time, live music was playing, and patrons were gathered along the bar's waterfront area. Authorities said chaos broke out as bullets struck people on the deck as patrons scrambled to safety. Edge, an Oak Island resident and military veteran, has not yet entered a plea. He appeared for his first court hearing Monday afternoon, logging in by video at 2 p.m. from the neighboring sheriff's office jail. Nigel Max Edge was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted first-degree murder in connection with the shooting at American Fish Company restaurant in Southport, North Carolina, on Saturday Sept. 27, 2025. Prosecutors said in court that Edge used a .300 Blackout Sig Sauer rifle outfitted with a suppressor and scope, and also had a .380 handgun tucked in his waistband when he was arrested. Some of the rifle ammunition was tipped for maximum ballistic impact, authorities noted. Two deputies responded on a sheriff's department boat after the shooting, later spotting Edge as he walked to retrieve his boat trailer. Deputies moved in and apprehended him as he backed the trailer in to pull his vessel from the water. The 40-year-old suspect is charged with three counts of first-degree murder, five counts of attempted first-degree murder and five counts of assault with a deadly weapon. He could face additional charges, including the death penalty. You can follow her on Twitter and LinkedIn. The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists warn that “flying rivers” — invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon — are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance. A new analysis finds southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable to increasing droughts. Experts say halting deforestation and restoring forests are key to preserving these vital systems. BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna — grassland with far fewer trees. “If you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.” Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. He and colleagues coined the “flying rivers” term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna. The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes — precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru's Manu National Park. “Peru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,” Finer said. “But if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.” Cut down trees lie within view of the Cordillera Azul National Park, seen in the background near Chambira community, in Peru's Amazon, Oct. 3, 2022. Corine Vriesendorp, director of science at Conservacion Amazonica, based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.” Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong. But in the dry season — when forests are already stressed by heat — the aerial rivers cut across southern Brazil, where deforestation fronts spread along highways and farms and there simply are fewer trees to help move the moisture along. Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil — a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon — could create an entirely new deforestation front. For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture. “It's not a single, all-at-once collapse,” he said. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. “The dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,” he said. “If deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there's no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.” Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say. “To avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires — immediately,” Nobre said. “And we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers — safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, “this can't be solved by one country alone.

Federal agents target suspected Tren de Aragua gang members in Chicago, Illinois, immigration enforcement operation. Hundreds of federal agents carried out a "targeted immigration enforcement operation" early Tuesday in Chicago, Illinois, against suspected Tren de Aragua gang members. The operation — which involved almost 300 agents — targeted six people associated with the Venezuelan gang, according to Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin. The development comes a day after Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is "seeking the deployment of 100 military troops to Illinois." The FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the DHS did not immediately respond Tuesday to requests for comment from Fox News Digital. Hundreds of federal agents were involved with an immigration operation overnight in Chicago, Ill., on Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2025. Footage captured overnight showed agents converging on an apartment building in the area. At one point, a helicopter dropped snipers down onto the building's roof. Two dozen people were taken into custody. Multiple people were seen being taken into custody during the immigration operation in Chicago, Ill., on Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2025. "Over the weekend, we received numerous confirmed reports of federal agents from ICE and Customs and Border Patrol abusing their power, intimidating innocent civilians and waging war on our people," Pritzker told reporters on Monday. "All of this has been aimed at causing chaos and mayhem in the hopes of creating a pretext to deploy military troops against Chicago and Broadview and other suburbs just as the president is doing right now in Oregon." "What I have been warning of is now being realized. The immigration operation targeted an apartment building in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood. ICE launched Operation Midway Blitz earlier this month, describing the operation as one that, "will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump made numerous false claims in a rambling Tuesday speech to hundreds of generals and admirals who were summoned to a military base in Virginia to listen to addresses by the president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Some of Trump's false claims were about the military itself. This article will be updated with additional items. Biden sometimes made the same point using slightly different language. Trump falsely claimed that Biden said he thought he could get rid of Space Force, the military branch created during Trump's first term, before backing down. “When Biden came into office, he wanted to terminate it – he said, ‘And this thing called Space Force, so we can get rid of that.' And he got hammered by the people in this room for even suggesting it,” Trump said. In the first month of Biden's presidency, in 2021, there was a controversy over a snarky response by his White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, to a question about whether Biden had made any decisions about keeping Space Force. Trump touted the fact that he got members of the NATO military alliance to pledge to spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense (by 2035), then falsely said, “It used to be 1%, then we got it up to 2(%) in my last term, and they did not like it.” Trump was not responsible for getting NATO to set its previous 2% target; the 2% figure was agreed upon by NATO defense ministers in 2006 and then reaffirmed in NATO documents in 2014, the year before Trump even launched his presidential campaign. Trump repeated his usual false claim that Biden “gave $350 billion” in aid to Ukraine. That figure isn't close to accurate. A German think tank that has closely tracked wartime aid to Ukraine says the US allocated about $135 billion to Ukraine (and had committed about $5 billion more) through June, at current exchange rates. Trump repeated his false claim that he has “settled seven” wars. He cited a war between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda as one example, saying, “I got that one done,” and mentioned “Kosovo and Serbia” as another. But those examples actually show that Trump has not settled seven wars. And while Trump has previously claimed to have prevented the eruption of a new war between Serbia and Kosovo — providing few details about what he was talking about — those countries weren't in an actual war either during Trump's current term or during his first term, when they signed an economic normalization agreement brokered by Trump's administration in 2020, so he couldn't possibly have settled one. Similarly, another dispute on his list of seven wars he supposedly settled, between Egypt and Ethiopia, was not actually a war, either, during Trump's time in the White House. “They opened up prisons in the Congo. They came into our country, totally unmatched, unvetted, unchecked, and from all over,” Trump said, adding moments later, “Venezuela emptied its prison population into our country.” He said a bit later, of unspecified countries, “They would take their worst people, and they're people from prisons, in jail, and they put them in a caravan, and they'd walk up.” Trump has never provided any proof for these claims, which his own presidential campaign and White House have been unable to corroborate. “We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,” Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN last year after Trump made similar claims. “I do a daily news search to see what's going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” Helen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in an email to CNN last year. Trump repeated his false claim that “25 million” migrants entered the country under Biden. Even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there's no way the total was even close to what Trump has said. Trump repeated his usual lie that the 2020 election was “rigged,” claiming that Russia wouldn't have invaded Ukraine “if the election weren't rigged.” Leaving aside the hypothetical about Russia, Trump lost the 2020 election fair and square to Biden. Trump repeated his usual phony figure about US drug deaths, saying, “We lost 300,000 people (who) died last year.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported earlier this month that there were 80,856 reported overdose deaths in the US in the 12 months ending December 2024 (and that, since the data is incomplete, the predicted total was 81,711). Experts say that even though drug deaths may be undercounted, there is no reasonable way to get to Trump's “300,000” figure. Trump, talking about the city of Portland, falsely claimed “your place is burning down” and that “unless they're playing false tapes, this looked like World War II.” We're not sure what “tapes” Trump has seen, but it's simply not true that the city is burning down. While there have been some unruly protests near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city this year – and protesters were arrested in June for allegedly starting fires there – the broader city has been functioning as usual, and even the situation around the ICE building is generally calmer than it was in June. CNN's Andy Rose noted in an article Tuesday that Trump began publicly floating the idea of deploying troops to Portland this year on the same day that Fox News, of which Trump is a frequent viewer, aired a story that mixed recent footage of standoffs at the ICE facility with five-year-old footage of rioting in Portland during a period of national unrest in 2020. Reviving a false claim he has deployed for years at his campaign rallies, Trump claimed that, right after he criticized CNN during the speech, CNN turned off the camera that had been filming him; Trump said, pointing toward the back of the room, “Oh, their camera just went off.” That didn't happen. And CNN itself aired Trump's criticism live and in full; in fact, the network didn't turn away from Trump's live remarks until more than half an hour after the president claimed the camera had been turned off and more than an hour after the speech began. (CNN then moved to analysis of what he had said.)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump informed hundreds of senior military leaders on Tuesday that he told Secretary of War Pete Hegseth that the military should use “dangerous cities” in the United States as “training grounds for our military.” “Portland, Oregon, where it looks like a war zone, and I get a call from the liberal governor, ‘Sir please don't come in, we don't need you.' I said, ‘Well, unless they're playing false tapes, this looked like World War II. Referencing the service members who have been deployed on these missions, Trump said he has told Hegseth, “We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military because we're going into Chicago very soon, that's a big city.” Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit to stop the mission, but it is still being adjudicated. He has discussed the possibility of deploying troops to other cities as well, including Chicago and New York City. Last month, Trump signed an executive order that called for the creation of a “quick reaction force” made up of National Guard troops available for “rapid nationwide deployment.” “That is going to be a big thing for the people in this focus. “It seems that the [cities] that are run by the radical left Democrats, what they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places, and we're going to straighten them out one by one,” the president added. Trump also said that military officers who are spat on while conducting crowd control missions should be allowed to “hit” that person back. Many of the protests that have spurred the deployment of troops to inner cities have focused on protecting immigrants, both those who have legal status and those who don't, who feel threatened by the administration's emphasis on deporting illegal immigrants. Trump addressed the more stoic audience as he walked out on stage in Quantico, saying, “I've never walked into a room so silent,” adding that he was told ahead of time that he wouldn't “hear a murmur in the room.” “If you don't like what I'm saying you can leave the room, of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future,” Trump quipped, which elicited laughs from the crowd. “Some people would say, no, that's old technology,” Trump told senior military leaders about possibly bringing back naval battleships. “I don't think it's old technology when you look at those guns. But it's something we're actually considering, the concept of battleship, nice six-inch side solid steel, not aluminum.”</p>

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration QUANTICO, Va. (AP) — President Donald Trump revealed that he wants to use American cities as training grounds for the armed forces and joined Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday in declaring an end to “woke” culture before an unusual gathering of hundreds of top U.S. military officials who were abruptly summoned to Virginia from around the world. Hegseth announced new directives for troops that include “gender-neutral” or “male-level” standards for physical fitness, while Trump bragged about U.S. nuclear capabilities and warned that “America is under invasion from within.” His address largely focused on his own long-used talking points that painted a picture of a military that has been hamstrung by “woke” policies, and he said military leaders should “do the honorable thing and resign” if they don't like his new approach. But he wasn't getting that kind of soundtrack from the generals and admirals in attendance. During his nearly hour-long speech, Hegseth said the U.S. military has promoted too many leaders for the wrong reasons based on race, gender quotas and “historic firsts.” “The era of politically correct, overly sensitive don't-hurt-anyone's-feelings leadership ends right now at every level,” Hegseth said. That was echoed by Trump, who said “the purposes of America military is not to protect anyone's feelings. ″We will not be politically correct when it comes to defending American freedom,” Trump said. Hegseth said he is loosening disciplinary rules and weakening hazing protections, putting a heavy focus on removing many of the guardrails the military had put in place after numerous scandals and investigations The defense secretary called for “changes to the retention of adverse information on personnel records that will allow leaders with forgivable, earnest, or minor infractions to not be encumbered by those infractions in perpetuity.” A Navy investigation found that Caserta's supervisor's “noted belligerence, vulgarity and brash leadership was likely a significant contributing factor in (the sailor)'s decision to end his own life.” Hegseth said this is not about preventing women from serving. “But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral,” he said. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. Hegseth's speech came as the country faces a potential government shutdown this week and as Hegseth, who has hammered home a focus on lethality, has taken several unusual and unexplained actions, including ordering cuts to the number of general officers and firings of other top military leaders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most people in Portland, Oregon, don't mind if you think they're weird. “We do have a lot of weirdos here,” Sarah Siano, who has lived in the city off and on since 2010, says with a smile. But to hear President Donald Trump tell it, Portland is the latest city taken over by terrorists and in desperate need of federal salvation, making its weirdness something else entirely. The anarchy described by the president is strongly disputed by locals who say they don't want or need federal help. “It kind of feels like somebody's trying to rage bait you,” Siano said. ‘It's slippery slope': CNN military analyst reacts to Trump's plan for Portland Tina Kotek said Saturday.“There is no threat to national security, and there is no need for military troops in our major city.” As they await a federal judge's decision on whether to block the Guard deployment – and continue to emphasize their “sanctuary city” status – Portland officials remain at odds with Trump over their view that the city needs no additional federal presence. “President Trump has directed ‘all necessary Troops' to Portland, Oregon,” Mayor Keith Wilson said Saturday. Getting an exact record of clashes between protesters and law enforcement is difficult because most of the standoff has been between demonstrators and federal agents, with Portland Police declining to get involved unless there is a safety threat to the general public. Listed reasons include “disorder,” “unwanted person”﻿ and shots fired. The tension reached its peak during one week in June, when a half-dozen protesters were arrested for allegedly starting fires around the building and more were accused of interfering with law enforcement. On June 14, a protest organized in connection with the national “No Kings” movement turned violent as some demonstrators arrived at the ICE facility. Portland Police continued to monitor the area for the following week, resulting in four minor arrests, including one for DUI. Later that month, the building was closed for several days after federal law enforcement forcibly removed protesters who refused to leave federal property. Portland's city leaders and residents are pushing back against ICE. The area outside the ICE facility has been calmer since the dramatic events of June, but the tan brick and stucco building in an industrial area has more layers of fencing, its lower-level windows have been blocked by plywood and a concrete retaining wall is covered in anti-ICE graffiti. Still, contrary to the president's depiction of constant violent lawlessness, neighbors say most of the time there is little to see. “I live within a thousand feet of the ICE facility,” Lashawnda Shavers told CNN affiliate KPTV on Sunday. Neighbors have repeatedly complained about the tear gas periodically being deployed against protesters. And some Portland residents say they're fed up with all of it. “(Protesters) are making noise constantly, even when nobody from ICE is outside,” David Schmidt told CNN affiliate KATU. Those frequently violent protests in downtown Portland stretched on for more than 100 days and became a top target for conservative leaders who argued Democratic leaders of major cities were being too soft on criminals. “The few shops that are open, they just use plywood … They don't put store fronts because they know it's going to be burned down,” Trump said last week, describing a scene that is neither the current state of downtown Portland nor the South Waterfront community where the ICE building sits. “For him to start making these comments again when I would say it's like more of a renaissance of downtown, it's just really ironic,” Siano said. “Their goal is to create an engagement – an engagement that will lead to conflict,” said Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley in a Friday night news conference. His goal is to make Portland look like what he's been describing it as. At least one prominent politician from Oregon is supporting the move. Thank you, @POTUS, for taking action to keep our ICE facilities protected and Make America Safe Again!,” Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer wrote in a post on X. The idea that federal agents can make a tense situation worse appears to be a concern shared by Portland Police. Assistant Police Chief Craig Dobson said this summer federal agents “have been, night after night, actually instigating and causing some of the ruckus that's occurring down there,” adding that ICE is “not following best practice,” The Oregonian reported. Following the announcement of the National Guard deployment, Kotek and Wilson were both part of a march against federal escalation Sunday, KATU reported. More than 100 people then gathered Sunday outside the ICE building, including counter protesters, which police said led to fights among the crowd. Rep. Maxine Dexter, a Democrat whose district includes most of Portland and who also participated in the march, said she hopes demonstrators will avoid confrontation at the ICE building. “Donald Trump is watching video of what's happening down there,” she told KATU Sunday. Walk by peacefully, but agitation down there is just going to backfire on all of us.” But with the Trump administration determined to make Portland its next test case on ramping up force, some residents wonder if keeping calm will make a difference. “If the president actually had been out here and seen what's really going on, maybe he would change his mind.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. David Schweikert (R-AZ) is running for governor of Arizona, forgoing a chance for reelection in a competitive GOP toss-up seat in 2026. The congressman, who has represented Arizona's 1st District since 2023 but has been in the House since 2010, will join a gubernatorial primary against fellow Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ). President Donald Trump has endorsed two candidates already in the Republican primary, Biggs and Karrin Taylor Robson, so Schweikert's entrance will be a test of how influential Trump's support can be in a competitive primary. Whoever wins the GOP race will go on to face Gov. Katie Hobbs (D-AZ), who defeated Republican Kari Lake in the 2022 gubernatorial general election. Schweikert told Axios that he believes Washington is “unsavable.” The six-term congressman told the outlet that he was skeptical Biggs or Robson could win against Hobbs, noting he has a track record of winning a purple district that can translate to results in a purple state. Schweikert separately told the Washington Post he thinks Republican voters desire an “actual conservative … someone that's not running on resentment and grievances.” But Trump won Arizona by more than 5 percentage points in 2024, so Hobbs's governor's mansion is viewed as a pick-up opportunity for Republicans in 2026. So far, the House GOP lawmakers who have already left or plan to retire after this term are leaving behind solid red or likely red seats.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift has been one of the Wives And Girlfriends of professional athletes (WAGs) for a minute, but there are levels in the WAG pyramid, if you will. WAG, a celebratory term for our vernacular purposes, has reached reality show status in popular culture, most recently in “W.A.G.s to Riches” on Netfllix. Kelce rose to prominence when he joined the Chiefs in 2013, but his lady love has been on the music scene since she was 16 years old. Forbes has designated Swift as the richest living female musician and estimates her worth at $1.6 billion, while Kelce's portfolio is estimated to stand at $70 million. Game recognizes game, and Kelce has expressed his admiration for the effort and conditioning required for Swift's concert performances. On his podcast in August, Kelce recalled seeing what he called “the recovery station” for Swift after her Eras Tour concert. “S**t, I'm telling you, dude, the similarities were crazy,” Kelce said. When it comes to the intersection of sports, culture and politics, the two have already shown they can successfully navigate their own paths. The pop star has been more vocal in recent years about her political stances, including endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the most recent presidential election. He ran afoul of some anti-vaxers after starring in a 2023 ad done in partnership with Pfizer to publicize flu and Covid vaccine shots. That same year, he also collaborated with Bud Light, a beer brand which stirred backlash from some conservatives after collaborating with actor and writer Dylan Mulvaney, who is trans. Outrage aimed at the football player has not been from one side, however. Some liberals were less than pleased when Kelce was asked about President Donald Trump's planned attendance at Super Bowl LIX, which he and his team were playing in. Trump was making history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl game. I think that's going to be the biggest challenge being able to keep her voice and reconcile that with the NFL.” That's because the NFL has famously attempted to avoid controversy, like in 2016 when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sparked debate after he began kneeling during the National Anthem at the beginning of his games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the US. But Swift has a massive audience and her own power, Bonner noted. To the ‘dads, Brads and Chads' who've taken issue with the amount of Taylor Swift shown during NFL games: Too bad “So I don't think that she's really too worried about it. Bonner said she also doesn't think Kelce is too concerned, as he is extremely supportive of Swift and pursued her in such a way that gave her fans the love story they have always wanted for her. “He's no shrinking violet in his own right,” Bonner said of Kelce.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a locator map for Iran with its capital, Tehran. Meanwhile, the United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran this past week over its nuclear program, putting new pressure on the Islamic Republic's ailing economy. The deportations also represent a collision of a top priority of President Donald Trump — targeting illegal immigration — against a decadeslong practice by the U.S. of welcoming Iranian dissidents, exiles and others since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. As many as 400 Iranians would be returning to Iran as part of the deal with the U.S., Iranian state television said, citing Hossein Noushabadi, director-general for parliamentary affairs at Iran's Foreign Ministry. He said the majority of those people had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico illegally, while some faced other immigration issues. Noushabadi said the first planeload of Iranians would arrive in a day or two, after stopping over in Qatar on the way. In the lead up to and after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, a large number of Iranians fled to the U.S. In the decades since, the U.S. had been sensitive in allowing those fleeing from Iran over religious, sexual or political persecution to seek residency. Iran has criticized Washington for hosting dissidents and others in the past. U.S. federal prosecutors have accused Iran of hiring hitmen to target dissidents as well in America. It's unclear exactly what has changed now in American policy. Noushabadi said that American authorities unilaterally made the decision without consultations with Iran. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, as well as President Masoud Pezeshkian, both attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York last week as a last-ditch effort to stop the reimposed sanctions. However, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei boxed in their efforts by describing diplomacy with the U.S. as a “sheer dead end.” Speaking to state TV in footage aired Tuesday, Araghchi acknowledged that direct communication from Iran went to the U.S. government during the U.N. visit — something he had been careful not to highlight during five rounds of nuclear negotiations with the Americans earlier this year. “With Americans, both directly and indirectly, messages were exchanged, and eventually, we are relieved that we did whatever it was necessary,” Araghchi said. “It was clear and evident to us after the interpretation the Supreme Leader made that negotiations with Americans is an obvious dead-end.”</p>

Bad Bunny performs during the final concert of his summer residency in his homeland at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jose Miguel Agrelot, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Saturday, Sept. 20, 2025. Bad Bunny performs during his first show of his 30-date concert residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, July 11, 2025. Bad Bunny performs during the final concert of his summer residency in his homeland at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jose Miguel Agrelot, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Saturday, Sept. 20, 2025. NEW YORK (AP) — Crowds wore maga flowers and “pavas” — straw hats traditionally worn by jíbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (“little house”), for the pari de marquesina, a house party. If all the world's a stage — might as well make it home. And he'll do so in Spanish — a landmark moment for Latino culture. Bad Bunny's “No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí” residency (in English, “I Don't Want to Leave Here”) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history — reggaetón hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.” (“I Should Have Taken More Photos.”) Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream — but it is enough for a taste. It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. “There was the issue of — like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an “anti-ICE activist” on Instagram. Ryan Fournier, chair of Students for Trump, said that “whoever picks these people should be fired.” “Go get em Bad Bunny!” wrote Bruno Mars on X. Roc Nation founder Jay-Z, who oversees the Super Bowl booking, said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has “done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world's biggest stage.” At the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English. And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable? In February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities — among them LeBron James, Penélope Cruz and Kylian Mbappé — to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arcángel and notably Marc Anthony. “Preciosa” was written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández Marín in 1937 and is viewed as an unofficial anthem for the island. It references Puerto Rico's hybrid identity — a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures — and threats made to the island in its long colonial history (“No importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,” goes the chorus. “It doesn't matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.”) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured. It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets — and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same — but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight — informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.</p>

And he's not only a rapper but also an actor, most recently appearing in Happy Gilmore 2, one of Netflix's highest-grossing films ever. More than 125 million people will tune in to watch live. Even more will see clips of the performance on social media afterward. It is a life-changer for any artist to have that kind of exposure. He announced earlier this year that he would no longer do concerts in the United States because of President Donald Trump's immigration policies, which no longer allow for unfettered entry into the country to the tune of millions. They're here in Pontezuela,” Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, raged recently. Among those arrested by ICE in Puerto Rico is Maykel Negrín Núñez, who had been charged with homicide, violations of gun laws, illegal transportation of firearms, and spousal abuse. Bad Bunny apparently takes issue with Núñez being detained. He also announced he would no longer perform on the U.S. mainland due to ICE having the audacity to do its job outside his concerts. “There was the issue of — like, f****** ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said in an interview earlier this year. What changed about Bad Bunny's staunch principle around not performing in America anymore? Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.” What exactly is the National Football League thinking here? Does Commissioner Roger Goodell even know who Bad Bunny is? As for Goodell, he likely just rubber stamps the selection. “What Benito has done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world's biggest stage,” Jay-Z said in a statement. Yes, there's nothing more inspiring than hiring someone who hates federal agents expelling the worst elements of society back to their homelands. I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants. This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans—” it continues before the group shuts off the radio in disbelief before walking away. Again, for the billionth time, Trump is not anti-immigrant. “Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways,” Trump said in a State of the Union Address, among dozens of other times. “I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.” And that's the trick: They have to come in legally. Per Pew Research, 97% of Americans support deporting illegal immigrants who have committed violent crimes. They say that rock ‘n' roll is here to stay. But it is clearly no longer welcome at the Super Bowl. Over the years, the NFL was smart enough to bring in not only rock's biggest performers but also country and pop stars and rappers, including the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, in 1993. Just days before Election Day 2024, after a comedian almost no one has ever heard of (Tony Hinchiffe) told a joke about Puerto Rico at a Trump rally, Bad Bunny voiced his support for former Vice President Kamala Harris, winning him plaudits from the legacy news media. Bad Bunny,” Politico declared on Oct. 29, “Bad Bunny won the day because he elevated the celebrity endorsement in a way that spoke to a specific community at a crucial moment in the race.” “It has the potential to help turn this into one of the more important moments in Puerto Rican and mainland politics in decades for the five million U.S. citizens identifying as Puerto Rican who live here — including half a million in battleground Pennsylvania,” it adds. When is the legacy media going to get it through their heads that celebrity endorsements don't matter? Harris paid millions of dollars to the likes of Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Eminem, and Lady Gaga, among many others, to have them perform during her rallies. And all that got her were zero wins in swing states while losing the popular vote. The same goes for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, when she also went the “people totally vote because a celebrity told them to vote a certain way” route and lost a race many believed she could never lose. Bad Bunny — at least for now, unless the NFL comes to their senses — will perform the Super Bowl 60 halftime show. But by doing this, it is begging a large chunk of the country to publicly denounce its product again in the same way it did when it welcomed Black Lives Matter with open arms.</p>

Many used to worry about China's power over the app — but American control is troubling, too. The app is also a political flashpoint. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company under the shadow of Beijing. For years, US lawmakers have tried to rein it in, either by banning it outright or forcing a sale to American investors. Now, with Donald Trump back in office, that fight has entered a new phase that could reshape the social media landscape. Last week, Trump signed an executive order approving the creation of a new entity — TikTok US — that would allow the app to remain available in America despite the “ban” that Congress passed in 2024. China still has to approve the deal. Her reporting exposed how ByteDance employees accessed American users' data and how TikTok's internal systems gave the company enormous influence over what we see. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. TikTok isn't just another social platform. TikTok's founder, Zhang Yiming, believed information could find people better than people could find information. On older platforms, you followed accounts and searched for things. On TikTok, you open the app and it just goes. We're giving up agency without noticing, because the product is pleasant. Is part of the pleasure not having to think? You could just stand there and be a person waiting your turn. When did we have to be doing something in every tiny pause of daily life? TikTok's For You feed is a prediction machine based on revealed preferences, not what we say we like. TikTok helped lead a broader shift: We now see far less from people we actually know and far more from professional creators. It's as much like Netflix as OG Facebook — people don't go there to see friends. Today it's similar to other big UGC [user-generated content] platforms. Algorithms flag likely violations; large teams of human moderators enforce rules and tune those systems. Policies in the US now look broadly like competitors'. Early on, it was different — more “Chinese” policy defaults that were later “Westernized.” One distinctive piece is the internal heating tool. “Remember, you're making fewer choices about what to see. That means you're ceding more control over your information diet to a faceless machine — and the people who build and govern it.” It lets certain staff give a video a fixed number of impressions — 5,000, 50,000, 5 million — overriding the recommender. That initial shove often triggers further organic growth. Humans used it to teach the system what “good” looked like when the algo was still rough. Marketing later used it to woo creators and partners. TikTok eventually restricted access and wrote stricter policies, but misuse did happen — and with a tool like that, some misuse likely persists. Other platforms boost and demote content too. What stood out here was how explicit, granular, and widely available the “big red button” was — at least historically. (If folks at other platforms have similar tools, my Signal is open.) And remember, you're making fewer choices about what to see. That means you're ceding more control over your information diet to a faceless machine — and the people who build and govern it. How much control does Beijing have over TikTok? In China, authorities can coerce employees — “do this or else” — including by threatening family. If a China-based ByteDance/TikTok employee can access US data or influence ranking, the state could compel them. There's limited public evidence they've exercised it extensively — capability does not equal action — but the leverage is real as long as China-based staff exist with relevant access. Is there evidence China has used TikTok as an ideological weapon? Years ago, TikTok had restrictive policies around China topics; those changed. There's classified material — referenced obliquely in TikTok's court filings — that US officials say involves manipulation abroad, but I haven't seen it. ByteDance's answer to America's ban on TikTok was Project Texas — walling off US data under Oracle. Conceptually, “driver carries no cash”: [The US] cut China-side access [to Oracle] so coercion can't yield US data. But there are hundreds of internal tools and data pipes; closing every last pathway is Sisyphean. They got far, but the “last mile” is hard to guarantee. The US eventually doubted a solution, short of full separation, would be foolproof. What made that technical challenge so daunting in practice? If you've ever worked inside a big tech company, you know how many internal tools there are and how much they talk to each other. TikTok is propped up by hundreds of them. The consumer app you see sits on top of 500 internal apps. Cutting off data flows across all of them was a maze-like, Sisyphean task. They closed most pathways, but the last mile was nearly impossible. Trump first tried to ban [TikTok], then to force a sale; he used the wrong legal mechanism and lost in court. Biden's team negotiated Project Texas for about 2 years, then pivoted to “sell or be banned,” pushing Congress to pass a law. On the eve of [Trump's second] inauguration, TikTok briefly “flickered” off; after taking office, Trump ordered DOJ not to enforce the law. TikTok has lived in that purgatory since. And TikTok publicly thanked Trump for “saving” it. Quite a turn from their early “Donald Trump isn't on TikTok — download now” ads. After all your reporting, how do you feel about TikTok now? Personally, I hate autoplay video — on any platform. You end the book noting Zhang Yiming is already moving on to AGI (artificial general intelligence). TikTok's hard problems are largely solved; generative AI is the next frontier. When you think about an algorithm, replace the word with a guy named Bob. Algorithms are made by people, for people's interests — and when we forget that, we give them far too much power. We don't usually do addendums, but the legal future of TikTok might have changed after we spoke. More than before, but details are thin. Both the US and Chinese sides say they've made progress. Trump is calling it a deal and extended non-enforcement of the ban law. Reporting suggests he'll sign an order declaring the deal meets last year's statute — he has wide latitude there. Terms — and who gets what power — remain unclear. Are there contours of the deal we do know? Both sides say ByteDance keeps ownership of the recommender algorithm; US TikTok would license it. “License” can range from “do whatever you want” to heavily restricted. How open it is will determine real separation. TikTok's was built over years on vast, mixed corpora (including scraped public web). If the new owners can't replicate inputs, users may notice “new TikTok” isn't as good — which is a business risk. Will Oracle keep American users' data walled off from China? Likely similar to today's TikTok US Data Security setup: new US user data housed in Oracle-controlled TTP, [trusted technology partner] walled from ByteDance. The draft deal would formalize and continue that. What do the new US stakeholders get besides a shit ton of money? But there's also influence over speech rules: bullying/hate policies, moderation posture, priority signals. Many on the left see this as handing a massive speech platform to Trump allies. Savvy owners won't overtly politicize fast — that's bad business (just look at what happened to Twitter/X). People like Larry Ellison of Oracle, Marc Andreessen, the Murdochs of Fox News — they're all involved in this potential deal and it has a whiff of corruption. If the Soros group wanted in, or Warren Buffett, I'm not at all sure Trump would be interested in making that happen. When I think about the law Congress passed, in a way they were trying to curtail presidential authority, but the way it was written still gave an immense amount of power to the president. And I think a lot of the people who passed it didn't imagine a president so willing to engage in naked self-dealing. That's just true — I don't think many would have done it this way if they'd foreseen the moment we're in now. How much better is this arrangement than Beijing controlling TikTok? The book's “authoritarian shakedown” concern was always the foil to a state that can't do that. We're now watching a US executive attempt to shape distribution and punish critics. We're about to find out which is “better,” but the CCP-like tactics are worrying.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HEGSETH'S BIG DAY: Speculation has run wild over the past week, ever since War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an unprecedented, mandatory, and in-person meeting of almost all of the U.S. military's “GOFOs” — Pentagon speak for general and flag officers — at the U.S. Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, just south of Washington D.C. “Another possibility is that Hegseth has decided that his schemes for reorganizing the U.S. military just aren't being taken seriously enough,” wrote Tom Nichols in the Atlantic. “Secretary Hegseth has tasked the development of a National Defense Strategy that is laser focused on advancing President Trump's commonsense America First, Peace Through Strength agenda,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told the newspaper in a statement. If signing up doesn't work, shoot us an email and we'll add you to our list. Significant and meaningful differences remain,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) after top House and Senate leaders met with President Donald Trump at the White House yesterday afternoon. You should go take a look at what they requested, $1.5 trillion in new spending that is unrelated to the ongoing appropriations process.” Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate and would need at least eight Democratic votes to pass the bill with 60 votes, since Republican Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has suggested he will vote against it. The Pentagon's contingency plan for a shutdown calls for “only the minimum number of civilian employees necessary to carry out excepted activities” to be exempted from being furloughed. PUTIN: ‘WE FIGHT AND PREVAIL': In a video message translated on the Kremlin's official website, Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a defiant tone as he celebrated the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts he does not fully control. In a Truth Social post last week, President Trump said Russia has been “fighting aimlessly,” making it look like “a paper tiger.” In a meeting with the Turkish president, Trump said, “With all of the heavy bombardment over the last two weeks, they've gained almost no land.
