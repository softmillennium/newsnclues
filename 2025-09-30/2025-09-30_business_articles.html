                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is debuting what it bills as its most advanced video generation model yet, alongside a new iOS app designed to bring artificial intelligence-powered video creation to everyday users. The Sora 2.0 model builds on an earlier version released this year as a research preview. OpenAI said the new release represents a major leap in physical realism, audio-video synchronization, and multi-shot storytelling. The new app, which is also called Sora, is invite-only to start with and will let users create, remix, and cameo in AI-generated videos using text or images with built-in controls for safety, likeness, and provenance. The rollout is already raising concerns around intellectual property rules. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that OpenAI is notifying studios and talent agencies that, unless they explicitly opt out, their copyrighted material may be reflected in Sora-generated content. The company views this style of engagement, where users remix or reference familiar fictional worlds, as a form of fan expression and creative play. OpenAI has also drawn a clear line between copyrighted IP and individual likeness. While characters or visual styles from popular franchises may appear unless blocked, individuals cannot be generated at all — via prompt or image — unless they've submitted a verified cameo. The policy is intended to give people full control over how, when, and whether they appear in any AI-generated content. A Pro version, web access, and developer API are all coming soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT – Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley said he expects demand for all-electric vehicles to be slashed in half next month following the end of federal tax incentives on Wednesday. Farley on Tuesday said he "wouldn't be surprised" if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 10% to 12% this month — which is expected to be a record — to 5% after the incentive program ends. "I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tail pipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away," he said during a Ford event about promoting skilled trades and workers in Detroit. "We're going to find out in a month. Farley said the industry learned that "partial electrification," such as hybrids, are easier for customers to accept for the time being. Farley said his Model e EV team is analyzing the demand for non-gas-powered vehicles each day. The federal EV incentives of up to $7,500 are coming to an end as part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which stripped the old enticement but included some perks for buying a U.S.-assembled vehicle, regardless of it being an EV. "Customers are not interested in the $75,000 electric vehicle. Once the bill was passed, sales of EVs quickly gained traction, especially as some automakers added even more discounts to move out older models. Cox Automotive forecasts sales of EVs hit 410,000 during the third quarter, up 21% from a year earlier. That would easily be the highest amount of EVs ever sold in a quarter in the U.S., as well as a record 10% market share. Cox and other industry analysts and executives expect many buyers pulled ahead plans to purchase an EV before the federal incentives sunset. Farley also said the federal changes mean the auto industry, including Ford, will have to adapt, saying the company will have to figure out what to do with its battery plants and EV capacity. "We'll fill them, but it will be more stress, because we had a four-year predictable policy," Farley said. ... We all have to make adjustments, and it's going to be good for the country, I believe, but it will be one more stress." Slight tweak: Farley was speaking Tuesday at the automaker's "Ford Pro Accelerate" event, which features executives from many industries as well as public officials discussing the "essential economy" and need for skilled labor and education.

When Starbucks announced on Thursday that it would shutter more than 100 coffeehouse locations across North America, the company didn't publicly specify which stores would close.

So, Business Insider has begun creating a list compiled from accounts from affected in-store staff members, reporter visits, and verification through the Starbucks "store locator" feature. While incomplete, it begins to show which neighborhoods and states are most affected by the closures.

When reached for comment by Business Insider, Starbucks pointed to a message it's sending its customers about the store closures: "We know this isn't just any store to customers. It's their coffeehouse, a place woven into their daily rhythm, where memories were made, and where meaningful connections with our partners grew over the years. We're deeply grateful for the communities that have been built."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spotify CEO Daniel Ek will step down from his position and move to the role of executive chairman, the company said Tuesday. Ek, who co-founded the streaming platform in 2006, will be replaced by current co-presidents and longtime executives Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström as co-CEOs, the company said in a release. "Over the last few years, I've turned over a large part of the day-to-day management and strategic direction of Spotify to Alex and Gustav–who have shaped the company from our earliest days and are now more than ready to guide our next phase," Ek said in a release. "This change simply matches titles to how we already operate." Ek said his new role will focus on steering the company's long-term strategy and providing support to its senior team. "It's been an honor of a lifetime for me to be able to lead Spotify for close to 20 years," Ek said in an X post. Ek, who now has a net worth of $9.8 billion according to Forbes, has led the streaming giant to its current market cap of $140 billion. The company said in its second-quarter earnings report that it expects to net add 14 million active users and five million net new Premium subscribers for the current quarter, even with the added price hike announced in August. In September, prices increased to 11.99 euros (US $14.08) from 10.99 euros (US $12.90) for premium subscribers in markets including South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, the company said in a release. The company reported total revenue of 4.19 billion euros in the second quarter, which was up 10% year over year but missed LSEG estimate of 4.26 billion euros. Questions were raised about its advertising business, with revenue down about 1% in the segment from a year ago. Spotify has also been cracking down on artificial intelligence "slop" under the increasing threat of AI-generated music going viral. The streaming juggernaut cut 75 million AI spam tracks in the past 12 months and rolled out updated policies to protect against harmful AI use, the company said in a release last week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The AI boom is a "bubble" driven by the "momentum" of soaring stocks like Nvidia, fund manager Bill Smead has said. "Dogs chase cars, and people chase stocks," Smead Capital Management's founder and chief investor told Business Insider in an interview. "We're in the crazy stage," Smead said, giving the example of CoreWeave, which generated $1.2 billion of revenue last quarter but has a $60 billion market value. The AI cloud-computing company reported a $30 billion revenue backlog at the end of June, underpinned by an expanded agreement with key customer OpenAI. "This is, from a fundamental standpoint, identical to all the past major manias," Smead said. "We're bumping up against history real hard now." Smead said the problem isn't whether AI companies realize the technology's potential benefits, but that "whatever success they might have has already been massively overcapitalized." He said that "when this thing breaks," people will only be willing to buy AI stocks at a fraction of their current price. Oracle stock jumped 40% in a day earlier this month after it forecast rapid revenue growth in its cloud infrastructure business, which caters to AI companies such as OpenAI. But if it can rise so much in a day, then it can fall 40% in a day too, Smead said. The value investor, who has 40-plus years of experience, said he was worried about the "incredibly unusual," close incestuous relationship between major AI companies. Smead said he's "extremely concerned" that so many people have so much of their savings in the Big Tech stocks, because if they come crashing down, the financial fallout could be enormous. However, he said investors shouldn't cash out of stocks entirely and wait for a crash as "you can't hold your breath until then." Smead said his fund has mostly avoided tech stocks in favor of energy, homebuilding, healthcare, retail, and real estate investment trusts or REITs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2023, Jamie Siminoff called up Amazon's former devices boss, Dave Limp, to say he was stepping down from leading the video doorbell company he sold to the e-commerce giant for $839 million in 2018. Siminoff, who started Ring in 2013, said Limp and Amazon offered him the opportunity to work elsewhere at the company, but he declined. In April, Siminoff announced his return to Ring, replacing Liz Hamren, a former Microsoft and Discord executive whom Amazon had hired to succeed him. And now his team has even more artificial intelligence technology at its disposal to supercharge those efforts. Siminoff took the stage Tuesday at Amazon's annual hardware event in New York to debut new Ring cameras, along with a feature called Search Party that uses AI to identify potential matches in camera footage. It's aimed at "reuniting lost dogs" with their families, but Siminoff said there could be other applications in the future. During Hamren's two-year tenure, Ring moved to adopt a softer, more whimsical image marked by silly videos of backyard animal encounters and family-friendly hijinks. It also removed a tool widely criticized by civil liberties and privacy advocates that let police request doorbell footage from users in its neighborhood watch app. Siminoff, 48, said Ring's cameras have many uses, including keeping an eye on pets and loved ones. "I'm focused on: How can I get the highest density of camera coverage in a neighborhood matched with AI to make neighborhoods safer?" Ring is part of Amazon's vast devices and services division, which is overseen by Panos Panay, a former Microsoft hardware leader who joined the company in 2023. Beyond Ring, the unit spans Amazon's Zoox robotaxis, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices and Kuiper, the company's internet satellite service. Ring's security cameras typically start at $50 and range in price depending on coverage. Users can also pay up to $20 a month for its subscription service that lets them continuously record and access more cloud storage, among other features. Several months earlier, Siminoff said he witnessed a shooting at a laundromat in South Central Los Angeles that left him feeling shaken. "Kids are crying, it's a whole f****** scene." Those relationships with police have been controversial over the years. Amazon claimed a Los Angeles Police Department pilot program in 2015 found that Ring's doorbells reduced burglaries in neighborhoods "by as much as 55%," according to a 2018 release. But reports from several outlets have disputed whether Ring cameras lead to a decrease in crime. Privacy advocates have expressed concern that the company's cameras and accompanying Neighbors app have heightened the risk of racial profiling and turned residents into informants, with few guardrails around how law enforcement can use the material. Siminoff, who said he's "pro public safety" and "backs the blue," said he felt some of the coverage of Ring's video-request feature for police was unfair or inaccurate. "We allow them to request footage from people in a super privacy centric, anonymous way that keeps their privacy. But that's not a good headline," he added. A few weeks after Siminoff's return, Ring reintroduced its community request tool through a partnership with Axon Enterprise, the maker of Tasers and police body cameras. Police can solicit footage from Ring cameras through Axon's online evidence management system, and users can choose whether or not to share it. "I don't think we should be working directly with police," Siminoff said. Siminoff said Ring, which is profitable, is exploring other potential growth areas, such as security solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses. At least when it comes to sticking its cameras in Amazon delivery vans or warehouses. "Amazon's so big you could probably do something for everything."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pfizer will also guarantee the same "most-favored-nation" pricing on its new drugs for Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers. As part of the deal, Pfizer has also agreed to a three-year grace period during which the company's products won't face pharmaceutical-specific tariffs – as long as the drugmaker further invests in U.S. manufacturing. Shares of Pfizer rose more than 4% on Tuesday after the announcement. "Pfizer has agreed to provide some of the most popular current medications to our consumers at heavily discounted prices anywhere between 50% and even 100%," Trump said, adding that those drugs will be available for direct purchase at a discount online on a website the administration is calling TrumpRx.gov. Trump said he's working with other drugmakers to secure similar agreements over the next week, adding that Pfizer is the first. "If we don't make a deal, we're going to tariff them," he said of the other companies' drugs. The deal comes as Pfizer and 16 other drugmakers face Trump's Monday deadline to take steps to lower drug prices, as outlined in letters from the president. Among the other steps is pursuing tougher price negotiations abroad and adopting models that sell its medicines directly to consumers or businesses. "They are the ones that will see a significant impact on their ability to buy medicines." But he said "American innovation and and the American economy" will also be "winners" with the agreement. Pfizer said it will offer a large share of its primacy care treatments and certain specialty branded drugs at discounts of 50% on average and up to 85%, according to a release from the company. In a separate statement Tuesday, Pfizer said more than 100 million patients are impacted by diseases those medicines treat, such as migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, menopause and atopic dermatitis. The company provided examples of discounted drugs under TrumpRx.gov. Duavee, a treatment for certain menopause symptoms, will be available for as little as $30 on the site, which is an 85% discount to its current price. Tovias, a medication for overactive bladder, will also be available on TrumpRx.gov for as little as $42, which is a 85% discount to the current price. Pfizer said it also plans to offer products such as Abrilada for autoimmune diseases at a 60% discount, Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis at a 40% discount and the migraine drug Zazvpret at 50% discount. Those drugs don't appear to be significant revenue drivers for Pfizer. The company's quarterly and full-year earnings reports only include product-specific revenue for Xeljanz, which generated $349 million in worldwide sales in 2024. Sales of the drug fell 29% operationally from 2023, primarily due to lower demand globally as well as lower net prices in the U.S. Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday that the U.S. will impose a 100% tariff on "any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product" entering the country from Oct. 1. He added that the exemption covers projects where construction has started, including sites that have broken ground or are under construction. In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said the deal is positive for Pfizer's stock and the broader pharmaceutical sector, as it "adds certainty and shifts POTUS policies potentially away from Pharma tariffs." "Today's deal seems to set a path for other pharmaceutical players to follow, allowing for headline pricing concessions and a Trump 'win' without more punitive implementation" of the most favored nation policy or tariffs, he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Consumer confidence edged lower in September ahead of an expected data blackout caused by the looming federal government shutdown, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. The reading was the lowest since April and comes with nonessential government operations slated to close at midnight. "Consumers' assessment of business conditions was much less positive than in recent months, while their appraisal of current job availability fell for the ninth straight month to reach a new multiyear low," said Stephanie Guichard, the organization's senior economist for global indicators. Though the labor market has shown considerable weakness this year, employment availability in August was slightly better than the prior month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in what could be its last data release until the spending impasse on Capitol Hill is resolved, said job openings totaled 7.23 million, up 19,000 from July though down 422,000, or 5.5%, from the same period a year ago. The bureau's Job Openings and Labor Turnover report, which Federal Reserve officials watch closely to gauge labor market slack, showed a slower pace in both hiring and total separations. Quits fell by 75,000  for a category looked at as a gauge of worker confidence for finding new jobs after leaving their present one. Labor market stability is an important consideration for the Fed as officials contemplate the next move for interest rates. "My baseline outlook doesn't see the labor market softening much further – but there are risks," Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Tuesday. "In particular, I see some increased risk that labor demand may fall significantly short of supply, leading to a more meaningful and unwelcome increase in the unemployment rate." Should the spending impasse be resolved by Friday, the BLS is expected to show payroll growth of 51,000 in September, following just 22,000 in August. The Conference Board's report showed a growing divide in labor market perceptions. The share of respondents indicating that jobs were "plentiful" slipped to 26.9%, down more than 3 percentage points from August, while the "hard to get" gauge held flat at 19.1%. Also, the survey showed more pessimism about finances, as views on their current financial situation saw its biggest one-month drop since the question was asked in July 2022.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Your DoorDash deliverer could soon look a little different. DoorDash on Tuesday announced a robot, known as Dot, that navigates busy streets, parking lots and sidewalks to bring customers their food. Dot marks DoorDash's first official standalone push into autonomous vehicle technology. The company previously tested drone delivery and partnered with Sam Altman-backed startup Coco Robotics for sidewalk delivery. "The scale and complexity of the business demands something like autonomy, and there isn't anything out there that fits our use case," DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang told CNBC. Tang, who leads the DoorDash Labs automation and robotics unit, said Dot is a solution to increasingly complex deliveries, and attempts to open the technology to local merchants. The company said the robot can reach up to 20 miles per hour and carry up to six pizza boxes, or 30 pounds of items. Uber announced a food delivery partnership with Israeli drone startup Flytrex, and previously delivered food using self-driving Waymo cars. Dot is currently open to merchants in the Phoenix area through DoorDash's new autonomous delivery platform that also includes drone delivery where available. Dot is equipped with eight cameras and three lidar sensors to navigate road scenarios like crowded parking lots, blocked bike lanes and busy streets. It also includes an internal camera to ensure food quality. DoorDash also announced a smart scale feature that weighs order and detects any potential missing items. The company said its internal data suggests that the test product has slashed missing item complaints by up to 30%. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI chipmaker Cerebras filed to go public exactly a year ago. The company has yet to take the plunge, but has now bought itself more time to stay private. Cerebras said Tuesday that it's raised $1.1 billion in new funding at a valuation of $8.1 billion as it tries to take on Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, in the booming market of artificial intelligence chips. In its IPO prospectus, Cerebras calls itself a designer of chips for training and running AI models, and the company has prioritized operating a cloud-based service that AI models can use to handle incoming queries. Shortly after Cerebras filed for its initial public offering last September, the company faced public criticism that it was too reliant on a single Middle Eastern customer, G42. Cerebras hit a snag seeking clearance from the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, to give G42 a bigger position. Co-founder and CEO Andrew Feldman said in an interview that Cerebras still intends to go public. "I don't think this is an indication of a preference for one or the other," he said. "I think we have tremendous opportunities in front of us, and I think it's good practice, when you have enormous opportunities, not to let them fall by the wayside for lack of capital." OpenAI said last week that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the company as it builds out data centers, and Anthropic announced earlier in September that it raised $13 billion in funding at a $183 billion valuation. Investors in Cerebras' funding round include 1789 Capital, Alpha Wave, Altimeter Capital, Atreides Management, Benchmark, Fidelity, Tiger Global and Valor Equity Partners. "It was with investors who everybody would be proud of to have cornerstone your IPO," Feldman said. The new money will allow for an expansion in U.S. manufacturing, he said. After Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing produces Cerebras' chip wafers, they're packaged in the U.S. As demand increases, Cerebras plans to hire more people to focus on production. "We increased manufacturing capacity in the last 18 months 8x, and we are going to go another 4x in the next six or eight months," Feldman said. This year Cerebras has discussed business that it's picked up from Hugging Face, Meta, Notion and Perplexity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wall Street's M&A rebound got a boost on Monday with the biggest take-private buyout in years, but experts are warning that the hiring landscape isn't showing the same signs of revival. Video game producer Electronic Arts on Monday said it would be sold for $55 billion in a transaction hammered out by bankers at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Though that's welcome news for everyone's league tables, it doesn't stand to do much for their job boards, insiders said. "Even a deal of that size is not going to move the needle that much" on year-end bonuses and job opportunities at Wall Street banks, said Alan Johnson, a compensation expert and founder of the consultancy Johnson Associates. Dealmakers kicked off 2025 anticipating a cascade of M&A opportunities, but tariff concerns in the first half of the year temporarily halted growth. "I would not be effusive that hiring is back. "It's probably gone from negative to flat," he said of bank hiring levels, adding that AI will shrink analyst and associate classes, leading to fewer open roles over the long term. So far this year, global dealmaking has produced standout transactions like Google's planned $32 billion acquisition of Wiz and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $13.4 billion purchase of Juniper Networks. Large blockbuster transactions, however, don't necessarily translate into an M&A market that lifts all boats. Sophia Samadian, an investment banking recruiter at the firm Selby Jennings, said the focus has been on senior origination hires who can drive dealmaking, versus legions of support staff. "While the overall job growth is modest, I think there's definitely sectors that are picking up, she said, adding that healthcare, energy, and ESG finance are "hiring aggressively." Artificial intelligence is helping boost financial technology dealmaking and hiring, experts said. Samadian said clients are creating dedicated teams for AI, crypto, and digital infrastructure. Some dealmakers, she added, are spinning out of bigger banks, launching their own shops to get in on the action. "You don't need three analysts" on a deal, Johnson said, referring to Wall Street's youngest ranks. Healthcare and biotech deal flow has begun to return, driving hiring needs in the sectors. This month, Lazard hired biopharmaceuticals insider Geoffrey Porges to its healthcare advisory group, a sign that banks are selectively boosting life sciences coverage, for instance. Equity capital markets hiring has been slower than M&A, despite the recent surge in high-profile IPOs. Johnson said equity underwriting incentives are flat to down. Samadian said her team has seen only scattered hiring in ECM. "From the capital markets perspective, right now it's been a slower market for the equity side versus M&A, which is very much ebb and flow," she said. "Most people are going to get paid more this year. I think if you're really good," the year could hold promise, he said. One recruiter pointed to optimism coming from the buyside — private equity firms hungry to do a deal — that next year could be more robust: "There's a lot of positive momentum in buyside hiring" going into the fourth quarter, said buyside recruiter Anthony Keizner of Odyssey Search Partners. "Alternative investment firms have been buoyed by rate cuts, decent investment returns, and asset inflows," he said, adding that this is translating into robust 2026 hiring plans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the term researchers are using to call AI-generated content that might look like it completes a task at work: pretty on paper, well-organized and neatly formatted, but lacks substance upon a closer read — and it often becomes a headache for the person receiving the work. The term was coined in research published this month from the Stanford Social Media Lab and BetterUp, a professional training and coaching company. Surveying 1,150 desk workers in the US, the researchers found that 40% of respondents said they believed they had received this sort of AI-made sloppy work from their colleagues, which can take on many deceiving forms, like visually pleasing slide shows, long reports, or code that doesn't actually translate to a thoughtful product. On average, employees surveyed said they spent nearly two hours sorting through or cleaning up each instance of workslop. In short: Some meetings might be better off as emails, and some AI-generated emails might be better off left in the drafts. "We see that people are just sort of proliferating these documents, offloading the work onto another human, and then having this unintended consequence — there's a whole lack of trust as a result," says Kate Niederhoffer, head of research at BetterUp Labs. It's not that AI use at work can't be effective, she says, but "using it without high enough agency" leads to issues. If your coworker foists lengthy, useless docs generated by AI onto your desk, it can feel like they're not pulling their weight or not capable of doing the work themselves. The likes of Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, Bill Gates, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have estimated that with advancements in generative AI, white collar workers may soon only clock in three or four days a week. In Gen AI's current state, few of us are working less, and for some, it's creating more work or shifting how they spend their days rather than making them more productive. A recent MIT Media Lab report found that 95% of AI pilot programs have not seen measurable savings or boosts in profit. Instead of freedom, some desk workers find themselves slogging through with low-quality work; experienced software engineers are now debugging code, graphic designers are making generative-AI images look like something humans actually want to see, and writers are editing the words that large language models spit out for accuracy, and then rewriting it to cover up ChatGPT's telltale signs. A 2023 study from Cornell University found that Google-written smart replies could make conversations more efficient and led to more positive language, but those who received the messages held more negative opinions of the senders of algorithmic responses. No doubt there have always been workers who squeaked by while another clocked late hours and cleaned up messes, but gen AI has streamlined the process of phoning it in. On Upwork, a job platform for freelancers, graphic design, English, and fact-checking were among the top 10 most in-demand AI skills in August. These were among skills most at risk of automation thanks to large language models, but the high-demand shows how companies need expert freelancers in this skillsets, and aren't leaning on AI to replace them, according to Upwork's analysis. "Humans must remain in the loop from the start to ensure that AI work products are delivering the levels of quality, accuracy and usability that we expect and need them to," Teng Liu, an economist for Upwork's Research Institute, tells me in a statement. "Otherwise, the need for 'AI clean-up' jobs does frequently occur." A deeper look shows that AI might not be making developers more efficient yet, and is more often shuffling around how they spend their time, moving the bulk of their focus from writing code to reviewing it. In 2024, Uplevel, a software development company, studied 800 software developers and compared the productivity of those with GitHub's Copilot access to those without. They found that the developers who used Copilot did not become more efficient or less burnt out, but did have bugs in code 41% more frequently than those without access to the tool (GitHub published its own smaller study a month later, showing that developers who used Copilot wrote about 18 lines of code without error, compared to 16 lines for those without). "For a lot of engineers, the only thing that looks different is where they spend their time, not exactly how much time it took." Caitlin Ner, director of operations at PsyMed Ventures, a VC firm that focuses on mental and brain health startups, says her firm has received more messages from founders and pitches that seem AI-generated; either they're spammy and don't fit in with the firm's niche, or they're so like other pitches that it's hard to decipher how well the founder can communicate if the product stands out. It's a standard part of the gig, but these emails needed a lot of extra love: They lacked her company's formatting, style, and tone, she tells me. That's because Shawna's colleague didn't actually write the drafts, but prompted a chatbot and then copied and pasted its output without much thought. "I had to drop everything and scramble at the end of the day to fix this series of emails," says Shawna, who asked I not use her full name because she's not authorized by her company to speak about this. But she says her coworkers don't always put as much editing into the output. I had to do the critical thinking on their behalf." There are already too many notifications, systems, processes, and standing meetings that eat up worker's time. AI "tools are being used because people feel like there's just too much," says Jeff Hancock, director of the Stanford Social Media Lab. Some AI tools have helped people organize and filter their notifications, cutting down on the unnecessary pings they receive each day. But when used without thought, AI can ironically add to the flood of too much information. "I think that is so often ignored when talking about AI." Using AI in responses might seem like a fix to take something off your plate, but an overreliance on it can derail conversation. Writing, coding, or designing is about communicating ideas to others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ford CEO Jim Farley says there's barely any contest between Chinese and American automakers when it comes to dominating in EVs. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China," he added. Farley told guest host and journalist Joanna Stern that China's dominance in the industry stemmed from the generous government support its automakers enjoyed. It has great innovation at a very low cost," Farley said. "There's hundreds of companies, and they're all sponsored by their local governments, so they have huge subsidies. Farley has talked about China's lead in the EV race on multiple occasions. In June, Farley said during a panel at the Aspen Ideas Festival that China's EV progress is the "most humbling thing" he has ever seen. Huawei and Xiaomi are in every car," Farley said. Automatically, your whole digital life is mirrored in the car." "We are in a global competition with China, and it's not just EVs. Farley praised Chinese tech giant Xiaomi's maiden electric vehicle, the SU7, in an episode of "The Fully Charged Podcast," which aired in October 2024. "I don't like talking about the competition so much, but I drive the Xiaomi," Farley said. "We flew one from Shanghai to Chicago, and I've been driving it for six months now, and I don't want to give it up," he added. Farley isn't the only one who sees China's dominance in EVs as a byproduct of the country's lower labor costs and generous subsidies. The Centre for Strategic & International Studies said in a report published last year that China's government has spent at least $230 billion funding local EV makers between 2009 and 2023. "There's not something magical when you take it apart that's allowing these really impressive cost structures," RJ Scaringe, the CEO of American EV maker Rivian, told the "Everything Electric" podcast in an episode that aired in September. "There's no secret magic thing that you're like, 'Oh, aha, they did this.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Eric Fung, 37, the CEO of Colega AI in Tokyo. California wasn't what it used to be: the cost of living was insane, and the Bay Area magic had dimmed. Japan is home to more than 3 million small businesses, including restaurants, bars, cafés, and retailers. Unlike the US, where big chains dominate, Japan still runs on a lot of mom-and-pop shops. That made it the perfect market to test my idea. In 2024, I came for three months, the maximum my US passport allows. My dad emigrated from Hong Kong and worked just about every job you can imagine — waiter, limo driver, FedEx worker. I studied advertising and public relations at Penn State. Within a year, I knew corporate life wasn't for me. I jumped to a tiny startup, pitching products no one had heard of and leading a team older than me. I learned more in those three years than in classrooms, and it convinced me I wanted to build companies. New York didn't seem like the right place to start, so at 24, I packed one suitcase and drove to San Francisco. My first ideas — from a job search site for visa sponsors to a travel camera app — didn't take off, and stints in Big Tech only confirmed how slow and soul-crushing corporate life felt. The Bay Area was brutally competitive, which I discovered firsthand at a fast-moving database startup. Working there sharpened my edge and taught me how to fight for market share. In 2019, I co-founded my first company with two former colleagues. After early success, we exited, in part due to the pandemic. It taught me how unpredictable startup life could be. I set each up, ran it, then hired managers to take over. Since then, I've sold one off and have managers running the other two. Our startup is US-registered, but the team's based in Tokyo. Moving to Tokyo has been both exciting and challenging. To navigate the cultural and language barriers, I partnered with a local who helps bridge relationships on the ground. Early on, I worried that no one would take me seriously — a foreigner pitching products in a market known for tradition and formality. The work culture in Tokyo is a world apart from San Francisco. I have Japanese friends who keep pillows under their desks because sleeping at the office isn't unusual. Long hours and seniority hierarchies are baked into the system. As an American founder, I've had to balance respecting that culture with building a more flexible, startup-style environment. My wife Shana, whom I met in San Francisco in 2018, runs her own jewelry and gemstone business and has adapted well — she loves how safe the city feels. But making close friends takes time, and the language barrier adds hurdles. I pay about $1,350 for 500 square feet in a very convenient part of the city. A similar place in San Francisco would easily be $3,000. While space is still tight by US standards, the trade-off is incredible access: late-night ramen, world-class dining, and trains to anywhere in minutes. If my business keeps me in Tokyo for five years, great. If it leads me elsewhere in Asia or back to the US, I'll figure that out when the time comes.</p>
